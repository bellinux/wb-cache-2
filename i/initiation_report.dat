Method: Data {{were obtained from the}} Youth Violence Survey conducted in 2004 and administered to all public school students enrolled in grades 7, 9, and 11 / 12 (N = 4131) in a high-risk school district in the United States. Our analyses were limited to seventh-grade students who either began drinking before the age of 13 or were nondrinkers, with complete information on all covariates (n = 856). Cross-sectional logistic and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between early alcohol use and each of the 6 outcome behaviors (dating violence victimization and perpetration, peer violence victimization and perpetration, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts) while controlling for demographic characteristics and other potential confounders (ie, heavy episodic drinking, substance use, peer drinking, depression, impulsivity, peer delinquency, and parental monitoring). Results: In our study, 35 % of students <b>reported</b> alcohol use <b>initiation</b> before 13 years of age (preteen alcohol use initiators). Students who reported preteen alcohol use <b>initiation</b> <b>reported</b> involvement in significantly more types of violent behaviors (mean: 2. 8 behaviors), compared with nondrinkers (mean: 1. 8 behaviors). Preteen alcohol use initiation was associated significantly with suicide attempts, relative to nondrinkers, controlling for demographic characteristics and all other potential confounders. Conclusions: Early alcohol use is an important risk factor for involvement in violent behaviors and suicide attempts among youths.

40|$|Ribosome {{profiling}} (ribo-seq) is {{a recently}} developed technique that provides genomewide information on protein synthesis (GWIPS) in vivo. The high resolution of ribo-seq {{is one of}} the exciting properties of this technique. In Chapter 2, I present a computational method that utilises the sub-codon precision and triplet periodicity of ribosome profiling data to detect transitions in the translated reading frame. Application of this method to ribosome profiling data generated for human HeLa cells allowed us to detect several human genes where the same genomic segment is translated in more than one reading frame. Since the initial publication of the ribosome profiling technique in 2009, there has been a proliferation of studies that have used the technique to explore various questions with respect to translation. A review of the many uses and adaptations of the technique is provided in Chapter 1. Indeed, owing to the increasing popularity of the technique and the growing number of published ribosome profiling datasets, we have developed GWIPS-viz ([URL] a ribo-seq dedicated genome browser. Details {{on the development of the}} browser and its usage are provided in Chapter 3. One of the surprising findings of ribosome profiling of initiating ribosomes carried out in 3 independent studies, was the widespread use of non-AUG codons as translation initiation start sites in mammals. Although initiation at non-AUG codons in mammals has been documented for some time, the extent of non-AUG <b>initiation</b> <b>reported</b> by these ribo-seq studies was unexpected. In Chapter 4, I present an approach for estimating the strength of initiating codons based on the leaky scanning model of translation initiation.

In addition, our approach provides a probability of initiation score for each start site that allows its strength of initiation to be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early life {{stress is}} known to be {{associated}} with increased propensity to substance abuse. The present study seeks to confirm the association between early life stress and tobacco smoking initiation by adolescents. METHODS: This study is based on the data of the Family and Children of Ukraine Study (FCOU), which {{is a part of the}} cohort study in Europe for pregnancy and childhood “ELSPAC”. Main exposures were stressful life event scores at 3 and 7 years that were calculated by summing the perceived impact score reported by mothers for each life event. Smoking status of the adolescent and age of smoking <b>initiation,</b> <b>reported</b> at the 16 -years-old follow-up, were outcome measures. Data were analyzed using multivariate binary logistic regression models separately for boys and girls controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and mother’s smoking. RESULTS: Stressful life events score was available for 898 participants at age 3 years and for 840 participants at age 7 years and varied from 0 to 48 points, with mean equal 4. 69 and 5. 96 respectively. In the gender-stratified analysis current smoking by boys or girls was not associated with early life stress measured at 3 years old. Association between smoking and early life stress at age 7 years was not observed for boys. However, girls who experienced much stress at 7 years (more than 12 points) had 3 times higher odds of smoking (OR= 2. 94, 95 % CI= 1. 26 - 6. 83). Girls who had scored more than 12 points for stressful life events at 3 or 7 years old were respectively three times (OR= 3. 34, 95 % CI= 1. 50 - 7. 42) or 2 times (OR= 2. 19, 95 % CI= 1. 01 - 4. 74) more likely to start smoking at 13 years old or younger. CONCLUSIONS: Early life stress may have effect on vulnerability to tobacco smoking by adolescents. However, this effect was significant only for girls at high incidence of stressful life events...|$|R

40|$|The mRNA cap {{recruits}} factors {{essential for}} transcript processing and translation <b>initiation.</b> We <b>report</b> that regulated mRNA cap methylation is {{a feature of}} embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Expression of the mRNA cap methyltransferase activating subunit RAM is elevated in ESCs, resulting in high levels of mRNA cap methylation and expression of a cohort of pluripotency-associated genes. During neural differentiation, RAM is suppressed, resulting in repression of pluripotency-associated factors and expression of a cohort of neural-associated genes. An established requirement of differentiation is increased ERK 1 / 2 activity, which suppresses pluripotency-associated genes. During differentiation, ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylates RAM serine- 36, targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, ultimately resulting in changes in gene expression associated with loss of pluripotency. Elevated RAM expression also increases the efficiency of fibroblast reprogramming. Thus, the mRNA cap emerges as a dynamic mark that instructs change in gene expression profiles during differentiation and reprogramming...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Aim: To {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} smoking restrictions in homes and schools, and tobacco advertising and information on smoking initiation by young people in Ukraine. Methods Data of 609 young people aged 15 – 29 {{was taken from the}} national representative survey conducted in June 2005. Outcome measures: The reported age of cigarette initiation was used to characterize the start of smoking experimentation, and the reported age of daily smoking initiation was considered to be a characteristic of established smoking. Analysis: survival analysis Cox proportional hazard regression models were used. Results Age of smoking <b>initiation</b> was <b>reported</b> by 87 % of young men and 61 % of young women, the beginning of daily smoking by 71 % and 33 % respectively. Being frequently exposed to second-hand smoke and having no household smoking restrictions was associated with a higher risk of earlier smoking initiation both for men and women. For women, this risk was associated with age, HR = 0. 95, (95 % CI 0. 91 – 0. 98), that is, younger girls were more likely to smoke their first cigarette earlier in their lifetime. Those women had a higher risk of early smoking <b>initiation</b> who <b>reported</b> to receive tobacco-related information from magazines, HR = 1. 40 (1. 01 – 1. 92), and outdoor tobacco advertising, HR = 1. 99 (1. 45 – 2. 75). With both men and women, the risk of establishing daily smoking was higher in those with lower levels of tobacco-related knowledge and less household smoking restrictions. For women, the risk was higher in those who live in larger cities HR = 1. 77 (1. 10 – 2. 86), and who received information about tobacco smoking from colleagues or friends HR = 1. 83 (1. 13 – 2. 95). Conclusion Encouraging people to eliminate their homes of tobacco smoke and tobacco advertising bans can be effective measures in preventing the initiation of smoking among young people. Young female smoking initiation is of special concern in Ukraine, since they are more responsive to tobacco marketing and pro-smoking peer influence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Meiotic {{recombination}} is {{initiated by}} programmed double strand breaks (DSBs), {{only a small}} subset of which are resolved into crossovers (COs).

Self-initiated intermission is an <b>initiation</b> to <b>report</b> oneself as being available for interaction. It gives the privilege of choosing appropriate time to handle interruptions, so that it would not hamper the current active tasks. Along with self-initiated intermission, interruptibility levels at the time of application switching and at regular intervals are studied.

The study shows that self-initiated intermission is the best moment for interrupting user which is less annoying than at the time of application switching and at regular intervals.

40|$|The poly(A) tail {{plays an}} {{important}} role in translation <b>initiation.</b> We <b>report</b> the identification of a mechanism that operates in mammalian somatic cells, and couples mRNA poly(A) tail length with its translation state. The regulation of human ferritin L-chain mRNA by iron-responsive elements (IREs) and iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) is subject to this mechanism: translational repression imposed by IRP binding to the IRE of ferritin L-chain mRNA induces poly(A) tail shortening. For the accumulation of mRNAs with short poly(A) tails, IRP binding to an IRE per se is not sufficient, but must cause translational repression. Interestingly, puromycin and verrucarin (general translation inhibitors that dissociate mRNAs from ribosomes) mimick the negative effect of the specific translational repressor proteins on poly(A) tail length, whereas cycloheximide and anisomycin (general translation inhibitors that maintain the association between mRNAs and ribosomes) preserve long poly(A) tails. Thus, the ribosome association of the mRNA appears to represent the critical determinant. These findings identify a novel mechanism of regulated polyadenylation as a consequence of translational control. They reveal differences in poly(A) tail metabolism between polysomal and mRNP-associated mRNAs. A possible role of this mechanism in the maintenance of translational repression is discussed...|$|R

The syntheses of the novel [{N,N'- 1, 3 -bis(P,P'-di-isopropyloxo/thiophosphinic) - 2, 2 -dimethylpropylenediamido}(amido) yttrium] complexes were achieved in excellent yields by reaction of the N,N'- 1, 3 -bis(P,P'-di-isopropyloxo/thiophosphinic) - 2, 2 -dimethylpropylenediamine ligands with [Y(NR(2)) (3) center dot xTHF] (R = SiMe(3), SiMe(2) H, i-Pr, x = 0, 2). The new complexes were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopies, elemental analyses, and for R = SiMe(2) H X-ray crystallography. The solution and solid-state structures were compared using 21) NMR techniques and in particular using pulsed gradient spin echo spectroscopy (PGSE) to derive the solution hydrodynamic radius and compare it to that calculated from the X-ray crystal structure: the [{N,N'-bis(P,P'-di-isopropyloxophosphinic) - 2, 2 -dimethylpropylenediamido}(amido) yttrium] complexes were all dimeric in both the solid state and solution. They showed unusual structures where each ligand has one oxophosphinic group bonded to a single yttrium center and one oxophosphinic group bonded to two yttrium centers. The new complexes were tested as lactide polymerization initiators; they all showed very high activities. The degree of polymerization control exerted by the novel initiators was related {{to the size of the}} initiating amide group and the structure of the complex...|$|R

This study seeks to examine the relationships between communication and psychological factors and breastfeeding behaviors. The factors considered include mediated communication (infant feeding exposure in various media and celebrity endorsements); social support from family, peers, partners, medical providers, and workplace; and attitudes and emotions. The outcome variable, breastfeeding behaviors, includes breastfeeding duration, six months of exclusive breastfeeding, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding less than six months. Women (N = 499) residing in the U. S. (M age = 31, age range: 18 - 46 years) who {{had at least one}} child between the ages of 8 weeks and 3 years completed an online survey. Ninety-seven percent of women surveyed <b>reported</b> <b>initiation</b> of breastfeeding their children. Among the women who breastfed, only 45...|$|R

Creating a "complete" methodology is proposed {{which can be}} applied to managing projects with any complexity, various degrees of responsibility for results and different predictability of the requirements. For the formation of a "complete" methodology, it is proposed to take the PMBOK standard as the basis, which would be supplemented by processes of the most demanding plan driven and flexible Agile Methodologies. For each knowledge area of the PMBOK standard, The following groups of processes should be provided: <b>initiation,</b> planning, execution, <b>reporting,</b> and forecasting, controlling, analysis, decision making and closing. The method for generating a methodology for the specific project is presented.
