5|$|A {{copyright}} claim {{registered with}} the United States Copyright Office by Gottlieb on February 10, 1983 cites the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> of Q*bert as October 18, 1982. Video Games reported that the game was sold directly to arcade operators at its public showing at the AMOA show held November 18–20, 1982. Gottlieb offered the machines for $2600 per unit. Q*bert is Gottlieb's fourth video game.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy {{had been set}} as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written Boletus edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> of Linnaeus' work, the Species Plantarum. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include Boletus solidus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.|$|E

5|$|The brown roll-rim was {{described}} by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1785 as Agaricus contiguus, although the 1786 combination Agaricus involutus of August Batsch is taken as the first valid description. James Bolton published a description {{of what he called}} Agaricus adscendibus in 1788; the taxonomical authority Index Fungorum considers this to be synonymous with P.involutus. Additional synonyms include Omphalia involuta described by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, and Rhymovis involuta, published by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844. The species gained its current binomial name in 1838 when the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries erected the genus Paxillus, and set it as the type species. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January1, 1821, to coincide with the date of Fries' works, which meant that names coined earlier than this date required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. It was thus written Paxillus involutus (Batsch:Fr.) Fr. However, a 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> of Linnaeus' seminal work, the Species Plantarum. Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} dated English {{reference to}} garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook — shepherd's knitting — is in, The Memoirs of a Highland Lady, by Elizabeth Grant (1797–1830).

Nonetheless, the 1833 volume of Penélopé describes and illustrates a shepherd's hook, and recommends its use for crochet with coarser yarn.|$|E
25|$|Evidence in debates is {{organized}} into units called cards (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice {{has long been}} out of favor). Cards are designed to condense an author's argument so that debaters have {{an easy way to}} access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the tag, the cite, and the body. The tag is the debater's summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually only one or two sentences. The cite contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication,</b> journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The body is a fragment of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly—cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the cite and the body.|$|E

25|$|Consecutively {{in order}} of appearance: The sheets are {{numbered}} consecutively as each is published. Thus, {{it is not possible}} to determine the sheets neighbouring a particular sheet without a current sheet index. Nor is it always possible to indicate on a sheet's map surround the numbers of adjacent sheets, as the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> of forthcoming sheets (and therefore thei place in the numbering system) may not yet be known. This system is therefore suitable only for small maps, or those in an irregular sheet division (as in tourist maps published by the private sector), and is seldom now used for modern official map series. Example: Geological Atlas of Switzerland (1:25,000).|$|E
25|$|Xerocomus subtomentosus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1753 {{by the father}} of taxonomy Carl Linnaeus as Boletus subtomentosus. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant that the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Linnaeus' work preceded this date.

However, a 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> of Linnaeus' seminal work, the Species Plantarum.

25|$|Hall's history, {{entitled}} A History of the Town and Parish of Nantwich, or Wich-Malbank, in the County Palatine of Chester {{but usually}} {{referred to as}} Hall's History of Nantwich, was completed in December 1883. The first edition of 350 copies was financed by subscription; it was privately printed by local printer Thomas Johnson, bound by Macmillan and Co. in Manchester and distributed early in 1884. Nearly four times the length of Platt's work, it covers the period from the Domesday survey of 1086 to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication,</b> and additionally includes the nearby townships of Alvaston (now part of Worleston), Willaston and Woolstanwood.

25|$|It was the Adventure Comics run which {{established}} the Legion's general workings and environment. A club of teenagers, they operated {{out of a}} clubhouse {{in the shape of}} an inverted yellow rocket ship which {{looked as if it had}} been driven into the ground. The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the United Planets. The regular police force in the United Planets was the Science Police. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth in}} time (but not in <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>publication)</b> is the Informaciones Jurídicas de 1666 already mentioned. As its name indicates, it is a {{collection}} of sworn testimonies. These were taken down in order to support an application to Rome for liturgical recognition of the Guadalupe event. The collection includes reminiscences in the form of sworn statements by informants (many of them of advanced age, including eight Indians from Cuauhtitlán) who claimed to be transmitting accounts of the life and experiences of Juan Diego which they had received from parents, grandparents or others who had known or met him. The substance of the testimonies was reported by Florencia in chapter 13 of his work Estrella de el Norte de México (see next entry). Until very recently the only source for the text was a copy dating from 1737 of the translation made into Spanish which itself was first published in 1889. An original copy of the translation (dated April 14, 1666) was discovered by Eduardo Chávez Sánchex in July 2001 as part of his researches in the archives of the Basilica de Guadalupe.|$|E
