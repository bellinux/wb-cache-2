Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars.

40|$|Holomorphic {{quantization}} of 2 + 1 dimensional pure Yang-Mills {{theory is}} studied with focusing on finite large scales. Previously {{we have shown}} that (Yildirim, 2015, Int. J. Mod. Phys A, 30 (7), 1550034) topologically massive Yang-Mills theory exhibits a Chern-Simons splitting behavior at large scales, similar to the topologically massive AdS gravity model in its near Chern-Simons limit. This splitting occurs as a sum of two Chern-Simons terms with levels k/ 2 each. In the pure Chern-Simons limit, the split parts add up to give the original Chern-Simons term in the action. The opposite limit of the gravitational analogue is an Einstein-Hilbert term with a negative cosmological constant, which can be written as subtracted two half Chern-Simons terms. With this motivation, the gauge theory version of this limit is investigated, showing that at large distances, pure Yang-Mills theory acts like a topological theory that consists of split Chern-Simons parts with levels k/ 2 and -k/ 2. At very large distances these split terms cancel, making the Yang-Mills theory trivial as expected due to existence of a mass <b>gap.</b> <b>Gauge</b> invariance of the split parts is discussed. It is also shown that, this splitting behavior can be exploited to incorporate link invariants of knot theory, {{just like in the}} topologically massive case.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{properties}} of rocks {{are important in}} a variety of rock mechanics and rock engineering problems. Due to the transient nature of the loading, dynamic tests of rock materials are very different from and much more challenging than their static counterparts. Dynamic tests are usually conducted using the split Hopkinson bar or Kolsky bar systems, which include both split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) and split Hopkinson tension bar (SHTB) systems. Significant progress has been made on the quantification of various rock dynamic properties, owing to the advances in the experimental techniques of SHPB system. This review aims to fully describe and critically assess the detailed procedures and principles of techniques for dynamic rock tests using split Hopkinson bars. The history and principles of SHPB are outlined, followed by the key loading techniques that are useful for dynamic rock tests with SHPB (i. e. pulse shaping, momentum-trap and multi-axial loading techniques). Various measurement techniques for rock tests in SHPB (i. e. X-ray micro computed tomography (CT), laser <b>gap</b> <b>gauge</b> (LGG), digital image correlation (DIC), Moiré method, caustics method, photoelastic coating method, dynamic infrared thermography) are then discussed.

When these field configurations are produced by the interplay of higher dimensional warped gravity with some matter content, braneworld models must prove to be stable under the whole set of small fluctuations of the gravitational and matter fields background, among other consistency tests. Here we present a complete proof of the stability under scalar perturbations of tachyonic thick braneworlds with an embedded maximally symmetric 4 D space-time, revealing its physical consistency. This family of models contains a recently reported tachyonic de Sitter thick braneworld which possesses a series of appealing properties. These features encompass complete regularity, asymptotic flatness (instead of being asymptotically dS or AdS) even when it contains a negative bulk cosmological constant, a relevant 3 -brane with dS metric which naturally arises from the full set of field equations of the 5 D background (it is not imposed), qualitatively describing the inflationary epochs of our Universe, and a graviton spectrum with a single zero mode bound state that accounts for the 4 D graviton localised on the brane and is separated from the continuum of Kaluza-Klein massive graviton excitations by a mass <b>gap.</b> <b>Gauge</b> vector fields with a single massless bound state in its mass spectrum are also localised on this braneworld model a fact that allows us to recover the Coulomb's law of our 4 D world.

In this research we have been working with ultra-high NA evanescent wave lithography (EWL) where the NA of the projection system is allowed to exceed the corresponding acceptance angle of one or more materials of the system. This approach is made possible by frustrating the total internal reflection (TIR) evanescent field into propagation. With photoresist as the frustrating media, the allowable gap for adequate exposure latitude is in the sub- 100 nm range. Through static imaging, we have demonstrated the ability to resolve 26 nm half-pitch features at 193 nm and 1. 85 NA using existing materials. Such imaging could lead to the attainment of 13 nm half-pitch through double patterning. In addition, a scanning EWL imaging system was designed, prototyped with a two-stage gap control imaging head including a DC noise canceling carrying air-bearing, and a AC noise canceling piezoelectric transducer with real-time closed-loop feedback from gap detection.

We use {{the presence or absence}} of mass <b>gap</b> for <b>gauge</b> fluctuations as an identifier of the infrared behavior. Present-day understanding does not allow the mass <b>gap</b> for <b>gauge</b> fluctuations to be computed on R* 4. However, recent progress allows its non-perturbative computation on R* 3 xS* 1 by using either the twisted partition function or deformation theory, for a range of S* 1 sizes depending on the theory. For small number of fermions, Nf, we show that the mass gap increases with increasing radius, due to the non-dilution of monopoles and bions, the topological excitations relevant for confinement on R* 3 xS* 1. For sufficiently large Nf, we show that the mass gap decreases with increasing radius. In a class of theories, we claim that the decompactification limit can be taken while remaining within the region of validity of semi-classical techniques, giving the first examples of semiclassically solvable Yang-Mills theories at any size S* 1. For general non-supersymmetric vectorlike or chiral theories, we conjecture that the change in the behavior of the mass gap on R* 3 xS* 1 as a function of the radius occurs near the lower boundary of the conformal window and give non-perturbative estimates of its value. For vectorlike theories, we compare our estimates of the conformal window with existing lattice results, truncations of the Schwinger-Dyson equations, NSVZ beta function-inspired estimates, and degree of freedom counting criteria. For multi-generation chiral gauge theories, to the best of our knowledge, our estimates of the conformal window are the only known ones.

At one time it was common practice to use lead loading to achieve tight panel gaps, especially in the coachbuilding business, but also on the production line. Lead loading is highly skilled, and requires safety precautions because ingested lead or fumes are toxic. The panels have to 'look right' together. This is a process of repeated adjustment, because the adjustment of one panel often affects the apparent fit of another. If there are multiple styling lines {{on the side of a}} car, it is generally best to align doors on the most prominent one. When the panels on the car are satisfactory, they should be primed and painted a correct historical color for the vehicle if the restoration is striving for historical accuracy. An owner might want to have the car painted to look like a particular specialty vehicle such as a police car, or a delivery van painted to look like it would have in grandfather's company colors, etc. Individual painting of the panels is generally the correct approach, as this will result in all parts of the panel being painted as opposed to partially re-assembling and then painting, leaving parts of the assembly that are touching or [...] "blind" [...] unpainted.

When chemical potential of the gauge systems is introduced, we find that topological terms (such as Chern-Simons term in 2 + 1 D) as constraints inevitably emerge at low energy. The fermion sign problem at finite chemical potential and its deep connection to the Chern-Simons theories are discussed. The Wilson's criteria of confinement in pure gauge theories is generalized to finite chemical potential case. The chemical potential dependence of physical quantities at strong coupling are explicitly calculated, including the expectation value of the Wilson loop, the confining potential and the confined/deconfined transition temperature. The bosonization puts discussions on chiral symmetry breaking and confined/deconfined transition on an equal footing, so it is suitable {{for the study of}} the subtle interplay between them.

The low energy modes of the strongly coupled gauge systems in a non-symmetry breaking phase is also discussed.

The results show that on average a few flow measurements can significantly improve the simulation efficiency, and that 10 measurements can reduce the performance <b>gap</b> between the <b>gauged</b> and ungauged situations by more than 50 %. The added value of regional information progressively decreases until being almost insignificant when sufficient flow measurements are available. Model parameters tend to come closer to the values obtained by calibration in fully gauged conditions as the number of point flow measurements increases...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn recent years, non-defense related industries and high-reliability organizations alike have emphasized positive teamwork traits {{as a part}} of their criteria for hiring high-quality applicants to maximize workplace efficiency. As a result of targeting these high-quality applicants and creating more efficient leadership training programs, these organizations have surpassed their competitors in their respective industries. Although the U. S. Navy is already considered to be a high-reliability organization, which is known for exceptionally high safety standards and performance, small inefficiencies in the areas of teamwork and leadership exist in the workplace. This thesis conducts a <b>gap</b> analysis to <b>gauge</b> the applicability of the Navy's current accessions testing measures to its future recruiting needs. We found that the Navy is inadequately assessing applicant skills and attributes through its primary use of cognitive testing. Personality traits or non-cognitive traits testing may be used to help the Navy identify the appropriate recruits to compose high-performance teams, particularly in the enlisted ranks. Additionally, personality traits testing may be used for Navy officer accessions to help improve the quality of leaders. Lieutenant Junior Grade, United States Nav...|$|R
30|$|Rainfall {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{discontinuous}} atmospheric parameters due to its temporal and spatial variability. Indian economy is highly dependent on agriculture. Accurate rainfall estimates are essential for agricultural purposes. Chief source of rainfall over Indian region is Monsoon. India Meteorological Department (IMD) use rain gauge based gridded rainfall product developed by Rajeevan et al. (2005), to monitor rainfall over India. Rain gauges are conventional tools to quantify area averaged precipitation over land surface. Dense network of uniformly distributed rain gauge stations are used to estimate rainfall for a particular area (Mishra et al. 2011). The problem of installing optimum rain gauge network has been the subject of research over the years. Insufficient gauge density leads to error in representing the areal rainfall of a region. It is also found that rainfall is also affected by the distance of rain gauge stations from the grid point (Bhowmik and Das, 2007). The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of rain gauge density over the accuracy of the areal daily accumulated rainfall over a region in Bangalore. Use of gauge calibrated satellite observations to fill the <b>gap</b> over poor <b>gauge</b> density region is studied in the present paper. Variation in the rainfall observations as function of inter-gauge distances is also studied in this paper.|$|R
