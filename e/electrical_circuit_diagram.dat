50|$|It was however Beck who had {{the idea}} of {{creating}} a full system map in colour. He believed that Underground passengers were not concerned with geographical accuracy and were more interested in how to get from one station to another and where to change trains. While drawing an <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram,</b> Beck came up with a new idea for a map that was based upon the concept of an electrical schematic rather than a geographic map on which all the stations were more-or-less equally spaced. Beck first submitted his idea to Frank Pick of London Underground in 1931 but it was considered too radical because it didn't show distances relative from any one station to the others. The design was therefore rejected by the Publicity department at first, but the designer persisted. So, after a successful trial of 500 copies in 1932, distributed via a select few stations, the map was given its first full publication in 1933 (700,000 copies). The positive reaction from customers proved it was a sound design, and a large reprint was required after only one month.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the table}} below, the three archetypes are reviewed. In the first row, the qubit <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> is presented. In the second, the quantum Hamiltonian {{derived from the}} circuit is shown. Generally, the Hamiltonian can be divided to a [...] "kinetic" [...] and [...] "potential" [...] parts, in analogy to a {{particle}} in a potential well. The particle mass corresponds to some inverse function of the circuit capacitance, while {{the shape of the}} potential is governed by the regular inductors and Josephson junctions. One of the first challenges in qubit design is to shape the potential well and to choose the particle mass {{in a way that the}} energy separation between specific two of the energy levels will differ from all other inter-level energy separations in the system. These two levels will be used as the logical states of the qubit. The schematic wave solutions in the third row of the table depict the complex amplitude of the phase variable. In other words, if a phase of the qubit is measured while the qubit is in a specific state, there is a non-zero probability to measure a specific value only where the depicted wave function oscillates. All three rows are essentially three different presentations of the same physical system.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of a supplementary visual analysis instructional unit on <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> simplification. More specifically, the study examined how this unit would affect students 2 ̆ 7 ability to recognize relationships of electrical components in a visually complex circuit diagram and how the instructional unit would affect students 2 ̆ 7 ability to describe circuit behaviors. The population for this quasi-experimental study was all students enrolled in two sections of the Introduction to Electrical Circuits (EET 214) course at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. The course EET 214 was selected for three reasons: (a) the course was designed to teach electrical circuit theory for beginners, (b) it had two sections, (c) both sections were taught by one instructor, and (d) the student body of the course consisted of majors from Industrial Technology, Mechanical Engineering Technology, and Computer Integrated Manufacturing Technology. One section of the course was selected as the experimental group and the other as the control group. A pretest was administered to both sections during the first week of the course. Following the pretest, the supplementary instructional unit was given to the experimental group. At the end of the fifth week of the course, both groups took a posttest. The test consisted of qualitative questions in order to examine the students 2 ̆ 7 conceptual understanding of electrical circuits. The study found that: (1) the students who received the supplementary instruction were able to identify the relationships among components of a visual complex electrical circuit more effectively, (2) the students were able to recognize the relationships more effectively when the diagrams are drawn linearly as opposed to drawn rectangularly, and (3) the students 2 ̆ 7 ability to describe the circuit behavior was not influenced by the visual analysis instruction. ...|$|E
40|$|Phonological notations need major overhaul. I {{would like}} to suggest how this can be succesfully done. My {{argument}} has four parts. First, I {{would like to}} make a simple distinction — well known in semiotics — between what I will call notations as symbols and notations as models. Notations which merely symbolize the thing they stand for are in all respects arbitrary in their form except insofar as they must be differentiated from other symbols used in the same context. Notations which model the thing they stand for are, in at least one respect, nonarbitrary in their form, that is. in some way they are or purport to be isomorphic with the thing they represent. A few simple examples of these two types of notations are given in Figure 1. In the case of the notation under the heading ‘symbols’, there is no recognizable part of the symbols that is isomorphic with any part of the entities they stand for. Only in Playboy cartoons and for humorous purposes is any ' isomorphism suggested to exist between the scientific symbols for 'male ' and 'female ' and actual males and females. Likewise the graphic symbol ' 7 ' does not have seven distinct parts, although the tally mark for ' 7 ', on the other side, does. Words, of course, are well known as arbitrary symbols for the things or concepts they stand for. Thus, we do not find it inappropriate that the word 'big ' is so small nor that the word 'microscopic ' is relatively large. Most mathematical notations are symbols in this sense. However, as for the notations under the heading 'models', there are obvious respects in which they are isomorphic with the entities they represent. Architects ' floor plans are isomorphic with the geometry and proportions of the building they represent. The <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> is isomorphic with the topological arrangement and connectedness of the various components. And so on...|$|E
50|$|A perfect {{conductor}} or perfect electric conductor (PEC) is an idealized material exhibiting infinite electrical conductivity or, equivalently, zero resistivity (cf. perfect dielectric).

Another example is <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams,</b> which carry the implicit assumption that the wires connecting the components have no resistance. Yet another example is in computational electromagnetics, where PEC can be simulated faster, since the parts of equations that take finite conductivity into account can be neglected.|$|R
40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} for automatic understanding of engineering flow drawings. Previous engineering drawing understanding systems considered only specific domains of drawings. Different systems have to be developed for drawings in different domains {{even if they are}} similar in nature. We have developed a system for understanding drawings of similar nature that can be classified as flow drawings. It covers a broad range of domains. ^ Flow drawing is a class of drawings characterized by alternate instances of symbols and connection lines. It includes flowcharts and diagrams describing chemical plants, logic circuits, structured chemical formulas, etc. ^ The flow drawing understanding system (FDUS) consists of subsystems that (1) preprocess the thinned and vectorized images of the scanned drawings, (2) segment symbols from the connection lines, and (3) classify symbols and traverse the drawings to correct errors. It contains a symbol library that stores information specific to the domain. ^ FDUS segments symbols using a few simple yet effective generic drawing properties such as (a) symbols contain mostly closed simple shapes, slant lines and open lines, and (b) connection lines are mostly horizontal or vertical. A very high fraction of the symbols are completely segmented, with most others partially segmented using these simple rules. ^ FDUS classifies symbols with a set of simple matchers and evaluates the goodness measure of each classification. Classified symbols are categorized as recognized and unrecognized. The system estimates from the recognized symbols a priority of processing for the unrecognized symbols and corrects errors automatically. A small number of residual errors are corrected interactively. The modular design allows more sophisticated matchers to be integrated easily. The performance is reported {{in terms of the number}} of errors interactively corrected. ^ FDUS has been tested with logic <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams,</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams,</b> chemical plant flow diagrams, and flowcharts. The system correctly recognized 74. 2 % and 88. 5 % of the symbols in <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> and chemical plant flow diagrams, respectively.

However, humans use many {{other kinds of}} symbolic notations for communication, in particular, two-dimensional graphical notations such as mathematical notation, choreography notation, organizational charts and <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams.</b> We can term such multi-dimensional symbolic notations, visual languages.

The standard approach to computer interpretation of visual languages is to utilize parsing technologies based on multi-dimensional grammars. In this paper we investigate {{a new approach to}} parsing visual languages based on linear logic. The advantages of this logic-based approach are threefold: It provides a more adequate level for modelling the semantics of visual languages; it allows us to implement them based on automated deduction and it provides a good basis for the investigation of their formal properties. We show how attributed multiset grammars, {{one of the most widely}} used methods for multi-dimensional parsing, can be embedded into linear logic, demonstrate how parsing corresponds to linear proofs and prove the soundness and correctness of this embedding. Importantly, our embedding is into a subset of a linear logic programming language.
