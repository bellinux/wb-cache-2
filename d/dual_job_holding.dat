We observe no evidence that husbands increase MJH in response to their wives moving from employment to unemployment (once earnings change is controlled for in column 6, the EU coefficient in column 6 turns negative). That said, we do observe evidence for an income effect in column 6, where husbands’ MJH behavior is inversely related to wives’ changes in weekly earnings. An interesting pattern seen in husbands’ behavior is that they appear to coordinate leisure and/or home production time with their wives.

30|$|Given {{the varied}} reasons for which {{individuals}} <b>hold</b> multiple <b>jobs,</b> predicting how multiple <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> differs across demographic groups can be problematic. Hipple (2010) provides descriptive evidence on multiple <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> rates for employed workers for 1994 through 2009. Primary job occupations with particularly {{high rates of}} <b>dual</b> <b>job</b> incidence among men are firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics, and teachers and among women are dental hygienists, psychologists, teachers, and therapists. 3 Some of these occupations (e.g., teachers) are salaried but earnings constrained, with hours that are either sufficiently predictable or flexible as to allow a second <b>job.</b> Those <b>holding</b> multiple <b>jobs</b> in 2009 worked an average 11  h per week more than did single job holders (Hipple 2010).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a thorough {{analysis of the}} issue of <b>dual</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> among physicians. As the causes and implications of this phenomenon may well depend on the specific form of dual practice under consideration, we first introduce a typology of dual practice in the health sector based on the public versus private nature of the activity and the work regime involved. Our primary focus is on public on private practice, since it is more prevalent and poses greater adverse welfare effects than do other forms. We commence our analysis with a review of the theoretical and empirical economic literature on public on private <b>dual</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> among physicians in developing and developed countries and analyze its underlying motives and economic effects. We find that economic motives are not the only reason why physicians engage in dual practice. Other non-pecuniary factors such as job complementarities, and institutional, professional, structural and personal variables play a relevant role and, hence, should also be taken into account when regulating dual practice. Furthermore, while dual providers may be tempted to skimp on time and effort in their main job, to induce demand for their private services, or to misuse public resources, the legalization of dual practice may also contribute to recruit and retain physicians with less strain on the budget and improve access to health services, especially in developing countries. Finally, the paper highlights the lack of evidence regarding the extent and effects of this phenomenon. Given its implications for the equity, efficiency and quality of health care provision, dual practice among physicians warrants more attention from researchers and policy makers alike.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the system}} of financial and non-financial incentives underlying job preferences of doctors in Bangladesh who work both in government health services and in private practice. The study {{is based on a}} survey of 100 government-employed doctors with private practice, across different levels of care and geographical areas. In-depth interviews were carried out in a sub-sample of 28 respondents. The study explores the beliefs and attitudes towards the arrangements of joint private/public practice, establishes profiles of fee levels and earnings and examines the options to change the incentive system in a way that ensures an increased involvement of <b>dual</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> practitioners in the priority areas of care. Consultation fees were Tk 120 on average (range Tk 20 - 300) and found to be correlated with the qualification of the practice owner and the type of service offered. A majority of the respondents reported at least to double their government income by engaging in private practice. Significant predictors of total income included the number of patients seen in private practice (p= 0. 000), employment in a secondary or tertiary care facility (p= 0. 001) and ownership of premises for private practice (p= 0. 033). Age was found to be marginally significant (p= 0. 084). No association was found between total income and specialisation, private practice costs, level of government salary or a degree from abroad. The data suggest that doctors have adopted individual strategies to accommodate the advantages of both government employment and private practice in their career development, thus maximising benefit from the incentives provided to them, e. g. status of a government job, and minimising opportunity costs of economic losses e. g. lower salaries. Commitment to government services was found to be greater among doctors in primary health care who reported they would give up private practice if paid a higher salary. Among doctors in secondary and tertiary care, the propensity to give up private practice was found to be low. Financial incentives that aim to increase numbers of doctors in rural areas, such as a non-private-practice allowance, {{are more likely to be}} appreciated by doctors who are at the beginning of their career. Improved training and career opportunities also appear to be of high importance for job satisfaction. Policy changes to ensure a better resource allocation to the priority areas of the health sector have to reflect an understanding of the incentives generated by the organisational and financial context within which <b>dual</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> practitioners operate.

40|$|Essays in this {{dissertation}} address three research questions. (1) What {{types of}} persons hold dual jobs {{and what are}} their motives for doing so? In essay 1, I investigate multiple factors that affect the decision to hold {{more than a single}} job. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the first essay documents the characteristics of second jobs and multiple job holders in the U. S. I characterize the types of people who hold dual jobs and use additional information from the BLS to find out workers’ motives for holding multiple jobs. I examine how multiple job holding differs with respect to age, education, race and ethnicity, sex, foreign-born status, marital status, public-private worker status, broad industry and occupation. (2) How does <b>dual</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> vary with the business cycle and state of the labor market? Essay 2 explores a large micro data set for 1998 - 2013 that covers most U. S. urban labor markets. We find clear-cut evidence that multiple job holding across labor markets and over time is weakly cyclical, thus (slightly) exacerbating rather than mitigating the severity of business cycles. Much of the cyclicality in multiple job holding seen across labor markets, however, is not causal, dropping sharply after accounting for MSA fixed effects. Using longitudinal worker data, there is minimal response to unemployment changes within labor markets over time. Our large CPS sample size produces precise estimates, albeit ones close to zero, helping explain conflicting results in prior studies based on far smaller data sets. (3) How might one explain the persistent geographical differences in multiple job holding? Essay 3 documents what are systematic (i. e., long-run) differences in multiple job holding across labor markets (MSAs) and explores possible explanations for these differences. Geographical differences in multiple job holding rates have received little attention, although the multiple job holding rates in some regions of the country are substantially higher than in other regions, and these differences have been persistent over time. Examining correlates of these labor market differences in multiple job holding provides us with {{a better understanding of the}} determinants of labor supply and how local labor markets work...|$|E

30|$|A “job portfolio” {{framework}} provides several {{explanations for}} multiple <b>job</b> <b>holding.</b> A worker may simply prefer diversity in job tasks, being happier dividing {{time in two}} different jobs or occupations. 2 In this spirit, Renna and Oaxaca (2006) develop a job portfolio model based on a personal preference for job differentiation. Alternatively, workers may choose to work a second job {{as a form of}} insurance (i.e., diversifying one’s human capital) due to a high level of employment or income uncertainty in a first job. Or workers wanting to switch occupations or employers due to a poor match may use a second job as a source of on-the-job training that will facilitate a utility-enhancing move. Finally, a worker may choose to work at a second job for financial or family circumstances that are temporary, at the same time expecting that the current primary job offers the best long-run job match.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{enhancing the}} knowledge about <b>dual</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding.</b> While most studies in labor economics assume {{that each person}} holds only one job, {{a significant part of}} the work force holds two jobs simultaneously. The first part of the dissertation empirically analyzes the determinants of wages for dual jobholders, with an emphasis on the contribution of the "on the job" human capital accumulation. In order to increase the number of observations, data from 1990 to 1994 have been pulled together, thus resulting in a panel. The usual problem associated with panel data, together with the need to control for the selection bias, makes the full information maximum likelihood estimation very challenging. New econometric techniques developed by Wooldridge (Journal of Econometrics, 1995) and Vella and Verbeek (Journal of Econometrics, 1999) are used to overcome this problem. We found some evidence that the motivation behind the decision to hold two jobs may play an important role in determining the market return of moonlighting. Given the results of the first study, I explore the motivations that induce workers to hold two jobs and I explicitly design a labor supply function that includes these different motivations. I identify two major motivations: I call the first motivation the "hours constraint model". The hours constraint model says that workers underemployed will seek a second job in order to fulfill the gap in their work schedule. Yet, some workers may decide to hold two jobs simply because each job has some peculiar characteristics that makes it appealing to the worker. I call this motivation the "job portfolio model". The last part of the dissertation looks at the impact of hours regulation on the decision to hold two jobs. The understanding of this relationship is important in order to address the real impact of time-sharing policies on reducing unemployment. By enforcing stricter working week standards, labor policies aim at creating new jobs by inducing employers to shift from an intensive to and extensive use of workers. However I found that reducing the working week causes some workers to be underemployed, thus increasing the number of moonlighters...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} empirical essays within {{the subject of}} health economics. There are four essays in applied micro-econometrics and, as data in Essays 2 and 4 have a panel format, econometric methods for panel data are applied. Tobit-type models for limited dependent variables are applied in Essays 3 and 4, Nested logit models for choice of general practitioner (GP) are applied in Essay 1 and in Essay 2 modeling and estimation procedures involving latent structural variables are applied. The market for GPs' services is the recurrent theme, and a common feature of the empirical modeling and estimation conducted in the essays of this dissertation is that latent variables play an important role. There are several motivations for studying the market for GPs. GPs {{play a key role}} and constitute the cornerstone of the health care sector in Norway and other countries with a national health service. The GP is often a patient's first encounter with the health care sector. In Norway the GP also acts as a “gatekeeper”, and a referral from the GP is necessary in order to receive specialized care. Further, decisions made by GPs have a large impact on public spending such as sick-leave benefits and drug reimbursements. Due to this pivotal role of general practice, any research providing policy guidance for the sector will potentially have noticeable welfare effects. Studying this market may also provide advances in terms of enhanced understanding of economic behavior in general, and within the discipline of health economics in particular. Arrow's (1963) article describing various imperfections in the market for medical care is often considered to mark the founding of health economics (Culyer and Newhouse, 2000). Many of the peculiarities Arrow describes are, indeed, present in the market for GPs' services. Asymmetric information limits consumer sovereignty and creates challenges for designing appropriate contracts and payment mechanisms. Quality of services is diffcult to observe and quantify, and optimal consumption of health care services is diffcult to achieve. While the general research questions in health economics are relevant in the specific context of general practice, the conditions for knowledge accumulation seem favorable as well. The availability of detailed and disaggregated panel data enables identification and quantification of the mechanisms in focus by applying a large variety of modeling and estimation methods. In addition, one may argue that economic theory is well suited to model individual behavior and that assumptions of rational decision makers are more realistic when describing individuals such as GPs than when describing institutions such as hospitals. Fuchs (2000) describes two related missions of health economists: providing valuable input into health policy and enhancing understanding of economic behavior. Both missions motivate research on the market for GPs. Essays 1 and 2 in this dissertation focus mainly on factors influencing the patients' or consumers' decision to seek the services of a particular GP, while Essays 3 and 4 focus on factors influencing the GP's supply decision. The rest of the text proceeds as follows: The next subsection provides a brief introduction to the topic of this dissertation. Summaries of the four essays are given in subsection 1. 3. Policy implications of the findings are presented in subsection 1. 4. Limitations and ideas for future research are discussed in subsection 1. 5.

Evidence from a nationally representative longitudinal survey of Russian citizens is used to characterize secondary jobs and second job holders, with emphasis on the determinants of multiple <b>job</b> <b>holding.</b> There has been a marked increase in multiple <b>job</b> <b>holding,</b> rising from 5. 6 percent overall in 1992 to 10. 1 percent in 1996. Economic conditions prevalent in Russia's labor market are found to strongly affect secondary job activity. Workers who have experienced wage arrears, been placed on involuntary leave, or are working less than full-time are all significantly more likely to take on second jobs. Higher education nearly doubles this probability. As transition has progressed, women have become not only much less likely to engage in additional work, but those that do so receive significantly lower second-job wages, with a gender wage gap of 68 percent, over 3 times that for primary jobs.

30|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} large micro {{data set}} for 1998 – 2013 {{in order to examine}} how {{multiple}} <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> varies across and within US labor markets (MSAs) with respect to local unemployment and employment growth rates. In addition to examining how overall multiple <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> varies with respect to local labor market conditions, we address several related questions. Among these are how multiple <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> over the cycle has varied over time and among demographic groups, how it varies for workers whose primary jobs are salaried versus hourly, and whether responses to business conditions are symmetric with respect to increases versus decreases in unemployment. We briefly address the question of how closely second jobs match primary jobs and whether differences between the two, measured by occupational indices of skill-related job tasks and working conditions, vary over the business cycle.|$|R

Econometric analysis of panel data explores whether the self-employed are more or less likely to take on a second job when already running their own business than their employed counterparts. The findings contribute to the literature through identification of a need-based variable—difficulty in meeting housing costs—as a key driver of movements from self-employment to hybrid entrepreneurship. Findings, further, identify different patterns of second <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> by gender, particularly among self-employed individuals...|$|R
