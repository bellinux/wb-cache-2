5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E

5|$|In 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria {{who led the}} Muslim Ayyubids, {{captured}} Bethlehem {{from the}} Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them {{in the small town}} of Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous 'in partibus infidelium' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution in 1789.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back}} to the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1943, Mutsu was moored at Hashirajima {{when the}} {{magazine}} of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12:13, cutting {{the ship in}} half. The forward section capsized almost immediately, but the rear section remained afloat until the early morning of the next day. Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu, meaning that 1,121 men {{were killed in the}} explosion. To avert the potential damage to morale <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a battleship, Mutsus loss was declared a state secret. To further prevent rumors from spreading, many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E
5|$|The novels {{take place}} on the fantasy world of Krynn, created {{specifically}} for the gameplay.

The world is just starting to recover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the True Gods and a group has sprung up seeking to replace the True Gods (the Seekers). The main focus of the novels is the continent Ansalon and the characters Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Flint Fireforge, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, Goldmoon, and Riverwind.|$|E
5|$|After the explosion, as {{the rescue}} {{operations}} commenced, the fleet was alerted {{and the area}} was searched for Allied submarines, but no traces were found. To avert the potential damage to morale <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> a battleship so soon after the string of recent setbacks in the war effort, Mutsus destruction was declared a state secret. Mass cremations of recovered bodies began almost immediately after the sinking. Captain Teruhiko Miyoshi's body was recovered by divers on 17 June, but his wife was not officially notified until 6 January 1944. Both he and his second in command, Captain Ono Koro, were posthumously promoted to rear admiral, as was normal practice. To further prevent rumours from spreading, healthy and recovered survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the Caroline Islands and assigned to the 41st Guard Force. Another 150 were sent to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where most were killed in 1944 during {{the battle for the}} island.|$|E

5|$|As {{temperatures}} cooled in {{the final}} qualifying session, {{over a third of}} the field improved their fastest laps, but Jani's pole position time was unchallenged. Audi No. 7 led the session with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three of their cars during the session, closing to within a second of the closest LMP1 competitor. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed to within a second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, a second and a half ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. The No. 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the session which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{reference}} {{is part of}} a polemic against the moral decay of Florence, Lombardy, and the Italian Peninsula as a whole; Dante, through his characters, chastises German King Albert I for neglecting his responsibilities towards Italy ("you who are negligent"), and successive popes for their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs, thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare between rival political parties in Lombardy. History records the name of the family Montague as being lent to such a political party in Verona, but that of the Capulets as from a Cremonese family, both of whom play out their conflict in Lombardy as a whole rather than within the confines of Verona. Allied to rival political factions, the parties are grieving ("One lot already grieving") because their endless warfare has led to the destruction of both parties, rather than a grief <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> their ill-fated offspring as the play sets forth, which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{planned to}} produce sequels, but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game {{production}} {{for a few}} years. Prior to the full effects of the crash, Vid Kidz developed an official sequel, Blaster in 1983. The game {{is set in the}} same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons. Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation. The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers. It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64. In addition to the graphical update, the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles. Though the game features similar gameplay as the original, it was not as well received. Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the moving camera in the 3D environment a negative update. They felt the original format—an overhead perspective of a single screen—presented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player's skill. The moving camera angle, however, obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by an enemy that suddenly appeared. Vince echoed similar statements, stating that the gameplay suffered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> important aspects from the original. Rollings and Adams, however, attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron Xs release.|$|E

25|$|Upon his election, {{he found}} the {{government}} coffers empty, as the state had exhausted itself {{in an attempt to}} recover from overspending on internal improvements during the 1830s.

The Bigger administration had overseen a large reduction in the state's debt, but the government was still unable to make headway on the nine-million dollar debt that still existed. During his first term, he advocated major spending cuts, including large cuts in government employee wages. Those cuts, along with steadily improving state revenues, enabled the government to manage its debt during his first term in office.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 the U.S. began {{implementing}} a massive program of economic assistance to Europe {{in order to}} support European recovery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> World War II.

Paul Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the agency established to administer Marshall Plan programs, asked FitzGerald to help organize the Agricultural Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration Thus began FitzGerald’s 16-year career as an administrator of U.S. government foreign assistance programs. For roughly his first year on the job, FitzGerald was dual-hatted as Director of Foreign Agricultural Relations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.|$|R
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|The {{relocation}} of the livestock market had {{done little to}} resolve the problems of congestion {{in and around the}} market. Many of the mediaeval access routes to the market were too narrow for wheeled transport, and the narrow alleys were also dark, dangerous and mostly unpaved. Although the market had been resurfaced during the 18thcentury, this had been with flint pebble cobblestones which were easily dislodged and trapped refuse. William Chase, editor of the first Norwich Directory, lobbied in the late 18thcentury for civic improvements and a rationalisation of the streets around the market. However, the economy of Norwich depended heavily on the textile industry, which had suffered badly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> export markets during the French Wars, and funds for improvements were limited. By the beginning of the 19thcentury the only significant improvement had been the paving of Gentleman's Walk. In 1805 a number of Improvement Commissions were established to propose solutions to the problems facing the area, but little action was taken. Local councils had no powers to levy rates to fund general civic improvements and as a consequence funds for improvement works had to be raised either through tolls and rents, via public appeals, or through long term borrowing, and the city was initially unable to raise sufficient funds.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many waterfowl, mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much {{so that they are}} now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E
