40|$|The {{mental health}} needs of youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{juvenile}} <b>justice</b> system have received more attention at <b>the</b> federal level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 2 years than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past three decades combined. The importance of the mental health issue is also being recognized at the state level. A number of factors have contributed to this change. They include: growing recognition of the {{mental health needs}} of youth in general; increasing reliance on <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> system to care for individuals with mental illness; and recent changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system. Despite this growing concern, there is a paucity of adequate research on the prevalence and types of mental health disorders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system. However, these conclusions can be drawn: youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system experience substantially higher rates of mental health disorders than youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general population; {{a high percentage of}} youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system have a diagnosable mental health disorder; it is safe to estimate that at least one out of every five youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system has serious mental health problems; and many of <b>the</b> youth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system with mental illness also have a co-occurring substance abuse disorder. A set of comprehensive strategies and models for dealing with mental illness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system is emerging. It includes collaboration across systems, diverting youth with mental disorders from <b>the</b> juvenile <b>justice</b> system, mental health screening, community-based alternatives, and appropriate treatment.

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required {{to disclose their}} membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E

5|$|The backup to Justice League #6 {{hints at}} the {{formation}} of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The Secret Society was fully introduced in Justice League of America. In Justice League of America #1, it was revealed that the Justice League of America team was created by A.R.G.U.S. in order to stop the Justice League if needed, with each member being paired with someone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> League. Justice League #18 introduces Firestorm, Element Woman and Atom as the newest members of the Justice League, as well as the Watchtower being hacked. It is revealed at the end of Justice League #20 that Atom is an agent of A.R.G.U.S. and is actually a member of the Justice League of America. She was chosen to act as a spy within the Justice League. In Justice League of America #4, Dr. Arthur Light is called in by A.R.G.U.S. to examine the Secret Society's communication coin. While doing so, it is manipulated from the other side causing Light to be enveloped in a white light, giving him powers. In Justice League of America #5, it is determined that the Secret Society's manor has stained glass with images of Pandora's Box, hinting at their interest in Pandora.|$|E
