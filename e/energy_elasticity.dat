Since such elasticities are often a convenient way to summarize the responsiveness of demand to such things as own prices, cross prices, income, or other relevant variables, {{a substantial amount of}} resources have been devoted to estimating demand elasticities, at various levels of aggregation using a variety of models. The goal of this project is to survey these works for the U.

(2001) with recomputed critical bounds from Narayan (2005) and the Solow (1956) framework extended by Rao (2010). We also conduct the (Toda and Yamamoto (1995) test for Granger non-causality. The regression {{results show that}} short-run and long-run <b>energy</b> <b>elasticities</b> are 0. 50 and 1. 71, respectively for Kenya and 0. 17 and 0. 34, respectively for South Africa. The causality results indicate a unidirectional Granger causality running from capital per worker and energy per capita to output per worker for both countries. Moreover, in Kenya, we detect a strong unidirectional causality: (a) on output from joint consideration of capital stock and energy; and (b) on capital stock from joint consideration of energy and output. In South Africa, the joint causations are neutral. Hence, while energy and capital stock spurs growth in both countries, Kenya has a greater potential to harness growth and capital productivity via joint consideration of energy with capital and output, respectively...|$|R

Although {{there are problems with}} the quality of the estimates of both GDP and energy consumption, by 2003-4 observers placed Chinese <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> at approximately 1.5. For every one percent increase in GDP, energy demand grew by 1.5 percent. Much of this extra demand has been sourced internationally from fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum.|$|E
40|$|At first {{a survey}} is given on the {{thermodynamics}} of rubber-elasticity {{and the results}} of the statistical theory of molecular networks. Experimental data of torsional vibrations, stress—strain measurements (simple extension and uni-axial compression) and photoelastic properties in dependence of temperature are reported. The measurements have been carried out on dry and swollen crosslinked polymers, especially poly(methyl methacrylate) (crosslinked in bulk or in solution), natural rubber, trans-polypentenamer and poly(butadiene). The modulus—temperature curves were always linear in the rubbery region when the samples had been carefully extracted. For poly(methyl methacrylate) the curve of retractive lorce against temperature showed a bend at a distinct temperature. Below this temperature the slope of the curve is lower than above. This behaviour {{can be explained by the}} existence of long living associations in poly(methyl methacrylate) —solvent systems already known by measurements on the corresponding solutions. The associations are able to form physical crosslinks. Most elastomers do not behave ideally in the sense of the theory: they are not purely entropy-elastic but show also an <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> term of the modulus. The <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> part is not constant but increases with the network density and the degree of swelling. From this it is concluded that the <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> contribution is not only an intramolecular effect caused by rotational isomerism. The <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> may also depend on other intramolecular effects and intermolecular sources. The existence of short chains in the network seems to be one essential reason for the nonconstancy of the <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> contri-bution. Photoelastic measurements in dependence of the degree of swelling show that we must assume a short-range order in amorphous polymers. Following a newer theoretical consideration, the second term of the Mooney-Rivlin equation for the stress—strain behaviour of unswollen elastomers can be explained by the co-operation of the short-range order and the chain-length distribution in the random polymer network...|$|E

In this paper we analyze a free–boundary model for free–standing fibers made from smectic layers of kinked (bent–core) liquid crystal molecules. In [1] a radial model was proposed to explain how fibers form (assuming radially symmetric configurations) based on the distinctive packing and ferroelectric properties of bent–core molecules. We develop this model further to include smectic energy terms so as to allow for non–circular cross–sections with non–radial configurations and fields. We show that the relative size of the <b>energy’s</b> <b>elasticity</b> constants can be used to determine the stability (instability) of radially symmetric fibers with respect to non–radial perturbations. 1.

40|$|The {{modelling}} of non-isothermal flow of viscoelastic materials using differential constitutive equations is investigated. The {{approach is}} based on the concept of a slip tensor describing the nonaffine motion of the stress-carrying structure of the fluid. By specifying a slip tensor and the elastic behaviour of the structure, the constitutive model is determined. This slip tensor also appears in the energy equation and thus, for a given constitutive model, the form of the energy equation is known. Besides the partitioning between dissipated and elastically stored energy, also the difference between entropy and <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> is discussed. Numerical simulations are based on a stabilized Discontinuous Galerkin method to solve the mass, momentum and constitutive equations and a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin formulation to solve the energy equation. Coupling is achieved by a fixed point iteration. The flow around a confined cylinder is investigated, showing differences between viscous and viscoelastic modelling, and between limiting cases of viscoelastic modelling...|$|E

In line with the current developments in energy economics [62], we add to the literature by reviewing the elasticity coefficients for the 12 countries using the augmented Solow [63] framework and the ARDL bounds procedure [57].

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{deposition}} {{of a series}} of splats onto a solid substrate by the cold spray process has been investigated through modeling. Traditional approaches to modeling particle deformations and splats are based on the distribution of kinetic <b>energy,</b> <b>elasticity</b> and fluidity of particles impacting the surface, and are computationally impractical to simulate a bulk sample with statistical distributions of particle shape, size and various experimental conditions. In this work we demonstrate that by using empirical and phenomenological statistical relationships among particle size, speed, material strength and impact elongation, it is feasible to realistically simulate virtual experiments under various experimental conditions. In the cold spray process, solid state powders, with particle sizes ranging from several to tens of micrometers in diameter, are accelerated to supersonic velocities. Upon impacting the substrate, these particles undergo plastic deformation and subsequently adhere to the surface. The collision dynamics of these micrometer sized particles impacting onto a solid substrate leading to the formation of a coating several hundreds of micrometers thick are studied by means of two-dimensional computer simulations. The experimental observations and the numerical results are in reasonable agreement...|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades after the ‘opening to the market ’ in 1979 China {{achieved}} rapid expansion with low growth in energy use, the energy growth rate being only about half that of GDP. This has not continued in recent years; over 2001 - 05 real GDP grew by 45 % and energy use by 57 %. During 1979 - 2001 falling energy intensities, in both secondary and tertiary industries, substantially offset the impact on energy demand of high growth and structural change, but the decline in sectoral intensities ceased after 2001. China will find difficult to achieve further reductions in energy intensity prior to 2010, and major policy initiatives or structural change may be necessary to return to an <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> of GDP of much less than one.

40|$|The built {{environment}} {{can be used}} to influence travel demand, but very few studies consider the relative energy savings of such policies in context of a complex urban system. This analysis quantifies the day-to-day and embodied energy consumption of four different neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how {{built environment}} variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to 320 % more embodied energy, 150 % more operational energy, and about 160 % more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed neighborhood with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes.

40|$|While China's 11 th Five Year Plan {{called for}} a {{reduction}} of energy intensity by 2010, whether and how the energy consumption trend can be changed {{in a short time}} has been hotly debated. This research intends to evaluate the impact of a variety of scenarios of GDP growth, <b>energy</b> <b>elasticity</b> and energy efficiency improvement on energy consumption in commercial buildings in China using a detailed China End-use Energy Model. China's official energy statistics have limited information on energy demand by end use. This is a particularly pertinent issue for building energy consumption. The authors have applied reasoned judgments, based on experience of working on Chinese efficiency standards and energy related programs, to present a realistic interpretation of the current energy data. The bottom-up approach allows detailed consideration of end use intensity, equipment efficiency, etc., thus facilitating assessment of potential impacts of specific policy and technology changes on building energy use. The results suggest that: (1) commercial energy consumption in China's current statistics is underestimated by about 44 %, and the fuel mix is misleading; (2) energy efficiency improvements will not be sufficient to offset the strong increase in end-use penetration and intensity in commercial buildings; (3) energy intensity (particularly electricity) in commercial buildings will increase; (4) different GDP growth and elasticity scenarios could lead {{to a wide range of}} floor area growth trajectories, and therefore, significantly impact energy consumption in commercial buildings...|$|E

This study used the LMDI factor decomposition model-panel co-integration test two-step method to analyze the factors that affect per-capita carbon emissions. The main results are as follows. (1) During 1997, Eastern China, Central China, and Western China ranked first, second, and third in the per-capita carbon emissions, while in 2009 the pecking order changed to Eastern China, Western China, and Central China. (2) According to the LMDI decomposition results, the key driver boosting the per-capita carbon emissions in the three economic regions of China between 1997 and 2009 was economic development, and the energy efficiency was much greater than the energy structure after considering their effect on restraining increased per-capita carbon emissions.
