5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered <b>deals</b> <b>that</b> matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{discovered}} few {{investment opportunities}} himself (and those that he did, often {{failed to make}} money for the firm). Instead, he focused on analyzing the merits of possible <b>deals</b> <b>that</b> others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved. Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself.|$|E
5|$|Hodgsen sold to Carling O'Keefe in 1979, who {{had been}} {{minority}} owners since 1976. The brewing company's total investment in the team was $5.8 million. At {{the time it was}} rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights <b>deals</b> <b>that</b> would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Romney soon {{switched}} Bain Capital's {{focus from}} startups {{to the relatively}} new business of leveraged buyouts: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets as collateral, then taking steps to improve the companies' value, and finally selling those companies once their value peaked, usually within a few years. Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but then found <b>deals</b> <b>that</b> made large returns. The firm invested in or acquired Accuride Corporation, Brookstone, Domino's Pizza, Sealy Corporation, Sports Authority, and Artisan Entertainment, {{as well as some}} lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors. Much of the firm's profit was earned from {{a relatively small number of}} deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} debut, {{most of the}} {{development}} staff were laid off; the remaining staff tried to patch Bloodlines and develop game concepts to secure funding to keep Troika in business. Troika, unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and Tim Cain. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development <b>deals.</b> <b>That</b> month, Boyarsky confirmed that Troika had not {{been working on a}} patch for the game since most of its staff were gone since December 2004. In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision was Activision's. In a 2006 interview, Anderson said that although Troika Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects.|$|E
5|$|To placate {{physical}} retailers {{affected by}} the digital exclusivity period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks; the iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalog <b>deals</b> <b>that</b> discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because {{it would not have been}} available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, this ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.|$|E

5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War of 1409–1411, {{precipitated by}} the Samogitian uprisings in Lithuanian territories {{controlled}} by the State of the Teutonic Order, culminated in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg), in which the combined forces of the Polish and Lithuanian-Rus' armies completely defeated the Teutonic Knights. The offensive that followed lost its impact with the ineffective siege of Malbork (Marienburg). The failure to take the fortress and eliminate the Teutonic (later Prussian) state had dire historic consequences for Poland in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The Peace of Thorn of 1411 gave Poland and Lithuania rather modest territorial adjustments, including Samogitia. Afterwards, there were more military campaigns and peace <b>deals</b> <b>that</b> did not hold. One unresolved arbitration {{took place at the}} Council of Constance. In 1415, Paulus Vladimiri, rector of the Kraków Academy, presented his Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor in respect to Infidels at the Council, in which he advocated tolerance, criticized the violent conversion methods of the Teutonic Knights, and postulated that pagans have the right to peaceful coexistence with Christians and political independence. This stage of the Polish-Lithuanian conflict with the Teutonic Order ended with the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Polish-Teutonic War of 1431-35 (see Battle of Pabaiskas) was concluded with the Peace of Brześć Kujawski in 1435.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of {{biomedical}} research, notably in America, patents were taken out on particular genes, treatments and techniques.

Although in principle rights holders could come together to make a deal, cognitive biases exist in rights owners that can often prevent <b>deals</b> <b>that</b> would likely be beneficial from occurring. For example, tests for certain breast cancer mutations were unavailable since the rights holder for the BRCA human gene did not release them onto the market, which lead to false negative tests for cancer. In the end the courts held that human genes were not patentable.|$|E
