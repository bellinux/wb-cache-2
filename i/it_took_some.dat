5|$|When the Hinomaru {{was first}} introduced, the {{government}} required citizens {{to greet the}} Emperor with the flag.

5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Marinić led {{other people}} from Jastrebarsko and Donja Reka by {{improving}} the living {{conditions of the}} children, decorating the walls, feeding them and treating their illnesses. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> time for the helpers to earn {{the trust of the}} children due to their harsh treatment {{at the hands of the}} Ustaše, but gradually their health began to improve. These helpers lived in the camp and at the sub-camp with the children.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A traffic light that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E
5|$|Potassium metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium {{was the first}} metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> time before this view was universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|The main Allied {{detector}} at {{this time}} was the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD). MAD entered service in 1943, only to find its targets had vanished from coastal waters. It was able to plot and recognise distortions in Earth's magnetic field caused by submarines. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> skill to use and only worked if it was directly above the target. It also was only effective at low altitudes. It had some success in the Gibraltar strait, but was ineffective in British waters owing to different conditions. The only recorded MAD victory in British waters was the sinking of U-1055 on 30 April 1945 off Ushant. Another invention was the American 3-cm radar and sonobuoy. These devices, along with the Mark 24 Mine (Fido), {{was responsible for the}} destruction of U-905 and U-296, sunk by No. 86 Squadron RAF and No. 120 Squadron RAF.|$|E

50|$|The film {{follows the}} early life story of Salamo Arouch, though <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> artistic liberties {{including}} the early introduction of wife Allegra (a pseudonym for Marta Yechiel), whom Arouch {{did not actually}} meet until after the liberation of the camp.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> {{time before}} a Bishop of Lithuania was {{appointed}} because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of Gniezno appointed Vito (Lithuanian: Vitas), a monk of the Dominican Order, to this position, {{but he was}} not recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace. The activities of Vito in Lithuania are unknown, although he is sometimes associated with Mindaugas' Cathedral. Finally, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: Kristijonas) from the Livonian Order was appointed. Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities. Historical sources do not mention any sponsorship of missionaries, education of priests, or construction of churches during that time, and Bishop Christian went back to Germany in 1259, where he died in 1271. The establishment of Mindaugas' Cathedral remains problematic, but recent archeological research found the remains of a 13th-century brick building {{on the site of the}} present-day Vilnius Cathedral. The general assumption is that the remains are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, built to satisfy the agreement with the pope. However, as later events showed, Lithuanians resisted Christianization, and Mindaugas' baptism had only a temporary impact on further developments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attacks on}} the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet, {{followed}} by Yates, while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group. Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet, {{who was in the}} lead of the race. Towards the top of the climb, however, Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race. He was knocked to the ground and the frame of the bike was broken; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race. Yates therefore led the race alone {{at the top of the}} final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián. Unlike in the 2014 race, when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent, Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this advantage to the end of the race. As he crossed the finish line, Yates was unaware that he had won the race, as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> time for the message to come through from his team that he had won. In the group behind, Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde.|$|E

25|$|In 1837 Lewis Thomson and Pfaff {{independently}} discovered stibine. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> {{time before}} {{the properties of the}} toxic gas could be determined, partly because a suitable synthesis was not available.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> {{time for}} work on the {{projected}} cathedral to get started. The first finished architectural project, by Aleksandr Lavrentyevich Vitberg, was endorsed by the Tsar in 1817. It was a flamboyant Neoclassical design full of Freemasonic symbolism. Construction work was begun on the Sparrow Hills, the highest point in Moscow, but the site proved unstable.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco {{advertising}} on Hong Kong television was outlawed on 1 December 1990, when the territory {{was still a}} British colony.

25|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> {{time after}} the fire of 1702, Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala Castle were both {{eventually}} restored, both by Carl Hårleman, {{perhaps the most important}} Swedish architect of the era. He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus' botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university.|$|E
50|$|Kazuhiko Shimamoto drew a manga {{adaptation}} of the film. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> liberties with the plot, expanding the role of several characters, a different characterization of ZO and more-graphic violence.
