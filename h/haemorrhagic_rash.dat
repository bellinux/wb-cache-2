40|$|Background Early {{recognition}} {{and treatment of}} meningococcal disease improves its outcome. <b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> {{is one of the}} most specifi c signs that parents can learn to recognise. Objective To determine the percentage of parents able to recognise a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> and perform the tumbler test. Methods 123 parents of children consulting for mild injuries were interviewed about the signifi cance and recognition of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> in febrile children. Results Although 88 % of parents undressed their children when they were febrile, it was never to look specifi cally for a skin rash. Only 7 % (95 % CI 3 % to 12 %) were able to recognise a petechial rash and knew th...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{the presentation of}} meningococcal disease in primary care; to explore how general practitioners process clinical and contextual information in children with meningococcal disease; and to describe how this information affects management. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews. SETTING: General practices in South Glamorgan. SUBJECTS: 26 general practitioners who between January 1994 and December 1996 admitted 31 children (under 16 years of age) in whom meningococcal disease was diagnosed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Categories of clinical rules and techniques used by general practitioners in processing each case. RESULTS: 22 children had rashes; in 16 of them the rashes were non-blanching. When present, a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> {{was the most important}} factor in the doctor's decision to admit a child. 22 children had clinical features not normally expected in children with acute self limiting illnesses [...] for example, lethargy, poor eye contact, altered mental states, pallor with a high temperature, and an abnormal cry. Contextual information, such as knowledge of parents' consultation patterns and their normal degree of anxiety, played an important part in the management decisions in 15 cases. Use of penicillin was associated with the certainty of diagnosis and the presence and type of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash.</b> CONCLUSION: The key clinical feature of meningococcal disease [...] a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> [...] was present in only half of the study children. The general practitioners specifically hunted for the rash in some ill children, but doctors should not be deterred from diagnosing meningococcal disease and starting antibiotic treatment if the child is otherwise well, if the rash has an unusual or scanty distribution, or if the rash is non-haemorrhagic...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{communicable}} disease surveillance depends on effective bidirectional information flow between clinicians at the periphery and {{communicable disease}} control units at regional, national and global levels. Resource-poor countries often struggle {{to establish and}} maintain the crucial link with the periphery. A simple syndrome-based outbreak surveillance system initially developed and evaluated in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa was adapted for the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu. Eight syndromes were identified for surveillance: acute flaccid paralysis (poliomyelitis), profuse watery diarrhoea (cholera), diarrhoea outbreak, dysentery outbreak, febrile disease with abdominal symptoms and headache (typhoid), febrile disease with generalized non-blistering rash (measles), febrile disease with intense headache and/or neck stiffness with or without <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> (meningococcal meningitis), and outbreaks of other febrile diseases of unknown origin. A user-oriented manual, the Tuvalu Outbreak Manual ([URL] was developed to support introduction of the surveillance system. Nurses working in seven outer island clinics and the hospital outpatient department on the main island rapidly report suspected outbreaks and submit weekly zero-reports to the central communicable disease control unit. An evaluation of the system after 12 months indicated that the Outbreak Manual was regarded as very useful by clinic nurses, and there was early evidence of improved surveillance and response to the disease syndromes under surveillance...|$|E

40|$|Sixty nine {{patients}} with meningococcal disease {{some of whom}} presented with a maculopapular rash were entered in a prospective multicentre study. The clinical and laboratory features of children presenting with maculopapular rashes were {{compared with those of}} children presenting with typical <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rashes.</b> Of the 69 children 26 (38 %) developed maculopapular rashes; nine (13 %) had a maculopapular rash only, and the remaining 17 had a mixed maculopapular-purpuric rash. Twelve of the 17 (7 %) had less than 12 petechiae. Children with maculopapular rashes had significantly higher platelet counts (median 294 compared with 243 x 10 (9) /l), and plasma total haemolytic complement activity (80. 5 compared with 65. 0 U/ml) and significantly lower Glasgow meningococcal septicaemia prognostic scores (2. 5 compared with 5. 5) than those with purpuric rashes on admission.

40|$|Background: Childhood Meningitis {{continues}} to be an important cause of mortality in many countries. The search for rapid diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis has lead to the further exploration of prognostic factors. This study was scheduled in an attempt to analyze various clinical symptoms as well as rapid laboratory results and provide an algorithm for the prediction of specific bacterial aetiology of childhood bacterial meningitis. Methodology and Principal Findings: During the 32 year period, 2477 cases of probable bacterial meningitis (BM) were collected from the Meningitis Registry (MR). Analysis was performed on a total of 1331 confirmed bacterial meningitis cases of patients aged 1 month to 14 years. Data was analysed using EPI INFO (version 3. 4. 3 -CDC-Atlanta) and SPSS (version 15. 0 -Chicago) software. Statistically significant (p, 0. 05) variables were included in a conditional backward logistic regression model. A total of 838 (63. 0 %) attributed to Neisseria meningitidis, 252 (18. 9 %) to Haemophilus influenzae, 186 (14. 0 %) to Streptococcus pneumoniae and 55 (4. 1 %) due to other bacteria. For the diagnosis of Meningococcal Meningitis, the most significant group of diagnostic criteria identified included <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> (OR 22. 36), absence of seizures (OR 2. 51), headache (OR 1. 83) and negative gram stain result (OR 1. 55) with a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 96. 4 % (95 %CI 87. 7 – 99. 6).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Meningococcal {{disease is}} a rapidly {{progressive}} childhood infection of global importance. To our knowledge, no systematic quantitative research exists into the occurrence of symptoms before admission to hospital. METHODS: Data were obtained from questionnaires answered by parents and from primary-care records for the course of illness before admission to hospital in 448 children (103 fatal, 345 non-fatal), aged 16 years or younger, with meningococcal disease. In 373 cases, diagnosis was confirmed with microbiological techniques. The rest {{of the children were}} included because they had a purpuric rash, and either meningitis or evidence of septicaemic shock. Results were standardised to UK case-fatality rates. FINDINGS: The time-window for clinical diagnosis was narrow. Most children had only non-specific symptoms in the first 4 - 6 h, but were close to death by 24 h. Only 165 (51 %) children were sent to hospital after the first consultation. The classic features of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash,</b> meningism, and impaired consciousness developed late (median onset 13 - 22 h). By contrast, 72 % of children had early symptoms of sepsis (leg pains, cold hands and feet, abnormal skin colour) that first developed at a median time of 8 h, much earlier than the median time to hospital admission of 19 h. INTERPRETATION: Classic clinical features of meningococcal disease appear late in the illness. Recognising early symptoms of sepsis could increase the proportion of children identified by primary-care clinicians and shorten the time to hospital admission. The framework within which meningococcal disease is diagnosed should be changed to emphasise identification of these early symptoms by parents and clinicians...|$|E

Statistically significant (p = 15000 /mu L (OR 2. 19) with a PPV of 77. 8 % (95 % CI 40. 0 - 97. 2). For the diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae, the most significant group of diagnostic criteria included, absence of <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rash</b> (OR 13. 61), age >= 1 year (OR 2. 04), absence of headache (OR 3. 01), CSF Glu < 40 mg/dL (OR 3. 62) and peripheral WBC < 15000 /mu L (OR 1. 74) with a PPV of 58. 5 % (95 % CI 42. 1 - 73. 7).

40|$|AIMS—To {{establish}} {{criteria for}} early distinction between meningococcal disease and other conditions with similar clinical features, {{and to identify}} other causes for <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>rashes</b> accompanied by fever.  METHODS—In a prospective study, 264 infants and children hospitalised with fever and skin haemorrhages were studied.  RESULTS—We identified an aetiological agent in 28 %: 15 % had meningococcal disease, 2 % another invasive bacterial infection, 7 % enterovirus infection, and 4 % adenovirus infection. Five clinical variables distinguished between meningococcal disease and other conditions on admission: (1) skin haemorrhages of characteristic appearance; (2) universal distribution of skin haemorrhages; (3) maximum diameter {{of one or more}} skin haemorrhages greater than 2 mm; (4) poor general condition (using a standardised observation scheme); and (5) nuchal rigidity. If any two or more of these clinical variables were present, the probability of identifying a patient with meningococcal disease was 97 % and the false positive rate was only 12 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Clinicians in resource-poor {{countries}} need {{to identify}} patients with dengue using readily-available data. The objective of this systematic review was to identify clinical and laboratory features that differentiate dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) from other febrile illnesses (OFI) in dengue-endemic populations. METHOD: Systematic {{review of the literature}} from 1990 to 30 October 2007 including English publications comparing dengue and OFI. RESULTS: Among 49 studies reviewed, 34 did not meet our criteria for inclusion. Of the 15 studies included, 10 were prospective cohort studies and five were case-control studies. Seven studies assessed all ages, four assessed children only, and four assessed adults only. Patients with dengue had significantly lower platelet, white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, and a higher frequency of petechiae than OFI patients. Higher frequencies of myalgia, <b>rash,</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> signs, lethargy/prostration, and arthralgia/joint pain and higher haematocrits were reported in adult patients with dengue but not in children. Most multivariable models included platelet count, WBC, rash, and signs of liver damage; however, none had high statistical validity and none considered changes in clinical features over the course of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Several individual clinical and laboratory variables distinguish dengue from OFI; however, some variables may be dependent on age. No published multivariable model has been validated. Study design, populations, diagnostic criteria, and data collection methods differed widely across studies, and the majority of studies did not identify specific aetiologies of OFIs. More prospective studies are needed to construct a valid and generalizable algorithm to guide the differential diagnosis of dengue in endemic countries...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Pakistan during 2005 – 06, an {{unprecedented}} increase in dengue fever {{occurred in the}} country, {{with a large number}} of cases reported in Karachi. During this time, more than 3640 patients were admitted to hospital with dengue. In the province of Punjab, disease incidence increased sharply towards August, 2011, especially in Lahore, with 17   256 cases and 279 deaths reported in that year. After Lahore, the next highest numbers of cases were reported in Faisalabad (783 cases), followed by Rawalpindi (410 cases), Pakpattan (233 cases), and Sheikhupura (225 cases). Since 2011 Lahore has been experiencing outbreaks of dengue fever every year. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify risk factors for dengue during the 2013 outbreak in Punjab, Pakistan, so as to help prevent future outbreaks. Methods: Between Oct 4 and Nov 23, 2014, we conducted a descriptive study followed by a case control study to identify the risk factors for spread of dengue fever. A case was defined as any person resident of Data Gunj Bakhsh Town who presented with fever and any three of headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, <b>rash,</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> manifestations, leukopenia, or abdominal pain, and also laboratory confirmation through ELISA. Control participants were taken from the same town and included people with dengue symptoms, but negative ELISA results. A standardised questionnaire was developed to collect data. A line listing of cases was developed and data were analysed with EpiInfo version 7 · 0. Findings: We identified 147 cases and 300 controls (221 [73 %] were men). Mean age was 30 · 9 years (range 5 – 70 years) and most cases were men (n= 94 [64 %]). Overall, the attack rate (AR) during the study period was 15 per 100   000 population. Residents in the 15 – 49 years age group had more dengue infections (n= 114; AR= 23 · 84 per 100   000) than did those aged 50 years and older (n= 6; AR= 15 · 3 per 100   000). On bivariate analysis, the presence of indoor stagnant water (OR= 3 · 7 [95 % CI= 2. 5 - 4. 8], p< 0 · 0001), presence of indoor larvae (OR= 3 · 1 [2 · 3 - 4 · 4], p= 0 · 001), and non-use of repellents (OR= 2 · 7 [CI= 1 · 5 – 3 · 2], p= 0 · 01) were found to be independent determinants of dengue infection. Interpretation: There is a strong association between dengue transmission and both stagnant water indoors and the non-use of mosquito repellent in Punjab. That more men than women and younger rather than older people presented with dengue is consistent with other findings and may be because these groups are more likely to be outdoors and, therefore, be exposed to mosquitos. In areas at risk of dengue transmission, we undertook health education activities to improve use of repellents and remove sources of indoor stagnant water. Funding: None...|$|R
