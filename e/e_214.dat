40|$|Cancer {{cachexia}} is characterised by selective {{depletion of}} skeletal muscle protein reserves. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway {{has been shown}} to be responsible for muscle wasting in a range of cachectic conditions including cancer cachexia. To establish the importance of this pathway in muscle wasting during cancer (and sepsis), a quantitative competitive RT-PCR (QcRT-PCR) method was developed to measure the mRNA levels of the proteasome sub units C 2 a and C 5 ß and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k. Western blotting was also used to measure the 20 S proteasome and <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k protein expression. In vivo studies in mice bearing a cachexia inducing murine colon adenocarcinoma (MAC 16) demonstrated the effect of progressive weight loss on the mRNA and protein expression for 20 S proteasome subunits, as well as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k, in gastrocnemius and pectoral muscles. QcRT-PCR measurements showed a good correlation between expression of the proteasome subunits (C 2 and CS) and the <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k enzyme mRNA and weight loss in gastrocnemius muscle, where expression increased with increasing weight loss followed by a decrease in expression at higher weight losses (25 - 27 %). Similar results were obtained in pectoral muscles, but with the expression being several fold lower in comparison to that in gastrocnemius muscle, reflecting the different degrees of protein degradation in the two muscles during the process of cancer cachexia. Western blot analysis of 20 S and <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k protein expression followed a similar pattern with respect to weight loss as that found with mRNA. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of the 20 S proteasome subunits and <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k enzyme was measured in biopsies from cachectic cancer patients, which also showed a good correlation between weight loss and proteasome expression, demonstrating a progressive increase in expression of the proteasome subunits and <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k mRNA and protein in cachectic patients with progressively increasing weight loss. The effect of the cachexia-inducing tumour product PIF (proteolysis inducing factor) and 15 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15 -HETE), the arachidoinic acid metabolite (thought to be the intracellular transducer of PIF action) has also been determined. Using a surrogate model system for skeletal muscle, C 2 C 12 myotubes in vitro, it was shown that both PIF and 15 -HETE increased proteasome subunit expression (C 2 a and C 5 ß) as well as the <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k enzyme. This increase gene expression was attenuated by preincubation with EPA or the 15 -lipoxygenase inhibitor CV- 6504; immunoblotting also confirmed these findings. Similarly, in sepsis-induced cachexia in NMRI mice there was increased mRNA and protein expression of the 20 S proteasome subunits and the <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k enzyme, which was inhibited by EPA treatment. These results suggest that 15 -HETE is the intracellular mediator for PIF induced protein degradation in skeletal muscle, and that elevated muscle catabolism is accomplished through upregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome-proteolytic pathway. Furthermore, both EPA and CV - 6504 have shown anti-cachectic properties, which could be used in the future for the treatment of cancer cachexia and other similar catabolic conditions...|$|E

40|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle, overall protein degradation {{involves the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system. One property of a protein {{that leads to}} rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation {{is the presence of}} a basic, acidic, or bulky hydrophobic residue at its N terminus. However, in normal cells, substrates for this N-end rule pathway, which involves ubiquitin carrier protein (E 2) <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k and ubiquitin-protein ligase (E 3) E 3 alpha, have remained unclear. Surprisingly, in soluble extracts of rabbit muscle, we found that competitive inhibitors of E 3 alpha markedly inhibited the 125 I-ubiquitin conjugation and ATP-dependent degradation of endogenous proteins. These inhibitors appear to selectively inhibit E 3 alpha, since they blocked degradation of 125 I-lysozyme, a model N-end rule substrate, but did not affect the degradation of proteins whose ubiquitination involved other E 3 s. The addition of several E 2 s or E 3 alpha to the muscle extracts stimulated overall proteolysis and ubiquitination, but only the stimulation by E 3 alpha or <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k was sensitive to these inhibitors. A similar general inhibition of ubiquitin conjugation to endogenous proteins was observed with a dominant negative inhibitor of <b>E</b> <b>214</b> k. Certain substrates of the N-end rule pathway are degraded after their tRNA-dependent arginylation. We found that adding RNase A to muscle extracts reduced the ATP-dependent proteolysis of endogenous proteins, and supplying tRNA partially restored this process. Finally, although in muscle extracts the N-end rule pathway catalyzes most ubiquitin conjugation, it makes only a minor contribution to overall protein ubiquitination in HeLa cell extracts...|$|E

ToMO was found here to also form catechol and 1, 2, 3 -trihydroxybenzene from phenol, m-nitrophenol (72 %) and p-nitrophenol (28 %) from nitrobenzene, 4 -nitrocatechol from m-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol, and 3 -nitrocatechol (12 %) and nitrohydroquinone (88 %) from o-nitrophenol. ^ To synthesize novel dihydroxy and trihydroxy derivatives of benzene, methylbenzene, and nitrobenzene, to enhance the degradation of chlorinated aliphatics, {{as well as to}} study the role of the active site residues I 100, Q 141, T 201, and F 205 of the alpha hydroxylase fragment of ToMO (TouA), DNA shuffling and saturation mutagenesis were used to generate random mutants. Mutants with higher rates of activities and with different regiospecificities were identified from TouA positions I 100, A 101 /M 114, A 107 /E 214, A 110 /E 392, M 180 /E 284, T 201, F 205, and <b>E</b> <b>214</b> /D 312 /M 399. To study the importance of TouA positions M 180 and <b>E</b> <b>214,</b> saturation mutagenesis was performed. It was discovered that position TouA M 180 influences the regiospecificity of hydroxylation of substituted aromatics, and TouA <b>E</b> <b>214</b> influences the catalysis rate. By substituting glycine, alanine, valine, glutamine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan at TouA position 214, it was found this residue acts as a gate. TouA positions A 101 and A 110 was also performed, and it was found saturation mutagenesis of these positions influence catalysis. ^ Eleven novel, industrially-important double- and triple-hydroxylated substituted aromatics, 3 -nitrocatechol, 4 -nitrocatechol, nitrohydroquinone, methylhydroquinone, 4 -methylresorcinol, 3 -methylcatechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, catechol, 1, 2, 4 -trihydroxybenzene, and 1, 2, 3 -trihydroxybenzene, were synthesized. Nonspecific ToMO was converted into a para enzyme, which rivals toluene 4 -monooxygenase of P. mendocina KR 1 and toluene ortho-monooxygenase of Burkholderia cepacia G 4 in its specificity.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the membrane pore structure of Cyt 2 Aa 1 toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis, 14 single-cysteine substitutions of the toxin were constructed. Five of these mutants (L 172 C, V 186 C, L 189 C, <b>E</b> <b>214</b> C and L 220 C) yielded characteristic products when processed by proteinase K; other mutants were degraded by this enzyme. Mutants that yielded characteristic proteolysed products and wild-type toxin were labelled with polarity-sensitive acrylodan (6 -acryloyl- 2 -dimethylaminonaphthalene) at the thiol group of cysteine residues. A green-blue {{shift in the}} emission spectra was observed with all labelled toxins on transfer from an aqueous solution into a solution containing membranes or liposomes from red blood cells. These results suggested that the label moved into the hydrophobic environment of the membrane or became buried within hydrophobic regions of the protein oligomers. Digestion of membrane-bound labelled toxin with proteinase K did not cause {{a significant decrease in}} emission intensity from any of the labelled mutants. This suggests that L 172 C, V 186 C, L 189 C, <b>E</b> <b>214</b> C and L 220 C are inserted into the membrane and are therefore protected from proteolysis. In contrast, a marked decrease in emission intensity was observed when membrane-bound labelled wild-type toxin was digested with proteinase K. This suggests that Cys- 19 does not insert into the membrane. Fluorimetric analysis of delipidated pore complexes suggests that L 172 C, V 186 C, L 189 C and <b>E</b> <b>214</b> C point towards the lipid in the membrane, whereas L 220 C is either within the hydrophobic environment of the protein oligomers or exposed to the membrane lipids.

The ToMO mutants were identified using a chlo-ride ion screen and then were further examined by gas chromatography. Escherichia coli TG 1 /pBS(Kan) ToMO expressing TouA saturation mutagenesis variant I 100 Q was identified that has 2. 8 -fold better trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation activity (apparent Vmax of 1. 77 nmol min− 1 mg− 1 protein− 1 vs 0. 63 nmol min− 1 mg− 1 protein− 1).

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{are thought to}} promote muscle atrophy in chronic wasting diseases, but the {{underlying}} mechanism has not been determined. Here we show that H 2 O 2 stimulates ubiquitin conjugation to muscle proteins through transcriptional regulation of the enzymes (E 2 and E 3 proteins) that conjugate ubiquitin to muscle proteins. Incubation of C 2 C 12 myotubes with 100 microM H 2 O 2 increased the rate of 125 I-labeled ubiquitin conjugation to muscle proteins in whole cell extracts.

40|$|Muscle atrophy in {{a number}} of acute wasting {{conditions}} is associated with an increased activity and expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway. Although different initiators are involved, {{it is possible that the}} intracellular signalling events leading to upregulation of this pathway are the same in all catabolic conditions. This study investigates hyperthermia in murine myotubes as a model for increased protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on this process should identify common elements, since EPA has been shown to attenuate induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cancer cachexia. Increasing the temperature of myotubes caused a progressive increase in protein degradation. This was associated with an increased proteasome 'chymotrypsin-like' enzyme activity, as well as increased expression of both mRNA and protein for 20 S proteasome subunits and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (<b>E</b> <b>214</b> k). This upregulation was not seen in cultures treated with EPA (50 μM), suggesting that it acts to prevent transcriptional activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in hyperthermia.

Our study was designed to test this hypothesis by replacing residues Leu- 211 and Asp- 214 with the larger Phe and Glu, respectively.

40|$|Bacterial oxygenases, the enzymes {{involved}} in the breakdown pathways of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, have aroused great interest within the scientific community for their potential applications {{in a number of}} different fields: environmental (bioremediation and biomonitoring), biotechnological (green chemistry) and biomedical (drug production). The aims of this study were 1) to clone new bacterial oxygenases using conventional methods and further develop new screening techniques and 2) to assess the ability of the newly-cloned enzyme(s), of toluene/o-xilene monooxygenase (ToMO) and of some of its mutants, to exploit various types of aromatic substrate on which the activity of these enzymes has never previously been assessed. Using conventional techniques, Pseudomonas sp. N 1 genes coding for naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) and Sphingobium sp. PhS genes, putatively coding for Phenanthrene dioxygenase (PhDO), were cloned; of the two enzymes only NDO appeared to be functional. ToMO is an enzyme complex formed from six different subunits, ABCDEF; subunit A (TouA) is part of the terminal hydroxylase and contains the active site. In this study, in addition to wild type enzymes, the TouA mutants D 211 A and D 211 A/E 214 G, previously created by this laboratory, and TouA <b>E</b> <b>214</b> G, already described in the literature, were also used. The ability of ToMO and TouA mutants, and of NDO to hydroxylate different aromatic compounds other than their natural substrates (toluene and naphthalene respectively) was evaluated by biotransformation assays using, as substrates, the following molecules: 1, 2, 3 -trimethoxybenzene, anisole, benzophenone, bibenzyl, biphenyl, nitrobenzene, quinoline, and trans-stilbene. These compounds were chosen for the environmental, biotechnological and pharmacological importance of their hydroxylated derivatives. To this end, ToMO, TouA mutants and NDO were expressed in the heterologous host E. coli JM 109. For both enzymes, the products of bioconversion were identified by GC-MS and, using the appropriate standard of reference, quantified by HPLC analysis. ToMO proved active in all substrates tested. The mutant <b>E</b> <b>214</b> G, like the wild type, was capable of oxidising all the compounds tested: in almost all the biotransformations both the mutant form and the wild type behaved in the same way in that they both produced the same isomers in similar proportions. In terms of catalytic efficiency, the mutant <b>E</b> <b>214</b> G was found to be most powerful: the mutants D 211 A and D 211 A/E 214 G were capable of hydroxylating only a few of the substrates used (1, 2, 3 -trimethoxybenzene, anisole, benzophenone, biphenyl) with very low yields. However, considering the fact that strains expressing the mutants D 211 A e D 211 A/E 214 G showed impaired growth and expression problems, probably attributable to unwanted mutations introduced during mutagenesis, these data cannot be considered definitive. The ability of NDO to perform dihydroxylation processes was confirmed but, in addition, monohydroxylation reactions (quinoline) and dealkylation reactions (anisole and 1, 2, 3 -trimethoxybenzene) were observed. The quantitative analysis of the biotransformation products showed that the enzyme efficiency decreased with the increasing steric footprint of the substrate. The failure of nitrobenzene to be transformed suggests that, in addition to steric footprint, other factors such as the presence of deactivating substituent groups plays a key role in the catalytic process of this enzyme. Both NDO and ToMO have shown a good potential in the field of biotransformation and further studies could lead to the production of more useful and efficient enzyme variants. During an internship at the University of Granada in Spain, a new protocol, based on the SIGEX (Substrate Induced Gene Expression) system, was developed to screen bacterial genomic libraries. This method, which is normally used to screen metagenomic libraries, was adapted to analyse libraries created from a single bacterial genome. With this technique it is possible to perform a rapid screening on the basis of a signal emitted from a reporter gene included in the construct used in creating the library. Using a previously constructed library, this approach allowed, in a short time, 60 clones to be isolated that had a high probability of containing naphthalene-dependent regulatory genes. The sequencing of the obtained clones, a necessary step in order to validate the protocol, in currently in progress...|$|E
40|$|VirB 8 -like {{proteins}} {{are essential}} components of type IV secretion systems, bacterial virulence factors that mediate the translocation of effector molecules from many bacterial pathogens into eukaryotic cells. Based on cell biological, genetic, and x-ray crystallographic data, VirB 8 was proposed to undergo multiple protein-protein interactions to mediate {{assembly of the}} translocation machinery. Here we report {{the results of a}} structure-function analysis of the periplasmic domain of VirB 8 from the mammalian pathogen Brucella suis, which identifies amino acid residues required for three protein-protein interactions. VirB 8 variants changed at residues proposed to be involved in dimerization, and protein-protein interactions were purified and characterized in vitro and in vivo. Changes at M 102, Y 105, and <b>E</b> <b>214</b> affected the self-association as measured by analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration. The interaction with B. suis VirB 10 was reduced by changes at T 201, and change at R 230 inhibited the interaction with VirB 4 in vitro. The in vivo functionality of VirB 8 variants was determined by complementation of growth in macrophages by a B. suis virB 8 mutant and by using a heterologous assay of type IV secretion system assembly in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Changes at Y 105, T 201, R 230, and at several other residues impaired the in vivo function of VirB 8, suggesting that we have identified interaction sites of relevance in the natural biological context. 9130...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Much of the {{catalytic}} {{power of}} trypsin {{is derived from}} the unusual buried, charged side chain of Aspl 02. A polar cave provides the stabilization for maintaining the buried charge, and it features the conserved amino acid Ser 214 adjacent to Aspl 02. Ser 214 has been replaced with Ala, Glu, and Lys in rat anionic trypsin, and the consequences of these changes have been determined. Three-dimensional structures of the Glu and Lys variant trypsins reveal that the new 214 side chains are buried. The 2. 2 -A crystal structure (R = 0. 150) of trypsin S 214 K shows that Lys 214 occupies the position held by Ser 214 and a buried water molecule in the buried polar cave. Lys 214 -Nf is solvent inaccessible and is less than 5 A from the catalytic Aspl 02. The side chain of Glu 214 (2. 8 A, R = 0. 168) in trypsin S <b>214</b> <b>E</b> shows two conformations. In the major one, the Glu carboxylate in S <b>214</b> <b>E</b> forms a hydrogen bond with Aspl 02. Analytical isoelectrofocusing results show that trypsin S 214 K has a significantly different isoelectric point than trypsin, corresponding to an additional positive charge. The kinetic parameter kat demonstrates that, compared to trypsin, S 214 K has 1 % of the catalytic activity on a tripeptide amide substrate and S <b>214</b> <b>E</b> is 44 % as active. Electrostatic potential calculations provide corroboration of the charge on Lys 214 and are consistent with the kinetic results, suggesting that the presence of Lys 214 has disturbed the electrostatic potential of Aspl 02.

40|$|AbstractThe petH genes {{encoding}} ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNR) {{from two}} Anabaena species (PCC 7119 and ATCC 29413) were cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. Several positively charged residues (Arg, Lys) have been implicated {{to be involved}} in ferredoxin binding and electron transfer by cross-linking, chemical modification and protection experiments, and crystallographic studies. The following substitutions were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis: R 153 Q, K 209 Q, K 212 Q, R 214 Q, K 275 N, K 430 Q and K 431 Q in Anabaena 29413 FNR, and R 153 E, K 209 E, K 212 <b>E,</b> R <b>214</b> <b>E,</b> K 275 E, R 401 E, K 427 E, and K 431 E in Anabaena 7119 FNR. Comparison of the diaphorase activities, the specific rates of ferredoxin dependent NADP+-photoreduction and cytochrome c reduction catalyzed by FNR showed that all these amino acid residues were required for efficient electron transfer between FNR and ferredoxin. Replacement of any one of these basic residues produced a much more pronounced effect on the cytochrome c reductase activity, where FNR, reduced by NADPH, acted as electron donor, than in the reduction of NADP+ by photosystem I via FNR. A mutation involving the replacement of positive charge by a neutral amide produced in all cases a smaller inhibitory effect on the activity than a charge reversal mutation. In addition, it has been found that R 214 was necessary for stable integration of the non covalently bound FAD-cofactor...|$|R
