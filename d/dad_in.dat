40|$|BACKGROUND: Animal {{studies have}} shown that the Ca(2 +) -activated Cl(-) current (I(Cl(Ca))) and the Na(+) /Ca(2 +) {{exchange}} current (I(Na/Ca)) contribute to the transient inward current (I(ti)). I(ti) is responsible for the proarrhythmic delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). We investigated the ionic mechanism of I(ti) and <b>DADs</b> <b>in</b> human cardiac cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human ventricular cells were enzymatically isolated from explanted hearts of patients with end-stage heart failure and studied with patch-clamp methodology. I(ti) s were elicited in the presence of 1 micromol/L norepinephrine by trains of repetitive depolarizations from - 80 to + 50 mV. <b>DADs</b> were induced <b>in</b> the presence of 1 micromol/L norepinephrine at a stimulus frequency of 1 Hz. I(ti) currents were inwardly directed over the voltage range between - 110 and + 50 mV. Neither the Cl(-) channel blocker 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid nor changes in [Cl(-) ](i) affected I(ti) or DAD amplitude. This excludes an important role for I(Cl(Ca)). Blockade of Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchange by substitution of all extracellular Na(+) by Li(+), conversely, completely inhibited I(ti). In rabbit, I(Cl(Ca)) density in ventricular cells isolated from control hearts did not differ significantly from that in ventricular cells isolated from failing hearts. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to many animal species, I(ti) and <b>DADs</b> <b>in</b> human ventricular cells from failing hearts consist only of I(Na/Ca). In rabbits, heart failure per se does not alter I(Cl(Ca)) density, suggesting that I(Cl(Ca)) may also be absent during <b>DADs</b> <b>in</b> nonfailing human ventricular cell...|$|R
40|$|Face-core {{delamination}} {{has become}} a subject matter in the Aerospace industry, as {{it can lead to}} early failure. In this study, sandwich composite beams are tested initially with no delamination to obtain the ultimate strength.

This experiment investigates the performance effects of the addition of Damage Arrestment Devices (<b>DADs),</b> <b>in</b> composite sandwich beams. The performance criterion is measured by strength in flexural loading test. The objective of this project is to verify an increase in the strength and performance with the addition of <b>DADs</b> <b>in</b> a sandwich composite.
