D 3 Computer Program, Mathematics and Science Faculty, Surakarta Sebelas Maret University. The use of {{database}} {{really helps}} {{in the data}} monitoring process such as monitoring the <b>insurance</b> <b>claim</b> process. PT. Asuransi Astra Buana Surakarta still uses the Microsoft Excel program as the processor of its <b>insurance</b> <b>claim</b> process monitoring. Microsoft Excel is slightly slower in processing data to get new information. For that reason, this research aims to develop a special program functioning to do the <b>insurance</b> <b>claim</b> monitoring job in PT. Asuransi Astra Buana Surakarta. Software Borland Delphi 7. 0 was used to develop an Application of <b>Insurance</b> <b>Claim</b> Process Monitoring on PT. Asuransi Astra Buana Surakarta. Database MySQL was used for storing the data after being processed. Meanwhile the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) connector 5. 15 -win 32 was used to connect the Borland Delphi 7. 0 application to the database MySQL. In this study, the writer used two research techniques: primary data and secondary data collection ones. The technique of collecting primary data consists of three methods: interview, observation and documentation. For the technique of collecting secondary data, the writer used literature study. The application of <b>Insurance</b> <b>Claim</b> Process Monitoring made with Borland Delphi 7. 0 aid {{is more effective than}} that with Microsoft Excel.

5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

The thesis is divided into six chapters in accordance with the topics. In order to introduce the problematics, there are historical roots of insurance in the world as well as of insurance in the area of Bohemia and Moravia stated. The second chapter deals with current legal regulation of personal insurance, with the focus on two-legal regime of the insurance contract.

An {{estimated}} 160,000 residences were left without power due to Georges and severe beach erosion took place due to the slow movement of the hurricane. Precipitation statewide peaked at 2.98in (75.69mm) in Bogalusa, and wind gusts reached 82mph (132km/h). In the wake of the hurricane, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) opened 67 shelters throughout the state, and covered <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> totalling $14,150,532, including from Puerto Rico and Mississippi.

Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million).

On January 3, 1885, Mary Celeste approached the port via the channel between Gonâve Island and the mainland, in which lay a large and well-charted coral reef, the Rochelois Bank. Parker deliberately ran the ship on to this reef, ripping out her bottom and wrecking her beyond repair. He and the crew then rowed themselves ashore, where Parker sold the salvageable cargo for $500 to the American consul, and instituted <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> for the alleged value.|$|E

5|$|MIGA offers {{insurance}} to cover five types of non-commercial risks: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction; government expropriation; war, terrorism, and civil disturbance; breaches of contract; and the non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also insure investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements.

5|$|In November 1938, a young Jewish man {{requested}} {{an interview}} with the German ambassador in Paris and met with a legation secretary, whom he shot and killed to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were killed during this pogrom, later called Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months– they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library or own weapons and Jewish pupils were removed from schools. The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by Kristallnacht and told that any money received via <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> would be confiscated. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine and other countries. Many chose to stay in continental Europe.

In late October, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador {{allocated}} $275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in Marystown and Port Union. However, union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600work hours. Following {{more than a year of}} discussions, the plant's parent company, Ocean Choice International, decided to permanently shut down operations on December2, 2011. Numerous <b>insurance</b> <b>claims,</b> reaching $65million by early November, were made following Hurricane Igor's landfall Over the course of the recovery phase, several complaints, including concerns lodged by church ministers, that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long. Roughly ten months after the hurricane, work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the Burin Peninsula. By January 24, 2011, The Salvation Army received about $1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by Hurricane Igor, roughly half of which had been distributed at that point. An additional $200,000 had been pledged by donors.|$|E

She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the Haight-Ashbury district. Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice. Soon after, they began taking night courses at University of San Francisco, an all-male Jesuit school that allowed women to take night courses. For Easter vacation Anne returned home to Texas, rekindling her relationship with Stan Rice. After her return to San Francisco, Stan Rice came for a week-long visit during summer break. He returned to Texas, Rice moved back in with the Percys, and Mathis left San Francisco in August to enroll in a nursing program in Oklahoma. Some time later, Anne received a special delivery letter from Stan Rice asking her to marry him.
