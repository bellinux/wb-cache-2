5|$|As {{hostilities}} renewed, San Martín organized several guerrilla {{groups in}} the countryside, and laid siege to Lima, but did not force his entry, as {{he did not want}} to appear as a conqueror to the local population. However, De la Serna suddenly left the city with his army, for unknown reasons. San Martín called for an open cabildo to discuss the <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> the country, which was agreed. With this approval, the authority in Lima, the support of the northern provinces and the port of El Callao under siege, San Martín declared the <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> Peru on 28 July 1821. The war, however, had not ended yet.|$|E

40|$|The <b>independence</b> density <b>of</b> {{a finite}} {{hypergraph}} is {{the probability that}} a subset of vertices, chosen uniformly at random contains no hyperedges. Independence densities can be generalized to countable hypergraphs using limits. We show that, in fact, every positive <b>independence</b> density <b>of</b> a countably infinite hypergraph with hyperedges of bounded size is equal to the <b>independence</b> density <b>of</b> some finite hypergraph whose hyperedges are no larger than those in the infinite hypergraph. This answers a question of Bonato, Brown, Kemkes, and Prałat about <b>independence</b> densities <b>of</b> graphs. Furthermore, we show that for any k, the set <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> densities <b>of</b> hypergraphs with hyperedges of size at most k is closed and contains no infinite increasing sequences.

5|$|After the Angolan War of <b>Independence</b> <b>of</b> 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions {{were important to}} the expansion of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> Pakistan and the {{partition}} of Bengal in 1947, {{there have been more}} attempts to compile and publish an encyclopedia. The first was a project to produce a Bengali adaptation of Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia by Franklin Book Programs Inc., undertaken in 1959 and aborted ten years later. The unfinished papers were compiled into four unequal volumes as Bangla Visvacos (1972) with Khan Bahadur Abdul Hakim as the chief editor. After the <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> Bangladesh in 1971, three specialized encyclopedias were published - the multi-volume Islami Bishwakosh (Encyclopedia of Islam, 1986) by Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, 5-volume Shishu-Biswakosh (Encyclopedia for Children, 1995) by Bangladesh Shishu Academy, and 4-volume Vijnan Biswakosh (Encyclopedia of Science, 1998) by Bangla Academy.|$|E
