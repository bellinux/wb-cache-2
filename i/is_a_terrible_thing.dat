500|$|The {{damage done}} by Sherman was almost entirely limited to the {{destruction}} of property. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small. Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, Alabama-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> to consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," [...] but if the scorched earth strategy served [...] "to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting ... it is mercy in the end".|$|E

500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors have been fighting {{for the last five years}} to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I have heard that for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. Why, when we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E
2500|$|The Ministry song [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (from {{the album}} The Mind <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> To Taste) {{features}} an audio {{sample of the}} military station's warning horn and a few notes of composer John Harrison's synthesized score.|$|E
2500|$|Ministry found {{mainstream}} {{success in}} the late 1980s and early 1990s with the albums The Land of Rape and Honey (1988), The Mind <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Taste (1989) and [...] (1992), with the former of the two certified gold and the latter certified platinum by the RIAA. The band has been nominated for six Grammy Awards, and performed at several notable music festivals, including participating in the second annual Lollapalooza tour in 1992 and co-headlining Big Day Out in 1995.|$|E

2500|$|This period {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of divisions within the band, as rather than tour in support of Rabies, Ogre joined Ministry while they toured in support of their album The Mind <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Taste; Ogre contributed guitars, keyboards, and vocals during the tour. Ogre had also began working with the Ministry side project Revolting Cocks. [...] Key was later quoted as saying of Ogre's involvement with Ministry and, later on, Martin Atkins' Pigface that he sometimes felt [...] "like a wife that's been cheated on".|$|E
2500|$|Due to the non-chronological story telling, {{other parts}} of Billy's life are told {{throughout}} the book. After being evicted from the radio studio, Barbara treats Billy {{as a child and}} often monitors him. Robert becomes starkly anti-Communist and a Green Beret. Billy eventually dies in 1976 after giving a speech in a baseball stadium in which he predicts his own death and claims that [...] "if you think death <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing,</b> then you have not understood a word I've said." [...] Billy is soon after shot by an assassin with a laser gun, commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.|$|E
2500|$|The follow-up, The Mind <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Taste was {{supported}} by a tour from 1989 to 1990. Due to the complex nature of the album's drumming, a second drummer, Martin Atkins, was used. In addition to Atkins, a ten piece touring line-up was formed, consisting of Chris Connelly (keyboards and vocals), Nivek Ogre (vocals and keyboards), Joe Kelly (vocals and backing vocals) and guitarists Mike Scaccia, Terry Roberts, and William Tucker, with Jourgensen, Barker and Rieflin serving as the group's core members. This tour was documented on In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up. Two singles, [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (for which a video was made) and [...] "So What" [...] were released from the album.|$|E

[...] "Oh! Margaret! I cannot leave you! Oh! how happy we have been--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Teddy Cho, one {{prominent}} activist stated that [...] "Nuclear power <b>is</b> only <b>an</b> excuse {{to develop more}} nuclear technology. Even if that's not the case, nuclear energy itself has also proven to be very dangerous to the environment."

6000|$|The attendant, who <b>was</b> shaking like <b>a</b> leaf, obeyed. The station-master {{turned away}} and drew a long breath.

This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> to face without a second's warning. He had not the slightest doubt but {{that the man who}} was seated at the table was dead! ...|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as vice president, Quayle was widely {{ridiculed}} {{in the media and}} by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory ("The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future") or just confused (such as his address to the United Negro College Fund, whose slogan is [...] "A mind <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> to waste," [...] where he said [...] "You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.") ...|$|E
2500|$|I'm 27 {{years old}} today, the entire trip I pondered upon the words [...] "Longing for home <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing,</b> I know". Yes, only now do I know and understand. And this [...] "homesickness" [...] of Božena Němcová, which I never understood, is nothing {{compared}} to my longing for home. I'm willing to suffer through, and do whatever it takes, but only home and home and to honestly work, work for something... How can some speak of beauty, when they've never seen Rešice and the fields from Kordula to Rešice, who never strolled through the warm dirt there, who never felt the warm air and over the grain fields, who never saw our chapel in the milk of white cherries, Husák's garden, which always reminded me of Sholokhov, especially the dirt lumps under the [...] "vortex" [...] and the [...] "Bare Hill" [...] and all the other places on all of which I am. Parts of me are all over the world. In England, little was left of me, maybe more in Scotland... 27 years of life behind me. Death for my homeland. With that I have dealt, and am ready to do what it takes.|$|E

50|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} had opposed airing the documentary, worried that NBC was increasing {{tensions between the}} United States and Russia {{at the height of}} the Cold War. Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother and attorney general, was reported to have commented “That <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> you people did, buying that tunnel.” Concerns about the ethics of NBC's involvement and the safety of the students were also expressed.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the second}} part of the Disarmament Conference {{starting}} in January 1933, Baldwin attempted to see through his hope of air disarmament. However he became alarmed at Britain's lack of defence against air raids and German rearmament, saying it [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing,</b> in fact, the beginning of the end". In April 1933 the Cabinet agreed to follow through with the construction of the Singapore military base.|$|R
5000|$|During their {{conversation}} the Signalman is repeatedly distracted by a ghostly vibration on his signal bell that only he can hear. The Traveller {{remarks on the}} bell and the red light {{at the entrance to}} the tunnel before changing the subject to how an accident in the tunnel must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing.</b> The Signalman, looking slightly wide-eyed at this tells him that <b>a</b> tunnel collision <b>is</b> the [...] "worst to be feared".|$|R

6000|$|The {{old woman}} had more words than {{any in the}} tribe. And her talk <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> to hear. Sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently, and {{sometimes}} {{the shape of her}} guttural cries was the mere phantom of thoughts. But she conveyed to Eudena, nevertheless, much of the things that were yet to come, of the Lion and of the torment he would do her. [...] "And Ugh-lomi! Ha, ha! Ugh-lomi is slain?" ...|$|R
5000|$|During the battle, American {{soldiers}} {{found it}} difficult to distinguish civilians from soldiers. It became common for them to shoot at Okinawan houses, as one infantryman wrote: There was some return fire from a few of the houses, but the others were probably occupied by civilians - and we didn't care. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> not to distinguish between the enemy and women and children. Americans always had great compassion, especially for children. Now we fired indiscriminately.|$|R
25|$|I {{wrote in}} {{detail about the}} Holocaust and said I {{did not want to}} discuss numbers. I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible,</b> unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|R

6000|$|Cyrus {{waited for}} the curtain to rise, feeling as if {{every one of his}} Spring Valley {{neighbours}} must know where he was and revile him for it.

He must see his girl Josie just once; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> that she <b>was</b> <b>an</b> actress, but she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> successful one, nobody could deny that, except fools who yapped in the National Gazette.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{guidelines}} {{followed by}} medieval parents in training {{their children were}} from the Bible. Scolding was considered ineffectual, and cursing <b>a</b> child <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing.</b> In general, the use of corporal punishment <b>was</b> as <b>a</b> disciplinary action taken to shape behavior, not a pervasive dispensing of beatings for no reason. Corporal punishment was undoubtedly the norm. The medieval world <b>was</b> <b>a</b> dangerous place, and it could take harsh measures to prepare a child to live in it. Pain was the medieval way of illustrating that actions had consequences.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, after {{close to}} 20 {{years of working}} together, Woodley and Lane decided to part ways. Woodley stated that the split <b>was</b> due to <b>a</b> desire to pursue new challenges.
