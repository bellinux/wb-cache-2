[...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. [...] "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players." ...|$|E
