25|$|My Father Will <b>Guide</b> <b>Me</b> up a Rope to the Sky is the {{eleventh}} studio album by Swans released on September 23, 2010; {{it was their}} first studio recording in 14 years. Swans founder Michael Gira funded the recording of this album by creating the limited-edition album I Am Not Insane and chose several collaborators from previous Swans line-ups {{as well as his}} side project Angels of Light to record and tour for this album. My Father Will <b>Guide</b> <b>Me</b> up a Rope to the Sky has received positive critical feedback for the return of Swans as well as the rich spiritual themes of the lyrics.|$|E

The first post-reformation Swans album, My Father Will <b>Guide</b> <b>Me</b> Up a Rope to the Sky, was {{released}} on September 23, 2010, and the band simultaneously embarked on an eighteen-month world tour. The band were chosen by Portishead to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror festivals that Portishead curated in July 2011 at London's Alexandra Palace, and, in September 2011, in Asbury Park, New Jersey.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico on November 2, 2009. Filming {{took place in}} several different New Mexico locations, before concluding in Albuquerque in January 2010. A large section of the film was filmed at Los Alamos High School in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Los Alamos County granted a special request from the film's director and producer to name the town in the movie [...] "Los Alamos, New Mexico." [...] The local police department loaned the film crew 1980s style uniforms and patrol cars to use for the film and over 100 local teenagers were cast as extras. Reeves felt that Lindqvist's story was very naturalistic and wanted the film to be shot the same way. After viewing Bright Star, he hired Greig Fraser as his cinematographer because he admired Fraser's work with natural light on the film. Shortly before filming, Reeves sought advice from Steven Spielberg for directing child actors. Spielberg instructed Reeves to have the two leads each keep a diary in character {{with the intention of}} sharing with Reeves what they wrote in it. Reeves stated, [...] "It was all a process of trying to, not only guide them, but in places, trying to let them <b>guide</b> <b>me</b> toward their perspective. That was important." ...|$|E
500|$|Ubaldini {{reported}} Molyneux's {{progress in}} manufacturing the globes to the Duke of Milan. He was in attendance when Molyneux presented {{a pair of}} manuscript globes to Elizabeth I at Greenwich in July 1591. Ubaldini noted that [...] "he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance {{how much of the}} world she could control by means of her naval forces". According to Wallis, the printed globes, which at [...] in diameter were then the largest ever made, were published after some delay in late 1592 or early 1593. Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in Newington Butts to mark the presentation of these globes to the Queen. His son William later reported the Queen's words on accepting the terrestrial globe: [...] "The whole earth, a present for a Prince ..."; and on accepting the celestial globe, she said: [...] "Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God <b>guide</b> <b>me,</b> to Govern my part of the one, that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other." [...] Elizabeth I saw globes and armillary spheres as symbols of her empire and spiritual mission on earth. The royal coat of arms contained in Elizabeth I Privy Seal was emblazoned across North America on the terrestrial globe.|$|E
2500|$|My Father Will <b>Guide</b> <b>Me</b> up a Rope to the Sky {{is rated}} an 83 with [...] "universal acclaim" [...] by Metacritic. The A.V. Club gave the album an A, calling it [...] "a {{leviathan}} of an album" [...] and {{commenting on the}} similarities and differences that this album has with the rest of Swans' catalogue, saying that it [...] "resembles all of Swans' previous work, yet none of it." [...] BBC Music has declared it [...] "a majestic return and, let us hope, a harbinger of more to come." [...] The Big Takeover has remarked that the album [...] "encompasses all of the original band's many moods." [...] In its December issue, The Wire listed My Father Will <b>Guide</b> <b>Me</b> up a Rope to the Sky as the third best album of 2010.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Gira {{hinted at}} the {{prospect}} of resurrecting the Swans project. Later that year, many of the tracks that would appear on My Father Will <b>Guide</b> <b>Me</b> up a Rope to the Sky were released in demo and acoustic form [...] on I Am Not Insane and sold in order to fund the recording process for this album. Gira handmade 1,000 copies of that album to fund the new Swans recordings. In January 2010, Gira amended the band's Facebook and MySpace to read [...] "SWANS ARE NOT DEAD"—an announcement that the band had been reformed as well as a play on words from Swans' live album Swans Are Dead.|$|E

2500|$|Trancentral was {{described}} as [...] "the spiritual home of The KLF". [...] This concept {{is reinforced by the}} [...] "LP Version" [...] of [...] "Last Train to Trancentral", which describes the journey to Trancentral as a spiritual awakening, and the place itself a forum for spiritual realisation. [...] Describing his journey, rapper Ricardo Da Force says [...] "A brand new day is dawning, a light that will anoint me, a sign from the subconscious, an angel sent to <b>guide</b> <b>me,</b> the searchin' will be over, the call will now be gentle...". [...] He also says, [...] "Relax - there's only one place I'm headed now: I'm going into Trancentral where I can, you understand, liberate and free the psyche, balance my mind and my body...". [...] The KLF's later output implied that Trancentral was analogous to [...] "Mu Mu Land" [...] - the Lost Continent of Mu - and that The KLF's journey [...] "home" [...] was ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E

2500|$|For Marvel's first {{television}} series {{set in the}} MCU, the Whedon-created Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., frequent genre television series composer Bear McCreary signed on to compose the score. [...] "The series centers on the behind-the-scenes people, their heroism and their quirks," [...] McCreary explained, [...] "As such, the music I wrote is heroic and, at times, quirky and offbeat." [...] McCreary spoke at length with Whedon [...] "about the challenge of creating a score that is big enough in its orchestral presence that it feels cinematic and feels {{at home in the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also must capture the intimate human characteristics that define this series. In editorial, it became clear that simply tracking in typical big 'superhero movie' music wasn’t going to work. So Joss helped <b>guide</b> <b>me</b> to find a sound that lives a little in both worlds." [...] McCreary worked with several soloists throughout the series, including Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek; vocalist Raya Yarbrough; composer Jeremy Zuckerman playing the gu zheng for [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress"; and cellist Eric Buyers for when [...] "the cellist" [...] character Audrey performs in [...] "The Only Light in the Darkness".|$|E
2500|$|Balachander {{wanted the}} same artistes to reprise their roles on television. Unfortunately, Sivakumar was {{committed}} to a daily soap. Suhasini was willing to play Sindhu but Balachander {{decided to have a}} different face—he felt if Suhasini played Sindhu, viewers would expect Sivakumar to play JKB. [...] "You cannot separate JKB and Sindhu. Sir (Balachander) felt {{if we are going to}} have a different JKB, let's have a different Sindhu too," [...] says Subha. This is when Y. Gee. Mahendra, a well-known theater and film personality was selected to play JKB. [...] "It is a challenge for a comedy artist like me to do a character role like JKB. I am enjoying both the challenge and the role," [...] he said. He, who has acted in more than 300 films, said it is a kind of homecoming for him. [...] "I acted in a Balachander film 26 years ago!". He was not worried about the fact that JKB was once successfully portrayed by Sivakumar. [...] "Had it been done by Sivaji (Sivaji Ganesan), I would not have accepted the role. Only two people inspire me, and they are K. Balachander and Sivaji [...] When I have KB on the sets to <b>guide</b> <b>me,</b> why should I worry? I also have my other guru Sivaji in mind".|$|E
2500|$|On June 28, 2017 a {{deal was}} {{finalized}} for Ortiz's return bout against Mexican boxer Saul Corral (24-9, 15 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round fight {{to take place}} at the Rabobank Theater in Bakersfield, California on July 30 and would headline a Premier Boxing Champions card. Ortiz made a successful comeback with a fourth round stoppage win over Corral. Ortiz stalked Corral from the opening round landing straight lefts and hooks, although Corral fought back, Ortiz did enough to win the early rounds. In round 3, referee Jack Reiss docked a point of Corral after warning him for holding Ortiz's left arm. In round 4, Ortiz landed a left hand that sent Corral down. He beat the count, but Ortiz pounced, forcing the referee to stop the fight after 1 minute and 26 seconds. Ortiz kept his options open when speaking in the post fight, “There are a lot of names out there in the welterweight division. At this point I’m going to let my team <b>guide</b> <b>me,</b> because I’ll always be ready for anybody.” He also praised Corral, “Corral is a great fighter who hits hard and I definitely felt it.Top of the line boxers like myself, we hang in there and we perform {{to the best of our}} abilities. It was my first time back in a while and it’s just the beginning.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to <b>guide</b> <b>me,</b> relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E
