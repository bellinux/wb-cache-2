The reasons for the growing demand for new <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are among others the withdrawals of the old ones due to new, more strict requirements and problems with resistance of harmful organisms against the <b>existing</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances.</b> The paper mentions selected methods used at present by chemical researchers to make their efforts in the process of inventing new molecules to be used in plant protection more efficient and less cost consuming. The requirements which should be fulfilled after {{the development of a new}} <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> to obtain the permission for use in the European Union (so called Annex 1 listing) are presented and discussed as well as the data and formalities demanded to place new plant protection products on the market in one of the member states.

40|$|Plant {{protection}} {{products have}} to be evaluated and authorised in the EU-Member States since 1993 in accordance with Council Directive 91 / 414 /EEC. This Directive formed the framework for a European-wide harmonised regulatory system for the evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products and the <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> in them. A two-stage registration process has been established through the Directive, with the consideration of the acceptability of <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> being done at community level while the authorisation of specific products and uses is dealt with by the individual Member States. Thus, Annex I to the Directive, the list of <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> deemed acceptable and which may be included in pesticide products {{for use in the}} community, is the prime focus of the European regulatory system. The programme for evaluating all of the <b>existing</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> (which were on the market before July 1993) involves several steps and stages, stretching over a period of 15 years.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) centralized regulatory review process. Regulatory review times—including submission and application dates for new <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> (NASs) and <b>existing</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> (EASs) using a standardized template for the period of 2006 to 2010 —were collected directly from the GCC office located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 413 products (96 NASs and 317 EASs) were approved during the period, with an overall significant increase in the EASs (P <. 001). The median approval times increased from 107 calendar days in 2006 to 265 in 2010 (P <. 001). The lowest approval time was for EASs submitted by the Gulf companies (134 days) and the longest for NASs submitted by international companies (346 days) (P <. 001). These data were also analyzed according to therapeutic classes and dosage forms. The results also showed that the lowest number (n 16) approved during the period was in 2010, and this was due to a major regulatory change implementing the International Conference on Harmonisation product stability guideline for the region. The findings indicate that the delay and the wide range in approval times could be reduced by utilizing a standard assessment template for product review and the implementation of a clock stop system for company responses to questions from the GCC central registration committee. Furthermore, using information technology tools would speed up the registration process rather than the manual exchange of product registration files between the executive office and the member states...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the entry}} into force of the Directive 98 / 8 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council {{concerning}} the placing of biocidal products on the market, all <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> in the European market have to be reviewed to ensure that under normal conditions of use {{they can be used}} without unacceptable risk for people, animals or the environment. Thus, in the frame of the review process, the risk assessment of each <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> plays a fundamental role and providing technical guidance to the assessments that must be performed ensures a correct and uniform implementation of the Directive for the different Member States. According to Annex VI of Directive 98 / 8 /EC the risk assessment shall cover the proposed normal use of the biocidal product together with a ‘realistic worst case scenario’. The aim of this Emission Scenario Document (ESD) is to set up methods for the estimation of the emission of disinfectants, used for the disinfection of vehicles used for animal transport, for veterinary hygiene and in hatcheries. 	 The present ESD is intended to be used by Member States as a basis for assessing applications submitted with a view to include <b>existing</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> used in PT 3 in Annex I or IA of Directive 98 / 8 /EC or for assessing applications for product authorisation. It can be a useful tool also for Industry, when assessing requirements for a submission. These Technical Notes for Guidance have been developed in the context of project FKZ 360 04 023 of the German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), who contracted SCC GmbH for a first draft of the document.

In order to reduce the possibility of side effects and to ensure adequate clinical dosage of the formulation, the primarily formulated composition should be optimized. It is also important that the composition should retain its therapeutic effectiveness and safety throughout the shelf-life of the product. This paper focuses on the optimization and stability testing of a parenteral solution containing miconazole and ketoconazole solubilized with a ternary solvent system as model drugs. Optimization of the solvent system was performed based on assessing the risk/benefit ratio of the composition and its properties upon dilution. Stability tests were conducted based on the EMEA (European Medicines Agency) “guideline on stability testing: stability testing of <b>existing</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> and related finished products”. Experiments show that both the amount of co-solvent and surface active agent of the solvent system could substantially be reduced, while still maintaining adequate solubilizing power. It is also shown that the choice of various containers affects the stability of the compositions. It was concluded that by assessing the risk/benefit ratio of solubilizing power versus toxicity, the concentration of excipients could be considerably decreased while still showing a powerful solubilizing effect. It was also shown that a pharmaceutically acceptable shelf-life could be assigned to the composition, indicating good long-term stability...|$|R

40|$|Pepelnica, biljna bolest prouzročena gljivom Microsphaera alphitoides Griff et Maubl. je, uz korove, najvažniji činitelj preživljenja hrastovog pomlatka, a tim i obnove hrastovih šuma. Uporabom istog fungicida ili iste grupe fungicida tijekom godina, broj rezistentnih patotipova gljive stalno se povećava pa dolazi do prestanka djelotvornosti, odnosno pojave rezistentnosti. Izmjenom fungicida pojava rezistentnosti može se odgoditi. Zbog toga se u praksu stalno uvode novi fungicidi, odnosno nove djelatne tvari. U ovom radu prikazani su rezultati ispitivanja novih pripravaka: Artea 330 EC, Impact SC 250, Punch 10 EW i Stroby DF, dok je kao {{standard}} rabljen Anvil 5 SC. Rezultati pokusa ukazuju na visoku djelotvornost fungicida. Najdjelotvorniji je fungicid Impact SC 250 (koeficijent djelotvornosti 93, 2 %). Slabiju, ali još uvijek zadovoljavajuću djelotvornost, osim fungicida Stroby, postižu Punch 10 EW (KD 91, 9 %), Artea 330 EC (KD 91, 28 %) i Anvil 5 SC (KD 90, 57 %). Najvjerojatniji uzroci nedovoljne djelotvornosti fungicida Stroby (KD 62, 80 %) su poddoziranje i činjenica kako je prije primjene pripravka na poniku registrirana zaraza pepelnicom, a za Stroby se navodi kako se puno protektivno fungicidno djelovanje postiže samo ako je pripravak na listu prije početka zaraze, odnosno preventivnom aplikacijom. In changed {{climatic conditions}} weakened trees have greater difficulty withstanding the attack of plant diseases and pests. The plant disease powdery mildew, {{caused by the}} fungus Microsphaera alphitoides, Griff et Maubl., {{is one of the}} essential factors for the survival of oak seedling plants and consequently reforestation of oak forests. Consequently, control of the level of infection by powdery mildew on seedling plants is of great importance. With the application of fungicide, on previously untreated areas, biotypes of the fungus react differently to the fungicide. Regardless of the effectiveness of the fungicide, a single treatment of the recommended doses, i. e. concentrations, can never control all pathotypes of the fungus, and one part always remains vital. With the use of the same fungicide, or the same group of fungicides in subsequent years the number of resistant pathotypes constantly increases. Although today there are numerous fungicides with excellent effectiveness against oak powdery mildew, new <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> and combinations of <b>existing</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are further tested and introduced into practice in view of broadening their spectrum and/or synergetic effect. This paper presents the results of testing new preparations: Artea 330 EC, Impact SC 250, Punch 10 EW and Stroby DF, with Anvil 5 SC used as a standard. Experiment results indicate the high effectiveness of fungicides. The most effective fungicide was Impact SC 250 (Coefficient of Effectiveness: 93. 2 %), Punch 10 EW (91. 9 %), Artea 330 EC (91. 28 %) and Anvil 5 SC (90. 57 %). The fungicide Stroby achieved much poorer success (K. D. 62. 80 %) most probably due to insufficient dosing, as the lowest recommended dose was used, so that the cost per hectare can be compared with the other tested fungicides. Another reason is the fact that prior to application of the preparation on the saplings, powdery mildew had been registered. Namely, in the case of Stroby it is stated that full protective effect is achieved only if the preparation is on the leaf before the beginning of infection, i. e. by preventive application...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} in both {{developed and developing}} countries share the responsibility of ensuring the access of safe and effective medicines to patients however their structures, strategies, and practices vary significantly. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) regulatory systems (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen) in order to develop a harmonised strategy. A questionnaire was designed and completed by the seven GCC authorities to provide details of their review process and the quality measures used to improve their assessment procedures. The Kuwait Drug and Food Control (KDFC) authority was assessed to identify areas for improvement in the system. Metrics for medicines approved for the private and government sectors were collected together with their patients' access time using data obtained from the authority's archives. Another questionnaire was developed to assess and compare the strategic planning processes of the regulatory {{authorities in}} the seven Gulf States. Both questionnaires were tested for applicability and practicality in the GCC region and a pilot study was conducted with two selected authorities, after which they were distributed for completion by senior managers in each of the seven GCC authorities. The results of the Kuwaiti regulatory system showed a significant decline (p 0. 05). Further analysis showed a significant decline (p < 0. 001) in the patients' access time for New <b>Active</b> <b>Substances</b> (NASs) (26 to 11 months) and <b>Existing</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Substances</b> (EASs) (28 to 14 months) due to the enhanced political conditions and the improved performance of the authority. Furthermore, there was a significant decline in the registration time for government health supply (GHS) medicines from 10 to 7 months (p < 0. 05) and for private sector medicines from 28 to 14 months (p < 0. 001) over the same period. The comparative study of the seven Gulf States showed that Kuwait and Yemen carry out a verification assessment for all applications. Bahrain and Oman conduct an abridged review while Saudi Arabia and UAE perform a full review for the majority of their applications. Furthermore, the speed of the approval process in the GCC States depends on the types of products being registered (NASs or EASs), the quality of the submitted data, the level of interaction between the sponsor and the authority and whether parts of the review process are carried out in parallel or sequentially. Several GCC authorities lack the essential measures for conducting a quality review process such as Good Review Practice, assessment templates, Standard Operating Procedures and peer reviews. Finally, comparisons of the GCC strategic planning processes showed that the seven Gulf States shared common strategic parameters that can form a harmonised strategy, namely, the guidelines, SOPs, resources and Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS). It is hoped that the findings of this study will help the GCC authorities to improve approval time for the registration of new medicines by fully engaging in the quality review practices. Such improvements will fulfil the GCC central drug registration goals and encourage the pharmaceutical industry to use the GCC centralised system which is a step towards successful harmonisation of the regional regulatory systems...|$|R
50|$|Bone cement {{has proven}} {{particularly}} useful because specific <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> e.g. antibiotics, {{can be added}} to the powder component. The <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection. The antibiotics act against bacteria precisely at the site where they are required in the open wound without subjecting the body in general to unnecessarily high antibiotic levels. This makes bone cement a modern drug delivery system that delivers the required drugs directly to the surgical site. The important factor is not how much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is in the cement matrix but how much of the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is actually released locally. Too much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the bone cement would actually be detrimental, because the mechanical stability of the fixed prosthesis is weakened by a high proportion of <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the cement.

50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} specific emission scenario documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an IT tool supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the Technical Guidance Document for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is allowed onto the list of approved <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> its specifications become a reference source of that <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> (so called 'reference active substance').

What are the environmental behaviours and ecotoxicological effects of these biocides? How can a prioritization be achieved? Which <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> should be suggested for further assessments? [...]...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} Puncturevine (Tribulus terrestris) as for planting, content substances, pharmacological use and with influences of planting technology or elicitors upon the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> contents. Saponines, flavonoids, and phytosterols {{are the main}} <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> of Puncturevine. The saponines act as aphrodisiacs, the flavonoids treat with heart diseases and the phytosterols decrease the cholesterol concentration in blood plasma. The <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> contents depend on the planting and elicitor influences. The practical part {{is focused on the}} matters of free soil growing and economy of planting the herb...|$|R
30|$|Almost 100 <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are {{potential}} candidates for substitution, which is roughly {{a quarter of}} all approved <b>active</b> <b>substances.</b> This derives from an examination of the information provided in the FCEC report to the Commission [[11]], as detailed in the ‘Methods’ section. The number refers to the list of approved <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> laid down in the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540 / 2011 [[18]], as amended until 31 January 2013. Where the legal definition of an approved <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> includes different varieties of a parent compound or where the approval applies to a defined group of compounds, these were counted as a single entity. Earlier impact studies expected CFS proportions between 15 % and 25 % [[16],[17]]. Our findings show that these prognoses indicated the dimension of the problem quite accurately.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a composition {{consisting of a}} dendrimer provided with blocking agents and an <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> occluded in the dendrimer. According to the invention a blocking agent is a compound which is sterically of sufficient size, which readily enters into a chemical bond with the terminal groups of a dendrimer and which can also be split off from the dendrimer or be modified without thereby affecting the chemical structure of the dendrimer and the <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b> The blocking agent can be provided with protective groups. Such conjugates have the advantage that the time at which the releasing of the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> starts, can be controlled. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of such a composition and to a process for the controlled release of the <b>active</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a dendrimer composition {{in which an}} effective number of the terminal functionalities are provided with blocking agents, {{and at least one}} <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> species is occluded in the dendrimer. A blocking agent is a sufficiently sterically sized compound which readily enters into a chemical bond with a terminal group of a dendrimer but which can also be split off from the dendrimer or can be modified without affecting the chemical structure of the dendrimer and the occluded <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b> The blocking agent can also be provided with a protecting group. The time and duration over which an <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is released can be controlled.
