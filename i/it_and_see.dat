A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves. The top of the egg was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason {{the image of a}} hen's egg was used on the poster, and has become emblematic of the franchise as a whole—as opposed to the Alien egg that appears in the finished film.|$|E

The expedition failed dismally: within a few months of reaching the river, many of the party were dead, including Tuckey and the expedition botanist Christen Smith (also known as Christian Smith and Chetian Smith). The botanical assistant, David Lockhart, survived, and eventually returned a collection of around 600 plant species to Joseph Banks. Banks turned the collection over to Brown to arrange <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what might be published based on it.|$|E

500|$|On 27 October they {{released}} a music video for [...] "Evil Twin" [...] on YouTube, the b-side {{to their new}} single [...] "Suck It and See". They performed the song on The Graham Norton Show on 28 October. The 4th single from Suck <b>It</b> <b>and</b> <b>See,</b> [...] "Black Treacle" [...] was released on 23 January 2012. The video for the single was released on YouTube on 5 January 2012. This video continued the theme from the previous single, [...] "Suck It and See" [...] and [...] "Evil Twin".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Sound City Studios in Los Angeles in 2010 and 2011. On 4 March 2011, the band premièred on its website a new track called [...] "Brick by Brick" [...] with lead vocals by Matt Helders. Helders explained {{that this is not}} a single, just a tease of what is coming and that is definitely going to be in the fourth album. On 10 March 2011 the band revealed the album is to be called Suck <b>It</b> <b>and</b> <b>See</b> and was released on 6 June 2011.|$|E
500|$|On 26 February 2012, {{the band}} {{released}} {{a brand new}} song titled [...] "R U Mine?" [...] on their YouTube channel. On 4 March, it went to No.23 on the UK Singles Chart on downloads alone. On 21 April, the song was released as a single, with the track [...] "Electricity" [...] as a B-side, released additionally for the Record Store Day. The song marked a direct shift in musical direction in comparison to their previous album, Suck <b>It</b> <b>and</b> <b>See,</b> by incorporating a heavy use of falsetto and hip hop beats, and eventually became the inspiration for AM.|$|E

They also headlined Oxegen 2011, Super Bock Super Rock 2011, V Festival 2011, Rock Werchter. and T in The Park.

500|$|Their fourth album Suck <b>It</b> <b>and</b> <b>See</b> {{sees the}} band {{exploring}} styles, mixing them with newfound maturity. Turner said: [...] "I think {{the new album}} is a balance between our first three. There's nothing about taxi ranks or anything like that, but there's {{a bit of the}} standpoint I had on those early songs and the sense of humour, but also there's a bit of the 'Humbug' stuff which is kind of off in the corners." [...] Critics noted an influence from British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as The Smiths, and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound. Turner wrote much of the album in his apartment on an acoustic guitar, further influencing the ballad-style prevalent on the album.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the band's {{second album}} started {{immediately}} after touring their self-titled debut. Guitarist Munky described {{the writing process}} as, [...] "we didn't write nothin' for two years then we had creativity build up, like blue balls of creativity." [...] Doug Small, author of The Story of Korn (...) , said that [...] "the band's songwriting method — a sort of collective building process wherein four instrumentalists, with the input of Jonathan , develop each other's ideas until they've created a monster — is truly a group effort." [...] The album's lyrics — {{for the most part}} — were primarily written by lead singer Jonathan Davis. Drummer David Silveria told Modern Drummer, [...] "somebody will start playing something {{and the rest of us}} will work around <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> where it goes." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{announced}} [...] "The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala" [...] as {{the second}} single to be taken from Suck <b>It</b> <b>and</b> <b>See.</b> Most of the stock was burned because of the London riots. A limited edition 7" [...] Vinyl of the single was then released over the band's website on 14 August. The song only managed to chart in the top 200 in the UK, however reaching higher in Belgium at No.25. In September 2011 the band released a music video for the song [...] "Suck It and See" [...] featuring drummer Matt Helders, and announced they would be releasing it as a single on 31 October 2011. In July 2011, the band released a live EP over iTunes with 6 live recordings from the iTunes Festival in London.|$|E

The band allowed fans {{to listen to the}} entire album on their website before deciding about whether to purchase it or not. Suck <b>It</b> <b>and</b> <b>See</b> was then released on 6 June 2011, and went straight to No.1 in the album charts.

500|$|Tomb Raider III was {{designed}} {{more in line}} with the puzzle-solving gameplay of the original Tomb Raider as opposed to the more shooting-oriented style of Tomb Raider II. The levels were designed to be less linear than before with the goal of giving players multiple routes to complete each one. The game's five locations were decided upon before the plot was conceived. According to producer Mike Schmitt, the team opted to [...] "just take a globe, spin <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> where it lands, and whether it's an interesting location or not." [...] Once the setting had been decided upon, a storyline linking all the locations was written. Lara's range of abilities was expanded with moves such as the duck, crawl, dash, and [...] "monkey swing". The 1995 film Desperado was an influence on Lara's gun play and new moves. Developers initially considered the possibility of implementing hand-to-hand combat, but the idea was rejected because it would have required giving enemies new combat animations.|$|E

[...] On January 14, 2016, Docter stated that a sequel is possible, and that he and Pixar will explore ideas, saying: [...] "We'll see if anything turns up. To me it's not as simple as: 'We liked it, so let's make another one.' What happens is you design these characters not so much looks-wise but as they are as characters and people for a story. So we'll explore <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what happens." [...] In a July 2016 interview, Pixar president Jim Morris said that while demand for a sequel is high, the company has committed its resources to several original movie concepts from June 7, 2019 onward, and that no sequels to any of Pixar's other films including Inside Out were being contemplated at this time.|$|E

He helped his team progress through the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup, and according to Reuters' correspondent, [...] "capped a brilliant individual performance with two goals" [...] as well as providing the cross for Milan Purović as Red Star beat Roma 3–1 in the third match of the group stage. His first goal, a header, appeared to have been scored from an offside position, but for the second, in the 86th minute, he dispossessed Philippe Mexès, evaded two more opponents, and bent the ball into the top corner from [...] with his weaker left foot. He said afterwards, [...] "I've never scored a goal like that in my entire career. I was going to pass the ball but there was no one ahead of me so I just decided to go for <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what happens". The win left Red Star needing to win their last group match to stand a chance of qualifying for the knockout rounds, but they failed to do so.|$|E
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> film clips, but you'd never experience it.

500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] {{took place in}} summer and autumn of 2008. After Rowland heard the instrumental of [...] "When Love Takes Over"—a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion—she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (The Nervo Twins). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go {{on to say that}} [...] "Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how it turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit." [...] The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday.|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know it sounds a bit mad now, but you'll see <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E
