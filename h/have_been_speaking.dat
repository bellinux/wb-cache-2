25|$|It {{is certain}} that the {{combinations}} which present themselves to the mind {{in a kind of}} sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed {{as a result of the}} automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>speaking</b> of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.|$|E

2500|$|It {{seems to}} have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who, in the 12th century, {{explicitly}} raised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless. It is doubtful, however, whether he was using the term [...] "conception" [...] in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>speaking</b> of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: [...] "How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (libido)?" [...] and stronger expressions follow, showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child.|$|E
