40|$|The damping {{mechanism}} of the isoscalar monopole resonance of the <b>hot</b> <b>nucleus</b> 208 Pb is studied microscopically {{on the basis of}} linear response theory. The width Γ of the resonance can be predicted unambiguously, if appropriate values are taken for the damping widths Γsp of single particle motions. Calculations have been done up to the temperature T of 12 MeV, within which 208 Pb can be stable in the thermal HF calculation with Skyrme interactions. The width increases with T in the collision-less region at low temperature. It reaches the maximal value at the critical temperature Tc of around 10 MeV, and then decreases in the collision-dominant region at high temperature. Experimentally, it is difficult to get such a <b>hot</b> <b>nucleus</b> 208 Pb because of larger probability of incomplete fusion or nonequilibrium processes at higher energy heavy-ion collision.

40|$|In {{the domain}} of Fermi energy, the <b>hot</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{temperature}} can be determined by using the energy spectra of evaporated light charged particles. But this method of measurement is not without difficulties both theoretical and experimental. The presented study aims to disentangle the respective influences of different factors {{on the quality of}} this measurement : the physics, the detection (a 4 ? detector array as INDRA) and the experimental procedure. This analysis demonstrates the possibility of determining from an energy spectrum, with an accuracy of about 10 %, the true apparent temperature felt by a given type of particle emitted by a <b>hot</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Three conditions are however necessary : have a perfect detector of particles, an important statistics and very few secondary emissions. According to the GEMINI event generator, for hot nuclei of intermediate mass, only deuterons and tritons could fill these conditions. This temperature can allow to trace back to the initial temperature by using an appropriate method. This determination may be better than 15 %. With a real experimental device, an insufficient angular resolution and topological distortions caused by the detection can damage spectra to the point to make very difficult a correct determination of the apparent temperature.

A recent experimental attempt by the ALADIN group [6] to deduce an equation of state, which relates the excitation energy of a <b>hot</b> <b>nucleus</b> to its temperature, has stimulated both, theoretical and experimental efforts in this field [7 [...] 13]. In the experiment excited projectile spectators were investigated in Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of E=A = 600 MeV. While the equation of state refers to a stationary system where liquid and vapour (evaporated nucleons) are in equilibrium, the experiment deals with an expanding source.
