40|$|Abstract — A <b>digital</b> <b>identification</b> filter {{interacts with}} an output {{reference}} model signal {{known as a}} black-box output system. The identification technique commonly needs the transition and gain matrixes. Both estimation cases are based on mean square criterion obtaining of the minimum output error as the best estimation filtering. The evolution system represents adaptive properties that the identification mechanism includes considering the fuzzy logic strategies affecting in probability sense the evolution identification filter. The fuzzy estimation filter allows in two forms describing the transition and the gain matrixes applying actions that affect the identification structure. Basically, the adaptive criterion conforming the inference mechanisms set, the Knowledge and Rule bases, selecting the optimal coefficients in distribution form. This paper describes the fuzzy strategies applied to the Kalman filter transition function, and gain matrixes. The simulation results were developed using Matlab ©.

40|$|The {{question}} of how we can live together with difference is more urgent than ever, now {{that more than half}} of the world’s population live in cities. For example, the majority of London’s inhabitants are ethnic minorities. Following Massey (2005), city dwellers negotiate a situation of intense “throwntogetherness,” as they live in the proximity of ethnic, racial, and religious others. Shifting the dominant focus of media and migration scholarship from transnational communication toward local everyday practices, this article develops the notion of digital throwntogetherness to chart relationships between geographically situated <b>digital</b> <b>identifications</b> and the urban politics of cultural difference and encounter. The argument draws from in-depth interviews with 38 young people living in Haringey, one of the most diverse areas in London, and builds on digital methods for network visualizations.

40|$|Identifier {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{elements}} in identifying an object in digital environment. Digital identifier systems were developed followed by a lot of problems such as violation of persistency and uniqueness of physical identifiers and URL in digital environment. These identifiers try to guarantee uniqueness and persistency of hostnames by using indirect names for Domain Name System (DNS). The main objective of this research is to identify qualified digital identifier system among other systems. To achieve the research objective, researchers have considered two major steps: first, identifying main criteria for distinguishing digital identifier based on literature review and focus group interview; and second, performing a comparative evaluation on common identifier systems in the world. Findings of first step demonstrated seven main criteria in three domains for distinguishing digital identifier systems: identifier uniqueness and persistency in the identifier features domain, <b>digital</b> <b>identification,</b> <b>digital</b> uniqueness, digital persistency and digital actionability in the digital coverage domain, and globality in the comprehensiveness of scope domain. In the second step, results of the comparative evaluation on common identifier systems indicated that six identifier systems, included, DOI, Handle, UCI, URN, ARK and PURL, are appropriate choices for using as a digital identifier system. Also, according to these results, three identification systems Including NBN, MARIAM and ISNI were identified as suitable choices for <b>digital</b> <b>identification</b> in certain specialized fields.

40|$|Identification {{of organisms}} is {{traditionally}} {{based on the}} use of "classic" identification keys, normally printed on paper. These keys have several drawbacks: they are mainly based on the systematics, requiring identification of orders, families and genera at first; they are written by experts for other experts, in a specific scientific jargon; they have a "frozen" structure (sequence of theses/antitheses); once published, they cannot be changed or updated without printing a new edition. Due to the use of computers, it is now possible to build new <b>digital</b> <b>identification</b> tools, which: 1) can be produced automatically, if the characters are stored in a database; 2) can be freed from the traditional systematics, giving priority to easy-to-observe characters, incl. those usually uncommon to the classical keys, such as ecology and distribution; 3) can be updated in real time once published on-line; 4) can be available on different media, and on mobile devices. An important feature of these new digital tools is their "collaborative" nature. They can be enriched by the contribution of several researchers, which can cooperate while maintaining rights and property of the resources and data they contribute to the system.
