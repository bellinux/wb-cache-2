60|$|To {{what end}} is the {{ultimate}} appeal in judicature lodged in this kingdom, if men may be disabled from following their suits here, and may be taxed into an absolute denied of justice? You observe, my dear Sir, that I do not assert that in all cases two shillings will necessarily cut off this means of correcting legislative and judicial mistakes, and thus amount to a <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> I might, indeed, state cases in which this very quantum of tax would be fully sufficient to defeat this right. But I argue not on the case, but on the principle, and I am sure the principle implies it. They who may restrain may prohibit; they who may impose two shillings may impose ten shillings in the pound; and those who may condition the tax to six months' annual absence may carry that condition to six weeks, or even to six days, and thereby totally defeat the wise means which have been provided for extensive and impartial justice, and for orderly, well-poised, and well-connected government.|$|E

Few Englishmen or Americans will deny that the source of government is the consent of the governed, or that every nation has the right to govern itself according to its will. When the silent consent is changed to fierce remonstrance, revolution is impending. The right of revolution is indisputable. It is written on the whole record of our race, British and American history is made up of rebellion and revolution. Hampden, Pym, and Oliver Cromwell; Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, all were rebels." [...] Then comes the question whether South Carolina and the Gulf States had so suffered as to make rebellion on their behalf justifiable or reasonable; or if not, what cause had been strong enough to produce in them so strong a desire for secession, a desire which has existed for fully half the term through which the United States has existed as a nation, and so firm a resolve to rush into rebellion with the object of accomplishing that which they deemed not to be accomplished on other terms? ...|$|E
60|$|Your legal pursuits will {{naturally}} {{give you an}} interest in the subject of the state of justice {{in this part of the}} world. A correspondence like mine would not admit of any very profound analysis of the subject, did I possess the necessary learning, which I do not, but I may present a few general facts and notions, that will give you some idea of the state of this important feature of society. The forms and modes of English jurisprudence are so much like our own, as to create the impression that the administration of justice is equally free from venality and favour. As a whole and when the points at issue reach the higher functionaries of the law, I should think this opinion true; but, taking those facts that appear in the daily prints, through the police reports and in the form of personal narratives, as guides, I should think that there is much more oppression, many more abuses, and far more outrages on the intention of the law, in the purlieus of the courts in England, through the agency of subordinates, than with us. The delays and charges of a suit in chancery almost amount to a <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice.</b> Quite lately, I saw a statement, which went to show that a legacy to a charity of about 1000l., with the interest of some fourteen years, had been consumed in this court, with the exception of rather more than 100l. This is an intolerable state of things, and goes to prove, I think, that, in some of its features at least, English jurisprudence is behind that of every other free country.|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of law, beside the problem {{regarding}} the solution of legal problems, "quid juris", {{there is also the}} question, intrinsically connected with it, concerning the "quid jus', or the determination of its concept. We may, in this regard, identifying two opposing positions – ethic legalism and sophistic rhetoric - where difficulties arise in four ways: the criterion of legality (arbitrary or absent), the relationship between the parties and the judge (silence or Babel) the basis of court decision (the authority or the passion), the various <b>denials</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> (crystallized in the rule or in the claims of the parties). Similarly, you can find a perspective - the dialectic vision of Right - in which the theoretical and methodological approach are combined, so the legality is based on reason, the relationship between the parties is based on a real dialogue footprint, the legal decision on reason and Justice on the order of nature...|$|R

6000|$|The Emperor's Birthday. It is possible, {{and it is}} alleged, {{that the}} Germans entered into the conference with hope. But it is certain they were {{resolved}} to remain prepared for either fate. And I take the liberty of believing that Laupepa was not forgiven his duplicity; that, during this interval, he stood marked like a tree for felling; and that his conduct was daily scrutinised for further pretexts of offence. On {{the evening of the}} Emperor's birthday, March 22nd, 1887, certain Germans were congregated in a public bar. The season and the place considered, it is scarce cynical to assume they had been drinking; nor, so much being granted, can it be thought exorbitant to suppose them possibly in fault for the squabble that took place. A squabble, I say; but I am willing to call it a riot. And this was the new fault of Laupepa; this it is that was described by a German commodore as [...] "the trampling upon by Malietoa of the German Emperor." [...] I pass the rhetoric by to examine the point of liability. Four natives were brought to trial for this horrid fact: not before a native judge, but before the German magistrate of the tripartite municipality of Apia. One was acquitted, one condemned for theft, and two for assault. On appeal, not to Malietoa, but to the three consuls, the case was by a majority of two to one returned to the magistrate and (as far as I can learn) was then allowed to drop. Consul Becker himself laid the chief blame on one of the policemen of the municipality, a half- white of the name of Scanlon. Him he sought to have discharged, but was again baffled by his brother consuls. Where, in all this, are we to find a corner of responsibility for the king of Samoa? Scanlon, the alleged author of the outrage, was a half-white; as Becker was to learn to his cost, he claimed to be an American subject; and he was not even in the king's employment. Apia, the scene of the outrage, was outside the king's jurisdiction by treaty; by the choice of Germany, he was not so much as allowed to fly his flag there. And the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> (if justice were denied) rested with the consuls of Britain and the States.|$|E
60|$|THOSE {{who believe}} that our social {{condition}} approaches perfection, will think the above word harsh and exaggerated, {{but it seems to}} me the only word that can be truly applied to us. We are the richest country in the world, and yet cue-twentieth of our population are parish paupers, and one-thirtieth known criminals. Add to these, the criminals who escape detection; and the poor who live mainly on private charity, (which, according to Dr. Hawkesley, expends seven millions sterling annually is London alone,) and we may be sure that more than ONE-TENTH of our population are actually Paupers and Criminals. Both these classes we keep idle or at unproductive labour, and each criminal costs us annually in our prisons more than the wages of an honest agricultural labourer. We allow over a hundred thousand persons known to have no means of subsistence but by crime, to remain at large and prey upon the community, and many thousand children to grow up before our eyes in ignorance and vice, to supply trained criminals for the next generation. This, in a country which boasts of its rapid increase in wealth, of its enormous commerce and gigantic manufactures, of its mechanical skill and scientific knowledge, of its high civilization and its pure Christianity,--I can but term a state of social barbarism. We also boast of our love of justice, and that the law protects rich and poor alike, yet we retain money fines as a punishment, and make the very first steps to obtain justice a matter of expense--in both cases a barbarous injustice, or <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> to the poor. Again, our laws render it possible, that, by mere neglect of a legal form, and contrary to his own wish and intention, a man's property may all go to a stranger, and his own children be left destitute. Such cases have happened through the operation of the laws of inheritance of landed property; and that such unnatural injustice is possible among us, shows that we are in a state of social barbarism. One more example to justify my use of the term, and I have done. We permit absolute possession of the soil of our country, with no legal rights of existence on the soil, to the vast majority who do not possess it. A great landholder may legally convert his whole property into a forest or a hunting-ground, and expel every human being who has hitherto lived upon it. In a thickly-populated country like England, where every acre has its owner and its occupier, this is a power of legally destroying his fellow-creatures; and that such a power should exist, and be exercised by individuals, in however small a degree, indicates that, as regards true social science, we are still in a state of barbarism.|$|E

40|$|Extraterritoriality at the ECtHR {{appears to}} create a paradox. On the one hand, it is limited in space, time, purpose and remedies, through its state membership, {{individual}} application process, {{the terms of the}} ECHR, and restricted enforcement and influence on general international policy. On the other, it appears to be an indispensable refuge for individuals who are victim to the most flagrant <b>denials</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> happening on a global scale. The ECtHR finds itself an avenue for redress in historical events of global significance such as the NATO bombing and UN administration of Kosovo, the US-UK occupation in Iraq, extraordinary rendition procedures and the interception of migrant boats at sea. This thesis embraces the paradox of extraterritoriality at the ECtHR. Putting forward a normative framework, the thesis clarifies the nature of extraterritoriality at the ECtHR and investigates {{the extent to which the}} ECtHR adopts a single normative frame. Existing theories fail to capture the nature of extraterritoriality in the ECtHR’s operation. This thesis offers a global constitutionalist approach to deduce a model for extraterritoriality. Using a normative global constitutionalist frame, in particular democratic accountability and the rule of law, the thesis examines the extent to which the ECtHR adopts such an approach. Translating the requirements of normative global constitutionalism into doctrinal indicators, it examines whether the ECtHR operates within a global constitutionalist frame in extraterritoriality decisions. Alongside this examination, the thesis queries the function and purpose of extraterritoriality and its relationship with other international legal concepts. It questions models that rely on state jurisdiction and attribution to determine their extraterritorial reach, exposing extraterritoriality as performing a separate function. It ultimately unravels the paradox of extraterritoriality through a global constitutionalist explanation...|$|R
