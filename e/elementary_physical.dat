In his book Infinite in All Directions he writes about three levels of mind: [...] "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level {{is the level of}} <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is [...] constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. [...] The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. [...] t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" [...] (p.297).|$|E
6000|$|In {{the third}} edition of Kitto's [...] "Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature" [...] (1876), the article [...] "Deluge," [...] written by my friend, the present {{distinguished}} {{head of the}} Geological Survey of Great Britain, extinguishes the universality doctrine as thoroughly {{as might be expected}} from its authorship; and, since the writer of the article [...] "Noah" [...] refers his readers to that entitled [...] "Deluge," [...] it is to be supposed, notwithstanding his generally orthodox tone, that he does not dissent from its conclusions. Again, the writers in Herzog's [...] "Real-Encyclopadie" [...] (Bd. X. 1882) and in Riehm's [...] "Handworterbuch" [...] (1884)--both works with a conservative leaning--are on the same side; and Diestel, [8] in his full discussion of the subject, remorselessly rejects the universality doctrine. Even that staunch opponent of scientific rationalism--may I say rationality?--Zockler [9] flinches from a distinct defence of the thesis, any opposition to which, well within my recollection, was howled down by the orthodox as mere [...] "infidelity." [...] All that, in his sore straits, Dr. Zockler is able to do, is to pronounce a faint commendation upon a particularly absurd attempt at reconciliation, which would make out the Noachian Deluge to be a catastrophe which occurred {{at the end of the}} Glacial Epoch. This hypothesis involves only the trifle of a physical revolution of which geology knows nothing; and which, if it secured the accuracy of the Pentateuchal writer about the fact of the Deluge, would leave the details of his account as irreconcilable with the truths of <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> science as ever. Thus I may be permitted to spare myself and my readers the weariness of a recapitulation of the overwhelming arguments against the universality of the Deluge, which they will now find for themselves stated, as fully and forcibly as could be wished, by Anglican and other theologians, whose orthodoxy and conservative tendencies have, hitherto, been above suspicion. Yet many fully admit (and, indeed, nothing can be plainer) that, as a matter of fact, the whole earth known to him was inundated; nor is it less obvious that unless all mankind, with the exception of Noah and his family, were actually destroyed, the references to the Flood in the New Testament are unintelligible.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2012, Albert {{published}} an extremely negative review of Lawrence Krauss' book A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing in the New York Times book review. Krauss, a well-known cosmologist and popular science writer, claimed that his book counters religion and philosophy, {{and the book}} was cited by Richard Dawkins as comparable to Darwin’s Origin of Species, {{on the grounds that}} it upends the “last trump card of the theologian.” In his review, Albert lamented the way in which books like Krauss' forward critiques of religion that are [...] "pale, small, silly, nerdy”, and expresses how [...] "the whole business of approaching the struggle with religion as if it were a card game, or a horse race, or some kind of battle of wits, just feels all wrong." [...] Disagreeing with the central thesis of Krauss' book, Albert wrote: The particular, eternally persisting, <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> stuff of the world, according to the standard presentations of relativistic quantum field theories, consists (unsurprisingly) of relativistic quantum fields... they have nothing whatsoever to say on the subject of where those fields came from, or of why the world should have consisted of the particular kinds of fields it does, or of why it should have consisted of fields at all, or of why there should have been a world in the first place. Period. Case closed. End of story. Krauss reacted vehemently and responded in an interview published in The Atlantic calling Albert “moronic” and dismissing the philosophy of science as worthless. In March 2013, The New York Times reported that Albert, who had previously been invited to speak at the Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate at the American Museum of Natural History, was later disinvited. Albert claimed [...] "It sparked a suspicion that Krauss must have demanded that I not be invited. But of course I’ve got no proof." ...|$|E

40|$|So-called "endurance running" is unpopular in the <b>elementary</b> school <b>physical</b> educationprogram. One of {{the major}} reasons it is disliked by {{students}} may be the physical pain it causes. Another possible reason is the misuse of the term "endurance running" when referring to long distance running during physical education classes or school events. To find out if "endurance running" was indeed misinterpreted, we distributed a questionnaire to school children and their teachers. The results of the questionnaires revealed that both groups view "endurance running" as competitive. Through case study interviews with several heads of physical education departments, we discovered that they also misinterpretrunning a few kilometers as being equivalent to running a marathon.

40|$|An {{elementary}} {{classroom teacher}} (ECT) has a busy day. The teachers teach their class, prepare class materials, and may supervise the lunchroom or the playground at recess time (Daily Physical Activity in School, 2005), attend meetings {{with parents and}} perform {{a number of other}} responsibilities.

This study investigated how <b>elementary</b> <b>physical</b> education can assist the ECT in their planning time. In this study 219 ECT from three states and 18 different schools participated in this study.

The results indicated that students' situational interest dropped dramatically over two semesters, but their PA intensity increased over time.

The findings suggest that exergames may be a possible means to enhance PA in PE. However, whether exergaming is a sustainable way to motivate children in PA is questionable...|$|R
