5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, with the Soviets {{advancing}} {{ever closer to}} the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife.</b> Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Goebbels and Bormann {{were two of the}} witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} at the now-named Apostolic Faith Mission housed an office and rooms for several {{residents}} including Seymour and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Jennie. It also had a large prayer room to handle the overflow from the altar services below. The prayer room was furnished with chairs and benches made from California Redwood planks, laid end to end on backless chairs.|$|E
5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun {{in a small}} civil {{ceremony}} in the Führerbunker. After a wedding breakfast with <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Hitler dictated his will to his secretary Traudl Junge. The event was witnessed and documents signed by Krebs, Burgdorf, Goebbels, and Bormann. Later that afternoon, Hitler was informed of the execution of Mussolini, which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.|$|E
50|$|John Edward Jones married Kathleen Lennard in 1926, adding <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> surname to <b>his</b> own {{to become}} Lennard-Jones. They had two children, John and Mary.|$|R
50|$|After {{his first}} wife died, in 1781, Foster Barham {{moved away from the}} Moravians. He married again, in a Church of England {{ceremony}} in 1785; and moved to <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> home, Hardwick Hall in Shropshire.|$|R
5|$|After World War I, Harrison {{traveled}} the Middle East performing medical duties such as treating prostitutes afflicted with venereal disease in Constantinople and operating an X-ray facility in Lod, Israel. Although still not legally divorced {{from his first}} two wives, Harrison married Filomena Abela, a Maltese woman at Alexandria in 1920. However, the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life. Harrison and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> train was ambushed by a band of Syrians disillusioned {{with a group of}} politicians. The quick thinking of the recently thrice-married physician prevented <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> broken leg from developing into gangrene.|$|R
5|$|After their wedding, {{the couple}} {{returned}} to Provo, Utah, where Kinne had been attending college, {{but at the}} end of the fall semester, Kinne again put his studies on hold. He and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> returned to Independence, where both took jobs—Sharon, babysitting and tending shops, and James as an electrical engineer at Bendix Aviation. Although Sharon claimed to have miscarried the child that had brought about their marriage, she soon became pregnant again. In the fall of 1957, she gave birth to a girl they named Danna.|$|E
5|$|Testimony was {{presented}} that in October 2002, Mme M'Barek had convinced the peer {{that she was}} pregnant with his child, and as a result, Shaftesbury married her on 5 November 2002. Shaftesbury made out a new will leaving <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> properties in Ireland and France. Two years later, with no child forthcoming, he began looking elsewhere for affection. When Shaftesbury initiated divorce proceedings, his wife feared losing her valuable inheritance and began to take steps to secure her financial future.|$|E
5|$|To win Keating {{a prestigious}} {{commission}} offered by Gail Wynand, {{the owner and}} editor-in-chief of the Banner, Dominique agrees to sleep with Wynand. Wynand is so strongly attracted to Dominique that he pays Keating to divorce her, after which Wynand and Dominique are married. Wanting to build a home for himself and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Wynand discovers that Roark designed every building he likes and so hires him. Roark and Wynand become close friends; Wynand is unaware of Roark's past relationship with Dominique.|$|E
50|$|Helen {{still holds}} a flame for James, {{and to his}} infuriation {{frequently}} visits to meddle in his affairs and generally check up on him. Her Italian husband Frank (Stephen Frost) is becoming equally annoyed with <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> ways.|$|R
50|$|William Sykes {{was just}} 23 when, against {{the advice of}} his father he married and then with his own and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> savings {{purchased}} a saddler business in Horbury, England, in about 1870. He married Ethel Marshall, sister of Herbert Marshall and Alice Whitmarsh.|$|R
5000|$|Now {{living in}} Massachusetts, in June 1860 the Count Joannes {{filed a lawsuit}} for libel over {{a letter from a}} clergyman {{attempting}} to dissuade a woman from marrying him. He argued his case himself, and, after two trials, received a substantial sum from him. <b>His</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> given name was [...] "Mary Eliza".|$|R
5|$|With {{starting}} {{help from}} <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Andersen started the wood product factory Apenes Trevarefabrikk in Horten, running it for fifteen years. King Haakon VII personally helped him {{with money and}} credit, remaining Andersen's friend and patron {{the rest of the}} king's life. One time, Andersen's company was hired to perform maintenance work on the Bygdøy Royal Estate. He eventually had to retire because of health problems sustained during the war.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month with}} <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Sing {{returned}} to the trenches in France in August 1917, but was in very poor health due to his battle wounds {{and the effects of}} gas poisoning. It is not clear whether he operated as a sniper on the Western Front, but in September 1917, he led a unit in the Battle of Polygon Wood in counter-sniper operations. For this action, he was awarded the Oorlogskruis (Belgian Croix de Guerre) in 1918, and was also recommended for the Military Medal—but never received it. In November 1917, he was confined to hospital again due to problems with his previously wounded leg. In mid-February 1918, he was hospitalised due to a gunshot wound in the back. Sing suffered lung disease from his exposure to gas, and it soon brought his military career to an end.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war and}} his {{recovery}} from the Chapultepec wound, Longstreet and Louise Garland were officially married on March 8, 1848, and the marriage produced 10 children. He and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> served on frontier duty in Texas, primarily at Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg and Fort Bliss in El Paso. He performed scouting missions and also served as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry from July 1858. Author Kevin Phillips claims that during this period Longstreet {{was involved in a}} plot to draw the Mexican state of Chihuahua into the Union as a slave state.|$|E
5000|$|When he married, <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> home in London {{was then}} called [...] "Fawkes Hall" [...] (Falkes' Hall), which over the years changed into [...] "Foxhall" [...] and finally into [...] "Vauxhall". The Vauxhall car company derived its name from that part of London and still uses de Breauté's griffin as its badge.|$|R

5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the Red Army had {{advanced}} to the Potsdamerplatz, and all indications were that they were preparing to storm the Chancellery. This report, combined with Himmler's treachery, prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life. After midnight on 29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the Führerbunker. Afterwards Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife.</b> Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his {{last will and testament}}. He signed these documents at 04:00 and then retired to bed (some sources say Hitler dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all sources agree on the timing of the signing).|$|E
5|$|Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he was angry {{that he had been}} overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E
50|$|In 1871, Caswell married again. <b>His</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> {{name was}} Sarah. They then {{moved into the}} Big Sable Point Lighthouse in 1873, where Caswell became its keeper. He was the 4th Big Sable Point Lighthouse keeper for the nine years {{spanning}} January 9, 1874 to July 17, 1882. They lived there for 5 years until 1878.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if he was}} {{divorced}} or his first wife died, but he was remarried in 1866. <b>His</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> extravagance eventually forced him to take more orders than he could handle, as well as turn to making copies of the Old Masters. She died in 1889, and he died the following year. He was interred at the Zentralfriedhof.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, Jeanie's adoptive mother, Joan Cunningham died of {{cirrhosis}} of the liver. Her adoptive father, Ralph Cunningham, remarried within 6 {{months of}} Joan's death, {{and by the}} end of that year, Jeanie and her brother Caleb were no longer living in <b>his</b> and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> home. Jeanie later struck out on a personal quest to locate her biological family and discover her roots.|$|R
5|$|Four years later, Godwin {{remarried}} and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> Mary Jane Clairmont, brought {{two children}} of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—Claire Clairmont. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.|$|E
5|$|George V's {{death in}} 1936 was {{followed}} by the accession of Edward VIII, who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry the divorced American Wallis Simpson, even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of divorcées. Accordingly, Edward announced his intention to abdicate; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries granted his request. Edward VIII and any children by <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> were excluded from the line of succession, and the Crown went to his brother, George VI. George served as a rallying figure for the British people during World War II, making morale-boosting visits to the troops as well as to munitions factories and to areas bombed by Nazi Germany. In June 1948 George VI relinquished the title Emperor of India, although remaining head of state of the Dominion of India.|$|E
5|$|Henry and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife</b> did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation {{as to the}} possible explanation, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E

The {{death of their}} little son, which occurred shortly before the book's publication, is commented on with a biblical allusion in a stop press marginal note: [...] "The children of adulterers shall be consumed, and the seed of a wicked bed shall be rooted out." ...|$|R
5000|$|He became {{engaged to}} Michele Clements (née Calascione) in August 2007, and married {{for the second}} time on 4 July 2008, at Lake Como in Italy, with a {{reception}} at the Villa Pizzo. His children, and <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> three children, Josh, Sasha and Alana also, attended, along with family and friends. Born Calascione, Ms Clements is the second of four children of Alfred Calascione and Stephanie De Cesare, and was previously married ...|$|R
5|$|In early April 1945, Braun {{travelled}} from Munich to Berlin {{to be with}} Hitler at the Führerbunker. She {{refused to}} leave as the Red Army closed in on the capital. After midnight {{on the night of}} 28–29 April, Hitler and Braun were married in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. The event was witnessed by Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann. Thereafter, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife.</b> When Braun married Hitler, her legal name changed to Eva Hitler. When she signed her marriage certificate she wrote the letter B for her family name, then lined this out and replaced it with Hitler.|$|E
5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} {{greatest}} impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife,</b> and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked to act as if class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E
5|$|Lonely and needing {{someone to}} care for his {{children}} and help with the sewing and other chores, Mala takes the young girl Iva as <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife.</b> But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship is a cold one. The Eskimos go hunting caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude. The woman is {{more than happy to}} live with Mala, and Mala makes love to her as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{alliance}} {{was achieved}} at no small cost, since France, which also claimed Burgundy, contested this acquisition, and Maximilian {{had to defend}} <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> territories from Louis XI, finally doing so upon Mary's death in 1482 at the Peace of Arras. Relationships with France remained difficult, Louis XI being defeated at the Battle of Guinegate in 1479. Matters with France were only concluded in 1493 at the Treaty of Senlis after Maximilian had become emperor.|$|R
50|$|After <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>wife's</b> family convinces her {{to leave}} him, {{attorney}} Dan Preston leaves his law practice and sets off to travel around {{the country as a}} vagabond. When he returns home he finds his house rented by a novelist, Shirley Haddon. He adopts a mongrel dog, Picardy Max, and sets out to avenge himself against his ex-wife's family by entering Max into dog shows to compete against their pedigreed animals. Preston also begins a romantic relationship with Haddon.|$|R
