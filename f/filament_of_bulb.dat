50|$|Critical {{illumination}} acts to form {{an image}} of the light source on the specimen to illuminate it. This image is formed by the condenser or collector lens. This illumination is bright but not always even, as any structure in the light source (for example the <b>filament</b> <b>of</b> a light <b>bulb)</b> will be visible in the resulting image. Homogenous light sources such as a flame or sunlight give more even illumination. Alternatively, a ground or opal glass diffuser can be used to homogenise the light source, but this will cause a significant amount of light to be scattered away from the sample.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA thermal {{light-emitting}} source, {{such as a}} {{black body}} or the incandescent <b>filament</b> <b>of</b> a light <b>bulb,</b> is often presented as a typical example of an incoherent source and is {{in marked contrast to}} a laser. Whereas a laser is highly monochromatic and very directional, a thermal source has a broad spectrum and is usually quasi-isotropic. However, {{as is the case with}} many systems, different behaviour can be expected on a microscopic scale. It has been shown recently that the field emitted by a thermal source made of a polar material is enhanced by more than four orders of magnitude and is partially coherent at a distance of the order of 10 to 100 nm. Here we demonstrate that by introducing a periodic microstructure into such a polar material (SiC) a thermal infrared source can be fabricated that is coherent over large distances (many wavelengths) and radiates in well defined directions. Narrow angular emission lobes similar to antenna lobes are observed and the emission spectra of the source depends on the observation angle [...] the so-called Wolf effect. The origin of the coherent emission lies in the diffraction of surface-phonon polaritons by the grating...|$|R

Since then the imports <b>of</b> <b>bulbs,</b> mainly from Holland, increased rapidly and bulb prices tended to decline gradually, while the Japanese production <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> did not decrease. The imports also introduced new varieties <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> to Japan. The demand for tulip bulbs increased greatly until the late 1990 s, but in the 2000 s the Japanese bulb markets stagnated.

50|$|Following voltage harmonisation, {{electricity}} supplies within the European Union are now nominally 230 V ±10% at 50 Hz. For a transition period (1995-2008), countries {{that had previously}} used 220 V changed to a narrower asymmetric tolerance range of 230 V +6%/−10% and those (like the UK) that had previously used 240 V changed to 230 V +10%/−6%. No change in voltage is required by either system as both 220&thinsp;V and 240&thinsp;V fall within the lower 230 V tolerance bands (230 V ±10%). Some areas of the UK still have 250 volts for legacy reasons, but these also fall within the 10% tolerance band of 230 volts. In practice, this allows countries to continue to supply the same voltage (220 or 240&thinsp;V), at least until existing supply transformers are replaced. Equipment (with the exception <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs)</b> used in these countries is designed to accept any voltage within the specified range. In the United States and Canada, national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120 V and allow a range of 114 V to 126 V (RMS) (−5% to +5%). Historically 110 V, 115 V and 117 V have been used at different times and places in North America. Mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 V; however, 120 V is the nominal voltage.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Although its {{importance}} as vegetable, {{a considerable amount}} <b>of</b> onion <b>bulbs</b> is lost in storage. That's why storage condition {{is one of the}} most important issues to maintain post-harvest quality. For this purpose, a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with two factors and three replicates was carried out. The factors were storage conditions <b>of</b> onion <b>bulbs</b> with five levels (4 oC in the seed storage apparatus, 25 and 30 oC without using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator, and 25 and 30 oC using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator) and storage times with ten levels (10 consecutive weeks). The storage feedbacks <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> in terms <b>of</b> the weight loss (WL) and the average bud length (ABL) <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> were analyzed. The storage <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> at 25 oC using rosemary fresh leaves and branches inside each bag <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> after 10 weeks resulted in the lowest weight loss and average bud length, and significantly controlled the post-harvest fungal rotting and improved the shelf life <b>of</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The findings <b>of</b> this study indicated the high potential of rosemary fresh leaves and branches, which can be considered as an alternative strategy to control post-harvest fungal rotting and to improve the storage life <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> considering its simplicity and efficacy in decreasing the storage cost, the weight loss and sprouting without causing any environmental toxicity...|$|R
