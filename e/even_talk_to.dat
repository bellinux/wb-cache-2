6000|$|... "Yet it isn't from them," [...] he said quietly, [...] "that I {{can take}} a mandate. I {{must go to the}} people. I couldn't <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them to-day. I couldn't take them into my confidence. I couldn't show them the things I have seen perhaps only in my dreams. I don't suppose they would have listened. [...] . How many more letters, Aaron?" ...|$|E
60|$|Kiki Aru usually went {{to these}} festivals with his parents, {{and then sat}} sullenly outside the circle and would not dance or sing or <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the other young people. So the festival did not make him any happier than other days, {{and this time he}} told Bini Aru and Mopsi Aru that he would not go. He would rather stay at home and be unhappy all by himself, he said, and so they gladly let him stay.|$|E

6000|$|At a {{mean little}} barber's with a pole above his {{lettered}} door {{he went in}} to be shaved. And a few steps further on {{he sat down at}} the crumb-littered counter of a little baker's shop to have some tea. It pleased him almost to childishness to find how easily he could listen and <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the oiled and crimpy little barber, and to the pretty, consumptive-looking, print-dressed baker's wife. Whatever his face might now be conniving at, the Arthur Lawford of last week could never have hob-nobbed so affably with his social 'inferiors.' ...|$|E

5000|$|..... wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me. In {{hindsight}} I suppose I'm {{proud to}} {{have been involved in}} the punk scene, though I don't go around telling everyone of it.

5000|$|Mugison got {{the idea}} while in London one summer {{performing}} at a Rough Trade music festival that lineup included a host of up-and-coming talent.
