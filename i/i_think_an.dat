And the f------ off-spinners don't turn.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>an</b> {{additional}} reason was that he found some difficulty in accepting the conventions of English cricket as it was then. There was a Somerset committee member, who liked and admired him, and would greet him with, 'Morning, McCool'. That committee member was seeking to be courteous. He would have thought it pompous to say 'Mr McCool', and impertinent to say 'Colin'. But it infuriated Colin. He thought it a reflection on his status. He would have preferred something like 'Hi, Col, you old bastard.' The worlds were too far apart." ...|$|E
500|$|Audience {{appreciation}} {{ratings were}} taken {{for the first}} two episodes of City of Death, and both episodes attained a respectable score of 64%. Listings magazine Radio Times published two letters from viewers regarding City of Death. Les Rogers of Hastings praised the serial's cast and the location filming; less impressed, however, was Paul R. Maskew of Exeter who felt the show was being played for laughs. Responding to similar criticisms from viewers, Douglas Adams wrote, [...] "If the programme didn't move and take a few risks then it would have died of boredom years ago". Several viewers wrote to point out the discrepancy between the start of life on Earth of 4,000 million years ago and the date given in City of Death of 400 million years ago. Graham Williams replied, [...] "The good Doctor makes the odd mistake or two but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>an</b> error of 3,600 million years is pushing it! His next edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica will provide an erratum". Another viewer wrote {{to point out that the}} atmosphere of the primordial Earth would have been poisonous to the Doctor and his companions; Douglas Adams responded to this criticism, citing artistic license.|$|E
500|$|Sondheim later {{expressed}} {{his view of}} de Mille's directing, calling her [...] "a horror. [...] She treated the actors and singers like dirt and treated the dancers like gods... <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>an</b> extremely insensitive woman, an excellent writer, and a terrible director, in terms of morale, anyway. [...] That was my first experience of bad behavior in the theatre." [...] However, Rufus Smith, who played the minor role of the football coach, stated, [...] "Never again in my life will I experience {{what it is like}} to stop a show cold, by doing exactly what she taught me". [...] The immense job of directing the play finally proved too big for de Mille, who stated [...] "I can't do the new dances and the new songs and the new book," [...] and Hammerstein stepped in to direct the dialogue. [...] According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, at this point the cast was up in arms over de Mille's treatment of them. [...] James Mitchell, one of the dancers in the production, later stated that de Mille was better at directing dancers than actors, as actors come to the stage with preconceived notions about how to play a part, and dancers do not.|$|E
