The results include the finding that maximum lateral penetration from such injections increases linearly with the square root of the jet-to-freestream dynamic-pressure ratio and is proportional to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{report on}} the {{essential}} performance characteristics of two brands of disposable air turbine handpiece and on aspects of their safety and convenience for clinical use. Materials and methods: Oralsafe and Feathertouch disposable handpieces were characterised {{using a variety of}} techniques in respect of the following: turbine rotor radius, <b>equivalent</b> <b>orifice</b> radius, stall torque coefficient, pressure effectiveness, power index, efficiency index, sound level and instrument retention force. Results: Free-running speed versus pressure curves for many of the disposable handpieces showed marked deviations from the expected smooth form. Considerable variation between examples of each type was found in most measured values. Evidence of eccentric rotors and high bearing friction was not found. Conclusions: Both brands of disposable handpiece had a number of problems: poor performance, vibration, excessive noise, variability of behaviour, poor bearings. Use of these devices is difficult to recommend. Improvement in design seems necessary. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the gas dynamics of the Mach-disk technique in laser evaporation experiments is presented. The relation between stagnation pressure, sonic pressure, and saturation pressure is given, and the <b>equivalent</b> sonic <b>orifice</b> diameter for laser-induced vaporization is calculated. Experimental results on UO// 2, which {{make use of the}} results of this analysis, are presented. These measurements, in the temperature range 3700 - 4200 K, confirm previous data for the total vapor pressure. The vaporization mechanism at extreme rates of evaporation and the relevance of equilibrium calculations to high-temperature evaporating systems are also discussed. Refs...|$|R
40|$|Two cowling systems {{intended}} {{to reduce the}} drag and improve the low-speed cooling characteristics of conventional radial engine cowlings were tested in model form to determine the practicability of the methods. One cowling included a blower mounted on the rear face of a large propeller spinner which drew cooling air in through side entrance ducts located behind the <b>equivalent</b> engine <b>orifice</b> plate. The air was passed through the <b>equivalent</b> engine <b>orifice</b> plate from rear to front and out through a slot between the spinner and the engine plate. The blower produced substantially all the power necessary to circulate the cooling air in some cases, so the quantity of air flowing was independent of the air speed, Two types of blowers were used, a centrifugal type and one using airfoil blades which forced the air outward {{from the center of}} rotation. The other cowling was similar to the conventional N. A. C. A. cowling except for the addition of a large propeller spinner nose. The spinner was provided with a hole in the nose to admit cooling air and blower blades to increase the pressure for cooling at low speeds. The tests show that with both cowling types the basic drag of the nacelle was reduced substantially below that for the N. A. C. A. cowling by virtue of the better nose shape made possible by the spinner. The drag due to the side-entrance ducts was nearly zero when the openings were closed or when the blower was drawing in a certain quantity of air in proportion to the air speed. The drag increased, however, when air mas allowed to spill from the openings. The nose-entrance blower showed considerable promise as a cooling means although the blower tested was relatively inefficient, owing {{to the fact that the}} blower compartments evidently were expanded too rapidly under the conditions imposed. by the design...|$|R
40|$|Local single- and {{two-phase}} {{heat transfer}} distributions are measured under a confined impinging jet issuing from a cross-shaped orifice. Spatially resolved temperature maps and convection coefficients {{resulting from the}} impinging flow are obtained via infrared imaging of a thin-foil heat source. The cooling patterns in single- and two-phase operation are explained by an accompanying numerical investigation of the fluid flow issuing from the orifice; computed velocity magnitudes and turbulence intensities are presented. In single-phase operation, the coolest surface temperatures correspond to areas with high liquid velocities. High velocities and developing turbulence are also shown to increase convective heat transfer along the diagonal outflow directions from the impinging jet. During two-phase transport, boiling preferentially begins in regions of low velocity, providing enhanced heat transfer in the areas least affected by the impingement. The cross-shaped orifice achieves local heat transfer coefficients that exceed the stagnation-point value of a circular jet of <b>equivalent</b> open <b>orifice</b> area by up to 1. 5 times, while resulting in an increased pressure drop only 1. 1 times {{higher than that of}} the circular jet...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Since {{the dawn}} of the {{computer}} age, there has been a push to create miniature devices. These devices were initially integrated circuit (IC) devices to perform calculations for computers. As the technology progressed, the scope of the devices diverged to included microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, meaning that the devices perform mechanical movements via electrical actuation. More recently, a new generation of devices has evolved called microtechnology-based energy and chemical systems (MECS). MECS may employ MEMS technology, however the systems are not designed to produce only mechanical movement. MECS deal with heat and mass transfer, the basic processes used in energy, chemical and biological systems, in the mesoscale realm. Mesoscale devices range from the size of a sugar cube {{to the size of a}} human fist. The possibilities of MECS have not been realized. Heating and cooling systems, chemical mixing/distribution, and locking systems are all potential applications. The devices require: 1) revolutionary design, accounting for the scaling effects on device performance; 2) new fabrication technologies for the creation of these designs; and 3) good material properties for mechanical and chemical interactions. Fabrication requirements for MECS are different than for MEMS in that MECS generally require non-silicon metals. Metal microlamination (MML) has been introduced as a general practice for meeting the fabrication requirements for MECS. Prior MML fabrication methods have emphasized the use of diffusion bonding, soldering, or brazing techniques. This thesis will introduce: 1) a novel microflapper valve design fabricated in mild steel using a novel microprojection welding technique; 2) a novel microfloat valve design fabricated in mild steel using a novel capacitive dissociation process for creating free floating geometries. The devices are characterized by comparing actual flow rates to theoretical flow rates of <b>equivalent</b> <b>orifice</b> sizes. Preliminary results show that the microfloat valve achieved an average diodicity (free flow versus leakage rate) ratio of 11. 19, while the microflapper valve achieved an average diodicity ratio of 4. 08. The theoretical orifice sizes of the microfloat and microflapper valves are 0. 629 mm and 0. 611 mm respectively. These results suggest that the float valve is the superior design...|$|E
