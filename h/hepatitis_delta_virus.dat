Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The <b>hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> <b>virus</b> of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although <b>hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> <b>virus</b> genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

Diagnosis of HDV infection therefore remains crucial in monitoring patients, but is often overlooked. To integrate delta markers into high throughput viral hepatitis diagnostic, we studied the binding of anti-delta antibodies (Abs) using surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). We focused on the ubiquitous HDV genotype 1 (HDV 1) and the more uncommon African-HDV 6 and HDV 8 genotypes to define an array with recombinant proteins or peptides. Full-length and truncated S-HDAg recombinant proteins of HDV 1 and 11 HDV peptides of HDV 1, 6 and 8, representing various portion of the delta antigen were grafted onto biochips, allowing SPRi measurements. Sixteen to seventeen sera from patients infected with different HDV-genotypes were injected onto protein or peptide chips, respectively. In all, Abs against HDV proteins and/or peptides were detected in 16 out of 17 infected patients (94, 12 %), although the amplitude of the SPR signal varied. Amino-terminal part of the protein was poorly immunogenic, while epitope 65 - 80, exposed on the viral ribonucleoprotein, may be immunodominant as 9 patient's samples led to a specific SPR signal on peptide 65 # 1, independently of the infecting genotype.

Objectives To report a successful treatment of a patient with a chronic severe <b>hepatitis</b> <b>Delta</b> using combination therapy with Pegylated interferon (PegIFN), Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and Emtricitabine (FTC). Study Design The patient, a 47 years -old male patient, originating from Dagestan (East Asia), suffered of chronic <b>hepatitis</b> <b>Delta</b> infection. The patient was HBsAg, HBeAg, and anti-Delta Ab (IgG) positive. Serum HBV-DNA level was elevated (more than 9 logUI/mL). Serum HDV-RNA level was up to 5. 6 log (copies/ml). Genotypes HBV/D and HDV- 1 were demonstrated. The liver histology revealed chronic active hepatitis (Metavir score: A 2 F 2). The treatment was started with PegIFN (180 μg/week) for two months and then TDF (300 mg/day) (combined later with FTC) was added. Results Sustained response was obtained after 10 months of treatment and was accompanied by the clearance of serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen with seroconversion to anti-HBs. Conclusion This case report suggests that Delta infection may co-exist with high replicative HBV infection and that combination therapy with PegIFN and nucleoside/tide analogues seems to be more effective than IFN alone.

The S-HDAg is essential for viral RNA replication while the L-HDAg is required for viral assembly. In this study, we demonstrated that HDAg are acetylated proteins. Metabolic labeling with [3 H]acetate revealed that both forms of HDAg could be acetylated in vivo. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of cellular acetyltransferase p 300 could acetylate the full-length and the N-terminal 88 amino acids of S-HDAg in vitro. By mass spectrometric analysis of the modified protein, Lys- 72 of S-HDAg was identified {{as one of the}} acetylation sites. Substitution of Lys- 72 to Arg caused the mutant S-HDAg to redistribute from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The mutant reduced viral RNA accumulation and resulted in the earlier appearance of L-HDAg.

40|$|Background: <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> {{is caused}} by {{infection}} with the hepatitis D virus (HDV) and is considered the most severe form of viral hepatitis. Treatment options for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> are limited, with only 25 % of patients responding to interferon (IFN) -alfa-based therapies. The role of the adaptive immune system in controlling HDV infection during spontaneous or treatment-induced viral clearance is not well understood. Methods: We studied HDV-specific cytokine production of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} stimulated with HDV peptide pools as well as serum cytokine levels in well-characterized patients with chronic HDV infection before and during pegylated-interferon-alfa±adefovir therapy. Results: Hepatitis D virus-specific interleukin (IL) - 2, IFN-γ-, interferon-inducible protein- 10 and IL- 10 -responses were detectable in 53 %, 35 %, 65 % and 6 % of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>delta</b> patients. HDV-specific IFN-γ responses tended to be more common in patients with low HDV viral loads. HDV-specific cytokine responses declined during pegylated (PEG) -IFNa therapy and patterns of changes were associated with the treatment response. Serum cytokine levels also showed distinct changes during PEG-IFNa treatment.
