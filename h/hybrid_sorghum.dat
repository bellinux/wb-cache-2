However, the values of pH of <b>sorghum</b> <b>hybrid</b> and sweet <b>sorghum</b> were 5. 13 and 4. 95, respectively.

40|$|In 1977, {{all summer}} annual forages studied {{produced}} excellent yields. Based on leafiness and regrowth ability, sudangrasses and pearl millet {{appeared to be}} best for early vegetative and boot cutting management. The sorghum-sudan hybrids had suitable yields and quality at all harvest stages. The <b>hybrid</b> forage <b>sorghum</b> appeared best suited for soft-dough-stage harvest although yields of pearl millet and sorghum-Sudan hybrids were also excellent...|$|R
40|$|Agronomic and silage quality traits were {{measure d}} for 37 forage sorghum cultivars and three grain <b>sorghum</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The 1995 growing season was {{characterized}} by above average rainfall {{in the spring and}} early summer, and a hard freeze on September 22. At the time of the freeze, 20 cultivars had reached the early-milk to early-dough stage, 12 were in the bloom stage, and the remaining eight were still in the early- to late-boot stage. The late planting date and low plant populations resulted in below-normal whole-plant D M and grain yields. Plant height s for the grain sorghums were near normal, but the forage sorghums were well below expected plant heights. The preensiled, whole-plan t DM contents of the 37 forage sorghums ranged from 23. 0 to 39. 9 %. As expected, the silage nutritive value traits of CP, NDF, and ADF were most favorable for the three grain <b>sorghum</b> <b>hybrids</b> and least favorable for the eight forage <b>sorghum</b> <b>hybrids</b> that were still in the boot stage when the freeze occurred...|$|R
