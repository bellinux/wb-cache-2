2500|$|All MIPS I {{control flow}} {{instructions}} {{are followed by}} a branch delay slot. Unless the branch delay slot is filled by an instruction performing useful work, an nop is substituted. MIPS I branch instructions compare {{the contents of a}} GPR (rs) against zero or another GPR (rt) as signed integers and branch if the specified condition is true. Control is transferred to the address computed by shifting the 16-bit offset left by two bits, sign-extending the 18-bit result, and adding the 32-bit sign-extended result to the sum of the program counter (<b>instruction</b> <b>address)</b> and 810. Jumps have two versions: absolute and register-indirect. Absolute jumps ("Jump" [...] and [...] "Jump and Link") compute the address control is transferred to by shifting the 26-bit instr_index left by two bits and concatenating the 30-bit result with the two high-order bits of instruction in the branch delay slot address's. Register-indirect jumps transfer control to the instruction at the address sourced from a GPR (rs). The address sourced from the GPR must be word-aligned, else an exception is signaled after the instruction in the branch delay slot is executed. Branch and jump instructions that link (except for [...] "Jump and Link Register") save the return address to GPR 31. The [...] "Jump and Link Register" [...] instruction permits the return address to be saved to any writable GPR.|$|E

40|$|Unlike library code, whose <b>instruction</b> <b>addresses</b> can be {{randomized}} by {{address space}} layout randomization (ASLR), application binary code often has static <b>instruction</b> <b>addresses.</b> Attackers can exploit this limitation to craft robust shell codes for such applications, {{as demonstrated by}} a recent attack that reuses instruction gadgets from the static binary code of victim applications. This paper introduces binary stirring, a new technique that imbues x 86 native code {{with the ability to}} self-randomize its <b>instruction</b> <b>addresses</b> each time it is launched. The input to STIR is only the application binary code without any source code, debug symbols, or relocation information. The output is a new binary whose basic block addresses are dynamically determined at load-time. Therefore, even if an attacker can find code gadgets in one instance of the binary, the <b>instruction</b> <b>addresses</b> in other instances are unpredictable. An array of binary transformation techniques enable STIR to transparently protect large, realistic applications that cannot be perfectly disassembled due to computed jumps, code-data interleaving, OS callbacks, dynamic linking {{and a variety of other}} difficult binary features. Evaluation of STIR for both Windows and Linux platforms shows that stirring introduces about 1. 6 % overhead on average to application runtimes...|$|R
