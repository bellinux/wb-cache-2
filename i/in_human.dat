40|$|AbstractThe {{scientific}} literature on altered onset of puberty predominantly involves studies on females. This paper reviews current knowledge {{on the role}} of environmental pollutants in dysregulation of male puberty <b>in</b> <b>humans,</b> laboratory rodents and farm animals. The methods used to determine the onset of puberty are well developed <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> and farm animals, and standardized across studies <b>in</b> <b>humans.</b> <b>In</b> laboratory rodents standardized external morphological endpoints are used. There is an increasing weight of evidence from epidemiological studies <b>in</b> <b>humans,</b> as well as from experiments in animals, indicating that environmental pollutants dysregulate puberty in males. Most data are from studies on “classical” persistent environmental pollutants. Assessing the effect of multichemical environmental pollution on dysregulation of puberty <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> is more challenging; further solid epidemiological data would likely contribute most to our understanding, especially if combined with systematically collected field-data from selected wildlife...|$|R
