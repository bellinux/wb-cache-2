5|$|The Uranian {{satellite}} {{system is the}} least massive among those of the giant planets. Indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites is less than <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Triton (the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System) alone. The largest of the satellites, Titania, has a radius of 788.9km, or less than <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Moon, but slightly more than that of Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus is about 10,000times more massive than its moons.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the war had}} a {{significantly}} {{negative impact on the}} Australia economy. Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, falling by 16 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Pluto {{has five}} known moons: Charon (the largest, with a {{diameter}} just over <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits {{does not lie}} within either body.|$|E

5|$|The {{smallest}} known {{planet is}} PSR B1257+12A, {{one of the}} first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a pulsar. Its mass is roughly <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the planet Mercury. The smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is Kepler-37b, with a mass (and radius) slightly higher than that of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|This {{plan was}} {{affected}} by {{the needs of the}} war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13b is an {{extrasolar planet}} that was {{discovered}} in 2008 in the orbit of the sunlike star WASP-13. The planet has a mass of nearly <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, but a radius five-fourths the size of Jupiter. This low relative mass might {{be caused by a}} core that is of low mass or that is not present at all.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The life span of horses on Cumberland Island is approximately <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites and disease. They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal distension.|$|E
5|$|After {{the railroads}} from Boston to Lowell, Worcester, and Providence were {{chartered}} in 1830 and 1831, railroads to other surrounding cities including Newburyport and Portsmouth were proposed. The Eastern Railroad was chartered on April 14, 1836. Work began at East Boston in late 1836; it reached Lynn {{in the spring}} of 1837, but construction was slowed by the Panic of 1837 and did not reach Salem until 1838. Service from Salem to East Boston began on August 27, 1838, with fares <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> competing stagecoaches.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet {{designated}} Gliese 876 b. In 2001, further analysis of the star's radial velocity revealed {{the existence of a}} second planet in the system, which was designated Gliese 876 c. The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the outer planet, which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E

5|$|However, {{this plan}} only applied to men manning {{the walls of}} the fort, not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort's guns. To man the guns of Fort Greble and those of Washington's other forts, Barnard {{designated}} three crews for each gun. These crews would be permanently located at the fort, unlike the men assigned to {{the walls of the}} fort. To fire Fort Greble's planned complement of 15 guns, Barnard assigned 255 artillerymen. This plan was affected by the needs of the war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{and ethnic}} {{minorities}} lag behind white counterparts in education, with 15.0% {{of blacks and}} 13.0% of Hispanics holding bachelor's degrees compared to 42.0% of the white population. The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes {{among the highest in}} the Midwest, but median household income among minorities is below that of whites by over $17,000. Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> whites though Asian home ownership has doubled. In 2000, the poverty rate for whites was 4.2%; for blacks it was 26.2%; for Asians, 19.1%; Native Americans, 23.2%; and Hispanics, 18.1%.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/mÂ³, {{is less than}} <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The {{same is true of}} several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E

5|$|WASP-15b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{discovered}} in 2008 by the SuperWASP collaboration, {{which seeks to}} discover exoplanets that transit their host stars. The planet orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.05 AU every four days. The mass of this planet is about one <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Watt {{was waiting}} for the order, and in 1938 had {{arranged}} for production of the transmitters at Metrovick and receivers at A.C. Cossor. These {{turned out to be the}} wrong products: Metrovick had been told to directly copy ("Chinese") the 1937 design by Percy Hibberd, but Bawdsey had delivered the wrong prototype to Metrovick, who copied it. The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much as the entire transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the EMI lash-up.|$|E
5|$|A poll {{conducted}} by Ipsos MORI in December 2011 as Lamont {{took control of}} Scottish Labour indicated that the party had an approval rating of 26%, almost <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish National Party with 51%. A survey by the same organisation in June 2012 showed an improvement for Labour, with 32% against the Nationalists' 45%. The same poll indicated a personal approval rating for Lamont of 9%, compared to 13% for Salmond. A {{poll conducted}} by Ipsos MORI on behalf of STV in September 2013 indicated that 37% of respondents were satisfied with Labour's performance compared to 41% for the SNP. That survey found that Lamont had a personal approval rating of +6%, against +8% for Salmond. Another Ipsos MORI poll for STV in December 2013 showed Labour on 34% with 36% for the SNP, while Lamont had overtaken Salmond in terms of personal approval with +9 for her compared to +7 for the First Minister.|$|E

5|$|Newton {{suffered}} {{a slow start}} to his 1883 campaign, failing to pass 10 runs in his first five innings. His improvements improved in his next three matches, highlighted by a half-century against Gloucestershire, scored during a 135 run partnership with Edward Sainsbury. His batting average for the season was almost <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the previous year, and despite playing two additional innings he scored two less half-centuries than in 1882. In his first match for Somerset in 1884, Newton claimed his only wickets in first-class cricket. Bowling with a style that is not recorded on CricketArchive or Cricinfo, he claimed the wickets of Hampshire's Arthur Richards and HH Armstrong, both batsmen being caught off his bowling. Newton utilised himself as a bowler only after using every other member of the side, {{with the exception of}} wicket-keeper Francis Terry. In his next match, Newton avoided a pair against Lancashire by top-scoring in Somerset's second innings with 62. That score was to be the last half-century of Newton's season, and his last in first-class cricket for Somerset. He added two further scores above 30 against Kent, scoring 46 and 31, He played three less innings than in the previous season, but surpassed his total runs from that season, and improved his average to 24.22. In his three years of first-class cricket for Somerset, he scored no centuries, five half-centuries, and averaged 24.56 with the bat, higher than he finished with any other first-class cricket side.|$|E
5|$|With {{no other}} way to readily obtain cash, DuMont sold WDTV to Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $9.75 million in late 1954. While this gave DuMont a {{short-term}} cash infusion, it eliminated the leverage the network had to get program clearances in other markets. Without its de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, the company's advertising revenue shrank to less than <b>half</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> 1953. By February 1955, DuMont executives realized the company could not continue as a television network. The decision was made to shut down network operations and operate WABD and WTTG as independent stations. On April 1, 1955, most of DuMont's entertainment programs were dropped. Bishop Sheen aired his last program on DuMont on April 26 and later moved to ABC. By May, just eight programs were left on the network, with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping {{what was left of the}} network going through the summer. The network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable, on which it had spent $3 million in 1954 to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance. The company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company's Electronicam process to produce studio-based programming. Ironically, Electronicam is best remembered for being used by Jackie Gleason's producers for the 39-half-hour episodes of The Honeymooners that aired on CBS during the 1955-56 television season.|$|E
