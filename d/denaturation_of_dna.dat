40|$|A unifying theory <b>of</b> the <b>denaturation</b> {{transition}} <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{driven by}} temperature T or induced by an external mechanical torque Γ is presented. Our model couples in a geometrical way the hydrogen-bond opening and the untwisting of the helicoidal molecular structure. Using the transfer matrix method, {{we show that}} denaturation corresponds to a first-order phase transition from BDNA to dDNA phases and that the coexistence region is naturally parametrized by the degree of supercoiling σ. The denaturation free energy ∆G, the phase diagram in the T,Γ plane and isotherms in the σ,Γ plane are calculated. At T = 298 K and for a Poly(dGdT) -Poly(dAdC) -DNA at 20 mM Na +, the critical torque Γc ≃ − 0. 033 eV/rad and degree of supercoiling σc ≃ − 0. 01 are in fair agreement with experimental data.

5000|$|The {{first model}} that {{attempted}} {{to describe the}} thermodynamics of the denaturation bubble was introduced in 1966 and called the Poland-Scheraga Model. This model describes the <b>denaturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> strands {{as a function of}} temperature. As the temperature increases, the hydrogen bonds between the Watson and Crick base pairs are increasingly disturbed and [...] "denatured loops" [...] begin to form. However, the Poland-Scheraga Model is now considered elementary because it fails to account for the confounding implications of DNA sequence, chemical composition, stiffness and torsion.|$|E
5000|$|Heat <b>denaturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{also called}} [...] melting, causes the double helix {{structure}} to unwind to form single stranded DNA. When DNA in solution is heated above its melting temperature (usually more than 80 °C), the double-stranded DNA unwinds to form single-stranded DNA. The bases become unstacked and can thus absorb more light. In their native state, {{the bases of}} DNA absorb light in the 260-nm wavelength region. When the bases become unstacked, the wavelength of maximum absorbance does not change, but the amount absorbed increases by 37%. A double strand DNA dissociating to single strands produces a sharp cooperative transition.|$|E

Nucleic acid denaturation occurs when hydrogen bonding between nucleotides is disrupted, and results in the separation of previously annealed strands. For example, <b>denaturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> due to high temperatures results in the disruption of Watson and Crick base pairs and the separation of the double stranded helix into two single strands.

50|$|Microbial {{growth in}} {{alkaline}} conditions presents several complications to normal biochemical activity and reproduction, as high pH is detrimental to normal cellular processes. For example, alkalinity {{can lead to}} <b>denaturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> instability of the plasma membrane and inactivation of cytosolic enzymes, {{as well as other}} unfavorable physiological changes. Thus, to adequately circumvent these obstacles, alkaliphiles must either possess specific cellular machinery that works best in the alkaline range, or they must have methods of acidifying the cytosol in relation to the extracellular environment. To determine which of the above possibilities an alkaliphile uses, experimentation has demonstrated that alkaliphilic enzymes possess relatively normal pH optimums. The determination that these enzymes function most efficiently near physiologically neutral pH ranges (about 7.5-8.5) was one of the primary steps in elucidating how alkaliphiles survive intensely basic environments. Since the cytosolic pH must remain nearly neutral, alkaliphiles must have one or more mechanisms of acidifying the cytosol when {{in the presence of a}} highly alkaline environment.|$|E
