40|$|In {{the present}} work, a fatigue {{assessment}} of the electric motor within the <b>electric</b> <b>axle</b> drive (<b>electric</b> <b>axle)</b> was developed using virtual load data. Now that the <b>electric</b> <b>axle</b> with torque vectoring function has been integrated into multiple vehicle classes, {{it is possible to}} create simulation models which allow the drive train to be mapped in various driving scenarios. Validation is performed by means of optical measurement methods (object tracking) which allow to determine load data for subsystems and components under variable torque and speed scenarios (e. g., handling course). In this paper, a load spectrum was created and used for fatigue analysis of the subsystem, namely the traction motor (EM) and torque vectoring motor. Based on the local stress, a finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out on the rotor, and investigations of strength and fatigue were performed on thin sheets of electrical steel. These S-N diagrams consider various factors such as material, temperature, and influence of specimen dimensions and are the basis for fatigue assessment based on the load spectrum from simulation...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) have spread {{worldwide}} {{due to their}} capability to reduce fuel consumption. Several studies focused on the optimisation of the energy management system of hybrid vehicles are available in literature, whilst there are few articles dealing with the drivability and the dynamics of these new powertrain systems. In this paper a ‘Through-the-Road-Parallel HEV' is analysed. This architecture is composed of an internal combustion engine mounted on the front <b>axle</b> and an <b>electric</b> motor powering the rear one. These two powertrains are not directly connected to each other, as the parallel configuration is implemented through the road-tyre force interaction.

The differences from a traditional Front-Wheel-Drive (FWD) configuration are subsequently highlighted. Furthermore, the authors compare different linearised dynamic models, with an increasing number of degrees of freedom, in order to assess which model represents the best compromise between complexity and quality of the results.

With two motors driving {{the front and}} rear axle separately, the torque distribution between axles can be easily achieved. To obtain good traction performance and stability of the electric vehicle, three control modes appropriate for different driving conditions are adopted: the routine control of equal distribution; the distribution based on Sliding Mode Control (SMC) to minimize wheel slip difference between axles; axles separately antiskid control based on SMC. With MATLAB/SimDriveline software, a forward vehicle simulation model was set up. The simulation results show that the torque distribution control strategy of three control modes can maintain the wheel slip in a reasonable range regardless of driving conditions, improving both vehicle traction ability and stability...|$|R

40|$|Optimized torque-distribution {{control method}} (OTCM) is a {{critical}} technology for front/rear <b>axle</b> <b>electric</b> wheel loader (FREWL) to improve the operation performance and energy efficiency. In the paper, a longitudinal dynamics model of FREWL is created. Based on the model, the objective functions are that the weighted sum of variance and mean of tire workload is minimal and the total motor efficiency is maximal. Four nonlinear constraint optimization algorithms, quasi-newton Lagrangian multiplier method, sequential quadratic programming, adaptive genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization with random weighting and natural selection, which have fast convergent rate and quick calculating speed, are used as solving solutions for objective function. The simulation results show that compared to no-control FREWL, controlled FREWL utilizes the adhesion ability better and slips less. It is obvious that controlled FREWL gains better operation performance and higher energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of FREWL in equipment transferring condition is increased by 13 – 29 %.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel 4 -wheel-drive electric vehicle layout consisting of one on-board <b>electric</b> drivetrain per <b>axle.</b> Each drivetrain includes a simplified clutch-less 2 -speed transmission system {{and an open}} differential, to transmit the torque to the wheels. This drivetrain layout allows eight different gear state combinations at the vehicle level, thus increasing the possibility of running the vehicle in a more energy efficient state for the specific wheel torque demand and speed. Also, to compensate the torque gap during gearshifts, a ‘torque-fill’ controller was developed that varies the motor torque on the axle {{not involved in the}} gearshift. Experimental tests show the effectiveness of the developed gearshift strategy extended with the torque-fill capability. Energy efficiency benefits are discussed by comparing the energy consumptions of the case study vehicle controlled through a constant front-to-total wheel torque distribution and conventional gearshift maps, and the same vehicle with an energy management system based on an off-line optimization. Results demonstrate that the more advanced controller brings a significant reduction of the energy consumption at constant speed and along different driving cycles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVibro-acoustic source {{characterization}} is {{an essential}} task in vehicle development to enable prediction of receiver response. For structure-borne noise, the interface forces in multiple degrees of freedom due to internal loads are often quantified for root cause analyses in a single system assembly, as in transfer path analysis (TPA). However, for a reliable prognosis of the acoustic performance of a known component such as a motor or pump, a receiver-independent source characterization is required, and the method of acquiring blocked forces from in-situ measurements {{has been shown to}} be a preferred technique for such purposes. The benefits of the method are the characterization of the intrinsic properties of the source and the possibilities of measuring the component attached to receivers with varying dynamic properties. There is to date a limited number of validation cases where blocked forces from in-situ measurements are acquired for automotive source–receiver assemblies. In this study the blocked forces of a vacuum pump in nine degrees of freedom were determined when connected to a bracket whose boundary conditions were modified in order to achieve four assemblies with different source/receiver dynamic properties. The results show that the blocked forces are transferable, i. e. the receiver response in one assembly was predicted in a wide frequency range by combining source–receiver transfer functions of that assembly with blocked forces estimated in another assembly. Furthermore, an in-situ blocked force TPA was applied to a double-isolated complete vehicle source–receiver case of an <b>electric</b> rear <b>axle</b> drive with interior compartment sound pressure as target. The reconstructed magnetic tonal harmonics agreed with the measured target response in the frequency range 50 – 500 Hz, which further motivates the use of the blocked force principles for TPA and source requirements specifications...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the modeling, the design and the control of mild hybrid {{electric}} vehicles. The main goal is to develop accurate design tools and methodologies for preliminary system and component level analysis. Particular attention {{is devoted to the}} configuration in which an electric machine is mounted on the rear axle of a passenger car. The use of such a machine in parallel with the internal combustion engine allows one to exploit different functionalities that are able to reduce the overall fuel consumption of the vehicle. In addition, the indirect coupling between the thermal and the electric machine, realized through the road and not by means of mechanical couplers, together with the position of the latter in the overall vehicle chassis system, enables such an architecture to be efficient both from the energy recovery and the full electric driving point of view. Chapter 1 introduces the problem of fuel consumption and emissions reduction in the overall world context and presents the main hybrid architectures available. Chapter 2 is devoted {{to the study of the}} influence of the electric machine position in the powertrain regarding the regenerative braking potentialities concerned. The model considered for the analysis will be described on each of its subcomponents. The braking performance of the vehicle in electric mode is presented considering no losses in the electric powertrain (electric motor, battery, inverter). Chapter 3 is dedicated to the design of an electric machine for a rear axle powertrain. The specifications of such machine are optimized considering both the vehicle and the application under analysis. The design takes into account analytical techniques for the computation of electrical parameters (such as phase and DC currents) and the torque - speed map, as well as numerical ones for its thermal behavior. In Chapter 4 the electrical and thermal characteristics of the designed electric motor are implemented in the model presented in Chapter 2. The overall vehicle model is therefore used both to assess a simple torque split strategy between thermal and electric machine and to perform an optimal sizing of the battery considering all the limitations imposed by the electric powertrain (e. g. maximum currents, maximum temperatures). Chapter 5 makes a step forward and analyzes the different implications that the use of the rear <b>axle</b> <b>electric</b> motor to brake the vehicle has on the vehicle dynamics. Open loop analysis will present a degradation of the vehicle handling comfort caused by the introduction of an oversteering moment to the vehicle. Through the use of a simplified vehicle model, the introduced oversteering yaw moment is evaluated, while a control strategy based on a new stability detector will show how to find a trade off between handling comfort and regenerable energy. At last, Chapter 6 {{deals with the}} problem of longitudinal driving comfort. Drivelines and chassis are lightly damped systems and the application of an impulsive torque imposed by the driver can cause the vehicle longitudinal acceleration (directly perceived by the driver) to be oscillating and non smooth. A sensitivity analysis on a conventional powertrain is presented demonstrating which of the different components are more influential in the different modes of vibration, and possible solutions to improve the driveability are proposed. One of these relates to the use of the rear <b>axle</b> <b>electric</b> machine in order to give more responsiveness to the vehicle. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Chapter 7...|$|R
40|$|New {{challenges}} arise for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) engineers when {{electric motors}} are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). The noise signature from an electric traction motor {{is characterized by}} speed-dependent high frequency tonal components due to electro-magnetic excitation. Despite the relatively low overall levels, those tonal components can be prominent and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. With the rapid increase of various types of hybrid/electric vehicles (EV), new methods are required to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The objective of this thesis was to explore the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate experimental methods for assessment of noise transmission. The thesis is based upon seven papers. Four of the papers are oriented around tools and techniques for sound quality assessments of EV-noise. Due to the specific character, there is a proven need for engineers to identify relevant psycho-acoustic metrics for quantifying the subjective perceptions of an accelerating EV. The relationship between the metric prominence ratio (PR) and perceived annoyance was explored and requirement criteria were proposed. PR is appropriate for quantifying individual tonal components, well frequency separated from each other. For more complex sounds, e. g. with multiple proximate prominent tones, the suitability of this metric is questioned. Therefore, the harmonic content {{of a large number}} of EVs on the market was examined in order to bring further facts to the on-going discussion on sound quality quantification of EV specific noise. Furthermore, the assessment environment’s role as well as the impact of experiencing the sound sensation in the real environment for sound quality evaluations were studied. Finally, perception of the tonal components related to different DC/AC conversion techniques including randomized pulse-width modulation was explored. The main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise were studied. The acoustic transfer functions’ (ATF) spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise was investigated for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. ATFs and surface velocities are also central for the presented in-situ method for determination of radiated sound power from the stator housing due to a dominant order. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for estimation of the radiation efficiency was derived. The two papers highlight the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the stator housing which enables sound power to be used as an acoustic source characterization, which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers. The final contribution of methods for handling EV-specific noise concerns structure-borne sound. The method of in-situ estimation of blocked forces, a theoretically independent source characterization, is evaluated for transfer path analysis (TPA) of a double isolated <b>electric</b> rear <b>axle</b> drive. The method has two main advantages; it is substantially faster compared to the conventional TPA method and the blocked forces allow for accurate prediction of the acoustic response when the same source is being integrated with a different receiving structure. The prerequisite for the second is that the source activity remains invariant and this was further studied. In summary, the work reported in this thesis is intended to support engineers to succeed with the acoustic refinement and thereby also to contribute to increasing competitiveness of hybrid/electric vehicles.

40|$|Complete vehicle, {{system and}} {{component}} target setting for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) are important activities within automotive product development. New challenges arise when electric motors are introduced into cars traditionally powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). Although the electric powertrain is generally quieter than ICEs, the sound character however {{is completely different}} and necessarily not more preferable. The noise signature from an electric traction motor is characterized by speed-dependent high frequency tonal components from the dominating electro-magnetic harmonics, covering a wide rpm-range. With relatively low levels of broad band masking noise from tires and wind, the tonal components can be accented in a large frequency range and contribute to perceived annoyance for the occupants inside the car. Methods for good practice of NVH development work for traditional vehicles have been established and refined during the last decades. With the rapid increase of various types of electric powertrain-equipped low emission vehicles, new methodology is {{required in order to}} understand and fulfill expectations on these unaccustomed vehicle-acoustic phenomena. The objective with this thesis was to investigate the audible perception of the electric powertrain and develop and validate methods for assessment of noise transmission. The findings aim to support the complete vehicle, system and component target setting processes to secure a desired sound quality in future electric vehicle launches. The thesis is based upon four papers. The first two papers address the human perception of the sound from the electric powertrain during driving. In Paper 1, the evaluation methodology of electric powertrain sound quality was investigated. It was concluded that the mean ratings of a specific acceleration sound stimulus was judged similarly in two laboratory test environments (listening room and “sound car” respectively) as during on-road driving. Further, with lower level of high frequency (> 1 kHz) tonal components, the overall satisfaction and annoyance ratings were improved. The annoyance due to tonal components, stationary as well as speed-dependent, was further studied in Paper 2. The psycho-acoustic metric prominence ratio (PR) was used to quantify the tone levels relative to the adjacent background noise. It was found that for PR-levels below 3 dB, the perceived annoyance was similar independent of frequency range. Increased PR-level provided higher probability of detecting the tones and the perceived annoyance was significantly increased compared to PR< 3 dB for tones above 2. 5 kHz. The findings from Paper 1 and 2 provide foundation for complete vehicle interior acoustic target specification. The following two papers (Paper 3 and 4) focus on the main mechanical system properties that are responsible for the airborne radiation and transfer of electric powertrain induced noise. Paper 3 has emphasis on the experimental determination of acoustic transfer functions (ATFs) between the car’s interior to multiple positions located on the stator shell surface of an <b>electric</b> rear <b>axle</b> drive. It addresses the ATFs’ spatial resolution with respect to estimated interior noise for theoretically derived and measured surface vibrations. A reciprocal relation was assumed; therefore the measured ATFs could be used to inversely reproduce the sound transmission from the stator shell to the interior. ATFs and surface velocities are also central in Paper 4, where a method for in-situ determination of radiated sound power from a stator shell was presented and validated. By acquiring the operational deflection shape due to an electro-magnetic radial force wave, a simplified expression for the radiation efficiency was estimated. Paper 3 and 4 highlights the advantages of the rotational symmetric force excitation acting on the stator housing which enables sound power as an acoustic source characterization which perhaps is the most adequate measure for system target setting directed towards external suppliers.
