5|$|The {{station was}} {{refurbished}} (as of 2015) and work began on 2 January 2007. Additional CCTV cameras and Help Points were installed, {{bringing the total}} to 77 cameras in the station and nine Help Points, the latter upgraded with new <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> to better aid hearing-impaired passengers. In addition, new communications equipment was introduced and damaged signs were replaced with new ones.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{signalling}} {{system is a}} fixed-block cab {{signalling system}} called HKT which transmits data to the trains through low-bandwidth audio frequency <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> between the rails. Different frequency combinations encode different target speeds; when a train enters a block with a lower target speed than its current speed it will initiate service braking until the two match. This allows blocks to be much shorter than the full-speed braking distance, but as the braking profile is encoded in the transmitted target speed it only works where all trains have similar braking characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Coordination between {{buses and}} trains {{in the tunnel}} is managed by the Link Light Rail Operations Control Center (OCC), located at the King County Metro Communication and Control Center in SoDo. The OCC {{controls}} vehicle separation between buses and trains by using on-board radio-frequency identification tags installed on tunnel buses and light rail vehicles, their locations tracked by passing over <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> embedded in the tunnel roadway. Signals at each station indicate when a driver can proceed through the tunnel. Within the DSTT, bus speed limits are set at [...] in stations and staging areas and [...] between stations. Light rail trains and buses are required {{to wait in the}} tunnels between stations until the platform is cleared of vehicles ahead; buses are mandated to keep a minimum of six seconds of separation between each other.|$|E

5000|$|An audio <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{inside of}} a hearing aid might have one or more loops {{sometimes}} with a phase shift between them near {{the area in which}} a hearing aid user would be present. Many different configurations can be used depending on the application. [...] Such an <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> receiver is classically a very small iron-cored inductor (telecoil), although rediffusion demonstrated a prototype Hall-Effect system in its PLL FM system.|$|R
2500|$|Telecoils or T-coils (from [...] "Telephone Coils") {{are small}} devices {{installed}} in hearing aids or cochlear implants. An Audio induction loop generates an electromagnetic field {{that can be}} detected by T-coils, allowing audio sources to be directly connected to a hearing aid. The T-coil is intended to help the wearer filter out background noise. They {{can be used with}} telephones, FM systems (with neck loops), and induction loop systems (also called [...] "hearing loops") that transmit sound to hearing aids from public address systems and TVs. In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places. In the U.S.A., telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common. Audio <b>induction</b> <b>loops,</b> telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common also in Slovenia.|$|E

50|$|An {{induction}} or {{inductive loop}} is an electromagnetic communication or detection system {{which uses a}} moving magnet to induce an electric current in a nearby wire. <b>Induction</b> <b>loops</b> are used for transmission and reception of communication signals, or for detection of metal objects in metal detectors or vehicle presence indicators. A common modern use for <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> is to provide hearing assistance to hearing-aid users.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{system was}} installed in the Lawns (a hall of residence at Hull University) as a third year project by engineering students. By 1983 the system was fully operational. To cut costs, the students used Coca-Cola bottles as insulation. As a result, by 1993, the <b>loop</b> <b>induction</b> system was no longer functional. In 1994, the engineering team carried out a comprehensive survey {{of the system and}} were able to partially restore it to several of the Lawns halls, as well as fitting a new transmitter to Ferens Hall. The <b>induction</b> <b>loop</b> system was abandoned in 1997 after the award of the LPAM licence.|$|R

40|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>loop</b> {{detectors}} {{have become}} the most utilized sensors in traffic management systems. The gathered traffic data is used to improve traffic efficiency (i. e., warning users about congested areas or planning new infrastructures). Despite their usefulness, their deployment and maintenance costs are expensive. Vehicular networks are an emerging technology that can support novel strategies for ubiquitous and more cost-effective traffic data gathering. In this article, we propose and evaluate VIL (Virtual <b>Induction</b> <b>Loop),</b> a simple and lightweight traffic monitoring system based on cooperative vehicular communications. The proposed solution has been experimentally evaluated through simulation using real vehicular traces...|$|R

The station subsequently became CUR945.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{as complex}} as the vehicle was the {{automated}} system to control the network in operation.

50|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} broadcast from a {{landing in the}} Electrical Engineering Department and carried by <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> {{in all of the}} campus residences. A year after launch the station moved the current studios in Norwood house but still retained the induction loop transmitters, which were updated and expanded as new residences were built on campus. Over the years loudspeakers playing URB were added to the campus laundrettes and the students' union coffee shop. In summer 1994 renovations to the Westwood blocks severed the wires to the loops there and after that URB 963 could only be heard in Eastwood, Wessex and Norwood. On 8 February 2001 at 14:49 1449AM URB launched as a low powered AM service covering the whole campus and the remaining <b>induction</b> <b>loops</b> on 963 were switched off. The addition of online and mobile streaming has also given the station a significant boost.|$|E
