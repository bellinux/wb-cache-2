Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If I can teach you how to hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{presents}} Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated {{centuries before}} by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles {{the issue of}} Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers {{a glimpse of a}} suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration. When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar [...] "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he [...] "started to cry because it was so damn beautiful". He subsequently described the film as a [...] "masterpiece". [...] "It doesn't really matter that [...] didn't want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I wanted it in every respect. He could obviously never do that. The film is his creative process", he said.|$|E

2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks.

[...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you really want it to be.
