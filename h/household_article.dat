25|$|The two Cherokee factions {{offered a}} series of treaty drafts to the U.S. {{government}} with Cooley giving each side twelve stipulations for the treaties. The Pro-Union Cherokee rejected four of those stipulations while agreeing with the rest. While the Southern Cherokee treaty had some support, the treaty offered by Ross' faction was ultimately selected. The Pro-Union faction was the sole Cherokee group that the U.S. government settled treaty terms with. Issues such as the status of Cherokee Freedmen and the voiding of the Confederate treaty were previously agreed upon, and both sides compromised {{on issues such as}} amnesty for Cherokee who had fought for the Confederacy. On July 19, 1866, six delegates representing the Cherokee Nation signed a Reconstruction treaty with the United States in Washington DC. The treaty granted Cherokee citizenship to the Freedmen and their descendants (article 9). The treaty also set aside a large tract of land for Freedmen to settle, with 160 acres for each head of <b>household</b> (<b>article</b> 4), and granted them voting rights and self-determination within the constraints of the greater Cherokee Nation (article 5 and article 10).|$|E
