5|$|Death from {{pneumothorax}} is very uncommon (except <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> pneumothoraces). British {{statistics show}} an annual mortality rate of 1.26 and 0.62 deaths per million person-years {{in men and}} women, respectively. A significantly increased risk of death is seen in older victims and in those with secondary pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial damage}} is usually due to over-stretching the tissues <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> or shear, either {{directly}} by {{expansion of the}} gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian air operations in the country. This occurred following an increase <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> between Russia and Turkey as a result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained full operational capability in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|Some tile {{types that}} retain the Holliday junction's native 60° angle have been demonstrated. One such array uses tiles {{containing}} four Holliday junctions in a parallelogram arrangement. This structure {{had the benefit}} of allowing the junction angle to be directly visualized via atomic force microscopy. Tiles of three Holliday junctions in a triangular fashion have been used to make periodic three-dimensional arrays for use in X-ray crystallography of biomolecules. These structures are named for their similarity to structural units based on the principle of tensegrity, which utilizes members both <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and compression.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. <b>In</b> <b>tension</b> pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|The attacks {{followed}} an increase <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> after the Hall sisters were released at Fort Blue Mounds on June 1. The sisters had been kidnapped during the Indian Creek massacre in May and {{were brought to}} Blue Mounds by a party of Ho-Chunk. Militia leader Henry Dodge became suspicious of the Ho-Chunk and took them prisoner, though they were later released as tension between the Ho-Chunk and white settlers increased. The attacks also lent credence {{to the belief that}} more Ho-Chunk were set to join Black Hawk's war against white settlers in Illinois and Michigan Territory. Though other attacks on the fort were expected they never happened and Fort Blue Mounds served as a supply center for the remaining days of the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} indium, 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal crystal {{system in the}} space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and compression. However {{it does have a}} size effect in bending and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E

5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so often results <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be}} a marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagonal}} {{and vertical}} members form the truss web, and carry the shear stress.

In the truss shown above right, the vertical members are <b>in</b> <b>tension,</b> and the diagonals are in compression.|$|E

25|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a geotextile, geogrid or geocell (all of which are good <b>in</b> <b>tension)</b> into a soil (that is good in compression, but poor <b>in</b> <b>tension)</b> or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.|$|E
