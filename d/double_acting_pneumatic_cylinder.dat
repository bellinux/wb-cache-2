40|$|Servo {{control of}} {{pneumatic}} actuators is difficult {{due to the}} high compressibility and non-linear flow of air. Friction as well as uncertainties in the parameters and model characterizing dynamics of the pneumatic systems further contribute to control challenges. These drawbacks cause stick-slip motion, larger tracking error and limit cycles, which degrades the control performances. Selection of a controller that satisfies requirements of the performing tasks is thus crucial in servo-pneumatic applications. This thesis focuses on the design and experimental evaluation of a model-based, nonlinear controller known as Dynamical Adaptive Backstepping-Sliding Mode Control (DAB-SMC). Originally designed for chemical process control and applied only in simulations, the DAB-SMC is adopted in this thesis and applied to the new area of servo-pneumatic control of a single-rod, <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> and antagonistic pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). The controller is further enhanced by augmenting it with LuGre-based friction observers to compensate the adverse frictional effect presents in both actuators. Unlike other research works, the actuators are subject to a varying load that influences control operations in two different modes: motion assisting or resisting. The implementation of DAB-SMC for such servo-pneumatic control application is novel. The mass flow rates of compressed air {{into and out of}} the actuators are regulated using one of the following valve configurations: 5 / 3 -way proportional directional valve, two 3 / 2 -way of four 2 / 2 -way Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) -controlled valves. Over the entire range of experiments which involve various operating conditions, the DAB-SMC is observed to track and regulate the reference input trajectories successfully and in a stable manner. Average root mean square error (RMSE) values of tracking for cylinder and PAMs when the compressed air is regulated using the 5 / 3 -way proportional valve are 1. 73 mm and 0. 10 °, respectively. In case of regulation, the average steady-state error (SSE) values are 0. 71 mm and 0. 04 °, respectively. The DAB-SMC exhibits better control performance than the standard PID and classical SMC by at least 33 %. The DAB-SMC also demonstrates robustness for up to 78 % in uncertainty of load parameter. When the control valve is replaced by the PWM-controlled valves of 3 / 2 -way and 2 / 2 -way configurations, performance is slightly compromised...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{requirements}} to achieve hypersonic flights, {{as in the}} case of reentry vehicles, pose a serious challenge to the designers. This demands an understanding of the features of hypersonic flow and its effect on hypersonic vehicles. Hypersonic shock tunnels are one of the most widely used facilities for the purpose of obtaining valuable design data by conducting experiments on scaled down models. They are operated by conventional shock tubes by rupturing metal diaphragms placed between the driver and driven sections of the shock tube. Shock tunnels are being extensively used in spite of some of the drawbacks they possess. Due to the varying nature of metal diaphragm rupture, reproducibility of the experiment results is difficult to obtain. Damage to model and inner surface of the shock tube can happen when the diaphragm petal breaks away from the diaphragm. Lastly the time consuming diaphragm replacement process is not desired in applications which require quick loading of shock waves on the specimen. All these disadvantages call for the replacement of the diaphragm mode of operation with a diaphragmless mode of operation for the generation of shock waves. The main objective of the present study is to design and demonstrate the working of a diaphragmless hypersonic shock tunnel. The motivation for the present study comes from the fact that the diaphragmless operation of a shock tunnel has not been reported so far in the open literature. All the research works carried out deal with diaphragmless drivers operating only a shock tube. In the present work, the conventional metal diaphragm is substituted by fast <b>acting</b> <b>pneumatic</b> valves which serve the purpose of quickly opening the driven section of the shock tube to allow the driver gas to rush in, resulting in the formation of a shock wave. To design a diaphragmless driver, a detailed study of the shock formation process is accomplished which helps in understanding the effect of valve opening time on the shock formation distance. Also the theoretical basis for the design of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is understood. Following the theoretical studies, three types of diaphragmless drivers are designed and tested. The first setup incorporates a rubber membrane, which acts as a valve. The rubber membrane when bulged closes the mouth of the driven section and on retraction the driven section is opened to the driver gas. The second and the third setups utilise two different types of <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Experimental results of the three diaphragmless drivers operating a shock tube are analysed and compared with the ideal shock tube theory. Better repeatability in terms of shock Mach number is shown with all three diaphragmless shock tubes when compared with a conventionally operated shock tube. Finally, the best among the three systems is identiﬁed to operate the hypersonic shock tunnel 2 (HST 2) facility of the Shock Waves laboratory, IISc. Demonstration of the working of the diaphragmless shock tunnel is shown by performing heat transfer measurements on a 3 mm backward facing step flat plate model. The experimental results are compared with those obtained in a conventional shock tunnel. CFD studies on diaphragmless shock tube model are done to have an idea on the flow in the shock tube there by identifying the shock formation distance. ANSYS-CFX package is used for this purpose. Further, results from the numerical simulation of hypersonic flow over the backward facing step model are compared with the experimental results thus validating the code...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a nonlinear control strategy for asymmetric actuators. In asymmetric actuators, the generated force/torque is not symmetric in push and pull. Examples of asymmetric actuators are thrusters, shape memory alloy wires, and in general, cables and long rods that cannot be used for compression forces. These actuators are called unidirectional. More complex asymmetric actuators are those that generate uneven push and pull forces. Examples of these actuators are <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> hydraulic and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> in which the area of the piston is not the same in forward and reverse directions. Since in the existing control techniques the actuator is assumed to be symmetric, the application of asymmetric actuators requires new control schemes. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear control method capable of producing any biased input that can be used by asymmetric actuators. The controller is based on quadratic coupling terms with which positive, negative, and any biased input can be generated. We study the stability of the system along with a method to select the controller gains for tuning the output of the controller to match the actuator type. The normal form method and perturbation techniques are used to study the controller design...|$|R

40|$|A {{compressibility}} of the actuating fluid of a {{pneumatic drive}} (compressed air) leads to significant landing of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston {{at the time}} of stop and hold of the load, a constant component of which can fluctuate significantly for the holding period. There are a lot of factors, which {{have a significant impact on}} the landing value of piston. Those are: an initial position of the piston at its stop, which determines the volume of the an active area of the piston, a value of the constant load component {{at the time of}} stop and its variation for the holding period, a transfer coefficient of the position component of the load, an active area of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston, as well as reduction in atmospheric pressure, which can significantly affect the operation of the control systems of small aircrafts flying at high altitudes. To reduce the landing value of piston due to changing value of the constant load component for its holding period, it is proposed to use a hydraulic positioner, which comprises a hydraulic cylinder the rod of which is rigidly connected to the rod of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> through the traverse, a cross-feed valve of the hydro-cylinder cavities with discrete electro-magnetic control, and adjustable chokes. A programmable logic controller provides the hydraulic positioner control. At the moment the piston stops and the load is held the cross-feed valve overlaps the hydro-cylinder cavities thereby locking the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston and preventing its landing. With available pneumatic cylinder-controlled signal the cross-feed valve connects the piston and rod cavities of the positioner hydro-cylinder, the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston is released and becomes capable of moving. A numerical estimate of landing of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston and its positioning quality is of essential interest. For this purpose, a technique to calculate the landing of piston has been developed taking into consideration that different factors, which determine operation conditions of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> have the impact on it. Experimental investigation of piston landing was conducted using the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> with piston and rod diameters of 32 and 16 mm, respectively, at operating pressure of 0. 8 MPa. With a vertical arrangement of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> axis, the control weights of a dead-weight pressure-gauge tester created a constant component of the load and its variation, and an indicator with resolution of 0. 05 mm estimated a landing value. The article shows the calculated data of piston landing, which are in good compliance with the experimental results. To substantially reduce the piston landing for the holding period of the load varying in value and sign was designed a hydraulic positioner of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston, and its operation quality is studied on the physical layout of electro-pneumatic control system operating in the discrete and tracking modes. For control system service, work programs of the programmable logic controller integrated in the control circuit of the hydraulic positioner in discrete mode, and, as a digital discriminator, in tracking mode are developed. In conclusion as a result of the research activities the article estimates the impact of factors on the quality of the load position at the time of its hold and notes a high efficiency of the hydraulic positioner of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston both in discrete mode and in tracking one. </p...|$|R
