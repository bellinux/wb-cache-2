5|$|Horses {{used for}} chariot warfare {{were not only}} trained for combat conditions, but because many chariots were pulled {{by a team of}} two to four horses, they also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to work {{together}} with other animals in close quarters under chaotic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{acquiring}} the Turk, Mälzel <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> its secrets {{and make some}} repairs {{to get it back}} in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk still made appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|E
5|$|Heston and Boyd both <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how {{to drive}} a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome {{and picked up the}} skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 {{he began}} to {{experience}} hip and leg problems; one of his legs had shortened {{an inch and a}} half and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to walk again. Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more and gain more experience. So {{when he returned to}} Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked for about six months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family during those years indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, but he soon moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E

As with other transdisciplinary projects, the need to become familiar with some characteristics of the respective other disciplines is both a challenge and an opportunity. The forensic pathologist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> deal with the possibility of investigating the inside of a body without opening it, the radiologist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> manage forensic questions and postmortem artifacts, and the radiographer <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> cope with dead bodies instead of living patients and adapt examination protocols. This chapter will give the reader the perspective of each of these three practitioners...|$|R
5|$|Chopra also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> jazz {{dance for}} one of the characters. For another song {{featuring}} all twelve characters, Chopra had to shoot for 22 hours to keep the continuity of the whole musical sequence. She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes. Her heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to hospital because of exhaustion and was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it took off the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E
5|$|His role in The Widowmaker lead to {{him being}} offered and taking many obsessive {{character}} roles; he played {{police officers in}} Black and Blue, Framed, Between the Lines and Out of the Blue, and soldier Andy McNab in The One That Got Away (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to play the double bass.|$|E

5|$|In 1526, Portuguese ships {{arrived in}} Mangalore, {{and the number}} of local {{converts}} to Christianity slowly increased. However, a sizeable Christian population did not exist there until {{the second half of the}} 16th century, when there was a large-scale immigration of Christians from Goa to South Canara. They were reluctant to learn the local languages of South Canara and continued to speak Konkani, the language they brought from Goa, so that local Christians <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Konkani to converse with them. After this migration, the skilled Goan Catholic agriculturists were offered various land grants by the native Bednore rulers of South Canara. They observed their traditional Hindu customs in conjunction with the newfound Catholic practices, and preserved their lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|The war also posed {{problems}} for the army commanders, given that, prior to 1914, the largest formation any serving General in the BEF had commanded on operations was a division. The expansion of the British Army saw some officers promoted from brigade to corps commander {{in less than a}} year. Army commanders also had to cope with the new tactics and weapons that were developed. With the move from manoeuvre to trench warfare, both the infantry and the artillery <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to work together. During an offensive, and when in defence, they learned how to combine forces to defend the front line. Later in the war, when the Machine Gun Corps and the Tank Corps were added to the order of battle, they were also included in the new tactical doctrine.|$|E

5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E
5|$|As {{recreational}} facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, Merv {{and his younger}} brothers played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house. Here they played cricket with a tennis ball, home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket. They were usually joined by other local children, two of whom became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven and Harold Shillinglaw. The group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers {{has been attributed to}} these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing. As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of a ball, and a miniature bat. This sharpened their reflexes.|$|E

All the siblings attended the nearby George Street State School and, one by one, the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal to local schools to award to their best cricketer in their ranks, who would then be given access to all of the club's facilities. The Harvey brothers were all recipients of the medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique, something Neil later regarded as beneficial. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty, and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
5|$|In 1680, Zotov {{embarked}} on a three-year diplomatic mission to the Crimea; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter. When Peter left the Kremlin to spend his childhood at Preobrazhenskoye, two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects for a time. He later resumed his studies under Afanassyi Nesterov and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea. Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology, he nevertheless {{learned a great deal}} of the latter from his tutors. Zotov (and later his sons) later worked with Peter to translate books about fortification from a Western European language into Russian. Peter did not learn, or forgot, a great deal about mathematics, a subject that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> properly in his late teens for use in siege warfare and fortification. In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education, and sought to give his daughters Anne and Elizabeth educations equivalent of any European princess.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} animators studied real-life {{animals for}} reference, {{as was done}} for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions {{with an assortment of}} lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity. The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill. The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare—and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish. Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{is at the}} {{beginning}} of language <b>learning.</b> Children <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units – eventually meaningful units – in order to acquire words and sentences. Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging: When you read, there are spaces between the words. No such spaces occur between spoken words. So, if an infant hears the sound sequence “thisisacup,” it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> segment this stream into the distinct units “this”, “is”, “a”, and “cup.” Once the child is able to extract the sequence “cup” from the speech stream it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> assign a meaning to this word. Furthermore, the child <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be able to distinguish the sequence “cup” from “cub” in order <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that these are two distinct words with different meanings. Finally, the child <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> produce these words.|$|R
