5|$|No longer deemed {{politically}} controversial, ao dai {{fashion design}} {{is supported by}} the Vietnamese government. It is often called áo dài Việt Nam to link it to patriotic feelings. Designer Le Si Hoang is a celebrity in Vietnam and his shop in Saigon <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> visit for those who admire the dress. In Hanoi, tourists get fitted with ao dai on Luong Van Can Street. The elegant city of Huế in the central region is known for its ao dai, nón lá (leaf hats), and well-dressed women.|$|E
25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
25|$|Under 50% of the municipality’s {{population}} is economically active, but {{of these very}} few are unemployed. Commerce and services employ {{the largest number of}} people followed by construction and mining. Agriculture is extremely limited due to the very rugged terrain. However, some crops of sorghum, alfalfa, peanuts and fruits are produced. Livestock is produced on a very small scale and includes cattle, goats and sheep. Mining is the economic activity that spurred the founding of the city. However, extraction of minerals today is minimal, with gold and silver ores almost exhausted. Kaolin and lead are still mined. Principle mining companies includes Las Torres, Santa Fe de Guanajuato and El Cubo. The most important segments of the economy now are tourism and commerce. The city’s rich cultural and artistic heritage, along with its colonial area constructions, are what attract visitors. For the rural areas around the city, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> shop for supplies not available at home. This includes foods, auto parts and service, banking services and more.|$|E

50|$|Colchester <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for {{excitement}} in November as the U’s edged two five-goal thrillers {{in the league}} and a seven-goal thriller in the cup.

25|$|Melton {{has several}} pubs, some of which, like the Generous Britain (affectionately {{known as the}} Jenny B) {{continue}} to encourage new live music. The Noels Arms Freehouse is Melton Mowbray District CAMRA Pub of the Year 2014 and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go for fine ales and cider. The Noels also houses Gasdog Brewery {{which is the first}} brewery in the town for over a hundred years. Also gaining great reputation for new and established bands and musicians in Melton Mowbray every Friday and Saturday night, Sunday afternoons sees the pub open to acoustic acts and the now very popular cheese board. There are several other pubs in Melton surviving the latest recession, including one of the oldest establishments in the area, The Anne of Cleves. This ancient building on Burton Street close to St Mary's church has features dating from the early 14th century. Originally home to Chantry Monks the building was taken during the dissolution and given, by Henry VIII to Anne of Cleves as part of the divorce settlement.|$|E
500|$|Morgan and his {{associates}} examined the books of the Knickerbocker Trust, and decided it was insolvent so did not intervene to stop the run. Its failure, however, triggered runs on even healthy trusts, prompting Morgan {{to take charge of}} the rescue operation. On the afternoon of Tuesday, October 22, the president of the Trust Company of America asked Morgan for assistance. That evening Morgan conferred with George F. Baker, the president of First National Bank, James Stillman of the National City Bank of New York (the ancestor of Citibank), and the United States Secretary of the Treasury, George B. Cortelyou. Cortelyou said that he was ready to deposit government money in the banks to help shore up their deposits. After an overnight audit of the Trust Company of America showed the institution to be sound, on Wednesday afternoon Morgan declared, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> stop the trouble, then." ...|$|E
500|$|Rosenberg went on {{to write}} for the {{television}} series Love Monkey (2006) and Dexter (2006–2010). Her job on Dexter, which is broadcast on Showtime, was her first on a show written for cable—she stated in 2007, [...] "Cable <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> be ... it's just wonderful." [...] Rosenberg initially worked as a consulting producer and writer on the first season. She {{and the other members}} of the Dexter writing staff were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for best Dramatic Series at the February 2008 ceremony for their work on the first season. She gained a staff position as co-executive producer and writer for the second season in 2007 and continued in this role for the third season in 2008. The writing staff was again nominated for the WGA award at the February 2009 ceremony for their work on the third season.

30|$|Trainees must realise {{that live}} operating, however, should not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> {{formulate}} surgical skills {{but rather to}} consolidate them. Trainees {{should be able to}} reach competency with the use of instruments and suturing before operating on a live patient. This again highlights the need for simulator- and cadaver-based training. Trainees should also not underestimate the value of assisting during operations.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the warming}} climatic trends since the 1920s, Paamiut {{developed}} a booming cod industry between the 1950s and 1989, {{when the stock}} dwindled. In connection with a development plan called G60 Paamiut was chosen as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live for <b>the</b> entire population of the former Paamiut municipality. Therefore, {{the number of people}} living there rose significantly during that period.|$|R

2500|$|The Western {{typically}} takes {{these elements}} and uses {{them to tell}} simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of John Ford or Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Specific settings include isolated forts, ranches and homesteads; the Native American village; or the small frontier town with its saloon, general store, livery stable and jailhouse and the open desert, {{where there are no}} structures and only windswept sand dunes. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the Wild West: it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often prostitutes), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as Sergio Leone said, [...] "where life has no value".|$|E

50|$|Around {{a century}} ago, {{there was a}} river by the street through which the local merchants {{imported}} exotic foreign goods. The area used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> sell sundry goods and agricultural produce. As the consumption style transformed, the area has evolved into an area to supply primarily on things needed for the Chinese New Year, {{in the types of}} grains, processed farm produce and candies.|$|R

In the late 1980s Sydney Rules Ltd, the company which ran the licence for the club, recorded a profit of $600,000.

60|$|The village <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> {{which the}} roads tend, {{a sort of}} {{expansion}} of the highway, as a lake of a river. It is the body of which roads are the arms and legs,--a trivial or quadrivial place, the thoroughfare and ordinary of travellers. The word is from the Latin villa, which, together with via, a way, or more anciently ved and vella, Varro derives from veho, to carry, because the villa <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> and from which things are carried. They who got their living by teaming were said vellaturam facere. Hence, too, apparently, the Latin word vilis and our vile; also villain. This suggests what kind of degeneracy villagers are liable to. They are wayworn by the travel that goes by and over them, without travelling themselves.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of his professional musical career, Finlay moved from Vancouver to Montreal, hoping to pursue a life as a solo musician. He soon recognized that Toronto <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and moved there in the summer of 2002. While in Toronto he met and played acoustically for Canadian producer Matt DeMatteo, who subsequently decided to work on Finlay’s debut EP. DeMatteo, who had previously worked with Edwin, Big Wreck and Ashley MacIsaac, introduced him at the time to Peter Murray, who became his regular bassist until 2010.|$|R
50|$|By {{the outset}} of <b>the</b> nineties, Nashville <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for a {{migration}} of Singer/Songwriters from Los Angeles, and the city gradually became known for music that mixed country with the folk and soul leanings brought by the influx. In 1990 Norman added his expertise to this emergent trend, producing the breakthrough self-titled Warner Bros/Reprise album by singer/songwriter Beth Nielsen Chapman, which {{was very much in}} the singer/songwriter blend of styles. He resumed duties for Nielsen Chapman's follow-up album You Hold the Key (Warner Reprise, 1993).|$|R
