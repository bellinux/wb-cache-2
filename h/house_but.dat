5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election.

Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in full scale, {{the school}} {{explosion}} used drywall around {{the interior of}} the set to protect it from the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion.

Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E
5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who {{got the idea for}} the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{a decade before}} the tunnel was {{actually}} constructed, a rumor circulated that such a passageway already existed connecting the White House to the Treasury Building.

Harrison tried to rest in the White <b>House,</b> <b>but</b> could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule also made rest time scarce.|$|E
