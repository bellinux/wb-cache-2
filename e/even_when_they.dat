5|$|The {{controversial}} Milgram experiment into obedience by Stanley Milgram {{showed that}} many people lack the psychological resources to openly resist authority, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are directed to act callously and inhumanely against an innocent victim.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|During the French Mandate {{and under}} the {{parliamentary}} régime in Syria, there were reserved seats for the various religious communities, like in Lebanon, including for Armenians. This system is unofficially still living. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> didn't take part as such in elections, Armenian parties such as Dashnak exerted an influence on them.|$|E

5|$|Girls had equal {{inheritance}} {{rights with}} boys if their father died without leaving a will. A Roman mother's {{right to own}} property and to dispose of it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were adults.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1926, {{thousands}} of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians {{would win the}} pennant <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians were only two games behind New York, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind.|$|E
5|$|Object {{permanence}} is {{the understanding}} that objects continue to exist <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied {{in the field of}} developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrived, {{and after}} putting up their horses {{they made their}} way to Monsieur Bertram's. Philip mounted the stairs, leaving Francois to follow him, slowly.|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's {{subspecies}} Anthus petrosus littoralis {{in summer}} plumage is particularly close in outward appearance {{to the water}} pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> occur in the same general area.|$|E
5|$|This line of {{argument}} follows the political philosophy of John Locke in the Two Treatises on Government (1689). Locke wrote that the people {{had the right to}} resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same sovereign rights <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have been conquered by another.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are abundant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Stelling," [...] she said, {{that same}} <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> {{were in the}} drawing-room, [...] "couldn't I do Euclid, and all Tom's lessons, {{if you were to}} teach me instead of him?" ...|$|R
60|$|The feasting and merrymaking {{continued}} {{until late in}} the <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> separated to meet again the next morning and take part in the birthday celebration, to which this royal banquet was merely the introduction.|$|R
60|$|It was {{therefore}} no great surprise to Eustace and Sir Francis Ommaney the next <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> {{were coming back}} on foot from the Louvre, to hear a scuffle {{in one of the}} side streets.|$|R
5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on {{the involvement of the}} irregular major-third.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Barenreiter {{published}} Hellmuth Christian Wolff's edition, {{prepared for}} the 1943 Halle revival and reflecting the casting of basses for Otto and Narcissus, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> sing what would otherwise be the alto part in the last chorus. It presents a German adaptation of the recitatives and written out embellishments for the da capo arias as well as numerous cuts. The B flat fugue G 37 appears as an act II overture along with other instrumental music.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, The New York Times {{created an}} app for the iPhone and iPod Touch which allowed users to {{download}} articles to their mobile device {{enabling them to}} read the paper <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were unable to receive a signal. In April 2010, The New York Times announced it would begin publishing daily content through an iPad app. , The New York Times iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated into a subscription-based model in 2011.|$|E
60|$|Three weeks later, Dick told Annie that {{he loved}} her. He spoke without any circumlocution, merely taking her hand one <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> {{happened}} to be alone together, and telling her so in plain words.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the next}} day Makoma and the giants set out to get poles to build the kraal, leaving only Chi-eswa-mapiri {{to look after the}} place and cook some venison which they had killed. In the <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> returned, they found the giant {{helpless}} and tied to a tree by one enormous hair! ...|$|R

5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds were}} first {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations {{of a bright}} scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped {{the distribution of the}} clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Since 2010, Leicester City's biggest away {{following}} {{was at an}} FA Cup {{match against}} Nottingham Forest at the City Ground in 2012; 8,000 travelling Foxes fans went to the match, with the scoreline finishing 0–0. At home matches, Leicester have gained notability for their atmosphere. Since the club moved to their current stadium in 2002 following the exit of Filbert Street, average home attendances have never dropped below 20,000, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were relegated to League One in 2008 {{for the first time}} in their history.|$|E
6000|$|... {{it was a}} {{dull and}} heavy <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> again sallied forth on their awkward errand. Mr. Winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape observation, and Mr. Snodgrass bore under his the {{instruments}} of destruction.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad that}} we are in the rear-guard," [...] he said to a number of non-commissioned {{officers}} who were one <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were fortunate enough to be camped in a wood, gathered round a huge fire.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Have {{you decided}} what your husband's name is to be?' said the father, laughingly, to his eldest daughter, one <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were all {{sitting at the}} door of their cottage. 'You know that is a very {{important}} point!' ...|$|R
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|The octopus (along with cuttlefish) has {{the highest}} brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates, and is also greater than many vertebrates. It has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is {{localised}} in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal somatotopic map of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department. The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> come from the best of intentions.|$|E
