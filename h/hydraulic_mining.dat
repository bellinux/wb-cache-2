5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining.</b> The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage in two hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} is generally poor due to high temperatures, sedimentation, and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region. Most of these problems are created by human activity; forests and riparian zones have been cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, and high road densities cause slope failures. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion. Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries, sometimes {{to such an extent that}} the mouth is left nearly dry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>mining,</b> which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E

50|$|Sterlingville was a boomtown {{along on}} Sterling Creek in Jackson County, Oregon, United States, once {{home to the}} largest <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mine</b> in Oregon. It has since been {{abandoned}} and destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Then in 1887, {{the area}} {{experienced}} a second boom when Thaddeus Harper built and operated {{the first of}} several <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mines</b> and the town became known as Harper's Camp. One of these mines was also known as Horsefly.|$|R
5|$|The first European Americans {{to visit}} the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. The {{community}} of Buncom was founded by Chinese miners in 1851 when gold, silver, cinnabar, and chromite were discovered in nearby Jacksonville. In the spring of 1854, James Sterling and Aaron Davis discovered gold in the Sterling Creek area, and hundreds of miners soon arrived. The town of Sterlingville was founded, and by October its population had risen to over 1,500. Mining lasted through the 1850s and 1860s, {{and much of the}} riverbeds of Sterling Creek and the lower Little Applegate River were excavated. The Sterling Ditch and several other ditches were constructed in the 1870s, providing water to large <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> operations in Sterlingville and surrounding regions. The Sterlingville mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon, and possibly the entire western United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its use in true mining, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> {{can be used as}} an excavation technique, principally to demolish hills. For example, the Denny Regrade in Seattle was largely accomplished by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vast {{areas of}} {{farmland}} in the Sacramento Valley were deeply buried by the mining sediment. Frequently devastated by flood waters, farmers demanded {{an end to}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining.</b> In the most renowned legal fight of farmers against miners, the farmers sued the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> operations and the landmark case of Edwards Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company {{made its way to}} the United States District Court in San Francisco where Judge Lorenzo Sawyer decided in favor of the farmers and banned <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> on January 7, 1884, declaring that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> was “a public and private nuisance” and enjoining its operation in areas tributary to navigable streams and rivers. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> on a much smaller scale was recommenced after 1893 when the United States Congress passed the Camminetti Act which allowed such mining if sediment detention structures were constructed. This led to a number of operations above sediment catching brush dams and log crib dams. Most of the water-delivery <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> infrastructure had been destroyed by an 1891 flood, so this later stage of mining was carried on at a much smaller scale in California.|$|E

5|$|The mining washed {{hundreds}} of thousands of tons of earth and sediment into the Little Applegate and its tributaries, devastated the landscape. The Sterlingville post office opened in 1879, but was closed four years later as the town's population declined. Buncom's post office opened in 1896. By 1910, however, most mining operations had ended, and it was closed in 1918. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>mines</b> were reopened from 1933 to 1957 during the Great Depression. Three buildings remain in Buncom, but Sterlingville was abandoned and destroyed.|$|R
25|$|Placer mining {{continued}} {{on a small}} scale in the Omineca for many years and then, in the 1890s large companies from Victoria and Ottawa came to the district and began <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> which continued well into the 1900s. The amount of activity fluctuated with gold prices, mining restrictions and economic conditions.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it was the}} Romans who {{developed}} large scale mining methods, especially the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous aqueducts. The water was used {{for a variety of}} purposes, including removing overburden and rock debris, called <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining,</b> as well as washing comminuted, or crushed, ores and driving simple machinery.|$|E
25|$|Violent bandits often preyed {{upon the}} miners, {{such as the}} case of Jonathan R. Davis' killing of eleven bandits single-handedly. Camps spread out {{north and south of}} the American River and eastward into the Sierras. In a few years, nearly all of the {{independent}} miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies, who then hired low-paid salaried miners. As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract, individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs, specialized skills, and mining machinery. Bigger mines, however, caused greater environmental damage. In the mountains, shaft mining predominated, producing large amounts of waste. Beginning in 1852, {{at the end of the}} '49 gold rush, through 1883, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> was used. Despite huge profits being made, it fell into the hands of a few capitalists, displaced numerous miners, vast amounts of waste entered river systems, and did heavy ecological damage to the environment. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> ended when public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice.|$|E
5000|$|During the Spanish {{occupation}} of Peru {{in the early}} 17th century, colonists redirected {{the waters of the}} Moche River to run past the base of the Huaca del Sol in order to facilitate the looting of gold artifacts from the temple. The operation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mine</b> greatly damaged the Huaca del Sol. In total, approximately two-thirds of the structure has been lost to erosion and such looting. The remaining structure stands at a height of 41 meters (135 feet).|$|R
500|$|The La Grange Mine {{which began}} {{operating}} in 1862 on Oregon Gulch, a small creek that {{flows into the}} Trinity, was the biggest <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mine</b> in California, covering over [...] Tailings washed from this single mine buried the valley, the creek and the entire town of Oregon Gulch (which had been purchased by the mine owners in anticipation of this) under a staggering 110 million cubic yards (84,000,000m3) of sediment.

50|$|Mine Zarechnaya (ex- North-Polysaevskaya) is {{the largest}} {{enterprise}} of the group. It was the first <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mine</b> in the USSR. The mine was put into service in August 1953 with an estimated capacity of 150 thousand tons of coal a year. In late 1990s {{due to lack of}} funds for modernization, the mine was scheduled to be closed. In 1998 it was bought by Victor Nusenkis. Today its annual coal production exceeds 5 million tons. Total coal reserves are 299.8 million tons of thermal coal.|$|R
25|$|After the sluice-box stage, {{placer mining}} may become {{increasingly}} large scale, requiring larger organisations and higher capital expenditures. Small claims owned and mined by individuals {{may need to}} be merged into larger tracts. Difficult-to-reach placer deposits may be mined by tunnels. Water may be diverted by dams and canals to placer mine active river beds or to deliver water needed to wash dry placers. The more advanced techniques of ground sluicing, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> and dredging may be used.|$|E
25|$|Such methods {{could be}} very {{effective}} in opencast mining, but fire-setting was very dangerous when used in underground workings. They were made redundant {{with the introduction of}} explosives, although <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> is still used on alluvial tin ores. They were also used to produce a controlled supply to wash the crushed ore. It is highly likely that they also developed water-powered stamp mills to crush hard ore, which could be washed to collect the heavy gold dust.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 20th century, miners dumped staggering quantities of mud and gravel from <b>hydraulic</b> <b>mining</b> operations into the upper Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

This material flowed down the rivers, progressively eroding into finer and finer sediment, until it reached the bay system. Here some of it settled, eventually filling in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay, in decreasing order of severity.|$|E
