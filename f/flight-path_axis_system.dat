Depending on the specific application, different linear <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> have been established. The design process of those systems is based on defined axis mechanics and technological constraints. Its algorithm disallows a comparison of existing and novel linear <b>axis</b> <b>systems.</b> The newly developed linear <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> is characterized by two mechanically coupled, oppositely moving direct drives. In addition to the inclusion in existing linear systems, the work deals with the development and evaluation of a process-oriented development methodology for electromechanical linear axes. The determination of functional relations between different linear axis components and parameters characterizes the methodology. By using these relations {{in the context of}} simulation models, different linear <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> can be designed and compare according to identical process parameters. The dynamic behavior of respective linear <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> is determined based on selected axis components. Subsequently, the servo control is going to be design on it. The individual steps of the design methodology are validated at different linear <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> of various machine tools. Using the design methodology a test rig is setup of the experimental evaluation.

40|$|Laser {{beam welding}} {{applications}} {{are widely used}} in the industry. However, laser beam welding applications have a very small position tolerance to an offset. In this project, the offset {{is defined as the}} distance between the point, which the laser tool welds, and the point which laser tool should weld the weld joint. In other words, the offset is the position error in a welding application. To perform successful welding, the laser beam must hit the exact coordinate of the weld joints to weld the parts together. For dealing with these inaccuracy issues, tool manipulation systems can be used. In this project, an external axis is used for the precise manipulation of the laser beam welding tool as a complement to robotic nominal movement. Input data to the external <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> is obtained from an image from a vision system of the work pieces which need to be welded. Tool manipulation systems are used to manipulate tools to ensure certain position accuracy during any application. The tool manipulation system in this project has two main parts; a seam tracking system (outside this project) and an external <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> The seam tracking system gives an on-line measurement of the offset, {{and that there is a}} feedback loop with a controller, which gives the system information about how much to manipulate the external axis module to the external <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> The seam tracking system consists of two main parts; a camera and the seam tracking image processing program. In the seam tracking system, a camera takes images of the work pieces which shall be welded. Then the seam tracking program calculates the offset by image processing. This estimated offset is the input for the external <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> The external <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> has three main parts; the external axis program, input-output module and the external axis module. The external axis program is the system which controls the input-output module for manipulating the external axis module in this project. The external axis module manipulates the laser beam welding tool by changing the orientation of the tool in order to reduce the offset. This project is about the external <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> There is a relationship between the offset input and the required manipulation angle of the external axis. In this project, the required manipulation angle is the external axis angle. By using this relationship, the laser beam welding tool can be manipulated to weld in the desired position. The same system can be used in applications which require high position accuracy. The evaluation of the external <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> emphasizes that the accuracy demand of the laser beam welding applications can be satisfied by an external <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> However, the investigated external <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> behaves in a way that when the offset is larger than it supposed to be, the speed of the TCP movement slows down...|$|R

40|$|The Denavit-Hartenberg {{parameters}} {{define the}} relative location of successive joint <b>axis</b> <b>systems</b> in a robot arm. A recent justifiable criticism {{is that one}} of these parameters becomes extremely large when two successive joints have near-parallel rotational axes. Geometrically, this parameter then locates a joint <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> at an excessive distance from the robot arm and, computationally, leads to an ill-conditioned transformation matrix. In this paper, a simple modification (which results from constraining a transverse vector between successive joint rotational axes to be normal to one of the rotational axes, instead of both) overcomes this criticism and favorably locates the joint <b>axis</b> <b>system.</b> An example is given for near-parallel rotational axes of the elbow and shoulder joints in a robot arm. The regular and modified parameters are extracted by an algebraic method with simulated measurement data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intuitive, freehand sketching application for Computed Aided Design (CAD) that can reconstruct a 3 D object from a single, flat, freehand sketch. A pen {{is used to}} draw two dimensional sketches consisting of straight and curved strokes connected at vertices. The sketches are processed by a reconstruction algorithm that uses the angular distribution of the strokes, and their connectivity, to determine an orthogonal 3 D <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> whose projection correlates with the observed stroke orientations. The <b>axis</b> <b>system</b> is used to determine a plausible depth for each vertex.
