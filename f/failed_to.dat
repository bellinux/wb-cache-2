5|$|At 1200UTC on October23, about 24hours before Wilma {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to the archipelago, the government of The Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama, and New Providence. The government of The Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion, though many <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> fully prepare, believing Wilma would pass through {{the region as a}} tropical storm. Many homes <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> board windows or apply hurricane shutters, as well. Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island, and established multiple shelters on the island. Evacuations were minimal; it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left. As most people <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> prepare sufficiently for the hurricane, hardware stores and food markets were generally well-stocked.|$|E
