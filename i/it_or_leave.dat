5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave.</b> Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, {{the role}} of Gerry Adams was {{questioned}} by former prisoner Richard O'Rawe, who was the public relations officer inside the prison during the strike. O'Rawe states in his book Blanketmen that Adams prolonged the strike as it was of great political benefit to Sinn Féin and allowed Owen Carron to win Sands' seat. This claim is denied by several hunger strikers and Brendan McFarlane, who was OC inside the prison during the hunger strike. McFarlane claims O'Rawe's version of events is confused and fragmentary, and states [...] "We were desperate for a solution. Any deal that went some way to meeting the five demands would have been taken.

500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't require us to put you in those dormitories. The law doesn't even require us to let you in. You take <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> it."

500|$|Bryant Gumbel on his HBO Real Sports show in October likened Stern's role in {{the lockout}} to a [...] "modern {{plantation}} overseer, treating NBA men {{as if they were}} his boys ... keeping the hired hands in their place". The NBA owners are predominantly white, while the players are mostly black. ESPN noted that William C. Rhoden in his book $40 Million Slaves had earlier dealt with the topic of players as [...] "slaves" [...] in spite of earning millions of dollars. Stern dismissed Gumbel's comments as [...] "an occupational hazard" [...] of being the NBA commissioner. In early November, NBPA attorney Jeff Kessler criticized the owners' [...] "take <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> it" [...] bargaining approach: [...] "instead of treating the players like partners, they're treating them like plantation workers." [...] Hall of Famer Magic Johnson called the comments [...] "ridiculous" [...] and defended Stern's record of promoting blacks. ESPN The Magazine said that the NBPA did not condone Kessler's statements, and they had intentionally avoided getting involved with Gumbel's earlier remarks. Kessler later apologized for his comments.|$|E
500|$|The fifth {{track on}} the record, [...] "Someday", is infused with rockabilly {{elements}} and interlocking guitar lines, the latter a recurring element of Is This It. [...] "Alone, Together" [...] {{is driven by}} a staccato rhythm, and climaxes first with a guitar solo, then {{a repeat of the}} central guitar hook. [...] "Last Nite" [...] is also a guitar-driven song, but leans towards pop music influences. At its core, there are reggae-inspired rhythm guitar lines played by Hammond, and studio noise effects. The rhythm section plays simple interlocking notes and beats. Like [...] "Soma", [...] "Hard to Explain" [...] contains processed drum tracks using dynamic range compression and equalization studio techniques to make them sound like a drum machine. The song incorporates spliced ad-libbing extras from Casablancas, a feature also used on [...] "New York City Cops". [...] "Trying Your Luck", the album's mellowest point, follows and shows more melancholic vocals. The last track on Is This It, [...] "Take <b>It</b> <b>or</b> <b>Leave</b> It", is the only song in which Hammond used the bridge pickup of his Fender Stratocaster guitar.|$|E
500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met {{before a federal}} mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust your gut. I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E

500|$|The McKeevers {{held their}} 25% {{interest}} in the Dodgers until 1975 when Dearie McKeever died. They sold out to O'Malley making him the sole owner of the Dodgers. [...] Also during 1975, the Dodgers franchise was embroiled in the Andy Messersmith controversy {{that led to the}} Seitz decision, which struck down baseball's reserve clause and opened up the sport to modern free agency. Messersmith and the Dodgers were unable to come to contract terms in part because of a then unheard of no-trade clause demand, and Messersmith pitched the entire season without a contract under the reserve clause, which stated that team has the right to extend the prior years contract one year if a player does not agree to terms. Teams had previously had the right to continue such re-signings year after year. This gave owners the right to issue [...] "take <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> it" [...] offers to the players. Although the Dodgers and Messersmith nearly hammered out a deal monetarily, they could not come to terms on the no-trade clause. Supposedly Major League Baseball instructed the Dodgers not to surrender such a clause {{for the good of the}} game. The Seitz decision limited the re-signings to one year, and since Messersmith performed quite well in 1975, winning a Gold Glove Award and leading the National League in complete games and shutouts, while finishing second in earned run average, he was a valuable talent. He earned offers from six different teams. Messersmith became the first free agent, except for Catfish Hunter who had been declared a 1974 free agent by breach of contract. O'Malley felt the price wars would be the downfall of baseball because the fans only have so much money. The scenario led to an eighteen-day lockout during spring training in [...] over the prospect of dozens of players playing becoming free agents and the inability to redesign the reserve clause.|$|E
