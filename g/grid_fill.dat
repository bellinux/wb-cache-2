40|$|This paper {{examined}} the factors influencing the long-term hydraulic performance of some stormwater infiltration systems (swale and {{two types of}} permeable pavements) in Växjö, southern Sweden. The infiltration capacities of 9 permeable pavements and 2 swales sites, all with different ages ranging from 1 year to 14 years, were measured using replicate double ring infiltrometers. The sites were either constructed of swale (2), interlocking concrete pavers (ICP) filled with gravel (2), concrete <b>grid</b> pavers (CGP) <b>filled</b> with gravel (3), or concrete <b>grid</b> pavers (CGP) <b>filled</b> with grass (4). The {{results of this study}} showed that the long-term behaviour of the infiltration capacity relies largely on the type and age of the system and the type of joint filling (gravel and grass). Furthermore, the study showed that the 11 year old concrete <b>grid</b> pavers <b>filled</b> with grass had the highest infiltration capacity (4. 80 + 2. 46 mm/min), whilst the 9 and 14 year old swales had the lowest infiltration capacity (0. 10 + 0. 00 mm/min).

30|$|To {{solve this}} problem, {{advanced}} interpolation algorithms have been proposed. Li et al. estimated local covariance coefficients from an LR image {{and used the}} estimated coefficients to adapt the interpolation effect based on the geometric duality between the pair of LR and High-resolution (HR) image covariance (Li et al. 2001). Zhang et al. proposed the edge-guided nonlinear interpolation using directional filtering and data fusion (Zhang et al. 2006). Giachetti et al. proposed an up-scaling algorithm based on two-step <b>grid</b> <b>filling</b> and iterative correction of the interpolated pixels by minimizing an objective function depending on the second-order directional derivatives of the image intensity (Giachetti et al. 2011).

These advanced interpolation algorithms are, however, unsuitable for a fast digital zooming system which has limiter computational power and memory space.|$|R
40|$|Negative mass {{phenomena}} occurring below a {{cut-off frequency}} is examined by both theoretical and experimental methods. The paper {{begins with the}} investigation on a mass-spring structure, the effective mass of which is shown to be negative below a specific frequency. Due to the decaying nature of lattice waves in the negative-mass system, the transmission drop induced by negative effective mass is demonstrated experimentally. Further investigation is conducted for a rectangular solid waveguide with clamped boundary conditions. It is shown that the lowest bandgap mode of the clamped waveguide {{can be attributed to}} negative effective mass below a cut-off frequency. Based on this observation, elastic metamaterials made of the steel <b>grid</b> <b>filled</b> by styrene butadiene rubber are designed and fabricated.
