50|$|School {{life changed}} tremendously during World War II. Young {{teachers}} were conscripted in 1939 and 1940 so that older teachers taught two {{classes at the}} same time. Additionally, students from the Diesterweg School had been incorporated. Parts of the basement had been converted {{to be used as}} a dugout and were located where the fitness room is nowadays. After the raid on Poland and a growing fear of a chemical warfare, the <b>decontamination</b> <b>squad</b> was deployed in the basement of the school building as well.In January and February 1940, the school had to close because of the freezing temperatures in the classrooms and the absence of heating fuel. Students were required to keep a diary with their experiences about the war and to collect donations. The school garden was used to cultivate vegetables to feed the people.In the school year of 1942 and 1943, sirens were installed on the roof to warn students and people living near the school. If possible, students were sent home after hearing the pre-alarm. At the beginning of 1945, the first refugees came and two classrooms of the boys school were furnished for the homeless. Parts of the girls school served as a sickbay. For 37 classes with up to 40 students each, there were only 20 rooms available anymore. Lessons were shortened or sometimes even shut down because of missing heating fuel.With the beginning of air raids, the school was completely shut down. The bombings destroyed the protectory right next to school and killed 39 children. The windows, the whole tower and parts of the roof were destroyed. Several class rooms caught fire. The upcoming months, only teachers were allowed to enter the school building to start clearing work. 22 students who visited the school, died during the war.|$|E
