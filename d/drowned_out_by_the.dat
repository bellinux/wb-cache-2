5|$|Meanwhile, CEO Robert California (James Spader) surprises Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{when he asks}} to {{join their}} band after he finds them having a jam session in the warehouse. Soon thereafter, California's friends, skilled musicians themselves, arrive to join in. Not having brought their own instruments, two of them take over Kevin's drums and Darryl's synthesizer, while Andy's {{acoustic}} guitar is <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> newcomer's electric guitar. The {{three of them are}} thus relegated to playing percussion. Andy, Kevin and Darryl, with the help of warehouse worker Val, realize that they were ousted, and after a failed attempt to try getting their original band roles back, they instead satisfyingly jam outside by themselves.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 1791, a plot, {{dubbed the}} Flight to Varennes, almost allowed the king {{to escape from}} France. As leader of the National Guard, Lafayette had been {{responsible}} for the royal family's custody. He was thus blamed by extremists like Danton for the near-escape and called a traitor to the people by Robespierre. These accusations made Lafayette appear a royalist, damaging his reputation {{in the eyes of the}} public, and strengthened the hands of the Jacobins and other radicals. Lafayette continued to urge the constitutional rule of law, but was <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mob and its leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
30|$|Hence, in this work, we {{experimentally}} {{determine the}} DR threshold for an ADC with 12 bits quantization resolution and compare our result with the link-budget-based estimations from [3]. We arrange an experimental setup that closely mimics the LTE UL transmission of two UEs {{to a single}} BS. <b>By</b> holding <b>the</b> bandwidth and the channel constant for both UEs, we can adjust the signal strength of which the UEs are received at <b>the</b> BS <b>by</b> adjusting <b>the</b> UE’s transmit powers. In this way, we can realize any arbitrary difference in the receive powers between <b>the</b> two UEs. <b>By</b> observing <b>the</b> weak UE’s bit error rate (BER), we can define the receive power difference at which the weak UE’s signal is <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strong UE’s signal. Based on this measurement, we can compute the DR threshold. Furthermore, we show that the interference scenario {{has an impact on}} the resulting DR threshold as we are using BER measurements to identify when the weak UE is <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strong UE. We estimate the error of the DR threshold measurement and compare it to a link-budget-based estimation.|$|R
3000|$|... 3 GPP {{connects the}} {{in-channel}} selectivity with a throughput requirement: the throughput {{in the presence}} of the interferer shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximal throughput achievable in a reference measurement without the presence of an interferer. This channel-selectivity corresponds to what we define as the DR threshold. However, we have so far defined the DR threshold rather loosely as the DR at which the signal of a weak UE is <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> signal of a strong UE, i.e., we have not defined an exact threshold at which we consider a UE to be <b>drowned</b> <b>out.</b> We define this point in Section 5 under consideration of our experimental setup.|$|R

The multimedia installation, {{which ran}} from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled {{a dark and}} empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with flashes of light, simulating {{the experience of a}} mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with the bustle of traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children’s laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast of President Obama speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).|$|E

[...] When Halleck mentioned Willkie's name, there were initially boos from some delegates, but they were quickly <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> those in <b>the</b> public balconies, who thunderously chanted, [...] "We want Willkie!". Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie, and distributed thousands of standing room passes to Willkie partisans. The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets, but provided one of the convention's most dramatic moments.|$|R
50|$|For many years, he also sang for the Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Bears and Chicago Sting.

25|$|After King Drupada and King Virata were slain by Drona, Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna fought him on {{the fifteenth}} day. Because Drona was very {{powerful}} and inconquerable having the irresistible Brahmanda astra, Krishna hinted to Yudhishthira that Drona would give up his arms if his son Ashwatthama was dead. Bhima proceeded to kill an elephant named Ashwatthama and loudly proclaimed that Ashwatthama was dead. Drona approached Yudhishthira to seek the truth of his son's death. Yudhishthira proclaimed Ashwathama Hatahath, Naro Va Kunjaro Va, implying Ashwathama had died but he was nor sure {{whether it was a}} Drona's son or an elephant, The latter part of his proclamation (Naro va Kunjaro va) were <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> sound of <b>the</b> conch blown <b>by</b> Krishna intentionally (a different version of the story is that Yudhishthira pronounced the last words so feebly that Drona could not hear the word elephant). Prior to this incident, the chariot of Yudhishthira, proclaimed as Dharma raja (King of righteousness), hovered a few inches off the ground. After the event, the chariot landed on the ground as he lied.|$|R

[...] According to The Boston Globe, Bryan [...] "had locked himself within the four walls at the Clifton House, down town, and there blushes unseen. [...] The dark horse is in his stall, feasting on the oats of hope and political straws." [...] Bryan had made no arrangements for formal nominating speeches given the short timeframe, and was surprised when word was brought to him at the Clifton House that he had been nominated by Henry Lewis of Georgia: the candidate had expected the Kansas delegation to name him.

500|$|Jake Coyle of the Associated Press {{was more}} {{critical}} of the film, calling it [...] "terribly overstuffed {{and many of the}} jokes get <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> special effects... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and Guardians depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat." [...] He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "In place of wit, Guardians offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post also had a negative response to the film, comparing it to Howard the Duck and Green Lantern, and criticizing the dialogue, villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax. The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's [...] "poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{positively}} reviewed Shin-shiro, {{with both}} CDJournal and Vibe reviewers noting the strong contrast {{to their first}} two studio albums. Mio Yamada of Vibe wrote that the album was completely different direction to their previous albums, feeling it was more accessible, while CDJournal felt that the album was more [...] "colorful" [...] and [...] "radical". Yamada {{described it as a}} [...] "Sakanaction-style road movie" [...] about finding yourself, while being lonely, anxious and fed up with the tedium of everyday. Shirō Ise of Listen.jp noted the album's [...] "high sense and edgy sound" [...] based on [...] "electronica and guitar rock", while being inspired by a variety of genres such as 1990s alternative rock, new wave, technopop, house, ambient music and African-American music. He praised the fact that despite how many genres the music was inspired by, the band's music did not forget the heart of songs. CDJournal praised the fact that each song stands on its own musically, instead of being <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> album's overarching digital sound. Yuji Tanaka of CDJournal described the album as [...] "dynamic technotronica rock" [...] that fused the feel of live music with four on the floor beats. Alexey Eremenko of AllMusic gave the album four or of five stars, comparing it to the works of Asian Kung-Fu Generation. He felt that Sakanaction created [...] "a fresh version of new wave", and felt that the album was [...] "emotionally cohesive". He felt that none of the songs on Shin-shiro were [...] "big catchy numbers", but felt that this was beneficial for the musical flow. Eremenko, however, criticized the album for being [...] "too lightweight".|$|E

[...] Unquestionably, it’s Madonna and company’s actual show — the entire spectacle of song, dance, style, and attitude — that make the Sticky & Sweet Tour an invigorating and highly memorable happening." [...] However, he felt that the performances of [...] "Borderline" [...] (1984) and [...] "Human Nature" [...] were disappointing. Ben Kaplan from Canada.com said [...] "Sticky & Sweet is a document of a woman in her fifties who actually started peaking after most people thought she was through. Madonna doesn't speak with a British accent on her new record.

[...] He listed the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] (1985) as a highlight of the tour. Tony clayton-Lea from The Irish Times said [...] "Madonna has the experience to know what works and what doesn’t. It is this that makes Sticky Sweet such an interesting proposition: a superbly shot movie of the 'four-act' show that blends muscle with music, depth with deftness." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said [...] "Since so much of the tour depended on overblown spectacle, Sticky & Sweet Tour is better experienced as a video instead of a CD – but even as a video this doesn’t rank among the best Madonna live albums, as there’s too much precision and not enough inspiration in the whole show." ...|$|E
