5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in <b>defense</b> <b>or</b> prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake venom is not used for <b>defense</b> <b>or</b> for competition between members of the same species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E
5|$|Buildings play a {{big role}} in gameplay, as they are used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural <b>defense</b> <b>or</b> as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers.|$|E

5|$|Like {{traditional}} role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts {{features an}} experience point system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, {{gaining access to}} new abilities. Unlike other games of its type, Kingdom Hearts allows a degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found {{at the beginning of}} the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, <b>defense,</b> <b>or</b> magic―for Sora to excel in and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in Final Fantasy games {{is to increase}} character attributes; arming Zidane with a Mythril Vest, for example, increases his base defense statistic. In Final Fantasy IX, weapons and armor include special character abilities, which the character may use when the item is equipped (permitting the ability matches their class). Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle, the ability becomes usable without having to keep the item equipped. In addition to granting abilities the equipment in Final Fantasy IX determines the statistical growth of the characters {{at the time of}} level up. Armor not only raises base <b>defense</b> <b>or</b> evasion statistics but raises defense and/or other statistics at level up.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect the jeep he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in driving the jet ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming the gun {{in order to use}} her weapon — either the grenade launcher or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in <b>defense,</b> <b>or</b> to clear the barrels from their path.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{development}} of coordinated fleets of ships capable of landing an invasion force, naval warfare {{has been an important}} aspect in the <b>defense</b> (<b>or</b> conquest) of maritime states. The first naval battle in recorded history saw Suppiluliuma II of the Hittites burn a Cypriot fleet at sea in 1210 BC. Shortly after, the fleets of the Sea Peoples disrupted the entire Eastern Mediterranean: over a period of about 50 years, raids and invasions violently destroyed nearly every coastal city between Pylos and Gaza. As empires grew and their armies became too large to live off the lands through which they passed, disruption of their supply fleets also became a powerful tactic. The 480 BC Battle of Salamis largely determined the course of the Persian Wars not because of its inherent damage (however considerable) but because Themistocles's deception and superior strategy left the Athenians capable of disrupting sea-borne supplies at will and potentially striking at the pontoon bridges across the Hellespont, cutting off the Persians' line of retreat. During the age of wooden ships, however, great fleets were burdensome to maintain and always liable to destruction by contrary weather, most famously {{in the case of the}} two kamikaze typhoons that destroyed the Mongol invasions of Japan in AD 1274 and 1281.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for <b>defense,</b> <b>or</b> for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Forgotten Realms setting is the {{continent}} of Faerûn, part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, {{the world of the}} Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for <b>defense</b> <b>or</b> conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.|$|E
50|$|As {{one of two}} fighter squadrons of the 1st Fighter Wing, the 27th is tasked {{to provide}} air superiority for United States or allied forces by {{engaging}} and destroying enemy forces, equipment, <b>defenses</b> <b>or</b> installations for global deployment.|$|R
50|$|The 2nd Marine Division's Scout Company reconnoitered Izena Jima {{during the}} night of 23 —24 June 1945, only {{locating}} some 3,000 to 4,000 Okinawa citizens; but no enemy <b>defenses</b> <b>or</b> Japanese defenders. The citizens were quickly processed by military government civil affairs teams.|$|R

5|$|The player {{controls}} only Mario at the journey's beginning. Ultimately, {{the player}} will gain {{a party of}} five characters, though only three members can be used during a battle at any given time. Mario is always in the player's party, but the other two characters can be selected before battles. Each of the five characters has {{a unique set of}} attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool's abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional turn based battle system with the addition of action commands that amplify a move's effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu. The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, <b>defense,</b> <b>or</b> item usage. This {{is one of the more}} innovative features of gameplay, becoming a mainstay of later Mario RPGs.|$|E
5|$|When {{not in a}} dungeon, Link {{explores the}} overworld. In Seasons, the overworld {{consists}} of Holodrum and the subterranean world of Subrosia. The two worlds are linked by several portals. In Ages, Link travels between present-day Labrynna and the past, connected by Time Holes. In either game, some areas of one world are accessible only from portals from the other and vice versa. Holodrum, Subrosia, and Labrynna contain optional side quests and upgrades for Link and his equipment. One such side quest is ring collection; rings provide Link with various bonuses and abilities, such as improved defense. Some rings {{do not have any}} practical uses, e.g. rings that weaken Link's attack or <b>defense,</b> <b>or</b> transform Link into an enemy creature, or are awarded when certain criteria are met but do not have any effect. Another side quest is the optional trading game, in which Link receives and delivers special items to certain people throughout the land. Once completed, Link receives an upgraded sword.|$|E
25|$|When teams {{get a new}} level, {{a player}} can raise some of their units characteristics, such as: attack, <b>defense,</b> <b>or</b> reduce {{maintenance}} costs. When the heroes get a new level, they can get access to new abilities.|$|E
