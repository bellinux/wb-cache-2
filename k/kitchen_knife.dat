He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} {{for the first time to}} detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife.</b> Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{is based}} on a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife.</b> By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife</b> and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E
50|$|The {{composition}} of the stone affects the sharpness of the blade (a finer grain, usually, though not always, produces sharper blades), as does the {{composition of}} the blade (some metals take and keep an edge better than others). For example, Western <b>kitchen</b> <b>knives</b> are usually made of softer steel and take an edge angle of 20-22°, while East Asian <b>kitchen</b> <b>knives</b> are traditionally of harder steel and take an edge angle of 15-18°.

25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife</b> in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife</b> in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E

Prior to the AFC Championship game, Irving Fryar had cut two fingers with a <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife,</b> {{requiring}} them to be put in a cast. At first it was dismissed as a freak accident, but after the conference championship, the truth came out: Fryar's wife, Jacqueline, had slashed him in a domestic incident after Fryar had knocked her down. It was a distraction that, many thought, epitomized the history of these Patriots – coming as it did in what was otherwise to that point the franchise's finest hour.|$|E

Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story.

25|$|While she {{was still}} an infant, Helen's father died from influenza. Helen was raised by her mother, who often blamed her husband's death on the birth of Helen. She {{believed}} that God had taken her husband because she had wished so much for a baby girl. Helen had three older brothers: Harry, Ed, and Sam. The family relocated to Brooklyn when Helen was in her early teenage years. Her mother married a house painter, a man that Helen disliked. Soon, Helen's mother and stepfather turned the family's home into a brothel. At age 14, Helen was nearly raped by her stepfather. Helen defended herself with a <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife,</b> injuring him. Following this, she was permitted by her mother {{to live with her}} piano teacher, Honey Silverman, and her family. While teaching her piano, Honey noticed Helen's singing ability and encouraged her to focus on singing instead.

25|$|Linda and Charlotte then dragged Noor's corpse {{into the}} {{bathroom}} where they began to dismember the remains. Noor's head, limbs and penis were severed using a <b>kitchen</b> <b>knife</b> and hammer. They put towels over his legs to stem the flow of blood. The dismemberment took a number of hours and the body parts were placed in black plastic bags and a sports bag before being disposed of in the Royal Canal. This took the three women several trips. They decided not to throw the head in to prevent identification. The head was brought by bus to Tallaght where they walked through The Square Shopping Centre to Tymon North Park. They walked to where Charlotte dug a hole with a knife to bury the head. Kathleen Mulhall threw the knives and the hammer into a nearby pond. A number of days later, Linda Mulhall allegedly returned {{to the park and}} dug up the head.
