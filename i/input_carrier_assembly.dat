50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two locking rollers, a striker sleeve and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and <b>carrier</b> <b>assembly</b> forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt <b>carrier</b> and striker <b>assembly</b> recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|R
50|$|The NEGEV is striker-fired, {{where the}} bolt <b>carrier</b> <b>assembly</b> {{acts as the}} striker, and fires from an open bolt position. A lever-type fire control {{selector}} switch is provided (“A”— for fully automatic fire and “R”— for semi-automatic fire), installed {{on the left side}} of the pistol grip, which doubles as a manual safety against accidental firing. The safe “S” position disables the sear mechanism (which makes it impossible to cock the bolt carrier), by lifting the lever responsible for holding the bolt carrier in the forward position and disconnects the trigger mechanism from the sear. The weapon can be secured safe regardless of the position of the bolt carrier group. The cocking handle is equipped with a ratcheting mechanism that immobilizes the partially cocked bolt carrier.|$|R
5000|$|With a short-stroke or tappet system, {{the piston}} moves {{separately}} from the bolt group. It may directly push the bolt group parts as in the M1 carbine or operate through a connecting rod or assembly as in the Armalite AR-18 or the SKS. In either case, the energy is imparted in a short, abrupt push and {{the motion of the}} gas piston is then arrested allowing the bolt <b>carrier</b> <b>assembly</b> to continue through the operating cycle through kinetic energy. This has the advantage of reducing the total mass of recoiling parts compared to the long-stroke piston. This, in turn, enables better control of the weapon due to less mass needing to be stopped {{at either end of the}} bolt carrier travel.|$|R
