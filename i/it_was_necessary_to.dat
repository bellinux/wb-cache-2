Harrison claimed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so {{that the federal government}} would not longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E

5|$|Two {{raids on}} Indiana soil {{during the war}} caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and {{southern}} Indiana. The Newburgh Raid on July 18, 1862, occurred when Confederate officer Adam Johnson briefly captured Newburgh by convincing the Union troops garrisoning the town that he had cannon on the surrounding hills, {{when in fact they}} were merely camouflaged stovepipes. The raid convinced the federal government that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> supply Indiana with a permanent force of regular Union Army soldiers to counter future raids.|$|E
5|$|A new women's {{suffrage}} {{bill was}} introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on 21 August 1946. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> wait {{more than a}} year before the House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights between men and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Perón signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.|$|E

5|$|Advocacy of such {{a nation}} became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was {{observed}} on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> work towards it.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{returned}} {{to the front lines}} in early April. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard. On 2 May, the regiment's A Company was the leading element of the 2nd New Zealand Division and entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders at all.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons. In {{the face of the}} destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the nuclear arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons. The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E

5|$|Anton was a {{scientist}} in Nazi Germany who, following a disagreement regarding {{the direction of}} its nuclear program, is recruited by the US and flees via France, Spain, and Portugal.

Anton regrets the consequences of the atomic bombs, attends the Pugwash Conference, but maintains his belief that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> end the war and prevented more deaths.

5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only {{consists}} of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building a large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building a small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built {{at the location of}} the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Muhammad {{married the}} wealthy Khadijah bint Khuwaylid who was 40 years old. The {{marriage}} lasted for 25years and was a happy one. Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad {{is said to have}} asked for arrangements to marry both. Muhammad's marriages after the death of Khajida were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans whom <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> honor and strengthen alliances with.|$|E

30|$|Because high nitrate {{concentrations}} in water can cause different health problems, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> protect drinking {{water in the}} study area. High nitrate concentrations are associated with improperly located wells. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> locate new wells uphill and least 20  m from feedlots, septic systems, barnyards and chemical storage facilities. Monitoring of nitrate in the tested wells should be continued, and specific rehabilitation measures of wells to end users should be proposed.

5|$|Before the {{designation}} of SR78, a road known as the Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway (connecting Oceanside, Escondido, Ramona, Julian, Westmorland, and Brawley) existed during the early twentieth century. This road roughly followed the current routing of SR78 from Escondido {{to the east of}} Brawley, although it traveled along a different routing from Westmorland into Brawley. No road connected Brawley with Glamis in 1919; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> travel north through Calipatria to reach Blythe. East of the Sand Hills, there was a road from Glamis passing by Smith Well into Palo Verde, which roughly follows the routing of SR78.|$|E

5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and {{will no doubt be}} identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> extend the limits of censorship.|$|E

In April 1809, these ships were HMS Amethyst and , loosely supported by other patrolling ships and tasked specifically with the capture of Niémen, acting on intelligence passed on by the Admiralty. When Niémen emerged on 5 April, she was immediately spotted and chased. Amethyst retained contact throughout the night and brought the French ship to action on the morning of 6 April.
