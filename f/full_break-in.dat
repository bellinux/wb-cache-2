50|$|<b>Full</b> <b>break-in</b> or QSK operation, is a {{hardware}} supported Morse code communications channel turn over communications protocol. <b>Full</b> <b>break-in</b> is a so-called duplexing protocol, that facilitates {{a style of}} two-way Morse code communications on traditional half-duplex radiotelegraph channels that closely simulates full-duplex channel operations {{similar to the way}} normal human voice communications proceeds.|$|E
5000|$|QSK - [...] "I {{can hear}} you during my transmission" [...] - refers to a {{particular}} mode of Morse code operating often called QSK operation (<b>full</b> <b>break-in)</b> in which the receiver is quickly enabled during the spaces between the dits and dahs, which allows another operator to interrupt transmissions. Many modern transceivers incorporate this function, {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> as against semi-break-in {{in which there is a}} short delay before the transceiver goes to receive.|$|E
50|$|Although not as {{fluid and}} {{efficient}} as <b>full</b> <b>break-in,</b> semi break-in or VOX controlled break-in {{is a better}} Morse code channel turn over technique than pure manual break-in operation {{as described in the}} following paragraph.|$|E
50|$|Semi {{break-in}} is {{a technique}} used by stations where slow (T/R) antenna switches are controlled indirectly by the telegraph key which lack the faster switching of <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> stations. Semi break-in hardware T/R switches {{are not required to}} switch as fast or to have the same long term reliability as their more expensive <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> counterparts. Instead of using the telegraph key to directly control antenna switching, semi break-in radio transceiver equipment typically uses the telegraph key to control T/R switches indirectly, but still automatically, by passing the telegraph key information (usually {{in the form of a}} keyed audio tone) through a radio transceivers Voice-operated switch or VOX circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|Turning over a {{communications}} channel {{is the change}} in communications protocol transmission status that occurs when a transmitting station releases transmitting control of {{a communications}} channel thus turning it over to allow another station to transmit. QSK or <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> operation {{is one of several}} techniques and protocols for turning over control of a Morse code radiotelegraph communications channel. Usually the transmitter of a radiotelegraph station is manually controlled by an operator using a telegraph key. QSK is a three-letter code group {{that is one of the}} numerous Morse code three-letter code groups belonging to the venerable International Q-code established for radiotelegraph operators in the first decade of the 1900s. The three letter code group QSK literally means [...] "I can hear you between my signals; you may break in on my transmission." [...] Because of this, <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> operation is often referred to as QSK operation. Although radiotelegraphy and Morse code is no longer used for commercial or professional purposes it continues to thrive and grow in the amateur radio community hobby. Today's modern era radio amateurs seem to be as interested in so-called <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> or QSK operation as professional operators were in the early twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Full</b> <b>break-in</b> or QSK {{operation}} {{is a technique}} and protocol used on radiotelegraph half-duplex channels that closely approximates the feeling of operating on a full-duplex channel. e.g. It appears to the QSK operators half-duplex operators that both directions can be used simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|The mid-symbol {{listening}} and interruption capability {{provided by the}} short but ubiquitous Morse code silent periods during QSK or <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> operation on half-duplex radiotelegraph channels creates the illusion of apparent continuous two-way contact allowing radiotelegraph operators {{to feel as if}} they are sharing a full duplex channel.|$|E
50|$|With QSK or <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> {{operation}} {{the ubiquitous}} silent periods of the Morse code, enables Morse operators to listen between their transmitted signals as they send Morse code using the radiotelegraph station telegraph key, and thus enables a fluid conversational style of high speed communications between skilled CW operators that closely approximates {{the style of}} normal human voice communications.|$|E
50|$|Switching {{hardware}} {{technologies that}} can handle the radio frequency currents of high power transmitters and also switch quietly at these high Morse code rates {{over long periods of}} time are difficult to design and quite expensive to manufacture. Mechanical switches or relays are the most problematic and least reliable and must be protected from arcs (sparking) usually by operating in a vacuum enclosure with elaborate timing circuitry. Not all radio transceiver equipment provides the costly high speed analog transmit/receive (T/R) radio frequency switching hardware support necessary for QSK <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> operation. Generally <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> is available only on more expensive radio transceivers. Radiotelegraphers who aspire to the fluency of Morse code QSK operation must ensure that their radio equipment includes the hardware capability for radio frequency antenna switching that operates rapidly enough to allow listening between signals at the appropriate Morse code sending speeds with appropriate lifetimes and reliability.|$|E
50|$|The {{aforementioned}} considerations: (i) {{prevention of}} receiver desensitization during transmit periods, (ii) {{prevention of damage}} or destruction of receiver AFE input circuitry during transmit periods, (iii) enabling transmitting stations to listen between signals and, (iv) providing efficient, fluid and fluent two way communications on half-duplex radiotelegraph channels, are the four prime motivations and considerations driving the development of radiotelegraph channel <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> QSK technologies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Full</b> <b>break-in</b> {{hardware}} capability requires fast, robust, high power, analog, {{radio frequency}} (RF) transmit/receive (T/R) switches or RF switches capable of operating in sub-millisecond response times {{over long periods}} of continuous operation while handling the high radio frequency power of the transmitter. Some high-end manufactured radio transceiver equipment contains integrated (factory installed) QSK switching hardware while in other cases external QSK switching hardware or commercial switching products may be added to existing non-QSK capable equipment.|$|E
50|$|Receiving {{stations}} {{wishing to}} break-in on semi break-in stations must {{wait for the}} longer silent periods between the sending stations words or sentences before attempting to interrupt or break-in. At worst, receiving stations must wait until semi break-in stations explicitly turn over the channel to the receiving station by sending a break prosign. Unlike <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> operation, semi break-in operation is not fast enough to provide a fluid Morse code conversational capability approximating that of normal human voice conversation.|$|E
50|$|Silent periods are {{the most}} {{important}} Morse code element for supporting <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> or QSK operation. The Morse code silent periods of approximately: one dot duration between Morse code signals, three dot durations between symbols, and five dot durations between words or code groups and sentences provide operators with: mid-symbol, mid-word and mid-sentence, opportunities to interrupt or break-in on transmitting operators. These silent periods between signals, symbols and words also provide the sending operator with opportunities to listen for interruptions from receiving stations.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to all {{automatic}} control system the time dynamics of AGC operation may be important in many applications. Some AGC systems are slow {{to react to the}} need for gain changes, others may react very rapidly. An example of an application where fast AGC recovery time is required is in receivers used in Morse code communications where so-called <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> or QSK operation is necessary to enable receiving stations to interrupt sending stations mid-character (e.g. between dot and dash signals).|$|E
50|$|Although simple in concept, the {{detailed}} {{design of the}} hardware RF T/R switches and the mechanisms to allow automatic control of the T/R switches for QSK operation from {{the actions of the}} associated telegraph key is a non-trivial engineering exercise and necessarily involves somewhat more expensive componentry than found in stations without <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> capability. These design difficulties and stringent requirements are due to factors such as: the vast signal ranges encountered by the switches, switch power handling requirements, switch speed requirements, switch reliability requirements, and receiver gain control recovery speed requirements, all of which are briefly outlined in following paragraphs.|$|E
50|$|QSK {{operation}} comprises {{a hardware}} switch technology and protocol wherein participating Morse code stations {{are equipped with}} very fast analog radio frequency T/R switches connecting the transmitter, receiver and antenna. This fast analog hardware switching capability enables a receiving station to interrupt or break-in on a transmitting station in mid-symbol (mid-character), {{a process known as}} <b>full</b> <b>break-in.</b> The ability to hear between transmitted signals conferred by fast radio frequency hardware switching only requires Morse code operators to make use of simple communications protocols to manage the channel turn over process. The typical QSK protocol technique is quite simple to learn and to master.|$|E
50|$|On {{half-duplex}} channels {{the radio}} station: receiver, transmitter, and antenna or antennas are usually interconnected by so-called transmit/receive or (T/R) switches that effectively connect and disconnect {{the receiver and}} transmitter from the antenna or antennas {{as required by the}} radiotelegraph channel protocol in use. T/R switches may be controlled by a variety of techniques. Typical T/R switch control methods and protocols are: manual operation, automatic semi break-in operation and automatic <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> operation. T/R switches are analog high power radio frequency or RF switch devices which may take many practical forms ranging all the way from simple mechanical manually operated knife switches to fully automated modern semiconductor devices.|$|E
50|$|With <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> or QSK {{operation}} {{the fast}} analog radio frequency hardware antenna change over transmit/receive (T/R) switches are controlled automatically {{in real time}} directly {{by the actions of}} the telegraph key with which the operator is originating the Morse code information. With radiotelegraph communications, so-called QSK operation enables a fluid style of half-duplex channel control based upon the capability, as provided by the QSK hardware T/R switches, for a receiving operator to interrupt a sending operator in mid-character, during any of the ubiquitous silent periods between Morse code signals, {{in a manner similar to}} the way in which normal human voice conversations allow mid-syllable interruption of speakers by listeners.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} on-off keying (OOK) the Morse code {{consists}} of either signal or no signal respectively either state {{of which may}} persist over time {{in a variety of}} epochs measured in terms of the basic dot signal duration. All Morse code (symbols) information is then seen to be composed of unique sequences of these three basic elements, namely: the dot signal, the dash signal, and the silent period; the time extent of each of these three basic elements being measured in terms of the dot duration. The ubiquitous silent periods or off periods that always occur between Morse signals represent the most important characteristic of Morse code utilized opportunistically by QSK or <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> operation to facilitate fluid Morse code conversations.|$|E
50|$|Since not all Morse code radio {{stations}} are equipped for QSK operation, sending stations equipped for QSK operation will often open a Morse conversation by sending the three letter group QSK (e.g. the operator will assert QSK) during an initial (opening) Morse code transmission to alert receiving stations that the sending station {{has the ability}} to listen between signals and that the receiving station can interrupt, or break-in, on the sending station at will. Conversely a station may query another Morse code station's QSK capability by sending the QSK signal followed by a question mark. The query QSK? asks if the receiving station has <b>full</b> <b>break-in</b> capability. If a receiving station is equipped for QSK operation the receiving operator will respond to the query QSK? with the assertion QSK indicating that the station has QSK capability. Subsequently, the two stations can then utilize the fluid and efficient Morse code conversational QSK protocols outlined in the following paragraphs.|$|E
