5|$|A {{complete}} {{remake of}} the original arcade game on the Game Boy, named Donkey Kong or Donkey Kong '94 contains levels from both the original Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. arcades. It starts with the same damsel-in-distress premise and four basic locations as the arcade game and then progresses to 97 additional puzzle-based levels. It is the first game to have built-in enhancement for the Super Game Boy accessory. The arcade version makes an appearance in Donkey Kong 64 in the Frantic <b>Factory</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement <b>factory</b> <b>level,</b> {{while most of the}} console versions did not. None of the home versions of Donkey Kong had all of the intermissions or animations from the arcade game. Some have Donkey Kong {{on the left side of}} the screen in the barrel level (like he is in the arcade game) and others have him on the right side.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{created a}} greatly {{simplified}} version for the Game & Watch multiscreen. Other ports include the Amiga, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC booter, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to Nintendo's Family Computer (Famicom) console in 1983 {{as one of}} the system's three launch titles; the same version was an early title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). However, the cement <b>factory</b> <b>level</b> is not included, nor are most of the cutscenes since Nintendo did not have large enough cartridge ROMs available in the beginning. This port includes a new song composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the title screen; an arrangement of the tune appears in Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Animal Crossing for the GameCube and as an item for purchase on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U version is also the last game that was released to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Japanese version of the NES, the Famicom. The original arcade version of the game appears in the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64. Nintendo released the NES version on the e-Reader and for the Game Boy Advance Classic NES series in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The Famicom version of the game sold 840,000 units in Japan.|$|E

For example, some product groups, which were {{previously}} grouped under one Implementation Rule, are now divided and subject to some different Implementation Rules. Furthermore, new products have been added, which are now subject to the mandatory certification. Further <b>factory</b> <b>levels</b> were introduced, so that the companies that carry out a product certification will be assigned a level (A-D) in future. Companies that receive particularly positive results on their products certification will receive level A.|$|R
5000|$|All three V8 {{models were}} powered by Toyota's {{acclaimed}} 1UZ-FE quad-cam all-alloy 4-litre V8. While producing marginally less {{power and torque}} than the turbocharged JZZ30 ( [...] at 5400 rpm, 353 Nm at 4600 rpm) the V8, called the 4.0GT-L was renowned for its smoothness and refinement. Although receiving a minor update in 1995 which improved responsiveness and bumped outputs to [...] / 363 Nm, production of the V8-equipped Soarers ended before the powerplant received VVTi which substantially increased outputs in the Lexus SC400 and other models. However, supercharged and turbocharged modifications have become increasingly common given the strength and durability of the engine, and power outputs up to double the <b>factory</b> <b>levels</b> are being seen on internally standard engines.|$|R
25|$|In 1919, {{the federal}} {{government}} launched a campaign to recolonize parts of the German interior including in Silesia, and new provisions for maternity were introduced. In February 1920, an industrial relations law was passed, giving workers in industry legally guaranteed representation, together {{with the right to}} co-determination in cases of hiring and firing, holiday arrangements, the fixing of working hours and regulations, and the introduction of new methods of payment. A Socialisation Law was also passed, while the government adopted guidelines on the workers' councils. In addition to workers' councils at national, regional, and <b>factory</b> <b>level,</b> the government made provision for economic councils in which employers and employees would work together on matters affecting {{the economy as a whole}} (such as nationalisation) and lend support to the Weimar parliament.|$|E
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a <b>factory</b> <b>level.</b> In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the <b>factory</b> <b>level.</b> These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E

25|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve environmental conditions and to safeguard the environment, the Federal Emission Control Law established the basis for taking of legal action against those responsible for excessive noise and air pollution, the Works’ Constitution Act and Personnel Representation Act strengthened the position of individual employees in offices and factories, and the Works’ Safety Law required firms to employ safety specialists and doctors. An amendment to the Labour Management Act (1971) granted workers co-determination {{on the shop floor}} while the new Factory Management Law (1972) extended co-determination at the <b>factory</b> <b>level.</b> This Act acknowledged {{for the first time the}} presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils. A law was passed in 1974 allowing for worker representation on the boards of large firms, although this change was not enacted until 1976, after alterations were made. In 1974, redundancy allowances in cases of bankruptcies were introduced. The Federal Law on Personnel Representation, which came into force in April 1974, gave increased co-management rights to those employed in factories and offices in the public sector. The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.|$|E

2500|$|Early in 1983 VAM {{was taken}} over by Renault from the Mexican {{government}} and a fairly reduced VAM passenger car line appeared for the year, mainly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories and to fulfil the previous agreements with sourcing companies as well as delivering the existing individual customer orders. The VAM Gremlin was carried over for 1983, becoming the last-ever AMC Spirit sedan model produced. This body style lasted one full year after AMC's dropped its equivalent from the U.S. lineup. At a <b>factory</b> <b>level,</b> the 1983 Gremlin was restricted to the base model with three-speed manual transmission only. It was practically the same as in the prior year with the only exception of incorporating dual remote mirrors and bumper guards as standard equipment. However, at a dealership level virtually all previous accessories were still available as either individual options or packages including those of the X model.|$|E

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Despite studies that {{consider}} service level rates of individual factories in a supply chain system, the interactions between connected factories {{and the impact of}} these interactions on the overall supply chain service level rate have been rarely studied. Moreover, due to uncertainties induced by various sources such as transportation delay and manufacturing processes variability, ensuring the robustness of system service level rate while considering these uncertainties in individual factories is a highly complex task. This paper studies uncertainty effect introduced by <b>factory</b> service <b>level</b> rates on the robustness of overall supply chain network performance, and presents a novel robust design optimization methodology to derive designs of <b>factory</b> service <b>level</b> rates in order to satisfy the service level rate requirement of the system and ensure its robustness.

40|$|Reducing {{resource}} consumption {{has been}} a major aspect in the optimization of manufacturing systems in recent years. Yet, the assessment of energy efficiency potentials at the interfaces of machinery, auxiliary equipment and technical building services has attained insufficient attention, especially in planning methodologies for factory remodelling and expansion. Here we show the development of a methodological approach to assess energy saving potentials through an interconnection of different <b>factory</b> <b>levels.</b> In this context, on-site renewable energy production, energy storage and waste heat recovery can be identified as key-enabling strategies. Consequently, tools to evaluate potential fields for their application are presented. Applying the developed methodology and tools in first industrial use-cases revealed energy savings of 9 % and a possible reduction of installed heating capacities of 43 %. Our findings demonstrate that for an energy- and cost-efficient operation of existing factories in the future, planers and optimizers need to consider energy efficiency potentials at the interfaces of machinery, auxiliary processes and technical building services...|$|R
