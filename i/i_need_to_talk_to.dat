40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of individuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder do not seek or receive effective treatment. Understanding the reasons why an individual chooses to seek treatment or prefers one treatment to another is a critical step to improve treatment seeking. To begin to understand these reasons, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the reasons women gave for choosing a cognitive-behavioral treatment, prolonged exposure (PE), or a pharmacological treatment, sertraline (SER). A community sample of women with trauma histories were asked to view standardized rationales, to choose among PE, SER, or no treatment, and to give 5 reasons for their choice. Women {{indicated that they were}} more likely to prefer the psychotherapy to the medication. Across reasons given, the most commonly cited reason for treatment preference highlighted why or how the treatment worked (e. g., <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it); and this reason emerged as the strongest predictor of preference for PE. Understanding this role of perceived treatment mechanism may aid clinicians and public health policy officials to identify and address help-seeking barriers regarding treatment. Female survivors of sexual or nonsexual assault often are unlikely to seek help for assault-related psychological symptoms (Amaya-Jackson et al., 1999; Kimerling & Calhoun, 1994; Solomon & Davidson, 1997).

We passed her water bottle back and forth again, and I {{looked over at her}} face, studying it for longer than a comfortable second. She had a placid look, almost like she was finally at a place where she felt comfortable. I suddenly felt an intense urge to say something to her.

For a few more moments we sat and took all the scenery in, and after a while, my mother suggested we start heading back down the trail to the car. She didn't want me to have to waste my whole day out hiking when I could be doing something fun with friends. I quietly tried to protest, but I just held my tongue. I took one last look out over Rattlesnake Ridge and hoped that maybe my mom and <b>I</b> didn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> things over. <b>I</b> hoped that <b>I</b> didn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> say all those things for her to know them. Regardless of what I said or didn't say, I thought that our yearly reunions on Rattlesnake meant something. The annual pilgrimage I made for my mother teetering to the ledge looking over the plummeting abyss was a testament of our bond together. I know this feeble gesture isn't the same, but maybe, hopefully, it's enough...|$|R
40|$|To my advisor, Dr. Kingsley. Your {{constant}} {{support and}} guidance {{is something that}} I cannot thank you enough for. It has truly given me a passion to continue in this line of research and without your ongoing encouragement, I {{would not have made}} it this far. Thank you. To my committee, Dr. Finch, Dr. Kuhlman, and Dr. Yeargin. Your seemingly endless stream of advice and feedback has been invaluable, and has led me to a body of work that I can be proud of. I can‟t thank you all enough. To my parents. Thank you for providing me the opportunity to be here in the first place. It is your continued and unwavering support that has allowed me to accomplish my goals while being so far from home. I will be forever grateful. To my brother, Gaven. Thank you for being there for me whenever <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> someone <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> in spite of having to cope with everything you and Rhonda have been through the last year. You‟ve been an inspiration. Kia kaha. To Ashley. Thank you for putting up with me through this whole process. How you deal with my constant over analyzing is beyond me, but nevertheless, I couldn‟t have done this without you by my side. To my fellow students who helped me along the way. I can‟t thank you guys enough for helping me get to this point, even if it was only by doing something seemingly small. Every little bit of help I received was invaluable, and I thank you all for giving up your time to help out one of your own. Matthew A. TuckerKingsley, J.

5000|$|In early 1951, Wolff {{presented}} Cage {{with a copy}} of the I Ching—a Chinese classic text {{which describes}} a symbol system used to identify order in chance events. This version of the I Ching was the first complete English translation and had been published by Wolff's father, Kurt Wolff of Pantheon Books in 1950. The I Ching is commonly used for divination, but for Cage it became a tool to compose using chance. To compose a piece of music, Cage would come up with questions to ask the I Ching; the book would then be used {{in much the same way}} as it is used for divination. For Cage, this meant [...] "imitating nature in its manner of operation": His lifelong interest in sound itself culminated in an approach that yielded works in which sounds were free from the composer's will:When I hear what we call music, it seems to me that someone is talking. And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships. But when I hear traffic, the sound of traffic—here on Sixth Avenue, for instance—I don't have the feeling that anyone is talking. I have the feeling that sound is acting. And I love the activity of sound ... <b>I</b> don't <b>need</b> sound <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|R
