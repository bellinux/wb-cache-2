40|$|Background: Hodkin s {{lymphoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent lymphoma in western world. Despite an overall good prognosis some patients suffer relapsing tumors which are difficult to cure. Over a long period Vitamin D has been shown to be a potential treatment for cancer. Vitamin D acts via the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor, acting as an inducible transcription factor. We aimed to investigate the expression of vitamin D receptor as potential therapeutic target structure in <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> as well as in non <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Methods: We used a panel of 193 formalin fixed tissues of lymphoma cases consisting of 55 cases of <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and 138 cases on several non <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> entities. Results: Vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> regardless of the subentity with an overall positivity of 80...|$|E

40|$|Each cell in HIV-associated primary {{central nervous}} system {{lymphoma}} (PCNSL) harbors latent EBV. Notably, the triggering of TLR 9, a key event in HIV pathogenesis, also promotes EBV latency and transformation. We hypothesized that because {{only a minority of}} HIV-infected patients develops PCNSL, their B cells exhibit aberrant signaling responses to TLR 9 triggering. We found higher levels of IL- 6, CD 80, and CD 86 expression at baseline in B cells of those patients than in B cells of matched controls, whereas TNF-a expression was lower. Notably, on TLR 9 triggering with CpG 2006, CD 80 and TNF- were up-regulated to a lesser extent in B cells of the former than in those of matched controls. The reduced up-regulation of CD 80 might be explained by its higher baseline expression resulting in a more blunted response rather than a specific deficit of the signaling response to TLR 9 triggering. However, this cannot explain the blunted TNF- response, which warrants further investigation. Finally, since increased IL- 6 expression is linked to EBV-associated <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> the enhanced baseline expression of IL- 6 might be important in the pathogenesis of PCNSL in HIV-infected patients...|$|E

40|$|Background: It is {{now well}} {{established}} that Hodgkin cells are clonal B cells with a CD 30 and CD 15 phenotype.

40|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{multifunctional}} cells that play {{important roles in}} health and disease. They are long lived cells with the capacity to be activated several times. Upon activation mast cells release a huge array of mediators. The nature of the mediators released {{is dependent on the}} stimuli. The microenvironment in which the mast cell resides determines its phenotype and modulates its function. The aims of this thesis were to study the phenotype and role of mast cells in different chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly the importance of activation via CD 30 L/CD 153 and the effects of hypoxia on mast cells. It has previously been shown that cells expressing CD 30 L can be activated by CD 30 and that CD 30 is associated with different inflammatory diseases, such as <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Here we show that mast cells can be activated via CD 30 L with a CD 30 -Fc fusion protein, secreting chemokines in a degranulation-independent mechanism. We also provide evidence for an involvement of the MAPK and PI 3 K pathways in the signalling downstream of CD 30 L. Furthermore, we show that mast cells are the predominant CD 30 L expressing cells in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and that IL- 8 expressing mast cells are upregulated in lesional skin from both diseases. IL- 8 secretion by mast cells was induced in CD 30 -treated healthy skin cultures. We next extended these findings to another chronic inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis. In some studies mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. The soluble form of CD 30 is increased in the serum and synovial fluid of rheumatic patients, however there are no reports regarding the soluble form of CD 30 L in the serum or synovial fluid or the expression of CD 30 L in the synovium. We found a strong correlation between elevated levels of soluble CD 30 L in the serum and synovial fluid of patients suggesting a common origin for the molecule. A CD 30 L+ cell population was found in biopsies of the rheumatic synovium, but in contrast to what we observed in the first study, mast cells were not the CD 30 L predominant expressing cells. Hypoxic areas are found in different inflammatory conditions. In situations of low oxygen tension some cells die while others change their metabolism and adapt to the hypoxic condition. In the previous studies we discussed the involvement of mast cells in different chronic inflammatory diseases. In this study we show that mast cells regulate their survival to hypoxia in an autocrine way by secreting IL- 6. In response to hypoxia, mast cells also secrete the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. Furthermore, we show that hypoxia does not affect degranulation and that the response to different activators is still sustained, although attenuated, under hypoxia when compared to normoxic conditions. These results suggest that mast cells are capable of resisting hypoxia and still respond to different stimuli even under hypoxic conditions, which can have important consequences in health and disease. In the last study presented in this thesis we validated the method used in previous studies and in the projects included in this thesis to identify human mast cells in vivo. Tryptase is the most abundant protein in mast cell granules and is frequently used as a mast cell marker in vivo. Here we show that different Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines also express tryptase in vitro. In vivo the tryptase expression is almost exclusively restricted to mast cells and the rare tryptase positive Hodgkin and Reed Stenberg cells are easily distinguished from mast cells by their characteristic morphology. In conclusion, this thesis elucidates some aspects of the function of mast cells in different chronic inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Familial {{aggregation}} {{of cancer}} may be due either to environmental factors shared by family members, or to shared genes. Familial clustering has been an avenue {{to the understanding of}} the etiology of cancer and has been a basis for clinical decisions and counseling, as well as guiding the identification of cancer-related genes. The nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was created by linking the Statistics Sweden Multi- Generation Register with the Swedish Cancer Registry, national census data and death notifications. All Swedes born after 1931 and their parents are included in the Database, which encompasses over 10 million individuals. Cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from the years 1958, including over 1 million primary cancers and in situ tumors (paper I). The Family-Cancer Database was used as the source of family and cancer data, according to the premise that comparisons can be done based on different probands: parental probands are informative of dominant effects in offspring, whereas analysis of risks between siblings who lack affected parents provides clues about possible recessive effects. With specific reference to lung cancer, in paper II, we used the Family-Cancer Database to examine the time trends of lung cancer in Sweden by histological type, with specific reference to gender, birth cohort, years of diagnosis (period), and age. The incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma and other subtypes in men peaked in the period 1980 - 1990, and then decreased slightly thereafter. In contrast, the incidence rates of adenocarcinoma have continued to increase throughout the period. In women, all subtypes except squamous cell carcinoma have been increasing linearly. The incidence ratio of male to female for all cases of lung cancer was 2. 8. For squamous cell carcinoma, the ratio was 12. 4 in the beginning and 3. 6 at the end. For adenocarcinoma, the ratio was stable at about 1. 5 for the whole period. In paper III, the standardized incidence ratio was 1. 87 (95 % CI 1. 66 - 2. 10) for all offspring (0 66 years old) when parents had lung cancer. The proportion of familial affect was 6. 39 %, and the population-attributable risk of all lung cancers was 2. 97 %. Lung cancer in offspring was associated with parental rectal, cervical, kidney, urinary bladder and endocrine gland tumors. Age-specific, histology-specific familial risks for lung cancer were analyzed in paper IV. For offspring diagnosed before 50 years, the SIRs for histological types of lung cancer between offspring and parents were 1. 98 for adenocarcinoma (offspring) and small cell/large cell carcinoma (parents), 2. 66 for squamous cell carcinoma and small/large cell carcinoma (offspring/parents), 3. 54 for small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and 3. 70 for large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. At a young age, risks between siblings were higher than those between offspring and parents. The SIR ratio (sibling risk/offspring risk) was 2. 92 for all lung cancers. The early onset familial component accounted for 29. 4 % of familial adenocarcinoma and 33. 3 % of familial small and large cell carcinoma. The proportion was lowest for squamous cell carcinoma (13. 3 %). In papers III and V, for multiple primary lung cancers we also found that risk of lung cancer was increased after upper aerodigestive tract, breast, cervical, kidney, urinary bladder or squamous cell skin cancer, or non- <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> Hodgkin s disease or leukemia, through all follow-up periods in men and women. Patients had an increased familial risk when their first-degree relatives were diagnosed with two lung cancers compared to those whose first-degree relatives were diagnosed with one lung cancer, and vice versa. In summary, we suggested that there is an equal sensitivity of both genders to tobacco-induced lung cancer. Familial history of lung cancer was associated with increased risk of lung cancer; the population-attributable fraction of familial lung cancer was 2. 97 %. A large proportion of lung cancers before 50 years of age appear to be heritable and are probably due to a high-penetrant recessive gene or genes that predispose to tobacco carcinogens. Familial risks for multiple primary lung cancers have also suggested that there is an inherited susceptibility...|$|E

40|$|Background:Fascin is an actin {{cross-linking}} protein, {{which is}} part of the cytoskeleton and involved in cell motility in several cell types. The differentiation of epithelial cells is greatly influenced by cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, which play an important role in the normal organisation and stabilisation of epithelial cells and maintain the cells in a non-migratory state. The malignant conversion of epithelial cells results from a phenotypic switch to a migratory state, which allows tumour invasion beyond the basement membrane, as well as metastasis. Such a switch requires complex rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and is governed by multiple actin-binding proteins including fascin. In non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue, fascin expression is highly selective and is predominantly localised in dendritic cells, while lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc are uniformly non-reactive. However, all or nearly all Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants in all types of Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> express fascin and are strongly immunoreactive for fascin. Conclusion: Lymphomas (Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s and non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s) are among the commonest malignancies seen in our practice.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that curcumin, a natural compound isolated from rhizomes of plant Curcuma longa, induces apoptosis in several Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines expressing Bax protein (AS 283 A, KK 124, and Pa 682 PB), whereas it has no effects in cell lines with no Bax expression (BML 895 and CA 46). Our data show that curcumin treatment results in down-regulation of constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via generation of reactive oxygen species where it causes conformational changes in Bax protein leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. This leads to activation of caspase- 9, caspase- 3, and poly(ADP) -ribose polymerase cleavage leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, curcumin treatment of Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines also causes up-regulation of DR 5; however, this up-regulation does not result in apoptosis. Importantly, cotreatment with curcumin and TRAIL induces apoptosis in Bax-deficient cell lines.
