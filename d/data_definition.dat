These functions are built into the CoSort package or through spin-offs for data extraction, generation, security, and migration. Each tool uses the same graphical IDE built on Eclipse, and metadata format for defining and manipulating data. IRI's open <b>data</b> <b>definition</b> file format is also supported by AnalytiX DS and Meta Integration Technology (MITI) so that third-party ETL, BI, and data modeling tool users can convert or re-use their existing metadata in IRI product environments.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{place in}} which SQL three-valued logic intersects with SQL <b>Data</b> <b>Definition</b> Language (DDL) {{is in the form}} of check {{constraint}}s. A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML WHERE clause. While a DML WHERE clause must evaluate to True for a row, a check constraint must not evaluate to False. (From a logic perspective, the designated values are True and Unknown.) This means that a check constraint will succeed if the result of the check is either True or Unknown. [...] The following example table with a check constraint will prohibit any integer values from being inserted into column i, but will allow Null to be inserted since the result of the check will always evaluate to Unknown for Nulls.|$|E

40|$|Patients with chest {{discomfort}} {{or other}} symptoms suggestive of {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) {{are one of the}} most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). While the recognition of patients at high-risk of ACS has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardised approach to the research framework using a common language for <b>data</b> <b>definitions</b> must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardised <b>data</b> <b>definitions</b> set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive <b>data</b> <b>definitions</b> set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible ACS was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardised <b>data</b> <b>definitions</b> set will facilitate ‘knowledge translation’ by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine. ...|$|R
