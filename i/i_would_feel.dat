And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavičius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.|$|E

When he was 7, he starred as Oliver Twist in a children's theater production of the musical Oliver!, and {{by the age of}} 12 he was an understudy in the 1996 Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke. At 13, he understudied the role of Young Scrooge in a musical version of A Christmas Carol starring Tony Randall. Eisenberg made his first professional role in Arje Shaw's off-Broadway play, The Gathering, at the age of 16. He stated, [...] "When playing a role, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> more comfortable, as you're given a prescribed way of behaving." ...|$|E

She married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted {{for six years}} and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. In a 1997 interview with The Daily Targum, Smith stated [...] "I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on when I need to," [...] and {{that she is a}} [...] "private" [...] actress. In 2009, she commented, [...] "People have said to me that I'm unassuming. It's true, I'm the worst celebrity ever. But I'm trying to become better." [...] Smith had bulimia since she was a teenager. She noted [...] "It would make me high, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> endorphins and this great sense of victory." ...|$|E

500|$|In retrospect, Swift {{has stated}} that the song was {{something}} typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time, adding [...] "I didn't know anything then." [...] She explained, [...] "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the way that I would say that {{and the way that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E
500|$|Props {{specialist}} Ken Hawryliw {{claimed the}} biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if my own daughter, Piper, were going through the same thing.|$|E

2500|$|While {{imprisoned in}} Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki became {{influenced}} by the works of Qutb.

2500|$|Ronaldo {{took part}} in the tournament despite {{suffering}} from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: [...] "If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> more comfortable. But we don't." [...] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, though he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament {{at the close of the}} group stage on goal difference.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{for many}} years Mona had made it a {{practice}} to enroll in occasional college-level courses, {{it was in the}} mid 1960s that she completed both a bachelor’s and a master's degree from Queens College. [...] She then taught remedial reading at two Queens elementary schools for eight years. [...] As she recalled, “Every time <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> mentally stagnant, I would just go take a course at Hunter or [...] [...] [...] any school downtown. And I loved anthropology, I took a lot of courses in that; I loved psychology and I took a lot of courses in that; anything that I felt like that I wanted to do. So it was not until later years that one of the teachers at Queens College talked me into matriculating. And I’m glad he did because when I did graduate, I graduated magna cum laude.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{observation}} of light deflection {{was performed by}} noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere. The observations were performed by Arthur Eddington and his collaborators during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, when the stars near the Sun (at {{that time in the}} constellation Taurus) could be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil and in São Tomé and Príncipe on the west coast of Africa. The result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers. It made Einstein and his theory of general relativity world-famous. When asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by Eddington and Dyson in 1919, Einstein famously made the quip: [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway." ...|$|E

There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility. [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> pity if Your Imperial Majesty followed your anger and not your credibility." [...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
