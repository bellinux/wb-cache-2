40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to {{describe}} the Argentine ITQ system {{during the early years}} after the initial allocation in 2009 and introduce the Argentine case in the discussion on ITQs. This paper has been elaborated based on statistical information derived from fleet and catch data of the <b>Fishing</b> <b>Log</b> System of the Undersecretariat of Fisheries and Acquaculture and Management Reports on the Individual Transferable Quotas regime. The implementation of the Argentine ITQs regime took into account issues learned from other countries and from the theoretical debate about {{the pros and cons of}} the ITQ system. The Argentine ITQ regime introduced enough flexibility to dismiss the disadvantages of this system pointed out in other international experiences...|$|E
40|$|The northwestern Mediterranean region faces two {{contrasting}} realities: intensive {{fishing activity}} and a rising awareness among {{citizens of the}} need to protect ecologically important areas. In NE Spain, {{a large portion of the}} Cap de Creus area will be declared a Natura 2000 offshore site, establishing a large Marine Protected Area. This study examines the spatial distribution of artisanal fisheries and their potential impact on key vulnerable ecosystem components (KVECs) in the region. Data collection is based on a questionnaire-based survey in the absence of better records. An integrative map showing potential cumulative impact values for the Cap de Creus region was developed, including fishing gear pressure on selected KVECs. The most potentially impacted areas were found along the coast and on canyon margins. Results showed that different types of fishing gears converge, implying a higher impact on certain benthic communities and KVECs, with the greatest spatial coverage in coralligenous areas, Posidonia beds and maërl beds. When <b>fishing</b> <b>log</b> book and vessel monitoring system data are not available, the use of fishermen surveys linked to geographical information system tools can provide fundamental information for further implementation of effective measures for ecosystem-based management aimed at improving conservation of marine benthic ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Some {{fundamental}} statistic consideration {{were made}} on the interrelations between the geographical distribution and catch of whales and the whaling conditions in the northern North Pacific in summer 1974 based on the <b>fishing</b> <b>log</b> book of a whaling factory ship. The authors would endorse the empirical knowledges among the crew on board the whale catcher boats as follows: 1) The geographical distribution of the sperm whale, Physeter catodon was rather deviated to the lower latitude in this area in summer 1974. 2) On the contrary, the fin-whale, Balaenoptera musculus had a trend to be distributed in the higher latitude. 3) The sei-whale, B. borealis, could be hardly identified, since {{the number of the}} sei-whale was mixed with that of B. edeni in the statistic procedures. However, this sort of whale was detected in a high rate in the same waters as the fin-whale. 4) The interrelation between the whale catch and the wind velocity showed an inverse proportion. 5) It was estimated by periodgram analysis that the peak of the catch in this crew's occurred every 12 days at the significant level of 90 %. 1974 年度K社船団の北洋捕鯨操業日誌にもとづいて,漁場の諸条件と鯨の関係について解析を行った結果,現在まで捕鯨関係者の間で一般に言われていることを或程度数的に示すことができた。即ち主な点をあげると, 1. 1974 年度における「まつこうくじら」の分布は,例年よりやゝ南に偏していたためか,低緯度で多く捕獲された。 2. 「ながすくじら」はこれに反して高緯度が多かった。 3. 「いわしくじら」は,「にたりくじら」を混算したため明確にできなかったが,「ながすくじら」と同じ水域で発見されることが多かった。 4. 風力は発見頭数および捕獲頭数と逆の関係にあることが,或程度証明できた。 5. 本航海における捕獲頭数の周期は 90 %の精度で 12 日であった...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} a {{participatory}} citizen project in collaboration with research partners (fishermen and fisherwomen) from Fogo Island. The project deviates from other citizen science projects in that our community partners, and not the university researchers, have developed the research question. Thus, the project outlined here deviates somewhat from the original proposal (as well, we discovered there were large technical limitations to the work originally proposed, {{which could not be}} overcome within the scope of this project). The project described here is in two parts, and both form the major components for an MSc(Env) thesis by Matt McWilliams (currently completing year 1 of his graduate program). The first part of the project is the participatory citizen science. Through meetings with fishermen and fisherwomen, we identified a research question about ocean tempeartures and developed a sampling methodology. Matt McWilliams lived on Fogo from May-September and assisted with deploying data loggers and downloading data. We presented these data back in the community and solicited feedback and recommendations for futuresampling. The second part of the {{project is a}} digitization exercise of historical (1979 - 1992) <b>fishing</b> <b>log</b> books. This was completed at the request of community members, who felt {{it would be useful to}} compile the data in a format that could be analysed and shared rather than have them sitting on a shelf. Matt McWilliams digitized tabular data into a relational database and the hand-drawn maps as a GIS database. The project is on-going, as Mr. McWilliams has a second year left in his degree. He will spend part of the summer on Fogo, facilitating additional data collection. He anticipates completing thesis work by December 2016...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to further the {{understanding}} of the biology of the European eel during the continental phase of its cycle and to analyse the operation of a sub population in terms of environmental and anthropics factors. An original daily <b>fishing</b> <b>log</b> was introduced in 1990 and has been used since by all the professional fishermen. During one year, monthly samples were taken from the catches of professional fishermen and the non fished fraction was also sampled using experimental nets. Eels were selected out of the samples and their age estimated accurately by otolithometry. The growth for each sex was modelled. The past and recent fishing of eels on the lake was analysed. A structural model has been used to estimate the absolute abundance at the various ages and the mortality rates due to the fishing at any instant at the various ages. The professional fishermen's attempts to build up the population, the fishing pressure and avian predation are the principal factors involved in the dynamics of the eel sub-population in the lake of Grand Lieu. / L'approche de la dynamique de la population d'anguilles européennes est réduite à la fraction continentale du cycle biologique sur le lac de Grand Lieu. Un carnet de pêche journalier est instauré depuis 1990 auprès de la pêcherie. Sur un an, un double échantillonnage est réalisé sur les captures professionnelles d'une part, et au moyen d'engins expérimentaux d'autre part. L'estimation de l'âge par otolithométrie d'un échantillon d'individus et la modélisation de la croissance par sexe sont effectuées. L'exploitation historique et récente des anguilles a été analysée. Un modèle structural permet d'estimer les abondances absolues aux âges et les taux instantanés de mortalité par pêche aux âges. Les soutiens d'effectifs effectués par les pêcheurs professionnels, les pressions halieutiques et la prédation aviaire sont les principaux facteurs agissant sur la dynamique de la sous-population d'anguilles du lac de Grand Lieu...|$|E

40|$|The protection, propagation, {{and wise}} {{utilization}} of California's {{living marine resources}} (established as common property by statute, Section 1600, Fish and Game Code) is dependent upon the welding of biological, environmental, economic, and sociological factors. Fundamental {{to each of these}} factors, as well as the entire management process, are harvest records. The California Department of Fish and Game began gathering commercial fisheries landing data in 1916. Commercial fish catches were first published in 1929 for the years 1926 and 1927. This report, the 32 nd in the landing series, is for the calendar year 1972. It summarizes commercial fishing activities in marine as well as fresh waters and includes the catches of the sportfishing partyboat fleet. Preliminary landing data are published annually in the circular series which also enumerates certain fishery products produced from the catch. The 1972 figures are contained in Circular No. 47, "Statistical Report of Fresh, Canned, Cured and Manufactured Fishery Products for 1972 " (Bell, 1973). California's fishery statistics are based on a system whereby fish dealers, processors, and operators of sportfishing partyboats send duplicate copies of their landing records to the Department. The system and methods used to collect commercial fishing records were fully described in Fish Bulletin 86, which reported the catch for 1950. In the intervening years, methods and equipment have been modified as conditions warranted, but the basic principles remain unchanged. Parke Young (1969) described the partyboat <b>fishing</b> <b>log</b> system in Fish Bulletin 145. ================================= Common names of the more important fishes have been designated by the California Department of Fish and Game for many years. The original purpose was to assist in collecting accurate catch statistics. For the Department to understand the State's many fisheries it is essential that the catch of each species be known. A consistent terminology {{on the part of both}} the commercial fishing industry and the sportsman is of great importance in the collection of catch records since confusion and inaccuracy result when a particular species is listed by different names in different parts of California or if a certain common name refers to any of several species. In California as elsewhere in the world, common nomenclature of marine organisms did not grow up with the language as in Europe or Asia. The people who settled here naturally named things because of similarities—either real or apparent, superficial or significant—to familiar species in their homeland. As a result when California initiated its recording system for commercial landings in 1916, the need for more uniform terminology with respect to common names became readily evident. A chaotic situation existed with a given species being identified by different names in different parts of the state, in different fisheries, or even in adjacent fish markets, and a number of species being referred to by a single name. While the present law specifically applies to commercial landings, the Department has designated common names to species taken by other than commercial fishermen in an effort to insure uniformity in State publications and records, and in an attempt to attain common usage on the part of all fishermen...|$|E
