40|$|In recent times, {{ionizing}} radiation {{has been used}} {{around the world to}} screen persons for non-medical purposes, namely to detect bulk explosives or other contraband hidden on the body including materials not registered by metal detectors. In contrast to conventional transmission or projection imaging, backscatter and forward-scatter systems employ a “flying spot ” of x rays and large-area detectors. A small spot is rastered across an individual and the Compton scatter signal collected by these detectors is quickly integrated and assigned to a pixel value in an image corresponding to the transient location of the small flying spot. These systems have been controversial due in part to possible radiation health risks, and lack of independent and accurate measurements of radiation exposures to the subjects, bystanders, and operators of such systems.

Materials and Methods: A state-of-the-art Siemens Artis Zee fluoroscope was operated in the service mode to allow for manual control of the technique factors (kVp, mA, ms, and Cu). Free-in-air measurements were made to determine HVLs and KAP-meter accuracy. BSFs were determined across a large range of X-ray field sizes and beam spectra with polymethyl-methacrylate. Percent depth doses (PDDs) and X-ray beam profiles were acquired across a similar range of X-ray beam spectra using a PTW water tank and a Spokas ionization chamber for the PDD measurements and a solid state dosimeter for the beam profile measurements. Results: Fluoroscopic dose rate and technique parameter curves are reported for several state-of-the-art fluoroscopes, illustrating differences in approach among vendors and establishing the basis for investigation of the X-ray beam characteristics (HVLs, HCs, BSFs, and PDDs). These X-ray beam characteristics are reported across a large range of clinically available X-ray beam spectra, providing the necessary foundation for dosimetry in soft tissue from these beams. Additionally, the accuracy of the displayed Ka,r and correction coefficients determined using the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 190 methodology is reported across a similar range of X-ray beam spectra. Conclusion: The content of this research provides the necessary foundation for determining radiation dose at depth in soft tissue from state-of-the-art fluoroscopes. The results from this research can be used to assess dose at depth in soft tissue from fluoroscopically guided interventions, to determine fetal dosimetry from fluoroscopically guided interventions, and to validate dose modeling software...|$|R
40|$|A heavily {{filtered}} {{fast neutron}} irradiation system (FNIS) {{was developed for}} a variety of applications, including the study of long-term health effects of fast neutrons by evaluating the biological mechanisms of damage in cultured cells and living animals such as rats or mice. This irradiation system includes an exposure cave made with a lead-bismuth alloy, a cave positioning system, a gamma and neutron monitoring system, a sample transfer system, and interchangeable filters. This system was installed in the irradiation cell of the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor (NSCR). By increasing the thickness of the lead-bismuth alloy, the neutron spectra were shifted into lower energies by the scattering interactions of fast neutrons with the alloy. It is possible, therefore, by changing the alloy thickness, to produce distinctly different dose weighted neutron spectra inside the exposure cave of the FNIS. The calculated neutron spectra showed close agreement with the results of activation foil measurements, unfolded by SAND-II close to the cell window. However, there was a considerable less agreement for locations far away from the cell window. Even though the magnitude of values such as neutron flux and tissue <b>kerma</b> <b>rates</b> in air differed, the weighted average neutron energies showed close agreement between the MCNP and SAND-II since the normalized neutron spectra were in a good agreement each other. A paired ion chamber system was constructed, one with a tissue equivalent plastic (A- 150) and propane gas for total dose monitoring, and another with graphite and argon for photon dose monitoring.

The dose rate constant for the 57 Co source {{was determined to be}} 1. 215 cGyh– 1 U– 1. The radial dose function for the 57 Co source has an increasing trend due to multiple scattering of low energy photons. The anisotropy function for the 57 Co source at various distances from the source is more isotropic than the 192 Ir source. Conclusions : The 57 Co source has advantages over 192 Ir due to its lower energy photons, longer half-life, higher dose rate constant and more isotropic anisotropic function. However, the 192 Ir source has a higher initial air kerma strength and more uniform radial dose function. These properties make 57 Co a suitable source for use in brachytherapy applications...|$|R

This study aims to check long term response stability of High Dose Rate (HDR) - 1000 Plus well-type {{ionization chamber}} in terms of reference air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> (RAKR) of a reference 137 Cs brachytherapy source and recommend an optimum frequency of recalibration. An HDR- 1000 Plus well-type ionization chamber, a reference 137 Cs brachytherapy source (CDCSJ 5), and a MAX- 4000 electrometer were used in this study. The HDR- 1000 Plus well-type chamber was calibrated in terms of reference air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> by the Standards Laboratory of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna. The response of the chamber was verified at regular intervals over a period of eight years using the reference 137 Cs source. All required correction factors were applied in the calculation of the RAKR of the 137 Cs source. This study reveals that the response of the HDR- 1000 Plus well-type chamber was well within &# 177; 0. 5 &#x 0025; for about three years after calibration/recalibration. However, it shows deviations larger than &# 177; 0. 5 &#x 0025; after three years of calibration/recalibration and the maximum variation in response of the chamber during an eight year period was 1. 71 &#x 0025;.

40|$|In {{instances}} where a building room is radiologically contaminated, dose rate coefficients {{are needed to}} estimate the dose rate to the occupants. Oneâ€™s position in the room, whether {{in the center of}} the room or the corner, could have an effect on dose rate. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in Federal Guidance Report 12 (EPA 1993) dose rate coefficients for idealized exposure geometries, including exposure to radionuclides distributed infinitely in various thicknesses of soil. The dimensions of the exposure plane were taken to be infinite in extent. Due to this assumption, using the Federal Guidance Report coefficients could lead to an incorrect estimate of dose rate inside a contaminated room. In order to apply the published coefficients for a structure, we developed Room Ratios using MCNP 5 to compare air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> of various room sizes and multiple building materials to the published infinite air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> taking into account several receptor positions. Room Ratio values will be used for preliminary remediation risk assessment for environmental radionuclide clean up and be integrated into existing online tools and databases (epa-bprg. ornl. gov). The incorporation of ratios into these tools will update dose coefficients that previously accounted only for surface contamination (Eckerman 2010). Additionally, Room Ratios will allow Federal Guidance Report 12 dose coefficients application to customizable building materials and thickness. M. S...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective:Small animal image-guided irradiators have {{recently}} been developed to mimic the delivery techniques of clinical radiotherapy. A dosemeter adapted to millimetric beams of medium-energy X-rays is then required. This work presents the characterization of a dosemeter prototype for this particular application. Methods:A scintillating optical fibre dosemeter (called DosiRat) has been implemented to perform real-time dose measurements with the dedicated small animal X-RAD® 225 Cx (Precision X-Ray, Inc., North Branford, CT) irradiator. Its sensitivity, stem effect, stability, linearity and measurement precision were determined in large field conditions for three different beam qualities, consistent with small animal irradiation and imaging parameters. Results:DosiRat demonstrates good sensitivity and stability; excellent air kerma and air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> linearity; and a good repeatability for air kerma rates > 1 [*]mGy[*]s− 1. The stem effect {{was found to be}} negligible. DosiRat showed limited precision for low air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> measurements (< 1 [*]mGy[*]s− 1), typically for imaging protocols. A positive energy dependence was found that can be accounted for by calibrating the dosemeter at the needed beam qualities. Conclusion:The dosimetric performances of DosiRat are very promising. Extensive studies of DosiRat energy dependence are still required. Further developments will allow to reduce the dosemeter size to ensure millimetric beams dosimetry and perform small animal in vivo dosimetry. Advances in knowledge:Among existing point dosemeters, very few are dedicated to both medium-energy X-rays and millimetric beams. Our work demonstrated that scintillating fibre dosemeters are suitable and promising tools for real-time dose measurements in the small animal field of interest...|$|E
40|$|Restenosis is a {{major problem}} after balloon {{angioplasty}} and stent implantation. The aim {{of this study is to}} introduce gadolinium neutron capture brachytherapy (GdNCB) as a suitable modality for treatment of stenosis. The utility of GdNCB in intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) of stent stenosis is investigated by using the GEANT 4 and MCNP 4 B Monte Carlo radiation transport codes. To study capture <b>rate,</b> <b>Kerma,</b> absorbed dose and absorbed dose rate around a Gd-containing stent activated with neutrons, a 30 mm long, 5 rum diameter gadolinium foil is chosen. The input data is a neutron spectrum used for clinical neutron capture therapy in Studsvik, Sweden. Thermal neutron capture in gadolinium yields a spectrum of high-energy gamma photons, which due to the build-up effect gives an almost flat dose delivery pattern to the first 4 mm around the stent. The absorbed dose rate is 1. 33 Gy/min, 0. 25 mm from the stent surface while the dose to normal tissue is in order of 0. 22 Gy/min, i. e., a factor of 6 lower. To spare normal tissue further fractionation of the dose is also possible. The capture rate is relatively high at both ends of the foil. The dose distribution from gamma and charge particle radiation at the edges and inside the stent contributes to a nonuniform dose distribution. This will lead to higher doses to the surrounding tissue and may prevent stent edge and in-stent restenosis. The position of the stent can be verified and corrected by the treatment plan prior to activation. Activation of the stent by an external neutron field can be performed days after catherization when the target cells start to proliferate and can be expected to be more radiation sensitive. Another advantage of the nonradioactive gadolinium stent is the possibility to avoid radiation hazard to personnel. (c) 2006 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{evaluate}} interventional radiology x-ray system performance in order to analyze its influence on patient dose. Entrance air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> in fluoroscopy modes and aire kerma per image in cine modes were measured at the entrance of PMMA slabs (10 to 30 cm) in two interventional x-ray systems. Air kerma evaluation was performed in all image intensifiers (II) diameters and in all fluoroscopy and cine modes used in the clinical practice with an ionization chamber. High and low contrast resolution was evaluated for all PMMA thickness, II and modes, with two quality image tests (NEMA XR 21 and Leeds TOR- 18 FG). Significant differences were found in air <b>kerma</b> <b>rate</b> and air kerma per image in both x-ray systems for comparable II and modes. For example, for 24 cm PMMA thickness in fluoroscopic high dose mode, in one x-ray system delivers 0. 49 mGy/s and the other one 1. 87 mGy/s. However, differences in image quality were not significant. In the same conditions described above, Leeds test showed: 0. 032 (low contrast) and 1. 25 lpmm (spatial frequency). In addition, when phantom thickness increase, image quality decreases in x-ray systems, but in one of them, the difference is high. Results show that patient dose and image quality depend on the x-ray system characteristics. Due to this it is essential to perform a complete evaluation of the x-ray system in order to help interventional cardiologists (radiologists) to learn possibilities of dose reduction with no lose of image quality.
