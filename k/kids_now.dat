500|$|Writer Rob Edwards {{stated that}} [...] "it was {{extremely}} challenging" [...] {{to take a}} classic novel and set it in outer space, and that they did away {{with some of the}} science fiction elements ("things like the metal space ships and the coldness") early on. Edwards {{goes on to say that}} they [...] "did a lot of things to make the film more modern" [...] and that the idea behind setting the film in outer space was to [...] "make the story as exciting for <b>kids</b> <b>now</b> as the book was for kids then".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the Pokémon saga stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which game {{designer}} Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child. While growing up, however, he observed more urbanization {{taking place in the}} town where he lived and as a result, the insect population declined. Tajiri noticed that <b>kids</b> <b>now</b> played in their homes instead of outside and he {{came up with the idea}} of a video game, containing creatures that resembled insects, called Pokémon. He thought kids could relate with the Pokémon by individually naming them, and then controlling them to represent fear or anger as a good way of relieving stress. However, Pokémon never bleed or die in battle, only faint– this was a very touchy subject to Tajiri, as he did not want to further fill the gaming world with [...] "pointless violence".|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Blood Drive" [...] {{within a week}} of its original release. In the first 85-second clip, Dwight assures his office-mates that the blood taken in the bloodmobile will not be used in any [...] "ritualistic ways". Later, while giving blood himself, he asks the hospital employee, [...] "How do I know it's not going to go into a person who will later come back to kill me?" [...] The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party. Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage-woman whom her <b>kids</b> <b>now</b> consider their real mother instead of herself, and Dwight said he believes his soulmate, [...] "probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai, {{or at the very least}} she lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes-Barre corridor." [...] In the final 90-second clip, Dwight shows off his bobblehead doll collection to a woman, Creed tries unsuccessfully to pick up Lynne, and Dwight gets rid of an attractive male visitor who Michael fears could be competition. Dwight tells him the party is cancelled [...] "due to a death in the elevator".|$|E
500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} <b>kids</b> <b>now</b> grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his success}} in the ring, Booth managed to secure an IBF World title shot against Canadian Steve Molitor, a two-time holder of the title. Molitor had {{initially}} won the title {{for the first time}} with a win over former Booth opponent Michael Hunter on 10 November 2006 defending five times before losing Celestino Caballero in Ontario on 21 November 2008. He regained the title on 27 March 2010 beating South African Takalani Ndlovu and the fight with Booth due to take place in the North of England would be his first defence. Molitor had also held the Commonwealth bantamweight title earlier in his career, defeating Jason's brother Nicky Booth on 21 November 2002 to lift the belt meaning that Moiltor would have eventually fought both brothers. Speaking about his career to date when announcing the fight, Booth paid tribute to the sport and reflected on how his life might have turned out: [...] "If I hadn't had boxing, I'd be dead, the drink would have beaten me. I've got my <b>kids</b> <b>now,</b> they're my focus and I think I've just grown up". In the end, on 11 September 2010 in Sunderland, Booth lost a majority decision to the Canadian with two judges scoring 116-113 and 116-112 to Molitor with the third scoring the fight a draw at 114-114. After the fight Booth stated that his new ambition was to win the European title after coming up short on three occasions so far in his career saying that he would relish a shot at the new champion Kiko Martinez.|$|E
