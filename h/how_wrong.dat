5|$|Critics praised Undead Nightmare as a {{model for}} {{downloadable}} content especially in its balance of content and price. Neil Davey (The Guardian) said that it was the best purchase of 2010 at its price range, but staff of the Official Xbox Magazine found the price slightly too high. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar thought that the game's concept sounded like a ploy to make easy money without much work, but admitted <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> and surprised he was at the game's depth. At the time of its 2010 release, the Official Xbox Magazine counted Undead Nightmare among the best downloadable content in existence. The standalone retail disc had sold two million units as of August 2011. No sales figures were released regarding the download pack itself.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Rotblat {{in charge}} in Liverpool, Chadwick began {{a tour of}} the Manhattan Project {{facilities}} in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.|$|E
25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

500|$|Scientology critic Andreas Heldal-Lund {{stated that}} the Church of Scientology views {{candidates}} for the test as [...] "raw meat from the street". [...] "You're told you're worth nothing," [...] he said. Heldal-Lund stated that, [...] "thousands of desperate parents contact me because they have children who have had major mental problems, or taken their own life after similar circumstances to Kaja Ballo". Scientology-associated celebrity, Hank Von Helvete, commented to the press that he thought psychiatry, not Scientology, {{was the cause of}} Ballo's suicide. TV 2 reported that psychologists advised that subsequent to the personality test, there should be proper follow-up attention with the subject. In an analysis of personality tests available online on social networking sites, Norwegian Psychological Association department advisor Andreas Høstmælingen cited Kaja Ballo as [...] "an example of <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> things can go". The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.|$|E

Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E

Albeck, Bowtell, Jeffreys and McCormack have assisted Cole on her albums. As of April 2012 Cole lived in Copacabana. In July 2012 Cole revealed that she is a lesbian on ABC-TV series, Australian Story. In October 2013 she was the inaugural ambassador for the Adelaide-based Feast Festival and in the following month she presented her show, The Queer of Country.

2500|$|The {{relationship}} of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, but intersex {{people are often}} added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions [...] "that intersex people's rights are protected" [...] by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but [...] "LGBTI activism has fought {{for the rights of}} people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [...] Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community [...] "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations [...] "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" [...] including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; [...] "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> that approach is".|$|E
2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. <b>How</b> <b>wrong</b> is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else."

[...] J. Hurtado of Twitch Film noted that many [...] "reviews of Battle Royale focus on the violence, which is extreme to be sure, {{and not so much}} on the humanity of the film." [...] He stated that [...] "cranking up that already elevated hormonal level of emotional hysteria by throwing these students into a real life-or-death situation is incredibly effective" [...] and that [...] "the story of Battle Royale is the story of those teenage years and just <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> we all were about the extent of our emotional turmoil." [...] DVD Talk gave the original theatrical cut of the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and 4 out of 5 for the Director's Cut, concluding that it gives [...] "a glimpse into what might very well happen should the rules of society, such as they are, ever do crumble to the point where it's everyone for themselves. There's enough black humor here and enough tense action that the film never quite feels bleak or depressing (though it does come close) – but most importantly it makes you think." [...] Devon Ashby of CraveOnline gave the film a score of 8.5 out of 10, referring to it as [...] "Japanese legend Kinji Fukasaku’s adolescent shooting spree opus" [...] and [...] "a compassionate and technically accomplished masterpiece." [...] Brent McKnight of PopMatters gave the film a score of 9 out of 10, describing it as [...] "savage, sharp, satirical, and brutally funny" [...] and [...] "a bleak commentary on humanity and society." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises <b>how</b> <b>wrong</b> she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
