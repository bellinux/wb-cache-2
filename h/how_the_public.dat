In art, the toga is shown with the long end dipping between the feet, a deep curved fold in front, and a bulbous flap at the midsection. The drapery became more intricate and structured over time, with the cloth forming a tight roll across the chest in later periods. The toga praetexta, with a purple or purplish-red stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, curule magistrates, and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga (toga picta).|$|E

Blaine was loyal to Grant, and the scandals of the Grant administration did not seem to affect <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> perceived him; according to his biographer, Blaine was never more popular than when he was Speaker of the House.

500|$|Paris's Théâtre des Champs-Élysées {{was a new}} structure, {{which had}} opened on 2 April 1913 with a {{programme}} celebrating the works {{of many of the}} leading composers of the day. The theatre's manager, Gabriel Astruc, was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year. [...] The programme for 29 May 1913, as well as the Stravinsky premiere, [...] included Les Sylphides, Weber's Le Spectre de la Rose and Borodin's Polovtsian Dances. Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs. Final rehearsals were held on the day before the premiere, in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests. According to Stravinsky all went peacefully. However, the critic of L'Écho de Paris, Adolphe Boschot, foresaw possible trouble; he wondered <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked.|$|E

The studio's creative team, which included nearly 200 people led by creative director Josh Holmes, started developing the game as early as 2009. Prior {{to the release of}} the game, Microsoft Studios Vice President Phil Spencer stated that the Halo franchise is the [...] "most important entertainment product in the company" [...] and that Halo 4 was the most expensive game that Microsoft had made. [...] A demonstration of the game's campaign was first shown at E3 2012. The developers described it as a pivotal moment in development, as {{it was the first time}} the game had been shown publicly. The positive reaction was a morale boost for the team, who were unsure <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> would react. On July 7, 2012, a pre-release build of Halo 4s Forge mode was showcased by 343 Industries and Certain Affinity at RTX which took place at the Austin Convention Center.

500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That {{sounds to me}} like a very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E

500|$|The Jets' {{success in}} signing Namath {{and the rise}} of the team in the standings {{adversely}} affected their crosstown rivals, the Giants, who had played in five NFL championship games in six years to 1963, but who thereafter declined in the standings. [...] Giants owner Wellington Mara stated, [...] "I think the Jets coming in when they did contributed to our bad years, because we tried to do everything for the short term rather than the long haul—we'd trade a draft choice for a player, figuring he'd give us one or two good years. We didn't want to accept <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> might react if we had a bad year or two or three." [...] In 1968, the Giants traded for star Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton in the vain hopes he would lead them to renewed success and rival Namath in the public eye. In August 1969, the Jets faced the Giants in a preseason game at the Yale Bowl. [...] While the Jets' Super Bowl win legitimized the AFL as a comparable league to the NFL in the eyes of many, others doubted the AFL's standard of play, and the Jets were underdogs going into the game. Giants coach Allie Sherman approached the game as if it were a regular season contest, and the Jets sent the three remaining original Titans out for the coin toss. The Jets defeated the Giants 37–14, and Sherman was fired a few weeks later. The Jets' fellow tenants, the Mets, won a championship themselves; the baseball team's accomplishments forced the Jets to play their first five games on the road. The Jets recovered from a slow start to win their second consecutive Eastern Division championship, but fell to Kansas City in the divisional round of the playoffs, 13–6.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{editions of}} a book as popular and {{enduring}} as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit inevitably attract the attention and money of both book collectors and fans. Because a publisher cannot predict accurately <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> will receive a new author, they usually print a small first run and follow it with reprints as needed. Often this first run is called a [...] "first edition". Technically, however, the first edition spans not only the first printing but all printings until the type is reset. In the collectibles market, normally {{it is the first}} printing that commands the bulk of attention and money. That is because it was printed in small quantity and under risk of failure in the market. The people who bought the first copies pioneered the book's popularity, and those copies are considered precious.
