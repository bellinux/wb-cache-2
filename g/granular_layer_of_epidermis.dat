40|$|Cathepsin D is an aspartic {{lysosomal}} endopeptidase {{present in}} most mammalian cells. Overexpression of cathepsin D {{is associated with}} the progression of several human cancers including melanoma. We examined the expression levels of cathepsin D in 20 primary malignant melanomas, 20 metastatic malignant melanomas, 20 benign nevus pigmentosus and 10 normal skin samples in Japanese. In normal skin, granular or dotted pattern of positive staining was observed along the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>epidermis</b> and hair follicle with apparent moderate to strong staining in sebaceous and eccrine glands. The percent positivity and staining intensity of cathepsin D in primary and metastatic malignant melanomas were significantly higher than that of nevus pigmentosus. Moreover, the expression levels of cathepsin D in metastatic malignant melanomas were significantly higher than those of primary malignant melanomas. Data from our and previous reports strongly supports a notion that the upregulation of cathepsin D may be critically involved in the malignant transformation and progression of melanocytic tumors. カテプシンDはリソゾーム内に存在するエンドペプチダーゼであるが, 胃癌, 乳癌, 卵巣癌などでは周辺正常組織に比べ, 過剰発現していることが知られている. 悪性黒色腫においても, その過剰発現が 2 編の文献報告で知られているが, 日本人を対象とした検討は行われていない. 我々は, 20 例の原発性悪性黒色腫, 20 例の転移性悪性黒色腫, 20 例の良性色素細胞母班, 10 例の健常皮膚を用いて, カテプシンD の発現を免疫組織学的に検討した. 正常皮膚では, カテプシンDは表皮および毛囊の上層・顆粒層に顆粒状に発現しており, 脂腺やエクリン汗腺では強い発現を認めた. 原発性悪性黒色腫や転移性悪性黒色腫のカテプシンDの発現は, 良性色素細胞母班のそれよりも有意に上昇していた. また転移性悪性黒色腫では, 原発性悪性黒色腫よりも有意に高い発現が認められた. これらの結果から, カテプシンDの発現は色素細胞の悪性化と腫瘍進展に関与していると考えられた...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The histopathological {{diagnosis}} of Mycosis Fungoides (MF) is challenging {{in its early}} stages and can easily be confused with inflammatory dermatoses. This study aims to; (i) assessthe frequency and significance of different histopathological parameters in early MF, seen in Saudi patients, and (ii) to studythe utility of these parameters in differentiating between early MF and inflammatory dermatoses. Methods: This is a five years study of 66 skin biopsies generated from 58 patients with clinically suspicious MF lesions or early patch stage MF. These cases were retrieved from the archives ofthe Department of Pathology, King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh from the year 2002 to 2006. Histological criteria were assessed and graded semi-quantitatively on a four-point scale by adermatopathologist and two pathologists independently. Results: The histological parameters suggesting the diagnosis in early stages MF include epidermotropism, dermal fibrosis, Pautrier’s micro abscesses, Basal alignment of neoplastic lymphocytes, hyperconvoluted dermal and epidermal lymphocytes and grandiosity sign (size of lymphocytes becoming larger as they migrate towards <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>epidermis).</b> These parameters on univariate analysis achieved statistical significance (p< 0. 05) in differentiating MF from non-MF cases. In addition, hyperconvoluted dermal and epidermal lymphocytes proved to be highly reliable with high specificity and sensitivity. Conclusion: The histopathological {{diagnosis of}} early MF lesions and their discrimination from inflammatory simulators can be achieved by carefully observing the hyperconvoluted dermal and epidermal lymphocytes along with the constellation of the other parameters...|$|E
40|$|Profilaggrin is {{expressed}} in the differentiating <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>epidermis</b> and other stratified epithelia, where it forms {{a major component of}} cytoplasmic keratohyalin granules. It consists of two distinct domains, an N-terminal S 100 -like Ca 2 +- binding domain containing two EF-hands and multiple filaggrin units that aggregate keratin filaments in the stratum corneum. Here, we report structure-function studies of the N-terminal peptide from mouse, human, and rat profilaggrin. The profilaggrin N- terminal peptides of all species contain two S 100 -like EF-hands, bipartite nuclear localization sequences, and proprotein convertase cleavage sites. The nuclear localization signals in human and mouse profilaggrin were shown to be functional by transfection of epithelial cells and depended on the absence of filaggrin sequences. The nuclear localization of the processed (free) N-terminal peptide of human profilaggrin is consistent with immunolocalization findings in normal human skin and in parakeratotic skin disorders, which exhibit nuclear staining of granular and/or cornified layers. The mouse profilaggrin N-terminus undergoes proteolytic processing in two steps, first releasing an N-terminal peptide containing some filaggrin sequence and finally the free N-terminus of 28 – 30 kDa; these peptides have cytoplasmic and nuclear distributions, respectively, when expressed in transfected cells. The N-terminal processing may occur prior to or simultaneously with the proteolytic processing of the polyfilaggrin domain. The nuclear accumulation of the profilaggrin N-terminal peptide in epidermis and in transfected cells strongly suggests a calcium-dependent nuclear function for the profilaggrin N-terminus during epidermal terminal differentia tion when the free N-terminus is released from profilaggrin by specific proteolysis...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent R 162 W {{mutation}} of keratin 9 {{has been}} reported in multiple families with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK) -type hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK). Recently, we have observed a family whose members showed autosomal-dominant PPK with unique histologic features such as rounded, dissociated, and slightly eosinophilic keratinocytes at the middle spinous and <b>granular</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>epidermis,</b> but without the distinct EHK pheno-type. To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation in this family, we searched for a mutation of keratin 9 and found R 162 W substitution in the coiled 1 A region.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{epidermal}} differentiation involves proliferation, differentiation, migration and maturation of keratinocytes {{to form an}} impermeable barrier against water loss and outside environment. It is controlled by highly balanced regulatory machinery, involving many molecules that are still under investigation. Homeobox proteins are involved in body patterning and morphogenesis of organs and are studied as potentially good candidates to regulate this process. In the first project we investigated {{the role of a}} protein named HOP which belongs to a group of homeobox proteins. Even if HOP is a small protein almost completely composed of the homeodomain and without DNA binding capacity, it is considered as transcriptional regulator in different tissues. HOP interacts with serum response factor (SRF) and histone deacetylase type 2 (HDAC 2). By microarray analysis we found that HOP expression increases in cultured human primary keratinocytes (NHK) which undergo calcium-induced differentiation. HOP protein was localized in granular layer of the epidermis of healthy individuals. Lack of HOP was demonstrated in psoriatic lesions, whereas a strong expression was demonstrated in the lesional skin of patients affected with lichen planus (LP). Since LP is characterized by hypergranulosis while psoriatic lesions by progressive lack of the granular layer, the obtained data indicated that HOP might have a potential function in <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>epidermis.</b> To investigate HOP function, we inhibited its expression by using HOP specific StealthRNAi and we overexpressed HOP using lentiviral vectors in differentiating NHK. The conclusion of both experiments indicated that HOP positively regulates the expression of late differentiation markers, such as profilaggrin, loricrin and transglutaminase 1. The in vitro data were next confirmed in vivo using HOP knockout mouse model. The second part of my study involved analysis of mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK). EHK is a genetic disorder characterized by erythema, skin blistering, keratinocyte hyperproliferation and hyperkeratosis. EHK is caused by mutations in keratin 1 or 10 (K 1, K 10) which are major structural proteins of differentiated keratinocytes and participate in the cellular scaffold formation. To investigate how the structural proteins carrying mutations alter cellular signaling, we established an in vitro model for EHK by overexpression {{of one of the most}} common K 10 mutations reported so far (K 10 R 156 H), in primary human keratinocytes. In order to mimic the in vivo situation, mutated keratinocytes growing on silicone membranes were subjected to mechanical stretch. We observed strong collapse of KIF in K 10 R 156 H keratinocytes when subjected to stretch for 30 minutes. Our data demonstrated stronger activation of p 38, a member of MAPK stress signaling pathways, in K 10 R 156 H when compared to control cells. We demonstrated also that K 10 R 156 H keratinocytes showed an induction of TNF-α and RANTES release in response to stretch. Taken together these studies characterize a novel regulator of epidermal differentiation - HOP and demonstrate new aspects implicated in the pathogenesis of EHK...|$|E

40|$|The diverse {{functions}} of microtubules (MT) in different cells and tissues may be facilitated by compositional changes in tubulin isotypes. We obtained partial cDNA clones of class II β-tubulin from {{a library of}} differentiating normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) cells, whereas screening via subtractive hybridization for genes involved in calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. Analysis of the isotypic composition of β-tubulin from NHEK cells revealed elevations in class II β-tubulin concentrations at both protein and message levels during cell differentiation, resulting in increased rates of incorporation of class II β-tubulin into MT. Immunohistochemistry of normal and pathologic skin tissues showed that class II β-tubulin occurred in the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis</b> and in differentiated areas of carcinomas. Class II β-tubulin was, however, not observed in the uppermost <b>granular</b> and cornified <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> normal <b>epidermis.</b> Further experiments showed that MT were likely to decay in {{the final stage of}} terminal differentiation during formation of the cornified envelope.

Biopsies of lesional skin reveal rounding up of epidermal cells with loss of epidermal cell adhesion: this pattern {{is referred to as}} acantholysis. Two major types of pemphigus are distinguished clinically and histopathologically.

40|$|The MDM 2 {{oncogene}} is overexpressed in 5 – 10 % {{of human}} tumours. Its major physiological {{role is to}} inhibit the tumour suppressor p 53. However, MDM 2 has p 53 -independent effects on differentiation and does not predispose to tumorigenesis when it is expressed in the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis.</b> These unexpected properties of MDM 2 could be tissue specific or could depend on the differentiation state of the cells. Strikingly, we found that MDM 2 has p 53 -dependent effects on differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis when it is expressed in the less differentiated basal layer cells. MDM 2 inhibits UV induction of p 53, the cell cycle inhibitor p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1 and apoptosis (‘sunburn cells’). Importantly, MDM 2 increases papilloma formation induced by chemical carcinogenesis and predisposes to the appearance of premalignant lesions and squamous cell carcinomas. p 53 has a natural role in the protection against UV damage in the basal <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis.</b> Our results show that MDM 2 predisposes to tumorigenesis when expressed {{at an early stage}} of differentiation, and provide a mouse model of MDM 2 tumorigenesis relevant to p 53 ’s tumour suppressor functions...|$|R

It catalyzes the {{formation}} of α-(γ-glutamyl) lysine bonds that participate in processes varying from fibrin clot formation to epidermal cell envelope formation. Epidermal transglutaminase is localized to the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis.</b> It catalyzes the covalent cross-linking of a soluble cytoplasmic substrate into large polymers to form the cornified envelope that lines the inner membrane of keratinocytes in the stratum corneum, The soluble precursor from epidermis has been named keratolinin, and from keratinocyte culture, it has been named involucrin. Hair follicle transglutaminase is biochemically and immunochemically distinct from its epidermal counters part. It has been localized to the inner root sheath and medulla of the hair follicle, The substrate of hair follicle transglutaminase has been poorly defined but appears to be rich in the amino acid citrulline, Transglutaminase {{has been shown to}} be an important marker of normal differentiation. There is a rise in its activity at the time of keratinization, and transglutaminase activity {{has been shown to be}} greatly decreased in basal cell epithelioma and in psoriasis. Keratinocyte cell culture has proven most helpful in delineating the processes of normal differentiation and keratinization, since {{the formation of}} the cell envelope in culture appears to parallel the formation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Cholesterol sulfate is {{a highly}} amphipathic {{molecule}} that is present in a relatively high concentration in the <b>epidermis</b> <b>of</b> human skin, particularly in the <b>granular</b> <b>layer.</b> The physiologic significance of this finding, however, is not well-understood. Therefore, we examined expression of the gene encoding for the enzyme that sulfonates cholesterol (SULT 2 B 1 b). Of the three enzymes known to sulfonate steroids/sterols, only the SULT 2 B 1 b isozyme was detected in cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in response to Ca 2 +-induced terminal differentiation {{as well as by}} normal human epidermal tissue. Immunocytochemical analysis of normal skin as well as specific skin disorders was carried out. In normal skin, the expression of SULT 2 B 1 b was localized to the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis</b> similar to that of filaggrin, an acknowledged late marker of differentiation and in contrast to that of involucrin, an early marker of terminal differentiation, which was expressed throughout the suprabasal region. The confinement of SULT 2 B 1 b to the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> coincides with this being the area with the highest cholesterol sulfate content suggesting that the physiologic action of cholesterol sulfate is likely carried out in this region <b>of</b> the living <b>epidermis.</b> Additionally, 88 % of cholesterol sulfate in NHEK was membrane-associated further suggesting a cellular location for cholesterol sulfate action...|$|R
40|$|The human {{epidermis}} serves 2 crucial barrier functions: {{it protects}} against water loss and prevents penetration of infectious agents and allergens. The physiology <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis</b> is maintained by {{a balance of}} protease and antiprotease activities, {{as illustrated by the}} rare genetic skin disease Netherton syndrome (NS), in which impaired inhibition of serine proteases causes severe skin erythema and scaling. Here, utilizing mass spectrometry, we have identified elastase 2 (ELA 2), which we believe to be a new epidermal protease that is specifically expressed in the most differentiated <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> living human and mouse epidermis. ELA 2 localized to keratohyalin granules, where it was found to directly participate in (pro-) filaggrin processing. Consistent with the observation that ELA 2 was hyperactive in skin from NS patients, transgenic mice overexpressing ELA 2 in the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis</b> displayed abnormal (pro-) filaggrin processing and impaired lipid lamellae structure, which are both observed in NS patients. These anomalies led to dehydration, implicating ELA 2 in the skin barrier defect seen in NS patients. Thus, our work identifies ELA 2 as a major new epidermal protease involved in essential pathways for skin barrier function. These results highlight the importance of the control of epidermal protease activity in skin homeostasis and designate ELA 2 as a major protease driving the pathogenesis of NS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe gap {{junction}} gene Connexin 31. 1 {{has been reported}} to be expressed predominantly in the <b>epidermis</b> <b>of</b> murine skin. To study the function of this gene, we generated mice in which the coding DNA of the Connexin 31. 1 gene was replaced by lacZ reporter coding DNA. Using β-galactosidase staining, we have shown that lacZ/Connexin 31. 1 was expressed in the spinous and <b>granular</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis,</b> in cells <b>of</b> olfactory epithelium and in the vomeronasal organ. During embryogenesis, Connexin 31. 1 was co-expressed with another isoform, Connexin 31, in the post-implantation trophoblast cell lineage and, later in gestation, in placental glycogen cells. Although homozygous Connexin 31. 1 -deficient mice were fertile and showed no morphological or functional defects in adult organs expressing this gene, 30 % of the offspring expected according to Mendelian inheritance were lost between embryonic days 11. 5 and 14. 5 and surviving embryos were significantly reduced in weight near the end of pregnancy. Placentas of Connexin 31. 1 -deficient embryos were reduced in weight and showed altered morphology of the spongiotrophoblast and labyrinth layer. The spongiotrophoblast formed a compact barrier at the decidual border that might restrict the maternal blood supply. We conclude that Connexin 31. 1 is critical for normal placental development but appears to be functionally compensated by other connexin isoforms in the embryo proper and adult mouse...|$|R
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is a common, chronic or chronically relapsing, multifactorial {{skin disease}} that mainly occurs in children but affects also adults. AD usually begins {{early in life}} and often concerns people with a personal or family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. AD is characterized by eczematous changes in the epidermis and originates from a late, T-cell mediated reaction associated to the formation and production of memory T-cell of TH 2 type, occurrence of homing receptor at skin level and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated (CLA) antigens. Extrinsic or allergic AD, but not intrinsic AD, shows high total serum IgE levels {{and the presence of}} specific IgE for environmental and food allergens. A pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD is played by filaggrin, a protein contained in the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis</b> regulating the aggregation of keratin filaments. Mutation in the filaggrin gene causes decreased barrier function <b>of</b> the corny <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis.</b> This favours the enter through the skin of environmental allergens, especially the house dust mite, that further facilitates such entering by the proteolytic activity of its major allergen Der p 1. In fact, recent advances suggest that the dust mite, more than foods, is the major cause of allergic AD. As far as the causal diagnosis of AD is concerned, there is notable evidence supporting the capacity of the atopy patch test (APT) to reproduce the pathophysiologic events of AD. This makes APT a valuable diagnostic tool for AD...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic UV skin {{exposure}} {{leads to}} epidermal differentiation defects in humans {{that can be}} largely restored by pharmacological doses of nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid {{has been identified as}} a ligand for the human G-protein-coupled receptors GPR 109 A and GPR 109 B that signal through Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We have examined the expression, cellular distribution, and functionality of GPR 109 A/B in human skin and skin derived epidermal cells. Results: Nicotinic acid increases epidermal differentiation in photodamaged human skin as judged by the terminal differentiation markers caspase 14 and filaggrin. Both GPR 109 A and GPR 109 B genes are transcribed in human skin and in epidermal keratinocytes, but expression in dermal fibroblasts is below limits of detection. Receptor transcripts are greatly over-expressed in squamous cell cancers. Receptor protein in normal skin is prominent from the basal through <b>granular</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis,</b> with cellular localization more dispersive in the basal layer but predominantly localized at the plasma membrane in more differentiated epidermal layers. In normal human primary and immortalized keratinocytes, nicotinic acid receptors show plasma membrane localization and functional Gi-mediated signaling. In contrast, in a squamous cell carcinoma derived cell line, receptor protein shows a more diffuse cellular localization and the receptors are nearly non-functional. Conclusions: The results of these studies justify future genetic and pharmacological intervention studies to define possibl...|$|R
40|$|Human peptidylarginine deiminase type III gene (PADI 3) encodes {{a crucial}} post-translational {{modification}} enzyme that converts protein-bound arginine residues into citrulline residues. Its expression {{is restricted to}} a few cell types, including keratinocytes in the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis</b> and in the inner root sheath of hair follicles. In these cells, the enzyme is involved in terminal processing of intermediate filament-binding proteins such as filaggrin and trichohyalin. To study the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of PADI 3 in human keratinocytes at the transcriptional level, we characterized its promoter region using human keratinocytes transfected with variously deleted fragments of the 5 ′-upstream region of PADI 3 coupled to the luciferase gene. We found that as few as 129  bp upstream from the transcription initiation site were sufficient to direct transcription of the reporter gene. Electrophoretic mobility-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that NF-Y (nuclear factor Y) and Sp 1 /Sp 3 (specificity protein 1 / 3) bind to this region in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, mutation of the Sp 1 - or NF-Y-binding motif markedly reduced PADI 3 promoter activity. Furthermore, Sp 1 or NF-YA (NF-Y subunit) small interfering RNAs effectively diminished PADI 3 expression in keratinocytes cultured in both low- and high-calcium medium. These data indicate that PADI 3 expression is driven by Sp 1 /Sp 3 and NF-Y binding to the promoter region...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{multifunctional}} receptor LRP 1 {{has been}} shown to bind and internalize a large number of protein ligands with biological importance such as the pan-protease inhibitor a 2 -macroglobulin (a 2 M). We recently identified A 2 ML 1, a new member of the a 2 M gene family, expressed in epidermis. a 2 ML 1 might contribute to the regulation of desquamation through its inhibitory activity towards proteases of the chymotrypsin family, notably KLK 7. The expression of LRP 1 in epidermis as well as its ability to internalize a 2 ML 1 was investigated. Methods and Principal Findings: In human epidermis, LRP 1 is mainly expressed within the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis,</b> which gathers the most differentiated keratinocytes, as shown by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using two different antibodies. By using various experimental approaches, we show that the receptor binding domain of a 2 ML 1 (RBDl) is specifically internalized into the macrophage-like cell line RAW and colocalizes with LRP 1 upon internalization. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that RBDl binds LRP 1 at the cell surface. Addition of RAP, a universal inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP 1, prevents RBDl binding at the cell surface as well as internalization into RAW cells. Silencing Lrp 1 expression with specific siRNA strongly reduces RBDl internalization. Conclusions and Significance: Keratinocytes of the upper differentiated <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>epidermis</b> express LRP 1 as well as a 2 ML 1. Our study also reveals that a 2 ML 1 is a new ligand for LRP 1. Our findings are consistent with endocytosis by LRP 1 o...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{expression}} {{and function of}} the membrane-associated or type I transglutaminase (TGase 1) in human epidermis, {{we have made a}} new anti-human TGase 1 antibody in goats elicited against a purified active recombinant protein expressed in bacteria. By use of Western blotting and immunoprecipitation methods, the antibody reacted with high specificity with only the TGase 1 activity <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis</b> and in cultured keratinocytes. By indirect immunofluorescence, the antibody decorated the entire epidermis, including the basal layer, with some potentiation <b>of</b> the <b>granular</b> <b>layer.</b> However, these staining properties are quite different from those of a widely used, commercially available TGase 1 monoclonal antibody (termed B. C 1), which decorates the <b>granular</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidermis.</b> By Western blotting, it identifies the TGase 1 protein band only weakly, but recognizes strongly a group of bands of 15 - 20 kDa, two of which by amino acid analysis and amino acid sequencing are the small proline-rich (SPR) 1 and SPR 2 proteins, also expressed in epidermal and epithelial tissues. Together with a series of blocking experiments with TGase 1 proteins and synthetic peptides, these data reveal that the major epitope of the B. C 1 antibody most likely resides on the amino-terminus of these two SPR proteins rather than on TGase 1. Further studies will now be necessary to determine the role(s) of TGase 1 during the different stages of development and differentiation in the epidermis...|$|R
