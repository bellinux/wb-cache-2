5|$|In 2000, the Channel 4 {{television}} programme What Sank the Mary Rose? attempted {{to investigate the}} causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models {{of the ship and}} metal weights to simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without capsizing. In later tests, a fan was used to create a breeze similar to the one reported to <b>have</b> <b>suddenly</b> sprung up {{on the day of the}} sinking as the real Mary Rose went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the breeze in the upper works forced it to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the waterline and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.|$|E
5|$|One {{of several}} ecclesiastical sources that deal {{specifically}} with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley. Since this grant probably {{dates to the}} period after Ragnall's defeat to Áengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204). The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family, a powerful kindred that had recently begun to expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to the frontier of the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll. Since Bute seems to have fallen {{into the hands of}} this kindred at about the time of Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against Áengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have been perceived as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just beyond the borders of the Scottish realm. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to <b>have</b> <b>suddenly</b> ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.|$|E

500|$|Walter Röhrl later {{confirmed}} that Toivonen was taking medicine for his flu. [...] In a later interview with Motorsport News, fellow driver Malcolm Wilson claimed {{that since the}} neck injuries sustained in his 1985 Costa Smeralda crash, Toivonen had suffered from random blackouts but did not tell his team {{because he did not}} want to lose his place at Lancia.

McCarthy stated in a 2006 RTÉ radio interview, [...] "What we have developed is a way to construct magnetic fields so that when you travel round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy". In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time. Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is [...] "not the first company to claim they <b>have</b> <b>suddenly</b> discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy" [...] while Martin Fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in {{his work}} on U.S. coins, took a more positive view of Barber's coinage: [...] "the last word as to their aesthetic merits {{has yet to be}} written. Little admired or collected for more than three generations after their appearance , these essentially conservative but most dignified coins <b>have</b> <b>suddenly</b> become extremely popular with collectors". Vermeule argued that [...] "the designs of Barber's coins were more attuned to the times than he perhaps realized. The plumpish, matronly gravitas of Liberty had come to America seven years earlier in the person of Frédéric Bartholdi's giant statue ... He suggested that the features of Daniel Chester French's huge statue Republic, created for the World Columbian Exposition, [...] "were absolutely in harmony with what Charles Barber had created for the coinage in the year of the Fair's opening".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would <b>have</b> <b>suddenly</b> found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|Other artists {{employed}} symbolism {{in a more}} prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's {{great influence}} on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter {{the sense of the}} real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand. Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that [...] "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed." [...] His treatment of architectural details, niches, colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that [...] "the particular objects or people we see before us <b>have</b> <b>suddenly,</b> jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".|$|E

2500|$|The D.H.108 first flew on 15 May 1946, a mere {{eight months}} after Frost had a go-ahead on the project.

On 12 April 1948, a D.H.108 did set a world's speed record at 973.65km/h (605mph) and later on became the first jet aircraft to exceed the speed of sound.

2500|$|Born in {{the village}} of Hòa Hảo, near Châu Đốc, Vietnam, French Indochina, in 1920, Sổ {{was the son of a}} {{moderately}} wealthy peasant. Plagued in his youth by illness, he was a mediocre student and graduated from high school only because of his father's influence. He was a brave child, so his father sent him to Núi Cấm in the Seven Mountains to learn from a hermit who was both a mystic and a healer. After some training, Sổ made his mark during a stormy night in May 1939, having returned to his village after his master's death. While in an agitated state, Sổ appeared to <b>have</b> <b>suddenly</b> been cured of his illnesses and started to propound his religious teachings, which were based on Buddhism, on the spot. According to observers, he spoke for several hours spontaneously [...] "with eloquence and erudition about the sublime dogmas of Buddhism ...

2500|$|In {{many ways}} the {{consideration}} of the English bookplate, in its numerous styles, from the late Elizabethan to the late Victorian period, is particularly interesting. In all its varieties it reflects with great fidelity the prevailing taste in decorative art at different epochs—as bookplates do in all countries. [...] Of English examples, none thus far {{seems to have been}} discovered of older date than the gift plate of Sir Nicholas Bacon; for the celebrated, gorgeous, hand-painted armorial device attached to a folio that once belonged to Henry VIII, and now is located in the King's library, British Museum, does not fall in the category of bookplates in its modern sense. The next is that of Sir Thomas Tresham, dated 1585. Until {{the last quarter of the}} 17th century the number of authentic English plates is very limited. Their composition is always remarkably simple, and displays nothing of the German elaborateness. They are as a rule very plainly armorial, and the decoration is usually limited to a symmetrical arrangement of mantling, with an occasional display of palms or wreaths. Soon after the Restoration, however, a bookplate seems to <b>have</b> <b>suddenly</b> become an established accessory to most well-ordered libraries.|$|E
