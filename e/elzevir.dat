25|$|Elsevier {{was founded}} in 1880 and took the name from the Dutch {{publishing}} house <b>Elzevir</b> which has no connection with the present company. The <b>Elzevir</b> family operated as booksellers and publishers in the Netherlands; the founder, Lodewijk <b>Elzevir</b> (1542–1617), lived in Leiden and established the business in 1580.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{invention}} of the printing press by Laurens Janszoon Coster in the 1430s appears to be a romantic notion, the Low Countries had an early start in printing. By 1470 a printing press was in use in Utrecht, where the first dated extant book was printed in 1473, while the first book in the Dutch language was the 1477 Delft Bible. By 1481 the Low Countries had printing shops in 21 cities and towns. Famous publishing houses like those of Christoffel Plantijn in Antwerp from 1555 on, Pierre Phalèse the Elder in Leuven from 1553, and the House of <b>Elzevir</b> in Leiden from around 1580 turned the Low Countries into a regional center of publishing.|$|E
25|$|He {{was part}} of a learned circle that {{included}} the much-maligned Ainsworth, Hugh Broughton and Matthew Slade. However, Paget was more cautious and conservative in adopting readings and interpretations from Jewish scholars than philo-semitic interpreters like Ainsworth and Dury. His reservations were set out in An Admonition touching Talmudique allegations, which was appended to An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes. Here he made clear that one of his motivations in using Jewish sources was to employ them controversially against Judaism. The interest in Judaism, its Scripture and its intellectual traditions was spreading within Dutch Calvinist culture and Leiden University was at its centre. Joseph Justus Scaliger had pioneered Semitic studies there and in 1625 the university press acquired an oriental section, with fonts for a range of Afroasiatic languages, on the initiative of the House of <b>Elzevir.</b> It was also the university most closely associated with overseas trade and expansion. Two of John Paget's nephews were sent to Leiden for their education: Robert in 1628 and Nathan in 1638. In the quarter century 1626–50 Leiden drew 52% of its students from abroad.|$|E

X., ff.1–219). Some of {{the text of the}} Paraphrase was published with a Latin translation and Preface by Philipp Melanchthon in Basel, 1554, but this was not widely circulated. [...] A full reproduction with an accompanying Latin translation was made around 1630 by the Vatican scholar Leo Allatius [...] "for his own private gratification" [...] and this was published by the <b>Elzevir</b> typsetters in Leiden, 1635, apparently without Allatius's knowledge or consent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term Textus Receptus comes from the publisher's preface to the 1633 edition {{produced}} by Bonaventure and his nephew Abraham <b>Elzevir</b> who were partners in a printing business at Leiden. The preface reads, Textum ergo habes, nunc ab omnibus receptum: in quo nihil immutatum aut corruptum damus, translated as, [...] "so you hold the text, now received by all, in which (is) nothing corrupt." [...] The two words textum and receptum were modified from the accusative to the nominative case to render textus receptus. Over time, this term has been retroactively applied to Erasmus' editions, as his work served {{as the basis of}} the others.|$|E

2500|$|Leiden {{flourished in}} the 16th and 17th century. At {{the close of the}} 15th century the weaving establishments (mainly broadcloth) of Leiden were very important, and after the {{expulsion}} of the Spaniards Leiden cloth, Leiden baize and Leiden camlet were familiar terms. [...] In the same period, Leiden developed an important printing and publishing industry. The influential printer Christoffel Plantijn lived there at one time. One of his pupils was Lodewijk <b>Elzevir</b> (1547–1617), who established the largest bookshop and printing works in Leiden, a business continued by his descendants through 1712 and the name subsequently adopted (in a variant spelling) by contemporary publisher Elsevier.|$|E
2500|$|Although a {{faithful}} Catholic, he incurred the suspicion of the Church by his tract De magnetica vulnerum curatione (1621), against Jean Roberti, which {{was thought to}} derogate {{from some of the}} miracles. His works were collected and edited by his son Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont and published by Lodewijk <b>Elzevir</b> in Amsterdam as Ortus medicinae, vel opera et opuscula omnia ("The Origin of Medicine, or Complete Works") in 1648. [...] "Ortus medicinae" [...] was based on, but not restricted to, the material of [...] Dageraad ofte Nieuwe Opkomst der Geneeskunst ("Daybreak, or the New Rise of Medicine"), which was published in 1644 in Van Helmont's native Dutch. His son Frans's writings, Cabbalah Denudata (1677) and Opuscula philosophica (1690) are a mixture of theosophy, mysticism and alchemy.|$|E
2500|$|Caslon's type rapidly {{built up}} a {{reputation}} for workmanship, being described by Henry Newman in 1733 as [...] "the work of that Artist who seems to aspire to outvying all the Workmen in his way in Europe, so that our Printers send no more to Holland for the <b>Elzevir</b> and other Letters which they formerly valued themselves much." [...] Mosley describes Caslon's Long Primer No. 1 type as [...] "type with generous proportions and it was normally cast with letter-spacing that was not too tight, characteristics that are needed in types on a small body. And yet it is so soundly made that words that are set in it keep their shape and are comfortably readable...It is a type that works best in the narrow measure of a two-column page or in quite modest octavos." [...] Caslon sold a French Canon face he did not engrave that may {{to have been the}} work of Joseph Moxon with some modifications, and his larger-size faces follow this high-contrast model. Compared to the more delicate, stylised and experimental designs that developed in Europe during Caslon's life, notably the romain du roi type and the work of Fleischmann in Amsterdam, and the Baskerville type of John Baskerville in Birmingham that appeared towards the end of Caslon's career, Caslon's type was quite conservative. Johnson notes that his 1764 specimen [...] "might have been produced a hundred years earlier". Stanley Morison described Caslon's type as [...] "a happy archaicism".|$|E

The brothers were extolled over their famous prints and editions; they were even complimented with being referred to as [...] "the <b>Elzevirs</b> of Britain". The <b>Elzevirs</b> were a Dutch family that had a printing press and published as well as sold books during the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R
60|$|This {{fragment}} {{of a literary}} dialogue I translate from 'Entretiens sur les Contes de Fees,' a book which contains more of old talk about books and booksellers than about fairies and folk-lore. The 'Entretiens' were published in 1699, about sixteen years after the <b>Elzevirs</b> ceased to be publishers. The fragment is valuable: first, because it shows us how early the taste for collecting <b>Elzevirs</b> was fully developed, and, secondly, because it contains very sound criticism of the mania. Already, in the seventeenth century, lovers of the tiny Elzevirian books waxed pathetic over dates, already they knew that a 'Caesar' of 1635 was the right 'Caesar,' already they were fond of the red-lettered passages, as in {{the first edition of}} the 'Virgil' of 1636. As early as 1699, too, the Parisian critic knew that the editions were not very correct, and that the paper, type, ornaments, and FORMAT were their main attractions. To these we must now add the rarity of really good <b>Elzevirs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Among <b>Elzevirs</b> desirable, yet not hopelessly rare, is the 'Virgil' of 1636. Heinsius was {{the editor}} of this {{beautiful}} volume, prettily printed, but incorrect. Probably {{it is hard to}} correct with absolute accuracy works in the clear but minute type which the <b>Elzevirs</b> affected. They have won fame by the elegance of their books, but their intention was to sell good books cheap, like Michel Levy. The small type was required to get plenty of [...] "copy" [...] into little bulk. Nicholas Heinsius, the son of {{the editor of}} the 'Virgil,' when he came to correct his father's edition, found that it contained so many coquilles, or misprints, as to be nearly the most incorrect copy in the world. Heyne says, [...] "Let the 'Virgil' be one of the rare <b>Elzevirs,</b> if you please, but within it has scarcely a trace of any good quality." [...] Yet the first edition of this beautiful little book, with its two passages of red letters, is so desirable that, till he could possess it, Charles Nodier would not profane his shelves by any 'Virgil' at all.|$|R
6000|$|... “I thought Mr. Lintot’s civility {{not to be}} neglected, so {{gave the}} [...] boy a small bag {{containing}} three shirts and an <b>Elzevir</b> Virgil, and, [...] mounting in an instant, proceeded on the road, with my man before, [...] my courteous stationer beside, and the aforesaid devil behind.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the little}} volume, the <b>Elzevir</b> size, is bound in blue morocco, by Cuzin, I {{hope it is}} not wholly a foolish bargain; but what do I want, after all, with a French [...] "Pilgrim's Progress"? These are the errors a man is always making who does not collect books with system, with a {{conscience}} and an aim.|$|E
6000|$|Though Elzevirs {{have been}} more fashionable than at present, they are still {{regarded}} by novelists as the great prize of the book collector. You read in novels about [...] "priceless little Elzevirs," [...] about books [...] "as rare as an old Elzevir." [...] I have met, {{in the works of}} a lady novelist (but not elsewhere), with an <b>Elzevir</b> 'Theocritus.' The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon introduced into one of his romances a romantic <b>Elzevir</b> Greek Testament, [...] "worth its weight in gold." [...] Casual remarks of this kind encourage a popular delusion that all Elzevirs are pearls of considerable price. When a man is first smitten with the pleasant fever of book-collecting, it is for Elzevirs that he searches. At first he thinks himself in amazing luck. In Booksellers' Row and in Castle Street he [...] "picks up," [...] for a shilling or two, Elzevirs, real or supposed. To the beginner, any book with a sphere on the title-page is an <b>Elzevir.</b> For the beginner's instruction, two copies of spheres are printed here. The second is a sphere, an ill-cut, ill-drawn sphere, which is not Elzevirian at all. The mark was used in the seventeenth century by many other booksellers and printers. The first, on the other hand, is a true Elzevirian sphere, from a play of Moliere's, printed in 1675. Observe the comparatively neat drawing of the first sphere, and be not led away after spurious imitations.|$|E

'Will you kindly take from the shelf that volume of Cicero [...] "De Officiis," [...] he said, pointing to a copy of an <b>Elzevir</b> variorum edition,--not the small duodecimo Elzevir,--'remove the paper you will find there, and burn it in the fire on the hearth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But, {{to return}} to our 'Pastissier,' here is M. de Fontaine de Resbecq's account of how he wooed and won his own copy of this illustrious <b>Elzevir.</b> [...] "I began my walk to-day," [...] says this haunter of ancient stalls, [...] "by the Pont Marie and the Quai de la Greve, the pillars of Hercules of the book-hunting world. After having viewed and {{reviewed}} these remote books, I was going away, when my attention was caught by a small naked volume, without a stitch of binding. I seized it, and what was my delight when I recognised one of the rarest of that famed <b>Elzevir</b> collection whose height is measured as minutely as the carats of the diamond. There was no indication of price on the box where this jewel was lying; the book, though unbound, was perfectly clean within. 'How much?' said I to the bookseller. 'You can have it for six sous,' he answered; 'is it too much?' 'No,' said I, and, trembling a little, I handed him the thirty centimes he asked for the 'Pastissier Francois.' You may believe, my friend, that after such a piece of luck at the start, one goes home fondly embracing the beloved object of one's search. That is exactly what I did." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the moral}} {{is that only}} tall Elzevirs are beautiful, only tall Elzevirs {{preserve}} their ancient proportions, only tall Elzevirs are worth collecting. Dr. Lemuel Gulliver remarks that the King of Lilliput was taller {{than any of his}} court by almost the breadth of a nail, and that his altitude filled the minds of all with awe. Well, the Philistine may think a few millimetres, more or less, in the height of an <b>Elzevir</b> are of little importance. When he comes to sell, he will discover the difference. An uncut, or almost uncut, copy of a good <b>Elzevir</b> may be worth fifty or sixty pounds or more; an ordinary copy may bring fewer pence. The binders usually pare down the top and bottom more than the sides. I have a 'Rabelais' of the good date, with the red title (1663), and some of the pages have never been opened, at the sides. But the height is only some 122 millimetres, a mere dwarf. Anything over 130 millimetres is very rare. Therefore the collector of Elzevirs should have one of those useful ivory-handled knives on which the French measures are marked, and thus he will at once be able to satisfy himself as to the exact height of any example which he encounters.|$|E

6000|$|A brief {{sketch of}} the history of the <b>Elzevirs</b> may here be useful. The founder of the family, a Flemish bookbinder, Louis, left Louvain and settled in Leyden in 1580. He bought a house {{opposite}} the University, and opened a book-shop. Another shop, on college ground, was opened in 1587. Louis was a good bookseller, a very ordinary publisher. It was not till shortly before his death, in 1617, that his grandson Isaac bought a set of types and other material. Louis left six sons. Two of these, Matthew and Bonaventure, kept on the business, dating ex officina Elzeviriana. In 1625 Bonaventure and Abraham (son of Matthew) became partners. The [...] "good dates" [...] of Elzevirian books begin from 1626. The two <b>Elzevirs</b> chose excellent types, and after nine years' endeavours turned out the beautiful 'Caesar' of 1635.|$|R
