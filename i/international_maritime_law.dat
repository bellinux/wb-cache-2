40|$|<b>International</b> <b>maritime</b> {{transport}} is {{an important}} means of transport in international trade. The vessels used in <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> transport face unique dangers which necessitate <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> that addresses the perils associated with <b>maritime</b> transport. <b>Maritime</b> <b>law</b> concerns many jurisdictions, which creates a special interest {{for the study of}} conflict of laws. There are private <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>laws</b> in addition to multilateral treaties. This paper analyzes the international approach that the United States takes in <b>maritime</b> conflict of <b>laws,</b> and compares it with the Venezuelan system of private international law. Venezuela is a civil law country with old maritime legislation which is in need of reform, so comparison with the United States’ system of law, which is in constant change and development, may prove useful. This conflict of laws analysis focuses only on the aspect of choice of applicable law...|$|R
25|$|The {{sinking of}} Tabora went {{virtually}} unnoticed by the public. The German Empire did not {{protest against the}} British and Australian action, nor did they even publish a statement about the incident. Germany′s behavior after the incident indicated that Tabora probably was not a hospital ship {{within the meaning of}} Artciles X and XI of the Hague Convention of 1907, and that her sinking had not violated <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

25|$|Two days before, U-20 {{had sunk}} Earl of Lathom, but first allowed {{the crew to}} escape in boats. According to <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>law,</b> any {{military}} vessel stopping an unarmed civilian ship was required to allow those on board time to escape before sinking it. The conventions had been drawn up in a time before {{the invention of the}} submarine and took no account of the severe risk a small vessel, such as a submarine, faced if it gave up the advantage of a surprise attack. Schwieger could have allowed the crew and passengers of Lusitania to take to the boats, but he considered the danger of being rammed or fired upon by deck guns too great. Merchant ships had, in fact, been advised to steer directly at any U-boat that surfaced. A cash bonus had been offered for any that were sunk, though the advice was carefully worded so as not to amount to an order to ram. This feat would only be accomplished once during the war by a commercial vessel when in 1918 the White Star Liner RMS Olympic, sister ship to Titanic, rammed into SM U-103 in the English Channel, sinking the submarine.|$|E

500|$|Stopping {{to visit}} with friends en route to Washington, D.C., Breckinridge arrived on December 7, 1805. His {{nomination}} was confirmed by the Senate on December 20. He was influential in Jefferson's infrequent cabinet meetings, where he served as the lone voice of the west. His most notable advisory opinion [...] that no local government in the Territory of Orleans {{had the power to}} tax federal property there [...] was upheld in the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland. He was sworn in to represent the federal government before the Supreme Court when it convened [...] about a week late because of the illness of several justices [...] on February 12, 1806. He was spared the awkwardness of practicing before a judge he had voted to impeach because Samuel Chase was absent for the Court's entire six-week term. The court heard only six cases during the term; most of them were cases Breckinridge had inherited from his predecessor, and Harrison wrote that none were of lasting importance. Cases such as Maley v. Shattuck involved <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> [...] an area with which Breckinridge was not familiar [...] and arose from the Napoleonic Wars, which complicated neutral American trade with both Great Britain and France. During the term, Breckinridge lost four cases, won one, and the justices sent one back for retrial in a lower court.|$|E
500|$|The Law of the Sea is the {{particular}} body international law applied to maritime questions and offenses. Empires such as Rome and China long claimed universal jurisdiction; during the Middle Ages, Italian maritime republics such as Venice and Genoa recognized {{the existence of}} rival states but claimed the right to close the seas to their traffic. Portuguese and Spanish pursuit of similar rights over new seas and lands during the Age of Discovery and papal support of their claims {{was a factor in}} the Wars of Religion; in 1609, a jurist hired to defend a lucrative act of piracy by the Dutch East India Company penned Mare Liberum, an argument in favor of freedom of the seas that ultimately produced the compromise that territory extended as far as land-based cannonshot could reach, standardized to 3 nautical miles (...) , and that everything beyond was international waters. President Woodrow Wilson argued this principle as part of United States's entrance into World War I and as one of his Fourteen Points afterwards; nonetheless, President Truman's unilateral claim of jurisdiction over the oil reserves of America's continental shelf in 1945 directly led {{to the end of the}} regime. The three rounds of the United Nations' conferences on the Law of the Sea eventually reshaped <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> but the United States has not ratified the present treaty but instead adopted its policies piecemeal via presidential proclamations.|$|E

2500|$|However, many {{legal systems}} allow {{the rights of}} salvors to {{override}} {{the rights of the}} original owners of a wreck or its cargo. As a general rule, non-historic civilian shipwrecks are considered fair game for salvage. Under <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>law,</b> for shipwrecks of a certain age, the original owner may have lost all claim to the cargo. Anyone who finds the wreck can then file a salvage claim on it and place a lien on the vessel, and subsequently mount a salvage operation (see Finders, keepers). The State of North Carolina questionably claims [...] "all photographs, video recordings, or other documentary materials of a derelict vessel or shipwreck or its contents, relics, artifacts, or historic materials in the custody of any agency of North Carolina government or its subdivisions" [...] to be its property.|$|E

40|$|Piracy has reemerged in {{the past}} decade, but {{international}} laws lag behind While modern-day piracy threatens lives and industries, antipiracy efforts are constrained by international legal definitions written centuries ago to address a crime that looked radically different from its twenty-first-century counterpart. Today, piracy networks are increasingly sophisticated and land-based, but piracy laws define the crime as one occurring on the high seas. Handcuffed by the high seas requirement, nations prosecute only junior pirates while pirate kingpins operate {{from the safety of}} land. In recent months, lower piracy rates have promised stability and masked the urgency of the threat. Although attacks have decreased, ransoms have skyrocketed and antipiracy successes come from methods resting on shaky legal foundations. The false sense of complacency in the antipiracy movement only heightens the need for a new definition of piracy. This Comment seeks a solution that will maintain existing <b>international</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>laws</b> but interpret {{them in a way that}} extends the piracy definition to land-based activities. These adjustments will efficiently deter pirates without the legal precariousness of existing antipiracy methods. It uses maritime treaties, counterterrorism tools, and familiar legal doctrines to pull pirate kingpins into the purview of piracy laws...|$|R
