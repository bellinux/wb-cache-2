5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged {{to reduce the amount}} of food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E

After {{a meeting with}} construction unions in 1972, Nixon wrote in his diary of labor leaders having [...] "character and guts {{and a bit of}} patriotism". Labor leadership were also alienated by the Democratic candidate George McGovern and his leftist views on domestic policies. On July 19, the AFL-CIO refused to endorse McGovern as President.

2500|$|Lord of the Rings Online {{employs a}} {{mechanism}} called [...] "tapping," [...] {{which is a}} way for the game to detect who attacked an enemy. [...] The game can then decide, based on who attacked an enemy first, who to give experience to and how much to give. [...] If players try to power-level, they will find that the high-level character will absorb most of the experience (frequently <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste),</b> and the low-level character will receive just {{a small fraction of the}} experience for the defeat of the enemy, even if the characters are not in a group. [...] The main problem with this method is that it discourages players from helping other players if they randomly stumble upon each other. [...] For example, if one player is fighting an enemy and is losing the fight, and another player stumbles upon the fight and helps the nearly-defeated player, the nearly-defeated player will lose most of the experience from victory over the enemy. [...] In the past, this has caused tension between players who appreciate the help and players who would rather suffer defeat than the loss of the experience reward.|$|E

Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show. [...] "I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could," [...] she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. [...] " [...] next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time {{it was the fact that}} they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun.

40|$|With {{the aging}} of the nuclear park, {{decommissioning}} and dismantling of nuclear installations after their service life is becoming an important issue for the nuclear industry. The radiological characterisation of the equipment and structures present in the reactor and its environment is an essential stage in a decommissioning project since it permits to define and optimize the decommissioning strategy and the disassembling operations. In addition, correct activation estimates are essential for determining the quantity {{and the nature of the}} radiological waste generated during decommissioning. The adoption of efficient dismantling procedures and the optimization of the mass flow <b>going</b> <b>to</b> different <b>waste</b> repositories might reduce substantially the total cost of decommissioning. The present work has been done in the framework of the decommissioning and dismantling of the experimental reactor of the University of Strasburg (RUS). A methodology that combines theoretical calculations and direct measurements has been developed for determining the long-term induced activity in the graphite, concrete and materials present in the reactor. After characterisation of the different elements present in the reactor, it is then possible to plan efficiently the disassembling and dismantling of the system and to optimise the mass flow <b>going</b> <b>to</b> different <b>waste</b> repositories. From a scientific perspective, the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental values validates the approach and the methodology used in the present study and tests the consistency and the reliability of the nuclear data used for activation analysis...|$|R

This property {{has been used to}} advantage by grinding it into a fine glass powder (GLP) for incorporation into concrete as a pozzolanic material.

He received criticism for using language that many outlets deemed to be pejorative towards Native Americans. Trump derogatorily referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a speculated potential candidate for the Democratic nomination, by the Native American epithet [...] "Pocahontas", a reference to her unproven claims of Native American heritage. He had previously used this as a derisive nickname for Warren during his 2016 campaign. Trump said, [...] "I {{have a feeling that}} in the next election you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be swamped with candidates, but you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>wasting</b> your time.

50|$|Although waste {{collection}} practices vary in each county in Ireland, most services share the guiding principles that waste is sorted into different categories at household level and that {{waste collection}} charges are highest for <b>waste</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> landfill sites. <b>Waste</b> collection services have been increasingly run by private companies, rather than local government, {{over the last}} decade. In Dublin several companies now compete <b>to</b> provide <b>waste</b> collection services.
