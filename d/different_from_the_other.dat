5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is known}} from three certain species, P. walkeri, P. tubicen, and P. cyrtocristatus. All {{of them can}} be {{distinguished}} from each other, and have many differences. The first named species, therefore the type, is P. walkeri. One certain specimen, from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it, but many more are almost certainly referable. Like stated above, it is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two species, with it having a simpler internal structure than P. tubicen, a straighter crest and different internal structuring than P. cyrtocristatus.|$|E

5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E
5|$|This {{similarity}} {{results in}} nearly identical chemical behavior {{and in the}} formation of similar chemical compounds. The chemistry of hafnium is so similar to that of zirconium that a separation on chemical reactions was not possible; only the physical properties of the compounds differ. The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the chemistry of these twin elements. Titanium is considerably <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two owing to the effects of the lanthanide contraction.|$|E

The 2016–17 season was the first in which the NBA held an awards show after the completion of the Finals, during which the winners of all season-long individual awards are announced except for the winner of the J.

5|$|Marshall held another {{press conference}} on October 17 to {{announce}} that the NAACP was requesting a formal government investigation into the working conditions that had led the men to strike. He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy that put {{the great majority of}} African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and lack of training that had led to the catastrophic detonationand the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers. when their actions concerning loading ammunition after the explosion were not significantly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9, but had been shipped out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialled.|$|E
5|$|The {{main flow}} {{of the game is}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Dragon Quest games; instead of {{exploring}} one large world, the party goes to separate continents by placing stone shards into their appropriate pedestals in Estard Fane. Once all of the missing shards are located and placed for a particular pedestal, the party is transported to the trapped location in the past. After solving whatever problems plague the location, the party then travels back to Estard, the beginning island. From there, they can travel via boat, carpet, or skystone to the modern version of the location they just saved. These saved lands appear on the main map, although the originals (from the past) can be revisited through the ruins.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} a {{concentric}} fortress, which von Haschenperg had hoped would combine the best of Italian military architecture, able to carry heavy guns but with a low profile to protect against any incoming artillery fire. Various flaws rapidly became apparent. The castle's design had focused on defence, {{with the result that}} the guns could not easily be brought to bear on enemy vessels, which had been the original intent of building the fortification by the Camber; some of the angles of fire from the defences were blocked by the entrance and the high water table may have caused serious damp problems on the ground floor. Furthermore, the design was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Device Forts constructed across the region and would have stood out as unusual and not in keeping with the King's general intent for the chain of forts.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom {{possessed the}} largest navy {{in the world}} for the whole of the ironclad period. The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them {{worldwide}} in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was no longer possible, so the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of 'coast-defence battleships', starting with the Devastation class. These 'breastwork monitors' were markedly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship. As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War. The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to 'overwhelm' enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their low-profile and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running gauntlets. Mines and obstructions, however, negated these advantages—a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough Devastation-class 'battleships' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act, which promulgated the idea of a 'two-power standard', that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
