50|$|A <b>floor</b> <b>broker</b> is an {{independent}} member of an exchange who {{can act as a}} broker for other members who become overloaded with orders, as an agent {{on the floor of the}} exchange. The <b>floor</b> <b>broker</b> receives an order via Teletype machine from his firm's trading department and then proceeds to the appropriate trading post on the exchange floor. There he joins other brokers and the specialist in the security being bought or sold and executes the trade at the best competitive price available. On completion of the transaction the customer is notified through his registered representative back at the firm and the trade is printed on the consolidated ticker tape which is displayed electronically around the country. A <b>floor</b> <b>broker</b> should not be confused with a floor trader who trades as a principal for his or her own account, rather than as a broker.Commission brokers are employees of a member firm.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. This paper {{studies the}} {{relative}} contribution of <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> and local <b>floor</b> members (locals) towards the price discovery process. Using detailed Share Price Index (SPI) futures contract {{data from the}} Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE), we construct 1 - and 5 -min series of volume weighted average prices for both <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> and locals. Estimates of Gonzalo and Granger [J. Bus. Econ. Stat. 13 (1995) 27] plus Hasbrouck [J. Finance 50 (1995) 1175] information shares reveal that trades initiated by locals account for approximately one-third of all price discovery within the market. Also, {{it is found that}} the locals' share of price discovery is higher than their share of trading activity. However, when there is high volatility or when observation intervals are lengthened, locals' contribution to price discovery declines. We conclude that although <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> are the main contributors, locals do play a significant role within the price discovery process. Kingsley Fong and Ralf Zurbruegg[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that reputations, developed in repeated face-to-face interactions, allow nonanonymous, floor-based trading venues to attenuate adverse selection in the trading process. We identify instances when stocks {{listed on the}} New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) experience a non-trivial relocation on the trading floor for reasons unrelated to execution quality. Although the specialist follows the stock to its new location, most <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> do not. We use this natural experiment to determine whether reputation appears to affect trading costs. We find a discernable increase {{in the cost of}} liquidity in the days surrounding a stock’s relocation. The increase is more pronounced for stocks with higher adverse selection and greater broker turnover. Using NYSE audit-trail data, we find that the <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> relocating with the stock obtain lower trading costs than those brokers who do not move and those that begin trading post-move in the days surrounding the move. Together, these results suggest that reputation {{plays an important role in}} the liquidity provision process on the floor of the NYSE...|$|R
50|$|According to a 2009 Bloomberg article: Flash systems {{trace their}} roots {{as far back}} as 1978 to efforts by exchanges to {{electronically}} replicate how a trader might yell an order to <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> before entering it into the system that displays all bids and offers. Markets have evolved since the days of floor brokers’ dominance, with computer algorithms now buying and selling shares 1,000 times faster than the blink of an eye.|$|R

50|$|A {{floor trader}} {{is a member}} of a stock or {{commodities}} exchange who trades on the floor of that exchange for his or her own account.

The term should not be confused with <b>floor</b> <b>broker.</b> Floor traders are occasionally referred to as registered competitive traders, individual liquidity providers or locals.|$|E
50|$|In 1911, Klingenstein joined Hallgarten & Co. after {{receiving}} a B.A. degree from Columbia University and completing one year of Columbia Law School. Neil Finch graduated from West Point, and became a colonel during World War I. Four years later, Maurice joined Hallgarten & Co., becoming a partner in 1919. The following year, Klingenstein left Hallgarten to join Arthur E. Frank. Jacob Wertheim died on November 21, 1920, leaving an estate appraised in December 1921 at $7.3 million gross and $6.0 million net (including $2.1 million in Liberty bonds, $860,377 in Underwood Typewriter common stock, $738,675 in Sears Roebuck common stock, and $560,000 in real estate).

5000|$|The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a {{physical}} exchange, with a hybrid market for placing orders electronically from any location {{as well as on}} the trading floor. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a <b>floor</b> <b>broker,</b> who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated Market Maker ("DMM") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a spread exists, no trade immediately takes place - in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the [...] "tape" [...] and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for program trading.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, Ambassador Doley {{bought a}} seat on the New York Stock Exchange and is the only African American to have owned a seat (there are no longer NYSE {{individual}} memberships). He operated his membership as a <b>Floor</b> <b>Broker,</b> executing orders for other members and member firms {{on the floor of the}} NYSE. Ambassador Doley began his professional career in investment banking in 1968. He served as Vice President with major Wall Street firms prior to buying his own seat. He serviced institutional accounts of banks, insurance companies, and universities with portfolios totaling over $500 million. During this period, Ambassador Doley also affected and counseled on a number of mergers and acquisitions of life insurance companies. Ambassador Doley is the Co-Founder of the U.S. Africa Chamber of Commerce. He chaired the investment committee of Southern Africa Enterprise Development Fund's (SAEDF) private equity fund and placed the first black market maker on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Over the years he’s advised African stock exchanges and the regulatory bodies of those stock exchanges. Ambassador Doley was honored by his industry peers as an Outstanding Broker of the Year in 1971. The Dow Jones Wall Street Journal selected him as Stock Picker of the Year in 1990.|$|E
5000|$|Through Depew, he was {{introduced}} to and became a broker for John Tobin & Co., part of the powerful Vanderbilt Organization. At Tobin & Co. he was the <b>floor</b> <b>broker</b> for Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and his son William Henry Vanderbilt on the New York Gold Exchange executing their trading in [...] "greenbacks" [...] and gold during the Civil War. The value of greenbacks against gold varied widely as investors altered their perception {{on the progress of}} the war. Greenbacks United States Notes sold at a discounted price in comparison to gold. However, if chances of victory rose they became perceived as a business opportunity. For the most part however, if the war was dragging on, people wanted the security of gold. Vanderbilt employed a private intelligence network on the front line reporting early news. Hiram Bond's position led to his prominent contacts on Wall Street, in the military, and in politics. He is described by Professor Richard Lowe as having financial dealings during the Civil War with Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.Among the other investment houses acting in collaboration with Commodore Vanderbilt and Tobin, and that Hiram Bond was acquainted with, was that of Leonard Jerome who was the grandfather of Winston Churchill.|$|E

40|$|Cahier de Recherche du Groupe HEC Paris, n° 742 / 2001 We {{consider}} {{information sharing}} between traders("floor brokers") who possess {{different types of}} information, namely information on the payoff of a risky security or information on the volume of liquidity trading in this security. We interpret these traders as dual -capacity <b>brokers</b> on the <b>floor</b> of an exchange. We identify conditions under which the traders are better off sharing information. We also show that information sharing improves price discovery, reduces volatility and lowers expected trading costs. Information sharing can improve or impair {{the depth of the}} market, depending on the values of the parameters. Overall our analysis suggests that information sharing among <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> improves the performance of floor-based trading systems...|$|R
40|$|How does {{automation}} reshape markets? Existing sociological {{studies have}} argued that market automation need not entail a dilution of social relations, but the empirical evidence is inconclusive. Our multi-period ethnography of the New York Stock Exchange addresses this gap by exploring how the NYSE automated trading while preserving its floor intermediaries. Our study reports on observations in 2003 before automation was introduced, outlining the functions traditionally played by specialists and <b>floor</b> <b>brokers.</b> It then analyzes how the Exchange preserved these intermediary roles in 2006 - 08 as it introduced algorithmic order matching, and proposes the notion of folding to denote the process of automating a market while preserving its social structure. Finally, our analysis of the Flash Crash in 2010 suggests that folding allowed the NYSE to outperform its floorless rivals...|$|R
40|$|By {{comparing}} execution {{costs of}} trades handled by Amex floor brokers with trades entered through its automated post execution reporting (PER) system, {{this article provides}} evidence that floor brokers have value. Because they can opportunistically seize liquidity, using a <b>floor</b> <b>broker</b> is equivalent to placing a "smart" limit order. Overall, floor trades have a lower realized half-spread than PER trades (- 3. 06 bps vs. 4. 43 bps). This finding holds for other measures of execution costs and is consistent across all order-size categories. The analysis {{of the value of}} intermediation in a securities market has implications for automated trading systems. ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{identifies}} impersonal efficiency as {{a driver}} of market automation during the past four decades, and speculates about the future problems it might pose. The ideology of impersonal efficiency is rooted in a mistrust of financial intermediaries such as <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> and specialists. Impersonal efficiency has guided the development of market automation towards transparency and impersonality, {{at the expense of}} human trading floors. The result has been an erosion of the informal norms and human judgment that characterize less anonymous markets. We call impersonal efficiency an ideology because we do not think that impersonal markets are always superior to markets built on social ties. This report traces the historical origins of this ideology, considers the problems it has already created in the recent Flash Crash of 2010, and asks what potential risks it might pose in the future...|$|R
50|$|The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) {{began in}} the 9th century. By the 16th century Frankfurt had {{developed}} into an important European hub for trade fairs and financial services. Today the Frankfurt Stock Exchange {{is by far the}} largest in Germany, with a turnover of more than 90 percent of the German stock market and is the third-largest in Europe after the London Stock Exchange and the European branch of the NYSE Euronext. The most important stock market index is the DAX, the index of the 30 largest German business companies listed at the stock exchange. The stock exchange is owned and operated by Deutsche Börse, which is itself listed in the DAX. Deutsche Börse also owns the European futures exchange Eurex and clearing company Clearstream. Trading takes place exclusively via the Xetra trading system, with redundant <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> taking on the role of market-makers on the new platform.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates an {{important}} feature of market design: pre-trade transparency, defined as the availability of information about pending trading interest in the market. We {{look at how the}} NYSE’s introduction of OpenBook, which enables traders off the exchange floor to observe depth in the limit order book in real time, affects the trading strategies of investors and specialists, informational efficiency, liquidity, and returns. We find that traders attempt to manage the exposure of their limit orders: the cancellation rate increases, time-to-cancellation shortens, and smaller orders are submitted. The new information OpenBook provides seems to cause traders to prefer managing the trading process themselves, rather than delegating this task to <b>floor</b> <b>brokers.</b> We also show that specialists’ participation rate in trading decreases and the depth they add to the quote goes down, consistent with a loss of their informational advantage or with being "crowded out" by active limit order strategies. We detect an improvement in the informational efficiency of prices after the introduction of OpenBook. Greater pre-trade transparency leads to some improvement in displayed liquidity in the book and a reduction in the execution costs of trades. We find that cumulative abnormal returns are positive following the introduction of OpenBook, consistent with the view that improvement in liquidity affects stock returns. ...|$|R

50|$|Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) (Budapesti Értéktőzsde (BÉT)) is the 2nd largest stock {{exchange}} in Central and Eastern Europe by market capitalization and liquidity. It {{is located at}} 7 Liberty Square, Budapest, Hungary, in the central business district of the city, known as District V. Previously, from 1864, during the Austro-Hungarian Empire it was located in the Budapest Stock Exchange Palace building, until a large trading floor was necessary. The exchange is controlled by listed issuers, by Hungarian private investors and by the central bank. The BSE is member of the World Federation of Exchanges and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges. The Budapest Stock Exchange accounts for all the turnover in the Hungarian market and {{a large share of}} the Central and Eastern European market. In 2007, BSE agreed to move to abolish floor trading, the trading today takes place via the Xetra system, with redundant <b>floor</b> <b>brokers</b> taking on the role of market-makers. Xetra is the reference market for all exchange trading in Hungarian equities and exchange traded funds.

40|$|This paper mainly {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of a very complex process of brokerage in commodity futures markets. Unlike a classical commodity market in which brokers are not a necessity, sales and purchases in commodity futures markets cannot be carried out without brokers. Brokers who act as agents of buyers and sellers of futures are {{a necessary condition for}} trading in organized markets, such as commodity futures markets. The structure of brokers in futures trading is multilayer and involves participants in futures trading from <b>floor</b> <b>brokers,</b> immediate futures traders and the members of clearing and the clearing house itself, on the one hand, to numerous other necessary actors whose activities out of the stock exchange and the clearing house contribute to the efficient functioning of futures market. The fact that transactions between buyers and sellers in futures markets are not carried out directly but through brokers means that the obligations of buyers and sellers are formally conveyed to brokers, providing {{at the same time the}} guarantee by the broker that the actual buyer and the actual seller will fulfill their contractual obligations. At the very beginning of futures trading, the relationship between the seller and the buyer is transformed into a relationship between two brokers. Since that moment on, the original relationship is conveyed to higher levels of brokerage reaching the level of the clearing house. In the process of transformation of the buyer-seller relationship and transmitting obligations and guaranteeing their fulfillment, the clearing house itself becomes the buyer relative to all sellers and the seller relative to all buyers. In this way, it guarantees that obligations regarding all transactions in futures market will be fulfilled. The whole process is carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures conducted on the floor of commodity exchange, in its administrative departments and in the clearing house itself...|$|R
50|$|The book {{takes a look}} at how {{electronic}} trading replaced the trading <b>floor</b> of screaming <b>brokers,</b> slamming telephones and hysteria-inducing ticker tape, and how that change impacted the market. The speed of data is a major theme in the book; the faster the data travels, the better the price of the trade. Lewis claims access to this fiber optic cable, as well as other technologies, presents an opportunity for the market to be controlled even more by the big Wall Street institutions. To counter this disadvantage to investors, Katsuyama bands together a team that sets out to develop a new exchange, called IEX, to make the playing field for trading fairer.|$|R
