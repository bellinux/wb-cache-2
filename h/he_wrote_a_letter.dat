5|$|Hitler named Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as his successor. Himmler met Dönitz in Flensburg {{and offered}} himself as second-in-command. He {{maintained}} {{that he was}} entitled to a position in Dönitz's interim government as Reichsführer-SS, believing the SS {{would be in a}} good position to restore and maintain order after the war. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> on 6 May—two days before the German Instrument of Surrender—formally dismissing Himmler from all his posts.|$|E
5|$|Ryba {{announced}} on 1 December 1980 {{that he intended}} to bar the dissenting players from the Poland squad. When {{the rest of the team}} returned to Poland, Terlecki once again attempted to form a footballers' union. Securing the support of 16 other Poland international players, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to the PZPN declaring their intention to do so, leading the authorities to order them to face a tribunal. Only Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk continued to endorse the letter when challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) {{in the hope that}} the government would fall before he was forced to retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> of resignation effective the next day.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{defeat in}} World War I, Hipper retired on 13 December 1918 from {{the navy and}} lived a quiet life; he {{received}} a full war pension. During {{the chaos of the}} German Revolution of 1918–1919, Hipper hid from radical revolutionaries by assuming a false name and moving frequently. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to Adolf von Trotha, the new fleet commander, expressing his approval of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919. After the revolution was over, Hipper moved to a house in Altona near Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|While Middleton {{was helping}} LSU recover from this {{traumatic}} ordeal, {{he was also}} {{keeping an eye on}} events in Europe. In July 1940 <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to General George Marshall asking if his services were needed by the Army as the United States was making preparations for war. Marshall replied that as much as the Army would like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do would be to place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his battle experience.|$|E
5|$|But {{apart from}} the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor and no longer a boy. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to argue for the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although he was writing Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles of this time {{addressed the issue of}} deforestation, and <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> {{to the president of the}} American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.|$|E
5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them. Stratford residents, {{as well as his}} senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> in August to Dandurand, explaining that he could not leave Stratford, and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{developing}} stalemate saw {{activity on}} both sides of the bay. Among the French fleet there was dissatisfaction that Willaumez had not attacked Stopford when he enjoyed numerical superiority, taking the opportunity to break out of the anchorage and pursue his objectives in the Caribbean. Captain Jacques Bergeret was so incensed that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> criticising Willaumez to the Minister of Marine Denis Decrès, and warning that the Aix Roads were highly vulnerable to British attack. Although Emperor Napoleon apparently shared Willaumez's opinion, Decrès removed and censured both Willaumez and Bergeret, replacing the admiral with Zacharie Allemand on 16 March. Word had arrived that a British expeditionary force had captured Martinique in late February, and so Allemand, lacking further instructions, prepared his defences.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish and Dutch armies spent 16 {{more days}} observing {{each other from}} their encampments, but no action of {{importance}} ensued. Maurice of Nassau laid a bridge over the Rhine and tried to take Meurs by surprise, but the enterprise was discovered. He also committed Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg to intercept five Spanish companies sent by Mondragón to lodge in Twente, but the Spaniards managed to reach Enschede, leaving only a few chariots with supplies in Dutch hands. On 11 October, lacking of forage, Mondragón retired back to Brabant. Maurice aimed to cut off his retreat, but the Spaniard succeeded in bringing his troops to a secure position. Mondragón re-crossed the Meuse in November and distributed his troops in different towns. Before crossing the river the Swiss mercenaries were paid and liscended. On 4 January 1596, the elderly general died in the citadel of Antwerp. On his deathbed <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to Philip II asking for the castellany of Antwerp for his son Alonso and a company of lances for his grandson Cristóbal, but both requests were denied.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a computer programmer from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Castelli also {{abolished}} the mita in Upper Peru, a mandatory form {{of public service}} that bordered on slavery. Mariano Moreno has also wished to end the mita, but Moreno had resigned from the Junta by this point. Without Castelli being in Buenos Aires to mediate between them, the disputes between Moreno and Saavedra had worsened. The Junta requested that Castelli should moderate his actions, but he went ahead with the positions he shared with Moreno. Several Saavedrist officers, such as José María Echaurri, José León Domínguez, Matías Balbastro, chaplain Manuel Antonio Azcurra, and sergeant major Toribio de Luzuriaga, planned to kidnap Castelli, deliver him to Buenos Aires for trial, and give command of the Army of the North to Juan Jose Viamonte. However, Viamonte did not accept the plan when he was informed by the conspirators, and {{did not attempt to}} carry it out. When Castelli knew about Moreno's resignation, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to Vieytes, Rodriguez Peña, Larrea, and Azcuénaga, asking them to move to Upper Peru. If they defeated Goyeneche, they planned to march back to Buenos Aires. However, the letter was sent via the common postal service, and the postmaster of Córdoba, Jose de Paz, decided to send it instead to Cornelio Saavedra. The Morenist members of the Junta had already been ousted and exiled by that point.|$|E

5|$|Back in Mopán, Amésqueta had {{received}} additional supplies {{and decided to}} catch up with his advance party. He left Mopán on 10 March 1696 with friar Agustín Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from Díaz or AjK'ixaw. On 20 March Amésqueta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find Díaz's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that Díaz had left behind. They followed Díaz's trail to the shore of Lake Petén Itzá near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes, and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that Díaz's party had passed that way, and Amésqueta assumed that they had crossed to Nojpetén. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to Díaz, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with Amésqueta. During various attempts at communication to verify Díaz's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of Amésqueta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in Díaz's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.|$|E
5|$|The {{setback for}} the reformers was short-lived. By September, Henry was displeased {{with the results}} of the Act and its promulgators; the ever-loyal Cranmer and Cromwell were back in favour. The king asked his {{archbishop}} to write a new preface for the Great Bible, an English translation of the Bible that was first published in April 1539 under the direction of Cromwell. The preface was {{in the form of a}} sermon addressed to readers. As for Cromwell, he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves, the sister of a German prince was accepted by the king. In Cromwell's view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the Schmalkaldic League. Henry was dismayed with Anne when they first met on 1 January 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 January in a ceremony officiated by Cranmer. However, the marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce. This resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences. His old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June. He immediately lost the support of all his friends, including Cranmer. However, as Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to the king defending the past work of Cromwell. Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves was quickly annulled on 9 July by the vice-gerential synod, now led by Cranmer and Gardiner.|$|E
25|$|Dwyer {{continued}} to profess his innocence after being convicted, as did others close to him. On December 23, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> to President Ronald Reagan seeking a presidential pardon, and to Senator Arlen Specter seeking support in this effort.|$|E
