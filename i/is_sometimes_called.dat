5|$|Nuclear weapon designs could {{intentionally}} incorporate 59Co, some {{of which}} would be activated in a nuclear explosion to produce 60Co. The 60Co, dispersed as nuclear fallout, creates what <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> a cobalt bomb.|$|E

5|$|The theorem {{is named}} after one of its discoverers, Toshikazu Kawasaki. However, several others also contributed to its discovery, and it <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> the Kawasaki–Justin theorem or Husimi's theorem after other contributors, Jacques Justin and Kôdi Husimi.|$|E
5|$|Foal: A {{horse of}} either sex {{less than one}} year old. A nursing foal <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> a {{suckling}} and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling. Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.|$|E
5|$|For {{merchant}} {{solar power}} stations, where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network, the levelised cost of solar energy {{will need to}} match the wholesale electricity price.

5|$|Hot chocolate, {{also known}} as hot cocoa, {{drinking}} chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E

5|$|Kotok was a {{precocious}} {{child who}} skipped two grades before college. At MIT {{he became a}} member of the Tech Model Railroad Club, and after enrolling in MIT's first freshman programming class, he helped develop some of the earliest computer software including a digital audio program and what <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> the first video game (Spacewar!). Together with his teacher John McCarthy and other classmates, he was part of the team that wrote the Kotok-McCarthy program which took part in the first chess match between computers.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{dysfunction}} as {{a result}} of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> malarial hepatitis. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.|$|E
5|$|Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell and Wayne Wiitanen {{conceived}} the computer game Spacewar! {{while working at}} Harvard University in 1961. Inspired by Marvin Minsky's Three Position Display (which they dubbed the Minskytron), they had the first version running, with help from their MIT classmates Dan Edwards, Kotok, Stephen D. Piner, Samson and Saunders, by early 1962. Coded by Russell, Spacewar! {{was one of the}} earliest interactive computer games and <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> the first video game.|$|E

5|$|Minneapolis is the third-most literate {{city in the}} U.S. A {{center for}} {{printing}} and publishing, Minneapolis was the city in which Open Book, the largest literary and book arts center in the U.S., was founded. The Center consists of the Loft Literary Center, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts and Milkweed Editions (the latter <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> the country's largest independent nonprofit literary publisher). The Center exhibits and teaches both contemporary art and traditional crafts of writing, papermaking, letterpress printing and bookbinding.|$|E
5|$|Nahuatl {{does not}} have {{grammatical}} case but uses what <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> a relational noun to describe spatial (and other) relations. These morphemes cannot appear alone but must occur after a noun or a possessive prefix. They are also often called postpositions or locative suffixes. In some ways these locative constructions resemble and {{can be thought of}} as locative case constructions. Most modern dialects have incorporated prepositions from Spanish that are competing with or that have completely replaced relational nouns.|$|E
5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, {{can supply}} power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>called</b> 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E
