5|$|The {{asymmetric}} gaseous envelope, another cooler region, extends {{for several}} radii (~10–40AU) from the photosphere. It is enriched in oxygen {{and especially in}} nitrogen relative to carbon. These composition anomalies are likely caused by contamination by CNO-processed material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of Betelgeuse.|$|E
5|$|At the Asekoff residence, Bo becomes {{upset and}} begins barking. Mrs. Asekoff lets him outside {{but when she}} {{attempts}} to retrieve him, the dog refuses to budge. She turns to go back inside but discovers {{that it has been}} bolted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside.</b> Louis hears his mother's screams and climbs out of bed, but a dark, shadowy figure with red eyes corners him. Louis barely escapes through the dog door where he runs into Mulder, informing him of the creature's whereabouts in the house.|$|E
5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside.</b> A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E

5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E
5|$|The M9 {{used the}} same chassis and {{mechanical}} components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> rear doors, and a pedestal machine gun mount as with the M2. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount machine gun mount and three pintle machine gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|The first castle on the Thetford {{site was}} Red Castle and was {{probably}} built {{shortly after the}} Norman conquest of England by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey.

5|$|The rebels {{began to}} cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the {{afternoon}} of 13 June. The defences on London Bridge were opened <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> either in sympathy for the rebel cause or out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city. At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate {{on the north side of}} the city. The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{dislodge}} Wheldon or Billy Walton <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> forward position, Harry Edwards chose {{to leave at}} the end of the season. Tom Bayley was released, and Fred Jones left for Lincoln City after losing his place at left back to Bernard Pumfrey. Harry Morris retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team in September 1893, but the injury received against Darwen effectively proved the end of his football career.|$|E
5|$|When {{construction}} of the shell began in June 2004, a large tent was erected around the piece to shield it from public view.

This sequence caused the structure to resemble a large sombrero when the bottom was complete.|$|E

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, the {{organizing}} committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked—an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside.</b> Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs {{deeper into the}} ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside,</b> pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start {{to grow in the}} following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} small and rectangular, has no {{internal}} division between the nave and the chancel. It measures 47feet 6inches by 14feet 9inches (14.5 by 4.5m). It is built of rubble masonry, and the roof is made of slate; there is a gabled bellcote at {{the west end of}} the roof. The roof timbers can be seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside.</b> Entrance to the church is through a porch with a rounded arch at the west end of the south wall, and there is a vestry, with one window, at the west end of the north wall.|$|E
5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E

5|$|When the {{protostar}} {{has grown}} {{such that it}} ignites to form a star, the surviving disk is removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> outward by photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects. Thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but over time many will collide, either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb. Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets {{through a process of}} gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had briefly {{joined the}} Cheerios {{when it looked}} like New Directions would be {{disbanding}} after their Sectionals loss, and cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) blackmails Blaine into rejoining; Blaine and Sam hatch up a plan to bring Sue down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside.</b> Blaine eventually confesses to Sam that he has feelings for him, to which Sam assures him that he is somewhat flattered by Blaine's honesty and attraction, and that it would not change the fact that Blaine is still Sam's best friend. Blaine still loves Kurt and asks Burt for his permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're too young to marry, and advises him to wait. Blaine remains determined, however, and while shopping for a ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for over thirty years. Jan offers to be a mentor to him, and Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of gay people. New Directions wins at Regionals, and Will and Emma get married immediately afterward, with the glee club, plus some graduates including Kurt, in attendance. Blaine is shown, after the ceremony is over, holding a jewelry box behind his back.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 12th century a new city wall began to be built around Worcester, with work {{probably}} continuing until early the next century. Enclosing about 85 acres (34.4 hectares), its design tracked the flow of natural streams to the north and east, and made use of the castle in the south as part of the defences. The walls were constructed of sandstone, and appear to have been surrounded by a flat bottomed, water-filled ditch, more than 30 feet (9 m) wide. The new walls cut across existing parts of the city and would have required the demolition of numerous existing buildings that lay in their way; the new defences also cut off the outlying districts of Sidbury, Lowesmoore, Foregate Street and The Tything <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of the walled city. Three main gates were built in the walls– North Gate, St Martin's Gate and Sidbury Gate– protected by gatehouses of paired circular towers and arrowslits for use by crossbowmen. Smaller gates were built between them, such as Friar's Gate.|$|E
