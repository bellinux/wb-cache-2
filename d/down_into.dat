5|$|Abciximab is a {{commonly}} used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together. Broken <b>down</b> <b>into</b> ab-ci-xi-mab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a chimeric monoclonal antibody used on the cardiovascular system. This {{and the following two}} names would look the same if the new convention were applied.|$|E

50|$|Calvello also flew some {{interesting}} missions besides combat sorties. On several occasions, he made espionage flights behind enemy lines, to resupply spies with carrier pigeons. On 31 October 1918, he was <b>downed</b> <b>into</b> a swamp, but rescued by a squadronmate.|$|R
5|$|Adalimumab {{is a drug}} {{targeting}} TNF alpha. Its name can be broken <b>down</b> <b>into</b> ada-lim-u-mab. Therefore, the drug is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune system. If adalimumab had been named after 2009, {{it would have been}} adalumab.|$|E
5|$|Rozrolimupab is a {{polyclonal}} antibody. Broken <b>down</b> <b>into</b> rozro-lim-u-pab, {{its name}} shows {{the drug to}} be a human polyclonal antibody acting on the immune system. The suffix -pab shows it is a polyclonal antibody.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|E

5|$|A 20-foot (6 m) wide ditch was dug at {{the north}} end of the moat to prevent tanks from {{breaking}} through and following the track south past the castle, and a 545-foot by 151-foot (166 m by 46 m) wide anti-personnel minefield was laid to the south-west to prevent infantry soldiers from circumventing the castle's defences and advancing <b>down</b> <b>into</b> Craster. After the end of the war, the barbed wire was cleared away from the beaches by local Italian prisoners of war, although the two pillboxes, the remnants of the anti-tank ditch and some of the trenches and weapons pits still remain.|$|E
5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving drystone walls rise to about threemetres (10ft) and are more than fourmetres (13ft) thick in some places.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was to serve as a buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence <b>down</b> <b>into</b> British India.|$|E
5|$|After {{staying for}} a period in Robert's stronghold of Bristol, Matilda {{established}} her court in nearby Gloucester, still safely in the south-west but far enough away for her to remain independent of her half-brother. Although there had been only a few new defections to her cause, Matilda still controlled a compact block of territory stretching out from Gloucester and Bristol south into Wiltshire, west into the Welsh Marches and east through the Thames Valley as far as Oxford and Wallingford, threatening London. Her influence extended <b>down</b> <b>into</b> Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E
5|$|After the Gold Rush had concluded, gold {{recovery}} operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, {{and it is}} estimated that more than 20million ounces (620t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E

5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine <b>down</b> <b>into</b> what {{was essentially a}} knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Bruce Wayne falls <b>down</b> <b>into</b> a {{dry well}} and is {{attacked}} by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a phobia of the creatures. While watching an opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.|$|E
5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} be broken <b>down</b> <b>into</b> smaller packages and carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available along the route but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one {{claimed the lives of}} more than 60 people travelling over Chilkoot Pass.|$|E
