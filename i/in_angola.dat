5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Fidel Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing to fight for South Africa had placed Cuba in its most aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was preparing to leave Angola with his opponents on the defensive. According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence <b>in</b> <b>Angola</b> proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 and 1976 most foreign forces, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Cuba, withdrew.

Sweden provided humanitarian assistance to both the SWAPO and the MPLA in the mid-1970s, and regularly raised the issue of UNITA in political discussions between the two movements.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1975, the South African {{government}} warned Savimbi and Roberto {{that the}} South African Defence Force (SADF) would soon end operations <b>in</b> <b>Angola</b> despite {{the failure of}} the coalition to capture Luanda and therefore secure international recognition for their government. Savimbi, desperate to avoid the withdrawal of South Africa, asked General Constand Viljoen to arrange a meeting for him with Prime Minister of South Africa John Vorster, who had been Savimbi's ally since October 1974. On the night of 10 November, the day before the formal declaration of independence, Savimbi secretly flew to Pretoria to meet Vorster. In a reversal of policy, Vorster not only agreed to keep his troops <b>in</b> <b>Angola</b> through November, but also promised to withdraw the SADF only after the OAU meeting on 9 December. The Soviets, well aware of South African activity in southern Angola, flew Cuban soldiers into Luanda the week before independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force, 60 Soviet officers in the Congo joined the Cubans on 12 November. The Soviet leadership expressly forbade the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> January 2011, <b>Angola</b> {{announced}} that it awarded 11 presalt offshore blocks in the Kwanza basin, following a closed licensing round in which a few selected IOCs were invited. IOCs that were awarded blocks include Petrobras, Maersk Oil, Cobalt, BP, Repsol, Total, Eni, ConocoPhillips, and Statoil. Some of those companies have slowed their investments <b>in</b> <b>Angola’s</b> presalt, and some wells have been closed and abandoned. The combination of disappointing results and geological complexity, compounded by the low-oil-price environment, has resulted in reduced investment <b>in</b> <b>Angola’s</b> presalt areas. Nonetheless, <b>Angola</b> is <b>in</b> {{the early stages of}} auctioning off 10 onshore blocks believed to hold presalt prospects in the Kwanza and Lower Congo basins.|$|R
