5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a <b>disincentive</b> to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ill-health (or {{possibly}} hypochondria) now {{began to}} restrict Meyerbeer's output and activities. The {{death of his}} beloved mother in 1854 was also a blow. However the success of L'étoile du nord in 1854 demonstrated that he could still pack the theatres. Following this he began on two new projects, an opera by Scribe based on the biblical story of Judith, and an opéra comique, Le pardon de Ploërmel, (also known as Dinorah, the title given to the Italian version performed at London) to a libretto by Jules Barbier. The latter premiered on 4 April 1859 at the Opéra Comique at Paris; the former, like many previous projects, remained only as sketches. The death of Scribe in 1861 was a further <b>disincentive</b> to Meyerbeer to proceed with his operatic work in progress. In 1862, in accordance with his original contract with Scribe, he paid Scribe's widow compensation for not completing Judith.|$|E
30|$|More important, the 2010 Affordable Care Act {{began in}} 2014 {{to pay its}} most {{significant}} health insurance subsidies. These subsidies are both income tested and employment tested, and for both reasons have sharply increased work <b>disincentives</b> relative to {{what they would have}} been without the law (Mulligan 2014). 36 Holding age constant, the ACA <b>disincentives</b> are greater for low-skill workers, even among married workers. Somewhat fewer married-worker <b>disincentives</b> are created by the ACA, but not to the degree as with the temporary programs featured in Fig.  5.

5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious <b>disincentive</b> to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E

40|$|Policies and {{programs}} to assist low income renters in Australia, {{as in many}} other countries, have developed in relative isolation from fundamental changes in labour markets and significant changes to income support programs. The federal government’s ‘welfare reform’ agenda recognises the potential importance of housing in the overall structure of welfare and tax reform but has not addressed this issue in any depth. This lack of focus on the role of housing, and housing assistance, in getting a job is also reflected in the research literature. While there is a growing literature in social policy and labour market studies generally on work <b>disincentives,</b> there has been limited empirical research into the role of rental housing assistance in contributing to incentives or <b>disincentives</b> for unemployed people to enter paid work. In particular, there has been little research on the behavioural aspects of work <b>disincentives.</b> The paper attempts to fill a part of this research gap. It reports on the findings of research into the financial and non-financial <b>disincentives</b> faced by renters who are unemployed and looking for paid work. This involved both theoretical modelling of <b>disincentives</b> and detailed interviews with 400 unemployed renters in Sydney and Melbourne. The findings identify how living in rental housing and being in receipt of different forms of rental housing assistance can contribute to incentives or <b>disincentives</b> to getting a job. This involves an examination of issues such as access to housing, rent setting, conditions of tenancy and location. There is a particular focus on how unemployed renters respond {{in the face of what}} appear to be quite considerable housing related <b>disincentives</b> to entering paid work...|$|R

Facilitation payments are an established part of 'getting things done', despite irregular payments and gifts being criminalised. Facilitation payments are regarded as bribery in many countries, which prevents many foreign entities from financial involvement with Egypt since they are a required part of doing business. Corruption makes the costs of both local goods as well as imports higher, decreasing the purchasing power of individuals which magnifies poverty.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 This study {{addresses}} the question: "What are the incentives and <b>disincentives</b> for conflict prevention and mitigation in the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), {{and how do}} they factor into Reclamation's management of water in the western United States?" Incentives and <b>disincentives</b> for conflict prevention (i. e., actions taken to avoid conflict) and mitigation (i. e., actions taken to resolve, manage, or temper a conflictive situation after conflict has occurred) are identified through a survey and focus groups of Reclamation employees. The two dominant <b>disincentives</b> identified are a lack of resources and Reclamation's organizational culture [...] specifically its reliance on crisis management, water delivery tunnel vision, and being slow to change. Other <b>disincentives</b> include a lack of forward planning, the existence of an acceptable bandwidth or level of conflict, a perception that conflict is unavoidable or entrenched, politics, and limits on acceptable actions associated with the legal authorization of Reclamation projects. Fewer incentives for conflict prevention and mitigation were identified, but include, pressure from higher management, the promotion of collaboration within the Bureau, and a desire to avoid litigation. The institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework offers some insight into how these incentives and <b>disincentives</b> factored into the implementation of the Water 2025 Initiative, and Reclamation’s experience with the Middle Rio Grande silvery minnow and the Endangered Species Act. As attributes of the community and rules-in-use, incentives and <b>disincentives</b> such as organizational culture, politics, funding availability, the desire to avoid litigation, the promotion of collaboration within the agency, and a lack of planning effort offer possible explanations of why Reclamation chose to act as it did...|$|R
25|$|Governmental {{intervention}} can aid {{in encouraging}} private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' Endangered Species Act requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, {{which is a}} <b>disincentive</b> for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place. To help mediate this problem, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date. This practice has already led {{to an increase in}} aplomado falcons (Falco femoralis) in Texas and red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) in the Southeastern US.|$|E
25|$|On November 25, 2008, a {{new federal}} rule was passed that allows states to charge {{premiums}} and higher co-payments to Medicaid participants. This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, limiting financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while {{the federal government will}} save nearly $1.4 billion. However, this means that the burden of financial responsibility will be placed on 13 million Medicaid recipients who will face a $1.3 billion increase in co-payments over 5 years. The major concern is that this rule will create a <b>disincentive</b> for low-income people to seek healthcare. It is possible that this will force only the sickest participants to pay the increased premiums and it is unclear what long-term effect this will have on the program.|$|E
25|$|The main {{provision}} of the Air Mail Act changed {{the manner in which}} payments were calculated. Air mail carriers would be paid for having sufficient cargo capacity on their planes, whether the planes carried mail or flew empty, a <b>disincentive</b> to carry mail since the carrier received a set fee for a plane of a certain size whether or not it carried mail. The purpose of the provision was to discourage the carrying of bulk junk mail to boost profits, particularly by the smaller and inefficient carriers, and to encourage the carrying of passengers. Airlines using larger planes designed to carry passengers would increase their revenues by carrying more passengers and less mail. Awards would be made to the “lowest responsible bidder” that had owned an airline operated on a daily schedule of at least 250 miles (402 kilometers) for at least six months.|$|E
