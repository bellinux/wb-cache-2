40|$|International audienceLinear {{free energy}} {{relationships}} (LFERs) were established which relate equilibrium vapor-liquid isotope effects to stable carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment factors for <b>equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> to geosorbents. The LFERs were established for normal, cyclic or branched alkanes, monoaromatic hydrocarbons, and chloroethenes. These LFERs predict that isotopic light compounds sorb {{more strongly than}} their heavy counterparts. Defining fractionation as in classical literature by ``heavy divided by light'', carbon enrichment factors for <b>equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> were derived which ranged from - 0. 13 +/- 0. 04 parts per thousand (benzene) to - 0. 52 +/- 0. 19 parts per thousand (trichloroethene at 5 - 15 degrees C). Hydrogen enrichment factors for sorption of 14 different compounds were between - 2. 4 and - 9. 2 parts per thousand. For perdeuterated hydrocarbons the predicted enrichment factors ranged from - 19 +/- 5. 4 parts per thousand. (benzene) to - 64 +/- 30 parts per thousand (cyclohexane). <b>Equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> experiments with a soil and activated carbon as sorbents were performed in the laboratory for perdeuterocyclohexane and perdeuterotoluene. The measured D/H enrichments agreed with the LFER prediction for both compounds and both sorbents within the uncertainty estimate of the prediction. The results of this work suggest that <b>equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> does create only very small isotope shifts for C- 13 in groundwater pollutants in aquifers.

The study on characterization of soils involved four types of soils from a single soil profile, a black cotton soil and a brick making soil collected from Mumbai and its surroundings. Completely mixed batch reactor systems were utilized to obtain isotherms for nickel and cadmium sorption on three geosorbents, i. e. top-most profile soil, bottom-most profile soil and black cotton soil.

Also, dielectric relaxation studies of the same hydrated Nafion(R) membranes have been carried out in the frequency range of 10 (- 2) - 5 x 10 (6) Hz and in the temperature range of 223 - 295 K. Two relaxation mechanisms were observed which both sift to higher frequencies by increasing the water content. The low frequency relaxation mechanism is due to interfacial polarization which takes place in the hydrated ionic regions. The high frequency relaxation mechanism, is a dipolar mechanism which may be attributed to the rotation of (-SO 3 -) group-water complexes at the end of the side chains.
