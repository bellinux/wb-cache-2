5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, <b>get</b> <b>no</b> more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could <b>get</b> <b>no</b> nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but <b>get</b> <b>no</b> business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, Smetana {{had written}} to a friend, the Czech poet Jan Neruda, {{revealing}} fears of the onset of madness. By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In 1883 he began writing a new symphonic suite, Prague Carnival, but could <b>get</b> <b>no</b> further than an Introduction and a Polonaise. He started a new opera, Viola, based on the character in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but wrote only fragments as his mental state gradually deteriorated. In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends; {{by the middle of}} February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent. On 23April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to the Kateřinky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12May 1884.|$|E
25|$|On 8 December it was {{announced}} that the Northern Rock shareholders were to <b>get</b> <b>no</b> compensation, based on the findings of the valuer Andrew Caldwell. This then went to a tribunal, 'Northern Rock v. Andrew Caldwell and HM Treasury, Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber), NR/001/2010, where the shareholders' appeal was rejected.|$|E

In the fourth quarter, Craig finished off an 80-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run, and scored on an NFL postseason record 80-yard touchdown run on the 49ers next drive.|$|E

Many crack addicts <b>get</b> <b>no</b> medical care at all and have extremely poor diets, and children who live around crack smoking are at risk of inhaling secondary smoke. Cocaine using mothers also have a higher rate of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Former {{shareholders}} and hedge funds also took legal action in January 2009 to get compensation for their shares; the shareholders lost the case. They also lost their appeals in the British courts, but hoped {{to take the}} case to the European courts. However, on 8 December 2009, it was announced that the valuer Andrew Caldwell had decided that the Northern Rock shareholders should <b>get</b> <b>no</b> compensation.|$|E
25|$|In Paris during 1933, Caresse had met Henry Miller. When he {{returned}} to the U.S. in 1940, he confessed to Caresse his lack of success in getting his work published. Miller's autobiographical book Tropic of Cancer was banned in the U.S. as pornographic, and he could <b>get</b> <b>no</b> other work published. She invited him to take a room in her spacious New York apartment on East 54th Street, where she infrequently lived, which he accepted, though she did not provide him with money.|$|E

25|$|Noda {{pulled in}} to retire, and Mansell {{eventually}} {{had to come}} in for a new nosecone, ruining his race and denting his reputation. Noda's luck would then <b>get</b> <b>no</b> better at his home race in Japan, where he qualified 23rd, once again only one spot off Comas, although this time he was only 0.013s behind the Frenchman. His experience at Suzuka was obviously paying rich dividends, but when torrential rain drenched the circuit on race day, it would suddenly be a whole new ball game.|$|E

25|$|I enquired {{throughout}} Italy at what place {{boys were}} chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could <b>get</b> <b>no</b> certain intelligence.

Then in {{what turned out to}} be the key play of the game, Raiders cornerback Sam Seale fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Bowman {{recovered}} in the end zone for a touchdown to give his team a 27–20 lead. There was still a full quarter left to play, but the Raiders would <b>get</b> <b>no</b> further in the game than the New England 41-yard line. Los Angeles' three fourth quarter drives would result in a punt, an interception by Fred Marion and a turnover on downs at their own 13.|$|E

25|$|Tragedy {{struck in}} Thackeray's {{personal}} life as his wife, Isabella, succumbed to depression {{after the birth}} of their third child, in 1840. Finding that he could <b>get</b> <b>no</b> work done at home, he spent more and more time away until September 1840, when he realised how grave his wife's condition was. Struck by guilt, he set out with his wife to Ireland. During the crossing she threw herself from a water-closet into the sea, but she was pulled from the waters. They fled back home after a four-week battle with her mother. From November 1840 to February 1842 Isabella {{was in and out of}} professional care, as her condition waxed and waned.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{has offered}} the {{potential}} to extend the game through downloadable content that, because of the procedural generation systems used, would likely be {{in the form of}} added features rather than new content. For example, with release of the day one patch, Hello Games has pointed to base building and the ability to purchase freighters as planned additions to the game. Murray anticipates all updates will be freely available, but did not rule out that some yet-planned features may require them to charge for the content. Former Sony executive Shahid Ahmad, who led Sony's efforts to <b>get</b> <b>No</b> Man's Sky, stated that Hello Games had a planned schedule of updates for the game as early as 2013.|$|E
25|$|A player's ranking {{points for}} an event {{must be at least}} 1.2. Players who would get less than this using the above formula <b>get</b> <b>no</b> ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th {{position}} gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.|$|E
