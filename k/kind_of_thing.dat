25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of it as a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> (because it isn't a particular thing at all).|$|E

25|$|The Biba label was relaunched {{again in}} May 2006 under {{designer}} Bella Freud. Again, Biba's founder, Barbara Hulanicki, was not contacted for the relaunch {{and said it}} was 'very, very painful', believing that the new Biba would 'betray its heritage.' Freud's first collection Spring/Summer 2007 was unveiled at London Fashion Week in September 2006, and was criticised for straying from the original concept of low-priced clothes for teenagers, needing 'more polish', as they 'had a Biba flavour but lacked the retro details that the original Biba designs had.' Freud's second attempt, Autumn/Winter 2007 was also panned as 'the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that's already over-available in fast-fashion chains.' Freud left the company after just 2 seasons in June 2007 to relaunch her own label. The Biba relaunch failed and the company went into administration for a second time in 2008.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} war Wilson had a poor {{relationship}} with Haig, although relations eased somewhat when Wilson became CIGS. Esher {{said that he was}} always loyal to the man he was serving, and Walter Reid believes Wilson did not actively plot against Haig. When French asked Wilson, late in 1915, if he had heard of Haig, Rawlinson and Gough intriguing against him, Wilson replied, perhaps somewhat naively, that “Haig was too good a fellow” for that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> Wilson wrote of Haig (21 December 1915, when appointing him to a corps command) “He was quite nice but he is always foreign to me”. After the disaster of 1 July 1916 Wilson wrote (5 July) that Haig was “a good stout hearted defensive soldier with no imagination & very little brains & very little sympathy”. That same day Foch, who had declined an invitation from Haig to lunch with Wilson, thought Haig “was stupid & lacked stomach for the fight” which Wilson thought “not quite fair”.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that this is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She {{wrote a letter to the}} author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

40|$|Whether or {{not there}} are {{non-existent}} objects {{seems to be one}} of the more mysterious and speculative issues in ontology. 1 To affirm that there are non-existent objects is to affirm that reality consists <b>of</b> two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> the existing and the non-existing. The existing contains all of what is in our space-time world, plus all abstract objects, if there are any. Most people, it seems fair to say, would think that this is all there is. For them the only real question in ontology can be what <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>things</b> there are. However, followers of Meinong maintain that this isn’t all there is. There is also another <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> those that do not exist. And to say this, the Meinongians continue, is to accept that reality is divided into two basic <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> the existing and the non-existing. Whether or not reality contains two basic categories <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> existing and non-existing, or only one, existing, is what the debate about non-existent objects is all about.
