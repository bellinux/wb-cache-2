That month, the monument to Calhoun in Charleston was found vandalized, with spray-painted denunciations of Calhoun as a racist and a defender of slavery.|$|E

5|$|After 25 {{years as}} a civilian, he rejoined the Army {{to fight in the}} American Civil War. Despite his age, he quickly rose up the ranks and was {{appointed}} a brigadier general in early 1862. During the war, he took part in the Northern Virginia Campaign, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Chancellorsville. His most notable contribution during the war was <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the Union right flank at Culp's Hill during the Battle of Gettysburg. He returned to engineering work after the war until his death in 1899.|$|E
5|$|Consequent to <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> an African American who {{was forced}} into a form of {{commercial}} slavery after incarceration, Black was befriended by A. O. Lane, a judge connected with the case. When Lane {{was elected to the}} Birmingham City Commission in 1911, he asked Black to serve as a police court judge, an experience that would be his only judicial experience prior to the Supreme Court. In 1912, Black resigned that seat in order to return to practicing law full-time. He was not done with public service; in 1914, he began a four-year term as the Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney.|$|E

5|$|That same year, in {{the general}} {{elections}} held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the officers {{as an indication of}} a possible conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Eugène's {{artillery}} {{continued to}} pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout {{set up a}} crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. Barclay countered by moving the Prussian General Eugen over {{to the right to}} support Miloradovich in <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the redoubt. The French responded to this move by sending forward General Sorbier, commander of the Imperial Guard artillery. Sorbier brought forth 36 artillery pieces from the Imperial Guard Artillery Park and also took command of 49 horse artillery pieces from Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps and La Tour Maubourg's IV Cavalry Corps, as well as of Viceroy Eugène's own artillery, opening up a massive artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{offices on}} the West Coast {{had been more}} {{directly}} involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi's lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney A.L. Wirin continued to represent Ernest Kinzo Wakayama but without addressing the case's constitutional questions. (Wirin would lose private clients because of <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.) However, the San Francisco branch, led by Ernest Besig, refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu, whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney Wayne Collins, with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.|$|E

5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E
5|$|John Harmen Marburger III (February 8, 1941 – July 28, 2011) was an American {{physicist}} {{who directed}} the Office of Science and Technology Policy {{in the administration of}} President George W.

His tenure was marked by controversy regarding <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the administration against allegations from over two dozen Nobel Laureates, amongst others, that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, including those relating to stem cell research and global warming. However, he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government. He also served as the President of Stony Brook University from 1980 until 1994, and director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1998 until 2001.|$|E
