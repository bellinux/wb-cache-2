500|$|Paul Arendt of the BBC {{compared}} it to The Matrix Reloaded, as a complex film that merely led onto the next film. Richard George felt a [...] "better construct of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End {{would have been to}} take 90 minutes of Chest, mix it with all of End and then cut that film in two." [...] Alex Billington felt the third film [...] "almost makes the second film in the series obsolete or dulls it down <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can accept it in our trilogy DVD collections without ever watching it." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{a parody of}} the Michael Jackson song [...] "Thriller", {{as well as the}} music video. When Chef becomes a zombie, he is dressed like Jackson from the [...] "Thriller" [...] video, and he and the other zombies dance in a similar way. Chef also shouts [...] "Oh" [...] the same way Jackson often did during music performances. The song Chef sings is also similar to the actual [...] "Thriller" [...] song, but Parker said they deliberately made it [...] "(just) different <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't get sued". Stan is ridiculed for his likeness to Raggedy Andy, based on the rag doll character by children's writer Johnny Gruelle; Stan's girlfriend Wendy was originally supposed to dress as Raggedy Ann with Stan, but she instead chose to dress as Chewbacca. When Cartman later dons a [...] "ghost" [...] costume, it resembles a costume from the Ku Klux Klan, the militant white supremacy organization. Parker and Stone said they feel Klan jokes are particularly funny because the concept of KKK is so stupid. Stone said, [...] "Dressing up like ghosts to scare black people is just stupid. Stupidly funny." [...] The zombie-version of Kenny is said to resemble Edward James Olmos, the American actor who played Lt. Martin Costillo in Miami Vice.|$|E
2500|$|Information on {{conditions}} in the stalags is contradictory depending on the source. Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance and did the best they could, while others accused their captors of brutalities and forced labour. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where food rations were meager and conditions squalid. One American admitted [...] "The only difference between the stalags and concentration camps was that we weren't gassed or shot in the former. I do not recall a single act of compassion or mercy {{on the part of}} the Germans." [...] Typical meals consisted of a bread slice and watery potato soup which, however, was still more substantial than what Soviet POWs or concentration camp inmates received. Another prisoner stated that [...] "The German plan was to keep us alive, yet weakened <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't attempt escape." ...|$|E

2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. IGNs Dan Iverson originally {{criticized the}} episode {{for the lack}} of storyline development, but later stated that [...] "the storylines were humorous <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were able to put aside that there was no real social commentary (like the last three episodes), but instead madcap comedy that was funny based on silly humor alone". Iverson also praised the episode for illustrating Satan as a spoiled child and for the Three Stooges scenes involving the killers, and concluded that [...] "although [...] isn't as good as a couple of South Parks other Halloween episodes, it is still a very funny episode". Adam Finley of TV Squad stated that although he thought [...] "Hell on Earth 2006" [...] was a [...] "great episode", it was [...] "most guaranteed to offend somebody". Judge Keefer of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "a really great installment with a wincing (yet guilty pleasure) joke", and graded the episode with an A. Chris Longo of Den of Geek listed [...] "Hell on Earth 2006" [...] as the series' best Halloween episode.|$|E
2500|$|A {{great deal}} of time was also spent working out the control scheme. The game {{originally}} had a target-lock system, based on the controls in Syphon Filter and Devil May Cry. However, the developers were unhappy with this system as they felt the gameplay was based more on [...] "PC-style shooters" [...] such as Half Life, which uses a mouse and keyboard control scheme to facilitate easier free aiming, rather than a target lock system. As such, [...] "with our controls for a console-style shooter but our gameplay from a PC-style shooter, about a year into development we realized we had a dangerous disconnect in our design that made our game tedious instead of fun." [...] However, with the release of successful console third-person shooters such as Max Payne, , , and , all of which [...] "eschewed target-lock in favor of double-stick control schemes that simulated the mouse/keyboard experience from the PC," [...] the team decided to scrap their target-lock system and go with a free aim system; [...] "looking at the sales for these titles, we concluded the installed base of players who were familiar with these controls was now large <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could take the risk of turning off a few newbies. The change was a huge success for the game: it fixed the disconnect in our gameplay and added depth that had been completely missing." ...|$|E
