50|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter the Eagles would finally get on the board with a 28-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Malcolm Bell to Adrian Wilkins. On the next series, 49ers' quarterback Lee McNeill would thrown an interception to the Eagle's Jeremy Thompson who would return it 26 yards for another Eagles' touchdown. Three plays into the Eagle's next series {{would result in a}} Malcolm Bell 15 yard touchdown pass to Jvon Simmons. On their next series, the 49ers would get into scoring range on a Matt Johnson 70 yard rush; but after the Niners were unable to convert another first down, Blake Brewer would miss a 24-yard field goal. On the next series the Eagles' Andre Clarke would score the Eagle's fourth touchdown of the quarter from 4 yards out. Charlotte would go 3-and-out on their next possession and return the ball to the Eagles; but on their next play Malcolm Bell's pass attempt would {{fall into the hands of}} the 49ers' defensive <b>end</b> <b>Tank</b> Norman. Despite the four touchdown fourth quarter effort from Central, the 49ers would hang onto the lead to complete the revenge game with the final score of 40 to 28.|$|E
40|$|Trapped {{air pockets}} may cause severe {{operational}} problems in hydropower and water supply systems. A locally isolated air pocket creates distinct amplitude, shape {{and timing of}} pressure pulses. This paper investigates dynamic behaviour of a single trapped air pocket. The air pocket is incorporated as a boundary condition into the discrete gas cavity model (DGCM). DGCM allows small gas cavities to form at computational sections in the method of characteristics (MOC). The growth of the pocket and gas cavities is described by the water hammer compatibility equation(s), the continuity equation for the cavity volume, and the equation of state of an ideal gas. Isentropic behaviour is assumed for the trapped gas pocket and an isothermal bath for small gas cavities. Experimental investigations have been performed in a laboratory pipeline apparatus. The apparatus consists of an upstream end high-pressure tank, a horizontal steel pipeline (total length 55. 37 m, inner diameter 18 mm), four valve units positioned along the pipeline including the end points, and a downstream <b>end</b> <b>tank.</b> A trapped air pocket is captured between two ball valves at the downstream end of the pipeline. The transient event is initiated by rapid opening of the upstream end valve; the downstream end valve stays closed during the event. Predicted and measured results for a few typical cases are compared and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiments}} on a plasma equilibrium response to externally applied disturbance {{of the magnetic}} field of a dipole type have been done on the GDT facility. The disturbance was produced {{by a pair of}} the coils installed at the <b>end</b> <b>tank</b> so as it was localized in the expander region. The results were compared with the theoretical predictions based on a hydromagnetic model of plasma equilibrium in the magnetic field treated in a long thin approximation. It was found that the measured displacements of the plasma column from a geometrical axis of the device varies linearly with the current in the disturbing coils at least up to 5 cm at the midplane. The data was processed to subtract the displacement measured for zero current that apparently caused by a small disturbance of the magnetic field by soft-iron-made parts of the equipment placed near the device inside the experimental hall and, in part, also by misalignments of the main coils. Theoretically predicted slope of the displacement-field amplitude dependence is to be inversely proportional to a pressure-weighted curvature averaged along the device. The authors believe this allows the use of the data for the measurements of this value. The slopes have been calculated for the GDT parameters under different assumptions on Kp parameter that define an upper limit of integration of the pressure-weighted curvature in the near-end wall region in the expanders...|$|E
40|$|A key {{component}} for the accelerated implementation {{and operation of}} the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) is the recovery of Tank 48 H. Tank 48 H is a type IIIA tank with a maximum capacity of 1. 3 million gallons. The material on the Tank 48 H internal tank surfaces is estimated to have a total volume of approximately 115 gallons consisting of mostly water soluble solids with approximately 20 wt% insoluble solids (33 Kg TPB). This film {{is assumed to be}} readily removable. The material on the internal equipment/surfaces of Tank 48 H is presumed to be easily removed by slurry pump operation. For Tank 49 H, the slurry pumps were operated almost continuously for approximately 6 months after which time the tank was inspected and the film was found to be removed. The major components of the Tank 49 H film were soluble solids [...] Na{sub 3 }H(CO) {sub 2 }, Al(OH) {sub 3 }, NaTPB, NaNO{sub 3 } and NaNO{sub 2 }. Although the Tank 48 H film is expected to be primarily soluble solids, it may not behave the same as the Tank 49 H film. Depending on when the Recycle material or inhibited water can be added to Tank 48 H, the tank may not be allowed to agitate for this same amount of time. The tank will be filled above 150 inches and agitated at least once during the Aggregation process. If the material cannot be removed after completion of these batches, the material may be removed with additional fill and agitation operations. There is a risk that this will not remove the material from the internal surfaces. As a risk mitigation activity, properties of the film and the ease of removing the film from the tank will be evaluated prior to initiating Aggregation. This task will investigate the dissolution of Tank 48 H solid deposits in inhibited water and DWPF recycle. To this <b>end,</b> <b>tank</b> personnel plan to cut and remove a thermowell pipe from Tank 48 H and submit the cut pieces to SRNL for both characterization and leaching behavior. A plan for the removal, packaging and transport of the thermowell pipe has been issued.

40|$|A module of a Side Coupled Linac (SCL) {{is formed}} by {{a cascade of}} two or more tanks, {{connected}} by a Bridge Cou-pler (BC) with an RF feeder, which realizes a well defined field configuration in all the coupled cavities. Usually the first step of the design consists in the use of 2 D and 3 D e-m CAD’s able to characterize the single cell parameters in terms of its geometrical quantities and to study the be-haviour of many coupled cells, respectively. The usual pro-cedure foresees a full characterization only of a <b>tank</b> <b>ended</b> by half cells shorted by p. e. c. flat plates, by using the 3 D CAD output (mode frequencies) as an input for specific codes as Disper able to find out the lumped circuit param-eters of such a structure.

This gives the possibility of having a full characterization either of a half-cell or a full-cell ended structures. Fur-thermore this procedure foresees an absolutely innovative and more rational design of the BC using its lumped cir-cuit modeling. Finally this rationale to design a module of an SCL allows to study ex ante the full coupled system in order to focus the crucial parameters for its optimum func-tioning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. HANBIT is a {{magnetic}} mirror confinement device, {{which consists of}} a simple mirror-type central cell, an anchor, a plug, and two <b>end</b> <b>tanks.</b> HANBIT started its physics experimental campaign in 2001, following the development phase of basic heating and diagnostic systems over 1996 to 2000. Initial physics experiments were concentrated on the basic physics studies of RF-heating, stability, and confinement in a simple mirror configuration of the central-cell, trying to identify the discharge characteristics and stable plasma operation modes. A main result from this initial study was that a stable, high-density plasma mode exists in the slow wave regime of ω ≤ Ωci in HANBIT, unlike the results from other mirror devices where the stable modes were mostly observed in the fast wave regime of ω> Ωci, where ω is the RF frequency and Ωci is the ion cyclotron frequency at the mid-plane of central cell. Since the last IAEA conference, a significant effort {{has been made to}} clarify the physics origin of this new stable mode. Also, an attempt has been made to produce the high-density mode in the fast wave regime of ω> Ωci, as observed in the other mirror devices. In addition, an intensive study is on the way to increase the plasma beta and ion temperature, mainly through the beach wave heating by the DHT antenna system...|$|R
