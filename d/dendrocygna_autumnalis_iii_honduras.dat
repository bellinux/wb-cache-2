40|$|The fowlpox, {{also known}} as contagiosum epithelioma, {{is caused by a}} {{poxvirus}} of the genus Avipoxvirus and affects both domestic and wild birds. The disease has two forms cutaneous and diphtheria. In March 2008 the sector of rehabilitation of wild birds from Mangual das Garças Park, located in Belém, Pará attended a duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>autumnalis)</b> that had nodular lesions in regions of the wing devoid of feathers. The lesions consisted of two large cutaneous tumor-like nodules that measured 4, 2 x 3, 8 cm and 2, 8 x 2, 2 cm in length and width, respectively. The nodules were surgically removed, fixed in 10 % formalin, processed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin.

40|$|Rice is {{the main}} crop in the subbasin of the fluvial lagoon system of Palizada River (FLSPR) {{in the state of}} Campeche, Mexico. The {{pesticides}} used to control pests of this crop mainly are carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, and glyphosate. Black -bellied whistling duck (Dendrocgna autumnalis) is an ecologically and economically important species in the area. This duck is consumed by local inhabitants throughout the year, despite its potential exposure to pesticides. Due to its feeding habits, abundance,and nutritional value, D. autumnalis is a good indicator of environmental contamination and a potential route of human exposure to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. In this study, the brain cholinesterase (ChE) in the frontal cerebral cortex of autochthonous ducks was characterized. In addition, the potential of the three locally used pesticides and mixtures to inhibit ChE activity was investigated and the exposure of the wild duck population during intensive pesticide applications in rice fields was evaluated. We found that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) seems to be the predominant ChE form in the biological fraction analyzed. Carbofuran was the most potent ChE inhibitor of D. autumnalis brain ChE activity from the three pesticides analyzed. Cholinesterase inhibition after exposure to pesticide mixtures predominantly was due to carbofuram. A decrease (p 30 %) was apparent in wild ducks compared to reference ducks, with recovery of ChE inhibition in wild ducks occurring months later when no pesticides were applied in the field. <b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>autumnalis</b> brain ChE is a suitable parameter for inclusion in biomonitoring programs for both environmental protection and human safety.

40|$|The present {{research}} concerns {{the environmental impact}} of pesticides used in the Fluvio Lagoon Palizada River Subasin (FLPRS) in Campeche, Mexico on environmental health using biomarkers in wild mosquitofishes (Gambusia yucatana) and whistling ducks (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>autumnalis),</b> likewise in campesinos (peasants). Mosquitofishes (G. yucatana) and black-bellied whistling duck (D. autumnalis) were chosen as bioindicators as they are abundant species, the fishes in small streams of the region; and the whistling ducks (D. autumnalis) in wetlands, being most abundant in flooded savannahs and irrigated rice fields. In this work were included human been because they applied the pesticide and are exposed at the first time. The biomarkers used to asses the environmental exposures to pesticides were acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3. 1. 1. 7), glutathione-S-transferases (GST, EC 2. 5. 1. 18) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1. 1. 1. 28). In this research was evaluated {{the environmental impact of}} pesticide use in the FLPRS in order to 1) know the environmental conditions of PRS in relation to water quality and land use, 2) evaluate in laboratory the use of biomarkers such as AChE, GST and LDH in wildlife exposed to pesticides, 3) estimate with biomarkers the environmental pesticide effects on organisms from aquatic (mosquitofish, G. yucatana) and terrestrial (whistling ducks, D. autumnalis) compartments, and 4) evaluate the adverse effects of pesticides used by fieldworkers from El Juncal, Palizada using symptoms related to pesticide exposure and a biomarker. The assessing of environmental impact of pesticide was carry out with the biomarkers mentioned with a test battery in situ through a biomonitoring study and toxicity test chambers in aquatic organisms, and with a survey on brain cholinesterase biomarker in terrestrial organisms. The results of this study indicated that during the last 20 years, in the Palizada River Subasin (PRS) the land use change has been drastic mainly in agriculture cover because this increase in more than 1, 000 %, and the total amount of pesticide used is parallel to this increase in agricultural hectares. The use of an index of water quality (WQI) identified that from the nine sampling sites studied in the PSR, sites with cattle ranching (WQI= 0. 58) and agricultural (WQI= 0. 65) activity were the sites with a significant average of WQI worse than the others sites (WQI = 0. 68 – 0. 73). In mosquitofish (G. yucatana), the characterization of cholinesterases seems that the main form present in both muscle and head is AChE. The ranking of in vivo toxicity (LC 50) of the tested pesticides to G. yucatana was chlorpyrifos > carbofuran > glyphoste. ChE activities of muscle and head of mosquitofish were significantly inhibited by furadan after 24 hrs of exposure with an inhibition of 60 % at 0. 06 mg/L. The mixture chlorpyrifos/glyphosate is 34 % more toxic than the chlorpyrifos tested alone. In the test with 6 chlorpyrifos, fish that survived after an exposure of 96 h to concentrations between 0. 006 and 0. 012 mg/L showed a ChE inhibition near to 80 %. Muscle and head AChE activity was inhibited by chlorpyrifos and carbofuran; gill GST was inhibited by carbofuran; and muscle LDH activity was not altered by any of pesticides tested. In the case of whistling duck (D. autumnalis), the forebrain ChE seems to be AChE. The carbofuran-chlorpyrifos mixture was the most potent in vitro inhibitor of D. autumnalis brain ChE tested. This is important because in real conditions the exposure is with a mixture of pollutants which can cause possible synergistic effects. The field study in the PRS was focused to three different sampling sites, one with cattle ranching activity, other with agricultural activity, and the last one was the Palizada River. The first phase of the in situ study demonstrated the possibility of a link between the water quality index (WQI) and the variation of abiotic conditions that may cause effects on survival, growth, and biomarkers on fishes exposed not related with direct effects of pollutants. In the biomonitoring studies using enzymatic biomarkers in wild fish present the advantage of diagnosing the real exposure and/or effects of environmental contaminants but they may underestimate the actual contamination of the water, since organisms with a reasonable degree of mobility may avoid the exposure. The results obtained in this study indicate that some water variables can influence directly or indirectly on enzymatic activity, and consider it as a natural variability of activity. The integration of information generated in situ toxicity test and wild fishes reflected a concordance between percentages of AChE activity in wild fishes and exposed in situ in the Palizada River during February, July and November. The results of the study with whistling duck (D. autumnalis) suggest that ducks are exposed to pesticides (inhibition above 30 % of ChE activity), at least during the season of intensive application. The evaluation of the adverse effects of pesticides in fieldworkers from El Juncal, Palizada using AChE as a biomarker showed no conclusive results from the regression analysis of symptoms and AChE inhibition activity. Some symptoms are probably compatible with acute organophosphate and carbamate poisoning such as headache, weakness, nausea, sweating and tiredness. No differences were observed with respect to use of protective clothing. It is recommended the use of pesticide less aggressive to environment and human health, also further field studies incorporating a systematic monitoring of wild populations and investigating also population parameters are particularly important for local pesticide management.

A prior version appeared as a working paper in the Osgoode CLPE Research Paper Series. The present Ethics in Action published version contains both a number of important edits and several substantive additions (notably to section <b>III</b> on <b>Honduras)</b> subsequent to the Osgoode CLPE Research Paper. The paper begins, in Section II, with general comments on a notion of “interactive diversity of knowledge” and how that connects up to a view about the nature of truth. Sections III and IV then present salient aspects of events in both Honduras and Sri Lanka over the last two years, with the coup d’ état of 28 June 2009, in Honduras and the bloody end to the civil war in Sri Lanka in spring 2009 as fulcrums of the narrative. In each case, emphasis is also placed on the establishment of truth-related commissions or panels in relation to each country. The paper ends with a discussion of three interconnected quandaries - the inside/outside quandary, the consistency and fairness quandary, and the timing quandary. The discussion of the timing (or staging) quandary offers some provisional thinking on the sequencing of processes related to truth, justice and reconciliation, offering some reasons not to fuse truth-seeking processes with either criminal justice or reconciliation processes - with special reference to the Sri Lanka context...|$|R
