5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on <b>election</b> <b>night,</b> the race was still too close to call. When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.|$|E
5|$|The final Gallup poll {{before the}} {{election}} showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just {{before the election}}, Maclean's magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale {{the morning after the}} vote, editorializing that democracy in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On <b>election</b> <b>night,</b> the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat in every other province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have legally stayed in office until Diefenbaker could defeat him {{on the floor of the}} Commons. However, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with a Tory government, St. Laurent chose not to do so, making Diefenbaker Prime Minister-designate of Canada.|$|E

50|$|By 1955, the {{existence}} of television on <b>election</b> <b>nights</b> was having a significant effect. It prompted returning officers to hold their counts immediately after the close of polls, so that the results were declared during {{the early hours of}} the morning, rather than the following day. In 1955, for the first time, a majority of constituencies declared on the night (357 of the 630 constituencies).|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} time {{television}} took {{a prominent role in}} the campaign, and this was the earliest UK general election of which television coverage survives (the 1950 and 1951 <b>election</b> <b>nights</b> were not recorded).

50|$|Walker {{had trouble}} gaining {{traction}} as leader. Prior {{to the start}} of the 4th Legislative session, the Independents lost two caucus members who joined Joseph Trembley to sit in the Assembly as Liberals. The Independents, despite knowing about the timing of the 1944 Alberta general election well in advance, failed to field a full slate of candidates. The party and Walker were criticized heavily as being unable to form government and unable to be a viable alternative. On <b>elections</b> <b>night,</b> Social Credit under Ernest Manning surged in popularity and the Independents were returned in just three seats.|$|R
50|$|Turkish {{elections}} have been increasingly sabotaged by electricity cuts during the vote counting process during recent years. The most recent example was the power cuts {{taking place on}} the eve of 30 March 2014, {{on the eve of}} the 2014 local elections. Energy minister Taner Yıldız caused outrage by blaming the power outages in 21 different provinces on a cat entering a transformer, which the BBC initially thought was an April fools joke. The opposition has alleged that electricity cuts on <b>election</b> <b>nights</b> are intentional and the commotion they cause is used to manipulate the counting process in the governments favour. Several whistleblowers within the AKP have also confirmed such allegations.|$|R
