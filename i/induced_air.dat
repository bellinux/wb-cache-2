50|$|Each {{unit had}} two large Forced Draught (FD) Fans. For {{efficiency}} these fans drew warm air from an intake {{at the top}} of the station. This combustion air was passed through the Air Heater which increased its temperature. Dampers were used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace and direct some of the air to the Primary Air (PA) Fans.There were also two large <b>Induced</b> <b>Air</b> (ID) Fans on each unit. These drew the hot gases from the Boiler, through the Air Heater where the heat is transferred to the incoming combustion air. The gases were then exhausted up the chimney. The exhaust flow of these fans was also controlled by dampers in the ducting.Working in tandem the Draught plant ensured the boiler was always under a slight vacuum. This created a draw of combustion air into the boiler and an exhaust to the chimney. The exhaust gases could not be allowed to cool below a certain temperature, as there was a risk of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the flue gases condensing and forming acids which could have damaged the ID Fans.|$|E

Major {{differences were found}} on tidal volume delivery, with mean relative errors ranging from + 1.7 to − 14.9 %. Triggering delays and pressurization capacity also showed significant heterogeneity with a mean pressure time product (PTP) varying from 883 to 3018  cmH 2 O ms. The resistance of the expiratory circuit also differed across ventilators (from 0.96 to 1.82  cmH 2 O L− 1  s), impacting the mean exhalation time and <b>inducing</b> <b>air</b> trapping and dynamic hyperinflation.

50|$|One {{can hear}} a {{leathery}} sound when cleaning one’s ear canal using a cotton-tipped swab. This {{is an example of}} sound transmitted via cartilage conduction. In cartilage conduction, sound (vibration) energy stimulates the cartilages of the external auditory canal and <b>induces</b> <b>air</b> vibration. This air vibration can be then transmitted into the inner ear via the eardrum and middle ear, which in turn activates the cochlear nerve. Air vibration created from cartilage conduction is combined with sound from air conduction at the ear canal, and thus an amplified sound is perceived. This same phenomenon can be experienced when a telephone receiver is pressed against one’s ear when it is difficult to hear the person {{on the other end of}} the call.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the characteristic energy of string models may be considerably lower than the observed Planck mass (≈ 10 19 GeV). In such schemes, the unification of interactions takes place around the string scale, perhaps as low as a few tens of TeV. Consequently, at energies above the string scale, neutrinos acquire interactions comparable in strength to strong interactions. While they can propagate through the CMBR essentially uninhibited, in interactions with nuclei in the atmosphere they <b>induce</b> <b>air</b> showers comparable to proton induced ones. We conjecture that air showers above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff in the cosmic radiation are induced by such neutrinos. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that neutrino induced “anomalous ” showers are virtually indistinguishable from proton induced ones on an event-by event basis. However, given sufficien...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the incoherent beam combining (BC) of four high-power single-mode fiber lasers. Adaptive fiber-optics collimators (AFOC) of 0. 5 kW-level are developed {{to correct the}} tip/tilt-type phase errors among beamlets. The maximum deflection angle of the AFOC is about 0. 29 mrad. A stochastic parallel gradient descent algorithm is employed as the tip/tilt control strategy. The tip/tilt control makes four separate laser beams overlap {{with each other in}} the far-field, and the average of normalized power-in-bucket increases from 0. 171 in open loop to 0. 798 in closed loop when 1. 5 -kW total output power is achieved. The precise tracking ability and control accuracy of this BC system are investigated. Experimental results expose that thermal-blooming effect disturbs BC seriously when the total output power is up to kW-level, which could be mitigated by <b>inducing</b> <b>air</b> flow near the laser output...|$|R
40|$|Radio {{detection}} {{offers the}} opportunity to measure cosmic ray <b>induced</b> <b>air</b> showers at greater than PeV energiesvia their electromagnetic emission in the MHz region. We intend to use this technique to extend the capability of theIceCube and IceTop detectors at the South Pole to measure cosmic ray observables. The radio emission is dominated bythe electron contribution in the shower maximum, hence providing an integral measure of the shower development. Itsupplements the measurement of high energetic muons deep in the ice by IceCube and the sampling of the air shower onthe surface by IceTop. Using these new, complementary observables, a radio extension can improve the measurement ofthe composition of cosmic rays. Further, the surface radio detector will increase the neutrino sensitivity of IceCube byproviding a veto for air showers. It also may allow the study of photon <b>induced</b> <b>air</b> showers, which contain a smaller muoncomponent than air showers induced by charged particles.
