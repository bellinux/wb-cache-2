[...] "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own," [...] he said. [...] "That's what I decided to do with music. I {{want to create a}} director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (St. Elsewhere)... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> film directors as a model." ...|$|E

[...] "When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> more discretion because of my kids.

I have arranged this sinker, which has a hole through it, so that the line will run freely. This seems to work all right on the bite, but I am afraid {{it does not work}} after the fish is hooked. That sinker drags on the bottom. This is the best rigging that I can plan at the present stage of the game. I have an idea now that a bonefish should be hooked hard and then very carefully handled.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond the $16,000 {{needed to}} make the film, it had no budget for actors. Thus, Nadia Litz did not receive any money for her performance, saying she instead took the role because she liked the scene where she hangs from a rope.

She will be of age in three weeks' time, and on her birthday I am going to take her away from Rochester, whatever means <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> and I am going to marry her at once. You think that I am reckless. Well, one must live. Remember that I am young and you are old. I have no place in the world except the place I make for myself. I cannot live in a pig-sty amongst the snows like Naudheim. I cannot find the whole elixir of life in thoughts and solitude as he does. There are other things--other things for men of my age." ...|$|E

There's a little matter on now, about an extension of the Truro Railroad to Harwich, which wouldn't interest you, but you can't conceive what a nuisance it has been to watch that House day and night, as I've had to. It's no joke to have that townsman of yours; Jethro Bass, opposed to you. I won't say anything against him, for he many be a friend of yours, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> him sometimes myself." [...] Mr. Duncan sighed. [...] "It's all very sordid and annoying. Now this evening, for instance, when we might have enjoyed ourselves with those books, I've' {{got to go to the}} House, just because some backwoods farmers want to talk about woodchucks. I suppose it's foolish," [...] said Mr. Duncan; [...] "but Bass has tricked us so often that I've got into the habit of being watchful. I should have been here twenty minutes ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is almost}} a {{fortnight}} now that I am domiciled in a medieval villa in the country, {{a mile or two}} from Florence. I cannot speak the language; I am too old not to learn how, also too busy when I am busy, and too indolent when I am not; wherefore some will imagine that I am having a dull time of it. But it is not so. The [...] "help" [...] are all natives; they talk Italian to me, I answer in English; I do not understand them, they do not understand me, consequently no harm is done, and everybody is satisfied. In order to be just and fair, I throw in an Italian word when I have one, and this has a good influence. I get the word out of the morning paper. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it while it is fresh, for I find that Italian words do not keep in this climate. They fade toward night, and next morning they are gone. But it is no matter; I get a new one out of the paper before breakfast, and thrill the domestics with it while it lasts. I have no dictionary, and I do not want one; I can select words by the sound, or by orthographic aspect. Many of them have French or German or English look, and these are the ones I enslave for the day's service. That is, as a rule. Not always. If I find a learnable phrase that has an imposing look and warbles musically along I do not care to know the meaning of it; I pay it out to the first applicant, knowing that if I pronounce it carefully HE will understand it, and that's enough.|$|E
5000|$|The director's {{immediate}} {{choice for}} the leading role of the old professor was Victor Sjöström, Bergman's silent film idol and early counselor at Svensk Filmindustri, whom he <b>had</b> directed in <b>To</b> Joy eight years earlier. [...] "Victor," [...] Bergman remarked, [...] "was feeling wretched and didn’t want to it;... {{he must have been}} seventy eight. He was misanthropic and tired and felt old. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> all my powers of persuasion to get him to play the part." ...|$|R

5000|$|Norman Greenbaum: If {{you ask me}} what I based “Spirit In The Sky” on ... {{what did}} we grow up watching? Westerns! These mean and nasty varmints get shot {{and they wanted to}} die with their boots on. So to me that was spiritual, they wanted to die with their boots on.Ray Shasho: So that was the trigger that got you to write the song?Norman Greenbaum: Yes. The song itself was simple, when you’re writing a song you keep it simple of course. It wasn’t like a Christian song of praise it was just a simple song. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Christianity because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> something. But more {{important}} it wasn’t the Jesus part, it was the spirit in the sky. Funny enough ... I wanted to die with my boots on. Though Greenbaum is generally regarded as a one-hit wonder, [...] several of his records placed prominently in the charts, including [...] "Canned Ham" [...] in 1970, which reached number 46 on the Billboard pop chart. In 1966, under the name Dr. West's Medicine Show and Junk Band, he recorded the novelty hit [...] "The Eggplant That Ate Chicago".In the 1960s Greenbaum also performed under the name Bruno Wolf with the Jim Kweskin Jug Band.|$|R
6000|$|The address, [...] "Dear friend," [...] {{was written}} over {{something}} else {{which had been}} rubbed out, but beyond this the letter ran fluently and uninterruptedly along in a hand which had a business-like directness and distinctness. [...] "I don't know," [...] the writer said, [...] "as you expected to hear from me, and I don't know as I expected to let you, but circumstances alter cases, and I just wanted to drop you a line {{and tell you that}} I have been in Pymantoning and seen your mother. She is looking prime, and younger than ever. We had a long talk about old times, and I told her what a mistake I made. Confession is good for the soul, they say, and I took a big dose of it; I guess I confessed pretty much everything; regular Topsey style. Well, your mother didn't spare me any, and I don't know but what she was about right. The fact is, a man on the road don't think as much about his p's and q's as he ought as long as he is young, and if I made a bad break in that little matrimonial venture of mine, I guess it was no more than I deserved to. I told your mother just how I happened to meet you again, and how the sight of you was enough to make another man of me. I was always a little too much afraid of you, or it might have turned out different; but I can appreciate a character like yours, and I want you to know it. I guess your mother sized it up about right when I said all I asked was to worship you at a distance, and she said she guessed you would look out for the distance. I told her you had, up to date. I want you to understand that I don't presume on anything, and if we seemed to have a pretty good time after the theatre, the other night, it was because you didn't want to spoil Mrs. Montgomery's fun, and treated me well just because I was a friend of hers. Well, it's pretty hard to realize that my life is ruined, and that I have got nobody but myself to thank for it, but I guess that's what I've got to come to, sooner or later. It's what your mother said, and I guess she was right; she didn't spare me a bit, and I didn't want her to. I knew she would write to you, as soon as I was gone, and tell you not {{to have anything to do}} with me; and if she has, all I have got to say is, all right. I have been a bad lot, and I don't deny it, and all I can ask now, from this time forward, is to be kept from doing any more mischief. I don't know as I shall ever see you again; I had a kind of presentiment I shouldn't, and I told your mother so. I don't know but I told a little more about how kind you were to me the other evening than what the facts would justify exactly, but as sure as you live I didn't mean to lie about it. If I exaggerated any, it was because it seemed the greatest thing in the world to me, just to talk to you, and be where I could see you smile, and hear you laugh; you've got a laugh that is like a child's, or an angel's, if angels laugh. I've heard of their weeping, and if you knew my whole life, I think you would shed a tear or two over me. But that is not what I am trying to get at; I want to explain that if I appeared to brag of being tolerated by you, and made it seem any thing more than toleration, it was because it was like heaven to me not to have you give me the grand bounce again. And what I want to ask you now, is just to let me write to you, every now and then, and when I am tempted to go wrong, anyways--and a business life is full of temptations--let me put the case before you, and have you set me right. I won't want but a word from you, and most part of the time, I shall just want to free my mind to you on life in general, and won't expect any answer. I feel as if you had got my soul in your hands, and you could save it, or throw it away. That is all. I am writing on the train, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> pencil. I hope you'll excuse the stationery; it's all the porter could get me, and I'm anxious to have a letter go back to you at once. I know your mother has written to you, and I want to corroborate everything she says against me." ...|$|E
