5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel,</b> on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that Whitewater <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel.</b> Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E

25|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> {{made this}} {{decision}} subject to developments {{that could have}} warranted reopening his inquiry, including testimony by Clair E.

At the time <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> reached this decision, the possibility remained that George could have provided information warranting reconsideration of Gates' status in the investigation. George refused to cooperate with <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> and was indicted on September 19, 1991. George subpoenaed Gates to testify as a defense witness at George's first trial {{in the summer of}} 1994, but Gates was never called.|$|E

Under 28 U. S. C. 596 (c) (2), we were required to conduct a financial review of a midyear statement and a financial audit of a year-end statement. We satisfied this requirement through semiannual financial audits of the statement of expenditures. For the 6 months ended September 30, 2007, there were no active <b>independent</b> <b>counsels.</b> However, we are required to perform a semiannual financial review of expenditures from the permanent indefinite appropriation used to pay special counsel Fitzgerald's expenses.

25|$|This case {{involved}} the second prosecution of Webster Hubbell by the <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel.</b> The prosecution {{arose from the}} Independent Counsel's attempt to determine whether Hubbell had violated a promise (part of a plea agreement) to cooperate in the Whitewater investigation. In October 1996, while Hubbell was in jail {{as a result of}} the conviction on the guilty plea in the Whitewater case, the <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> served him with a subpoena duces tecum calling for the production of eleven categories of documents before a grand jury.|$|E

5000|$|The prosecutor, who was {{appointed}} by a special panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, could investigate allegations of any misconduct, with an unlimited budget and no deadline, and could be dismissed only by the Attorney General for [...] "good cause" [...] or by the special panel of the court when the <b>independent</b> <b>counsel's</b> task was completed. As the president could not dismiss those investigating the executive branch {{it was felt that}} the independence of the office would ensure impartiality of any reports presented to Congress. However, there have been many critics of this law including Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Many argued the new <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel's</b> office was a sort of [...] "fourth branch" [...] of government that had virtually unlimited powers and was answerable to no one. However, the constitutionality of the new office was ultimately upheld in the 1988 Supreme Court case Morrison v. Olson.|$|R

25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair that Bill Clinton had with Monica Lewinsky. After several years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged that Bill Clinton lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, 2010, then-New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo {{appointed}} Kaye as an <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> {{to investigate}} Governor David Paterson's alleged violation of ethics laws, due to Cuomo's conflict of interest.

50|$|Roughly twenty special {{prosecutors}} (called <b>independent</b> <b>counsels</b> after 1983) {{were appointed}} under the Ethics in Government Act and its reauthorizations during the Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations. These include significant {{investigations into the}} Iran-Contra affair and the Whitewater controversy, the latter of which ultimately led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal. Numerous smaller investigations into cabinet secretaries for relatively minor offenses, such as drug use, were also carried out by special prosecutors during this period.|$|R
5000|$|In In re Sealed Case, 838 F.2d 476 (1988), Silberman {{held that}} the {{procedures}} for appointing <b>independent</b> <b>counsels</b> violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and the separation of powers, because they interfered with the President’s ability {{to ensure that the}} laws are “faithfully executed.” [...] This decision was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), over a vigorous dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia. After the Clinton impeachment episode, many changed their minds on this issue and praised Judge Silberman and Justice Scalia’s position.|$|R
