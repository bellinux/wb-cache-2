40|$|Understanding the {{mechanical}} actions of weeding with a spring-tine harrow at different tine settings {{is necessary to}} achieve optimal weed control. The mechanical actions of a tine harrow in two different soils at two different locations on the harrow were investigated, pointing out the effects of varied implement settings and operational conditions on the tine weeding performance. A commercially available flexible <b>harrow</b> <b>tine</b> was investigated in sandy and sandy clay loam soils. The tine was pulled in soil bins without plants {{in order to avoid}} biological variances. Tine movements and forces acting on the tine were measured with strain gauges and analysed as the mean backward and upward tine torsion, the variation of the tine location around the mean position in sideward and upward direction and the properties of the vibrational frequency in sideward and upward direction during working. In addition, a high-speed camera was used to provide visible description of tine mechanical actions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a seed hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each <b>harrow</b> <b>tine</b> functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc <b>harrows,</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrows</b> (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R
50|$|In cooler climates {{the most}} common types are the disc harrow, the chain <b>harrow,</b> the <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> or spike harrow and the spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow.</b> Chain harrows are often used for lighter work such as {{levelling}} the tilth or covering seed, while disc harrows are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing {{to break up the}} sod.

40|$|Uprooting by weed {{harrowing}} and {{the potential}} of the uprooting process for selective weed control at early crop growth stages was studied. Effects of working depth, seed depth, soil moisture content and working speed on uprooting of Lolium perenne L., Lepidium sativum L. and Chenopodium quinoa Willd. were investigated in laboratory harrowing experiments on a sandy soil. Harrowing uprooted on average 51 % of the emerging plants and 21 % of the plants in the seedling stage. Seventy per cent of all uprooted plants were completely covered by soil. An increase in working depth from 10 mm to 30 mm doubled the average fraction of uprooted plants. Uprooting was also promoted by higher soil moisture contents and higher working speeds. Average uprooting selectivity (=fraction of uprooted emerging plants/fraction of uprooted seedlings of the same species) varied between 2. 0 (deep tillage and high speed) and 5. 6 (dry soil). If tines could keep a distance of more than 3 mm from the crop and weed plants, the average selectivity of all treatments would improve from 2. 4 to 5. 5 and the average fraction of uprooted seedlings would decrease from 21 % to 8 %. This study indicates that uprooting may be a more important weed control mechanism than commonly believed. If working depth and the path of the <b>harrow</b> <b>tines</b> in relation to crop rows could be accurately controlled, uprooting could be a relatively selective weed control mechanism at early crop growth stages...|$|R

Six weed control techniques (spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> inter row hoe with duckfoot sweeps, separately used or in combinations, inter row hoe with additional tools: finger weeder, torsion weeder, ridging wings) were evaluated concerning the effects on weed ground cover and on plant losses.

In the four environments with high weed pressure, the weed ground cover was already higher at pod filling in the harrowing variant. This resulted in higher yields in the hoeing variants in these environments and was caused by a longer period of weed control with hoeing.

40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At {{the same time the}} supply of sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important mechanical weeding techniques. The loosening and aerating of the soil produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance the soil structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated the effects of mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content of the crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at the time of harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. The amount of dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On the soils with the lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % of those in the control, while on the soil with the higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % of those in the control. On average, the best effect on the lighter clay soils was achieved by use of the s-tine harrow, while on the heavier clay soils the Väderstad Crosskill roller and the spring-tine harrow had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on the lighter clay soil were achieved by use of the spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005). The best results on the heavier clay soils were achieved by use of Väderstad Crosskill roller, which gave a 5 % yield increase compared with the control, while the use of spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> and s-tine harrow caused a yield reduction of about the same magnitude. On both soil types, the use of an s-tine harrow had a negative effect on wheat yield, probably due to a high degree of mechanical damage to the crop...|$|R

We ask: i) {{whether there are}} traits or combinations of traits that allow weed species to persist in sown grass strips; and, ii) how does duration of sown grass strips affect weed community composition? We hypothesized that therophyte annual and small weed species will dominate the community in newly sown grass strips (5 years old). Floral surveys were performed in 75 sown grass-margin strips in France and each strip was surveyed twice. Weed species were summarized with trait databases into functional groups using Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Hierarchical Ascendant Classification. Functional group trajectories were investigated in sown grass-margin strips that differed in age using a space-for-time substitution. We found that geophyte, competitor and monocotyledon species were more frequent and abundant than therophyte, ruderal and dicotyledon species. Trait combinations found in most functional groups appeared to be tolerant of strip management; however, one functional group consisting of therophyte, ruderals with a continuous reproduction period declined in importance with age of sown grass-margin strips.

40|$|Dairy and {{livestock}} farmers face considerable {{economic and environmental}} challenges as they prepare for the future. Over {{the last several years}} many farmers have adopted low-disturbance tillage and soil conservation practices that improve profitability and protect the environment. A modified no-till system with a rolling <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> suitable for use on dairy {{and livestock}} farms reduced machinery costs 25 %, fuel costs 45 %, and labor costs 50 %, compared with a conventional tillage and planting system (Harrigan et al., 1996). Cropping systems that reduce tillage intensity and increase the use of cover crops improve soil quality and protect the environment in many ways. Even small amounts of crop residue reduce soil erosion, and no-till systems are associated with the least runoff. However, manure use is a challenge in no-till crop-ping systems. There is a need for cropping and manure management options that stabilize soil and prevent overland flow of sedi-ment, nutrients, and contaminants. Such options will retain manure in the root zone for nutrient use in the following crop and remediation of pathogens. Cover crops have not been used widely in livestock-based cropping systems because establishment costs, competition for labor and added manage-ment needs have discouraged their use. Because cover crops are an effective barrier to overland flow, sedimentation, and manure contamination of waterways, interest in the use of cover crops is increasing.

Firstly, the strategy of physical weed control of carrot in the Fucino Valley was defined and included the realization of the false seed-bed technique, a flame treatment before crop emergence and one or more mechanical (precision hoeing) and manual interventions in post-emergence. False seed-bed technique was performed by means of a specific spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> two meters wide, while flaming was performed by means of an operative machine equipped with four “open flame” rod burners 50 cm wide. A specific precision hoe with eleven units (inter-row of about 18 cm) was built, tested, improved and set up to perform weed control both between (by means of a rigid tine supporting a 9 cm wide horizontal blade) and in rows (by means of vibrating teeth or torsion weeder). During the testing period the evolution of weed flora (both presence and biomass) was monitored and carrot root yield was recorded. Moreover work chains characteristics, manpower use and physical weed control cost were determined. The results were quite good and put in evidence that physical weed control in organic carrot cultivated in the Fucino Valley can be performed, obtaining relevant and high quality yields, without the need of too many hours of manual labour and with fully acceptable costs, taking also into account that in Italy the market price of “biological” carrot is quite high...|$|R
40|$|A web-based {{digital image}} {{analysis}} tool (IMAGING Crop Response Analyser) has been developed, tested and made public (www. imaging-crops. dk). This new technology makes possible objective estimations of crop-soil cover (i. e. how much crop is buried with soil) associated with post-emergence weed control with spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrows,</b> rotary hoes and other weeders. Objective estimation of crop-soil cover offers new possibilities to improve decision support of physical weed control practises with low selectivity because trade-offs between weed control and resulting injury to the associated crop now may be quantified, communicated and incorporated into models. The objective of this resentation is to suggest key parameters and research priorities for future research and to suggest standards for estimation and statistical test of the analytical parameters. The overall aim is to help researchers deliver reliable parameter estimates that may help to predict the optimal intensity and timing of physical weed control with low selectivity and, thereby, contribute to the theoretical and methodological framework of physical weed control. Selectivity and crop recovery are suggested as key parameters because they are crucial in predictive models and are less influenced by site-specific soil conditions and implement settings than other parameters. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} ratio between weed control and crop-soil cover and crop recovery is defined as the ability of the crop to recover from soil coverage. Both parameters depend on the intensity of tillage. To facilitate comparisons between different studies, it is suggested that the crop soil cover associated with 80 % weed control and the relative crop yield loss associated with 25 % crop-soil cover are calculated with 95 %-confidence intervals. Experimental protocols needed to make such calculations are outlined and factors that influence - or may influence - selectivity and recovery are listed and research priorities are given. Crop tolerance has previously been used to express the susceptibility of the crop to physical weed control, but crop recovery is shown to be more useful in decision support models than crop tolerance. Recent studies using the new {{digital image analysis}} tool and the above suggested parameter estimation procedure show that timing of weed harrowing is of lesser importance if the intensity of tillage is correctly adjusted to the growth stage compared with prediction of the optimal intensity in sitespecific conditions. This latter issue remains the major challenge for future development...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard plough, 3 furrow disc plough, disc harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved single furrow mouldboard plough, disc plough, disc <b>harrow</b> and winged <b>tines.</b> Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for mouldboard and disc ploughs, while draught force of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for disc plough and disc harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of disc plough was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased. Comparing the costs of complete tillage systems it was observed that minimum tillage decreases the operational cost per hectare by 30 % compared to a conventional system based on ploughing. Direct drilling is the cheapest way to establish a crop, but if herbicide has to be applied the cost per hectare {{is similar to that of}} minimum tillage.
