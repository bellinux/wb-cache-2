60|$|I {{could not}} but wonder whether John's love {{for me was}} what it had been. Was it cooling? I asked myself. And what was cooling it? It hardly seemed possible, when I looked back to the wild passion with which he had {{proposed}} {{to me on the}} garden bench, that John's love was waning. But I <b>kept</b> <b>noticing</b> different little things. One day in the spring-time I saw John getting out a lot of fishing tackle from a box and fitting it together. I asked him {{what he was going to}} do, and he said that he was going to fish. I went to my room and had a good cry. It seemed dreadful that he could neglect his wife for a few worthless fish.|$|E
50|$|As a {{high school}} senior, Carson was not heavily recruited. LSU coaches were {{reviewing}} film of another player on Carson's team but <b>kept</b> <b>noticing</b> this wide receiver making plays. When they contacted Carlos {{to ask him to}} visit LSU, he asked if they were offering him scholarship. The coach said yes and Carson accepted right then. In his first game as a starter at LSU he caught five touchdown passes against Rice University.|$|E
50|$|McCarty {{became the}} mentor of Paul Reed Smith. Smith {{found out about}} McCarty {{during a visit to}} the US Patent office in the early 1980s, where he <b>kept</b> <b>noticing</b> McCarty's name among Gibson's patents. Smith later hired McCarty as a consultant, and credits his {{experience}} with McCarty as a defining moment in his company. In 1994, Paul Reed Smith's company PRS Guitars, launched the McCarty model as a tribute to McCarty. Previously, no instrument or company ever bore his name.|$|E
50|$|The {{owner of}} any mobile phone still shall keep {{addicted}} to the basics: Written down IMEI, MEID or ESN number (as generally printed on a sticker placed by manufacturer under the battery of any phone) kept somewhere safe. That is a unique identifier to {{be taken as a}} proof of ownership in case of loss. The other is written down PIN code, super PIN code etc. to be kept safely far apart from the phone. And finally, it helps to remember from safely <b>kept</b> <b>notice</b> the own phone number, the subscribers password and the service phone number of the provider.|$|R

5000|$|The letter further said tender notices are not {{published}} in the [...] "desired newspapers" [...] (they are published in papers not widely read) as per the government resolution. [...] "At the same time discrepancies are <b>kept</b> in these <b>notices.</b> No details are mentioned for payment of fees, addresses and contact numbers", it said.|$|R
5000|$|At 16 he {{was hired}} as a {{technical}} consultant on the 1995 film Hackers, where his job was to consult with the actors and director about computer hacking. Jarecki took an interest in filmmaking on the set of Hackers, recalling, [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>noticing</b> that there was this guy that the actors seemed to really look up to and respect, so I asked 'Who's that?' and they told me he was the director. Then I knew it was clear what I wanted to do." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{difficulty}} when filming in Halo 2 was {{the enormous}} shadow over Red Base in the map Coagulation. This shadow had a detrimental {{effect on the}} appearance of the characters. To avoid this, late in Season 4 a glitch was discovered that allowed a character to appear lit even in a dark area. Burnie Burns stated in the Season 4 audio commentary that the glitch was something they <b>kept</b> <b>noticing</b> a lot while filming the episodes, and when they discovered how to replicate it they utilised it extensively.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for The Facts In the Case of Mister Hollow has been mostly positive. Bloody Disgusting reviewed the short {{as part of}} the DVD for The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh and praised it as [...] "a creepy look at the chaotic nature of everything that can happen during that one millisecond of time" [...] when a photograph has been taken. Shock Till You Drop and Dread Central both gave positive reviews, with Dread Central commenting that although the concept didn't sound like it [...] "would be able to hold up for very long", the film's length worked in the short's favor and upon viewing the film multiple times, they <b>kept</b> <b>noticing</b> more details that they had initially missed.|$|E
30|$|The {{system that}} does not make use of MDT is {{provided}} as a baseline in terms of recognition time such that we can measure the computational cost of the robustness obtained from the MDT systems. The acoustic model is the backend HMM containing 21, 037 MIDA Gaussians described in Section 6.1. 2. An axis indexing-based Gaussian selection method, Fast Removal of Gaussians (FRoG) [37] is used. The testing results are shown in the first rows of Tables 2, 3, 4 and - 5. The default FRoG Gaussian pruning setting works well on clean speech and results in only about 5 % of Gaussians being evaluated. However, we noticed a performance degradation due to Gaussian pruning on noisy speech. Therefore, the FRoG Gaussian pruning settings were adjusted on the noisy test data such that the accuracy was not degraded more than 2 % compared to no pruning, requiring 27 % of Gaussians to be <b>kept.</b> <b>Notice</b> that this procedure yields an optimistic speed estimate for this baseline, as tuning on an independent development set would require some safety margin as well. Notice that this non-MDT system produces higher WER than the MDT systems under the clean condition (test set 1), as shown in Table 2. This is mainly due to the non-MDT system using spectral mean normalization to reduce the channel effects, while the MDT systems use the more sophisticated MLE-based channel update as described in Section 6.2. 1.|$|R
60|$|Then, her {{own cousin}} being a marshal in the Prussian army, {{it seemed to}} Mrs. Drummond almost a matter of course, when the time came, that Fergus should go to him; and she had, for many years, devoted herself to {{preparing}} the lad for that service. Nevertheless, now that the time had come, she felt the parting no less sorely; but she bore up well, and the sudden <b>notice</b> <b>kept</b> her fully occupied with preparations, till the hour came for his departure.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{design and}} evaluation of a software distributed shared memory (DSM) system called JIAJIA. JIAJIA is a home-based software DSM system in which physical memories of multiple computers are combined to form a larger shared space. It implements the lock-based cache coherence protocol which totally eliminates directory and maintains coherence through accessing write <b>notices</b> <b>kept</b> on the lock. Our experiments with some widely accepted DSM benchmarks such as SPLASH 2 program suite and NAS Parallel Benchmarks indicate that, compared to recent software DSMs such as CVM, higher performance is achieved by JIAJIA. Besides, JIAJIA can solve large problems that cannot be solved by other software DSMs due to memory size limitation. 1 Introduction Over the past decade, software Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) systems have been extensively studied to provide a good compromise between programmability of shared memory multiprocessors and hardware simplicity of message pass [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|The sub-landlord's {{daughter}} was a dwarfish, blotched-faced, passionate child of fifteen, with moist eyes and very low-cut waists of coarse voile (which she pronounced [...] "voyle"). She would stop Carl {{in the dark}} [...] "railroad" [...] hallway and, chewing gum rapidly, chatter about the aisleman at Wanamacy's, and what a swell time there {{would be at the}} coming ball of the Thomas J. Monahan Literary and Social Club, tickets twenty-five cents for lady and gent, including hat-check. She let Carl know that she considered him close-fisted for never taking her to the movies on Sunday afternoons, but he patted her head and talked to her like a big brother and <b>kept</b> himself from <b>noticing</b> that she had clinging hands and would be rather pretty, and he bought her a wholesome woman's magazine to read--not an entirely complete {{solution to the problem of}} what to do with the girl whom organized society is too busy to nourish, but the best he could contrive just then.|$|R
60|$|The {{acceleration}} of my torpid pulse in the keen {{fight with the}} wind, whose violence was almost {{equal to that of}} a tornado, and the familiar faces of the bright stars above me, I felt as a blessed relief. I ran not knowing whither, and when I halted, the square outline of the house was lost in the alder bushes. An uninterrupted plain stretched before me, like a vast sea beaten flat by the force of the gale. As I <b>kept</b> on I <b>noticed</b> a slight elevation toward the horizon, and presently my progress was impeded by the ascent of an Indian mound. It struck me forcibly as resembling an island in the sea. Its height gave me a better view of the expanding plain. But even here I found no rest. The ridiculous interpretation Tryan had given the climate was somehow sung in my ears, and echoed in my throbbing pulse as, guided by the star, I sought the house again.|$|R
60|$|I {{had passed}} through the first strip of wood {{and was in the}} {{succeeding}} stony sterile space when a gleam of brilliant colour close by on the ground caught my sight. It was a snake lying on the bare earth; had I <b>kept</b> on without <b>noticing</b> it, I should most probably have trodden upon or dangerously near it. Viewing it closely, I found that it was a coral snake, famed as much for its beauty and singularity as for its deadly character. It was about three feet long, and very slim; its ground colour a brilliant vermilion, with broad jet-black rings at equal distances round its body, each black ring or band divided by a narrow yellow strip in the middle. The symmetrical pattern and vividly contrasted colours would have given it the appearance of an artificial snake made by some fanciful artist, but for the gleam of life in its bright coils. Its fixed eyes, too, were living gems, and from the point of its dangerous arrowy head the glistening tongue flickered ceaselessly as I stood a few yards away regarding it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lydia. It {{seemed to}} him as if by some {{infinitely}} subtle and unconscious affinition she relaxed toward him as they walked. This was incomparably sweet and charming to Staniford,--too sweet as recognition of his protecting friendship to be questioned as anything else. He felt sure that she had taken his meaning, and he rested content from further trouble in regard to {{what it would have}} been impossible to express. Her tacit confidence touched a kindred spring in him, and he began to talk to her of himself: not of his character or opinions,--they had already gone over them,--but of his past life, and his future. Their strangeness to her gave certain well-worn topics novelty, and the familiar project of a pastoral career in the far West invested itself with a color of romance which it had not worn before. She tried to remember, at his urgence, something about her childhood in California; and she told him a great deal more about South Bradfield. She described its characters and customs, and, from no vantage-ground or stand-point but her native feeling of their oddity, and what seemed her sympathy with him, made him see them as one might whose life had not been passed among them. Then they began to compare their own traits, and amused themselves to find how many they had in common. Staniford related a singular experience of his on a former voyage to Europe, when he dreamed of a collision, and woke to hear a great trampling and uproar on deck, which afterwards turned out to have been caused by their bare escape from running into an iceberg. She said that she had had strange dreams, too, but mostly {{when she was a little}} girl; once she had had a presentiment that troubled her, but it did not come true. They both said they did not believe in such things, and agreed that it was only people's love of mystery that <b>kept</b> them <b>noticed.</b> He permitted himself to help her, with his disengaged hand, to draw her shawl closer about the shoulder that was away from him. He gave the action a philosophical and impersonal character by saying immediately afterwards: [...] "The sea is really the only mystery left us, and that will never be explored. They circumnavigate the whole globe,--" [...] here he put the gathered shawl into the fingers which she stretched through his arm to take it, and she said, [...] "Oh, thank you!"--"but they don't describe the sea. War and plague and famine submit to the ameliorations of science,"--the closely drawn shawl pressed her against his shoulder; his mind wandered; he hardly knew what he was saying,--"but the one utterly inexorable calamity--the same now as when the first sail was spread--is a shipwreck." ...|$|R
60|$|Standing {{some two}} {{miles out of}} Reigate is the village of Crowswood, a quiet place and fairly well to do, thanks in no small degree to Squire Thorndyke, who owned {{the whole of the}} parish, and by whom and his tenants the greater portion of the village were employed. Greatly had the closing of the Manor House, after the death of old Squire Thorndyke, been felt. There were no more jellies, soups, and other comforts to be looked for in time of sickness, no {{abatement}} of rent when the breadwinner was sick or disabled, no check to the drunkards, whom the knowledge that they would be turned out of their cottage at a week's <b>notice</b> <b>kept</b> in some sort of order. When, therefore, after ten years of absence of all government, John Thorndyke, {{after the death of his}} brother, the Colonel, came down and took possession, he found the place sadly changed from what it had been when he had left it twenty years before. His first act was to dismiss Newman; who, completely unchecked, had, he found, been sadly mismanaging affairs. It was not long, however, before his hand made itself felt. Two out of the three public houses were shut up in six months, a score of their habitual frequenters had, weeks before, been turned out of their houses, an order had been issued that unless a cottage was kept in good order and the garden bright and blooming with flowers in the summer a fresh tenant would be found for it. Every child must be sent to the village school; the Squire was ready to do what there was to be done in the way of thatching and whitewashing, repairing palings and painting doors and windows, but, as he told the people, the village had to be kept clean and decent, and anyone who would not conform to the rules was at liberty to leave without a day's notice.|$|R
