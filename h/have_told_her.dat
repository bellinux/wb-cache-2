500|$|In {{seeking to}} place {{blame for the}} Union defeat, some in Washington spread rumors that Wilson had {{revealed}} plans for the Union invasion of Virginia to Washington society figure and southern spy Rose O'Neal Greenhow. [...] According to the story, although he was married, Wilson had seen {{a great deal of}} Mrs. Greenhow, and may <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about the plans of Major General Irvin McDowell, which Mrs. Greenhow then conveyed to Confederate forces under Major General P. G. T. Beauregard. [...] One Wilson biography suggests someone else—Wilson's Senate clerk Horace White—was also friendly with Mrs. Greenhow and could have leaked the invasion plan, although {{it is also possible that}} neither Wilson nor White did so.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.|$|E
500|$|On 6 February Momolo Mortara gave {{an account}} of the case that contradicted the inquisitor's at almost every turn; in Rome, he said, Edgardo had been [...] "frightened, and intimidated by the rector's presence, [...] he openly {{declared}} his desire to return home with us". Carboni then travelled to San Giovanni in Persiceto to interrogate Morisi, who gave her age as 23 rather than the actual 26. Morisi said that Edgardo had fallen sick in the winter of 1851–52, when he was about four months old. She recounted having seen the Mortaras sitting sadly by Edgardo's crib and [...] "reading from a book in Hebrew that the Jews read when one of them is about to die". She repeated her account of giving Edgardo an emergency baptism at the instigation of the grocer Lepori and later telling the story to a neighbour's servant called Regina, adding that she had also told her sisters about the baptism. As before, Lepori denied any role in the affair whatsoever, indeed saying he could not even remember Morisi. The [...] "Regina" [...] in Morisi's story was identified as Regina Bussolari; though Morisi averred to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the whole story, Bussolari professed to know nothing of the case. She said that she had only spoken with Morisi [...] "once or twice, when she was going up to the storage room to get something", and never about {{anything to do with the}} Mortaras' children.|$|E

In an interview with author Rebecca Rule, Brodsky said the stories her clients <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> [...] "often reveal great courage, inner strength and joy." [...] Brodsky said she has witnessed the human struggle to [...] "overcome personal difficulties that started in childhood." [...] "My books for children have messages in them that come from my social work experience...differences, friendship, loyalty, and social action," [...] Brodsky told journalist Michael Cousineau in a 2008 interview in the New Hampshire Sunday News.

2500|$|Doughty's {{intention}} {{with the}} book was to combine [...] "memoir, science, and manifesto" [...] in an entertaining way that would attract a wide readership to the unpleasant topics of death, decay, and corpse handling, in order to challenge the reader to confront their own mortality. Doughty says readers <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that they themselves are fascinated by the graphic descriptions of such things as [...] "stomach-content removal" [...] or the [...] "bubblating" [...] of human fat during a cremation, yet they are [...] "not sure other {{people will be able}} to handle it." [...] Doughty said, [...] "I think we need to admit that, as a group, as humans, we are all drawn to the gory details. When reality is hidden from us, we crave it." ...|$|E

Her mother, the legendary Whur Ha-Rhang(Lunar Ice in English version) (월하랑), has trained both her and her sister in the Heavenly Mountain Sword Stance, which constantly circulates a type of internal ki to accentuate constant movement in battle. However, when Ah-Rin was younger, she accidentally ingested a poisonous herb.

2500|$|Olivia {{is given}} {{permission}} by Nina Sharp to meet William Bell, who currently resides in another dimension, with {{his office in}} the World Trade Center's South Tower. Having left her universe moving at a high speed, she returns at the same speed, crashing through the windshield of her now stationary car, leaving her in an almost fatal condition. She ends up in a short coma and wakes up in an incoherent state and in shock. Olivia apparently loses her memories of her meeting with Bell and whatever information he may <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> She regains part of those memories and learns more about the invasion between dimensions. Following the transition to an alternate reality, Olivia meets her doppelganger [...] "Fauxlivia", and ultimately shares a kiss with Peter Bishop. She is trapped in the alternate universe by Walternate, Walter's alternative self, while Fauxlivia replaces her in the prime universe. She is captured and drugged, brainwashed into believing that she is the alternate Olivia, complete with traits such as superb marksmanship skills which prime-universe Olivia did not possess. Olivia tries to escape her imprisonment and travel back to her own universe, but in doing so, she inadvertently goes to Fauxlivia's mother's house where she finally accepts the new memories as her own. It is revealed that the alternate Walter plans to use Olivia's Cortexiphan-derived abilities {{to find a way to}} safely cross universes, for which he needs her willing assistance. However, Olivia begins to regain her past memories after she has hallucinations of Peter Bishop, who comes to her in a vision and tells her that she doesn't belong there before kissing her. With the help of the alternate universe's Agent Broyles, she is able to escape from custody and make it to alternate Walter's Harvard lab, where she uses the tank to return to her own universe. Meanwhile, Peter realizes that he is with alternate Olivia, causing her to flee and return to her own universe as well. After returning to work, Olivia is dismayed to discover that Peter had become intimate with her doppelganger.|$|E
