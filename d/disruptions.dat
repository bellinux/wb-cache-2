The scans were evaluated with visual and quantitative scales. Patients were observed for adverse effects after blood-brain barrier <b>disruption.</b> RESULTS: There was a 4 % rate of seizures in this study. There was good agreement between visual CT and radionuclide grading systems. Quantitative methods to grade <b>disruption</b> did not add useful information to visual interpretations. CONCLUSIONS: Nonionic iodine-based contrast medium has a lower incidence of seizures when injected intravenously in conjunction with osmotic blood-brain barrier <b>disruption</b> than ionic contrast material.

40|$|Includes {{supplemental}} material: PresentationDisruptive {{events can}} have severe economic consequences, and input-output models {{can be used}} to measure how direct impacts propagate to other economic sectors. Investing in infrastructure and industry sectors can lessen those direct impacts, but {{it is often difficult to}} determine the level of resources that should be allocated to prepare for a <b>disruption</b> and how best to allocate resources in response to a <b>disruption.</b> We develop a model to help a decision maker allocate resources to prevent a <b>disruption</b> and to help individual industries recover if the <b>disruption</b> occurs. Resources allocated in advance of the <b>disruption</b> reduce the likelihood of the <b>disruption,</b> and resources allocated if the <b>disruption</b> occurs are divided among allocations to individual industries and allocations that help all industries recover simultaneously. The decision maker chooses these allocation amounts with the objective of minimizing the expected production losses from the <b>disruption.</b> The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which adversely impacted several industries in the Gulf region in 2010, serves as a real-world case study for this decision model...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the importance of assessing endocrine <b>disruption</b> in a large new cohort that has been proposed, the National Children’s Study (NCS). We briefly review evidence that endocrine <b>disruption</b> is a potentially important hypothesis for human studies and weigh the need to assess endocrine <b>disruption</b> in the NCS. We note the salient features of earlier, similar cohort studies that serve as reference points {{for the design of}} the NCS. Finally, we discuss features of the NCS that would allow or enhance assessment of endocrine <b>disruption,</b> even if endocrine <b>disruption</b> were not a primary hypothesis motivating the study. At this time, the evidence supporting endocrine <b>disruption</b> in humans with background-level exposures is not strong. Thus, a compelling rationale for the NCS will probably need to be based on core hypotheses that focus on other issues. Nonetheless, if properly designed, the NCS could serve as an excellent resource for investigating future hypotheses regarding endocrine <b>disruption.</b> Key words: chemical actions, child, cohort studies, endocrine <b>disruption,</b> environment, epidemiology, health.
