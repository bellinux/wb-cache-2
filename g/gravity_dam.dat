5|$|The Three Gorges Dam is a {{hydroelectric}} <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> {{that spans}} the Yangtze River {{by the town}} of Sandouping, located in Yiling District, Yichang, Hubei province, China. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500MW). In 2014 the dam generated 98.8 terawatt-hours (TWh) and had the world record, but was surpassed by Itaipú Dam that set the new world record in 2016 producing 103.1 TWh.|$|E

When built it was the longest concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> in Australia, and also the second highest after the Burrinjuck Dam in New South Wales. As of 1997 of the 90 large concrete and masonry gravity dams in Australia the Canning Dam is still the fifth highest and the sixth longest. It is the largest concrete dam in Western Australia in terms of length of crest and volume of concrete.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gravity</b> style {{diversion}} <b>dams</b> {{are built}} to non counteract {{the force of}} the water pushing on the dam by building a dam with enough weight to withstand the force. <b>Gravity</b> <b>dams</b> are commonly constructed using masonry or cement. The foundations of the <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> are generally constructed on top of a solid bedrock foundation. However, <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> can be built over unconsolidated ground as long as proper measures are put in place to stop the flow of water under the dam. If water were to get under the dam, the dam could fail.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an analytical solution {{to get a}} reliable estimation of the hydrodynamic pressure on <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> induced by vertical component earthquake when solving the fluid and dam interaction problem. Presented analytical technique is presented for calculation of earthquake-induced hydrodynamic pressure in the reservoir of <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> allowing for water compressibility and wave absorption at the reservoir bottom. This new analytical solution can {{take into account the}} effect of bottom material on seismic response of <b>gravity</b> <b>dams.</b> It is concluded that because the vertical component of ground motion causes significant hydrodynamic forces in the horizontal direction on a vertical upstream face, responses to the vertical component of ground motion are of special importance in analysis of concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> subjected to earthquakes...|$|R

5|$|Through {{the rest}} of the 1970s, other {{possible}} designs were looked at but never implemented, while preliminary work on the construction site resumed. On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued over whether to build an arched or straight-axis <b>gravity</b> <b>dam.</b> Some favored the latter design because it would have greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Grand Coulee Dam is a {{concrete}} <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington, built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally {{had only two}} powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the United States by nameplate-capacity at 6,809 MW. However, in terms of yearly power production, Grand Coulee places fifth {{after a number of}} nuclear facilities to the south, like Palo Verde west of Phoenix. This is because river flow varies throughout the year. For example, while the dam may generate at nameplate-capacity in the spring, decreased river flow in the fall means less power can be generated the rest of the year, resulting in a lower capacity factor.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, while all {{construction}} was stayed, Reclamation conducted evaluations of the seismic potential of the dam site, even though these delays caused {{the cost of the}} project to rise with every passing year. The studies concluded that a major fault system underlay the vicinity of the Auburn Dam site, with many folds of metamorphic rock formed by the contact of the foothill rocks and the granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada. Reclamation predicted that the Auburn Reservoir could induce an earthquake of up to a 6.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey projected a higher magnitude of 7.0. Nevertheless, Reclamation redesigned the Auburn Dam based on their 6.5 figure, even though a 7.0 would be three times stronger. The design for the Auburn Dam was changed to a concrete thick-arch <b>gravity</b> <b>dam,</b> to provide better protection against a possible earthquake induced by its own reservoir.|$|E
25|$|When {{situated}} on a suitable site, a <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> can {{prove to be}} a better alternative to other types of dams. When built on a carefully studied foundation, the <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> probably represents the best developed example of dam building. Since the fear of flood is a strong motivator in many regions, gravity dams are being built in some instances where an arch dam would have been more economical.|$|E
25|$|A <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> can be {{combined}} with an arch dam into an arch-gravity dam for areas with massive amounts of water flow but less material available for a purely <b>gravity</b> <b>dam.</b> The inward compression of the dam by the water reduces the lateral (horizontal) force acting on the dam. Thus, the gravitation force required by the dam is lessened, i.e. the dam {{does not need to}} be so massive. This enables thinner dams and saves resources.|$|E

In this paper, to study the effect of nonlinear parameters of concrete in <b>gravity</b> <b>dams,</b> a twodimensional approach was used including the finite element method, staggered method and smeared crack approach. Effective parameters in the models are physical properties of concrete such as modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and specific fracture energy.

50|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>dams</b> {{provide some}} {{advantages}} over embankment dams. The main advantage being {{that they can}} tolerate minor over topping flows as the concrete is resistant to scouring. Large overtopping flows are still a problem, as they can scour the foundations if not accounted for in the design. A disadvantage of <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> is that due to their large footprint, they are susceptible to uplift pressures which act as a de-stabilising force. Uplift pressures (buoyancy) can be reduced by internal and foundation drainage systems which reduces the pressures.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{application}} of the Endurance Time (ET) method in seismic analysis of concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> has been investigated. The ET method is based on time history analysis of structures, subjected to specially designed intensifying acceleration functions. It is expected that by developing its application in analysis of concrete dams, useful information on the seismic behavior of such dams at various excitation intensities can be obtained. Results from linear analysis of Folsom and Koyna dams under real earthquakes and ET acceleration functions have been compared. It is shown that the ET method can predict the response of concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> to individual earthquakes with reasonable accuracy in linear analysis. In order to evaluate concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> by linear analysis, the target time has been assumed to correspond to the OBE level of earthquake. Endurance criteria can be set as {{the time when the}} desired damage index(es), e. g. maximum principal stress, reaches its allowable value. The design can be considered satisfactory if endurance time is more than target time and vice versa. Also, potential {{application of}} the ET method in non-linear analysis of concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> has been investigated. It is shown that crack profiles during earthquakes could be traced by the ET method...|$|R

After a preliminary calibration of the model with analytical solutions, the dynamic properties of the numerical model are investigated via modal and frequency response analyses. The fully coupled mechanical-acoustic model is also compared to the widespread “added mass” model [1] adopted in most national codes...|$|R
25|$|The largest {{arch-gravity dam}} was the Kasserine Dam in Tunisia, arguably the biggest Roman dam in North Africa with 150m length by 10m height by 7.3m width. However, despite its curved nature, it is {{uncertain}} whether the 2ndcenturyAD dam structurally acted by arching action and not solely by its sheer weight; {{in this case it}} would be classified as a <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> and considerably smaller structures in Turkey or the Spanish Puy Foradado Dam would move up in this category (see sortable List of Roman dams).|$|E
25|$|In great {{contrast}} to the bright pristine nature of the stations, the dams are organic and entwined with the natural rock. They are generally arch dams, curved in plan, bearing onto the side walls of the valleys except in those dams where only {{one side of the}} valley is suitable for bearing. In these latter cases, the end of the dam straightens out, and the last section of <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> (where the weight of the dam itself resists the force of the water) then acts like a buttress to the more efficient arch dam.|$|E

The reservoir at one concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> suffered a small non-serious slope failure. All damaged dams are functioning with no problems. Four dams within the quake area were unreachable. When the roads clear, experts will be dispatched to conduct further investigations.|$|E

40|$|A hybrid meta-heuristic {{optimization}} {{method is}} introduced to efficiently find the optimal shape of concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dams</b> including dam-water-foundation rock interaction subjected to earthquake loading. The hybrid meta-heuristic optimization method {{is based on}} a hybrid of gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is called GSA-PSO. The operation of GSA-PSO includes three phases. In the first phase, a preliminary optimization is accomplished using GSA as local search. In the second phase, an optimal initial swarm is produced using the optimum result of GSA. Finally, PSO is employed to find the optimum design using the optimal initial swarm. In order to reduce the computational cost of dam analysis subject to earthquake loading, weighted least squares support vector machine (WLS-SVM) is employed to accurately predict dynamic responses of <b>gravity</b> <b>dams.</b> Numerical results demonstrate the high performance of the hybrid meta-heuristic optimization for optimal shape design of concrete <b>gravity</b> <b>dams.</b> The solutions obtained by GSA-PSO are compared with those of GSA and PSO.

25|$|In a <b>gravity</b> <b>dam,</b> {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on {{the mass of the}} dam. The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of the dam.|$|E

40|$|Cracks {{are often}} present in {{concrete}} dams, {{and may have}} relevant dimensions. The evaluation of the safety factor of old dams under higher flood levels has been investigated through fracture mechanics in previous years.
