50|$|As {{opposed to}} n-type {{semiconductors}}, p-type semiconductors {{have a larger}} hole concentration than electron concentration. The term p-type refers to the positive charge of the hole. In p-type semiconductors, holes are the majority carriers and electrons are the minority carriers. P-type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with acceptor impurities (or doping an n-type semiconductor). A common p-type dopant for silicon is boron. For p-type semiconductors the Fermi level is below the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> and lies closer to the valence band than the conduction band.|$|E
50|$|Dopants {{also have}} the {{important}} effect of shifting the energy bands relative to the Fermi level. The energy band that corresponds with the dopant with the greatest concentration ends up closer to the Fermi level. Since the Fermi level must remain constant in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, stacking layers of materials with different properties leads to many useful electrical properties induced by band bending, if the interfaces can be made cleanly enough. For example, the p-n junction's properties are due to the band bending that happens {{as a result of}} the necessity to line up the bands in contacting regions of p-type and n-type material.This effect is shown in a band diagram. The band diagram typically indicates the variation in the valence band and conduction band edges versus some spatial dimension, often denoted x. The Fermi level is also usually indicated in the diagram. Sometimes the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level,</b> Ei, which is the Fermi level in the absence of doping, is shown. These diagrams are useful in explaining the operation of many kinds of semiconductor devices.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{transmission}} measurements {{were performed on}} CdTe bulk single crystal. It was found that when a sliced and polished CdTe wafer was used, a white film started to develop when the sample was heated above 530 K and the sample became opaque. Therefore, a bulk crystal of CdTe was first grown in the window area by physical vapor transport; the optical transmission was then measured and from which the energy band gap was derived between 304 and 1067 K. The band gaps of CdTe can be fit well {{as a function of}} temperature using the Varshini expression: Eg (e V) = 1. 5860 - 5. 9117 xl 0 (exp - 4) T(sup 2) /(T + 160). Using the band gap data, the high temperature electron-hole equilibrium was calculated numerically by assuming the Kane's conduction band structure and a heavy-hole parabolic valance band. The calculated intrinsic carrier concentrations agree well with the experimental data reported previously.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} (EC) {{behavior of}} mechanically exfoliated graphene and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is studied at high spatial resolution in aqueous solutions using Ru(NH 3) 63 +/ 2 + as a redox probe whose standard potential sits {{close to the}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> of graphene and graphite. When scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) data are coupled with that from complementary techniques (AFM, micro-Raman) applied to the same sample area, different time-dependent EC activity between the basal planes and step edges is revealed. In contrast, other redox couples (ferrocene derivatives) whose potential is further removed from the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> of graphene and graphite show uniform and high activity (close to diffusion-control). Macroscopic voltammetric measurements in different environments reveal that the time-dependent behavior after HOPG cleavage, peculiar to Ru(NH 3) 63 +/ 2 +, is not associated particularly with any surface contaminants but is reasonably attributed to the spontaneous delamination of the HOPG with time to create partially coupled graphene layers, further supported by conductive AFM measurements. This process has {{a major impact on}} the density of states of graphene and graphite edges, particularly at the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> to which Ru(NH 3) 63 +/ 2 + is most sensitive. Through the use of an improved voltammetric mode of SECCM, we produce movies of potential-resolved and spatially resolved HOPG activity, revealing how enhanced activity at step edges is a subtle effect for Ru(NH 3) 63 +/ 2 +. These latter studies allow us to propose a microscopic model to interpret the EC response of graphene (basal plane and edges) and aged HOPG considering the nontrivial electronic band structure. ...|$|E

The approach is based on contour integrations in the complex energy plane and exploits the analytical properties of the KKR Green function and the Fermi-Dirac function.

40|$|ABSTRACT In this work, we have {{performed}} the first-principles calculations {{to investigate the}} Schottky barrier height (SBH) of various nanostructured silicide-silicon junctions.

From this finding, we suggest a model, a symmetric increase of the SBH (SI) model, to properly predict SBHs of nanostructured silicide-silicon junctions. We also suggest two measurable quantities for the experimental validation of our model.

30|$|Effects of doping on single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNT) networks {{with different}} metallicity are reported through {{the study of}} sheet resistance changes upon annealing and acid treatment. SWNT film with high metallic tube content is found to have relatively good chemical stability against post treatments, as demonstrated from its stable film performance in ambient after annealing, and merely 15 % reduction in sheet resistance upon sulfuric acid treatment. Conversely, film stability of SWNT film with low metallic content which comprises largely of semiconducting SWNT varies with days in ambient, and its sheet resistance changes drastically after treated with acid, indicating the extreme sensitivity of semiconducting SWNT to surrounding environment. The results suggest that annealing removes unintentional oxygen doping from the ambient and shifts the Fermi level towards the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level.</b> Acid treatment, on the other hand, introduces physisorbed and chemisorbed oxygen and shifts the Fermi level away from the intrinsic level and increases the hole doping.|$|E
40|$|The zinc {{concentration}} measured after organometallic {{vapor phase}} epitaxy (GMVPE) growth on (100) -oriented GaAs at 700 °C {{has been compared to}} the zinc concentration measured after in-diffusion under near-equilibrium conditions. During diffusion, the concentration of Zn 20 nm below the surface was found to vary with PZn 1 / 2, as expected for bulk solid-vapor equilibrium. During growth, the concentration of Zn varied linearly with PZn up to a maximum value which was found to correspond to the solubility limit set by second phase formation, e. g., growth of Zn 3 As 2. Although large differences were observed between the results of the two experiments when using nominally identical ambient conditions, all of the results are consistent with a thermodynamic model in which the Fermi level at the surface is pinned approximately 200 meV below the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level.</b> Typical OMVPE growth conditions appear to give a buIk zinc concentration which is supersaturated relative to the ambient partial pressures used, and to enhance the diffusion of Zn into the substrate...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{has always}} been a killing matter for {{traditional}} semiconductor machines. The underlining physical reason is that the intrinsic carrier density of a device made from a traditional semiconductor material increases very fast with a rising temperature. Once reaching a temperature, the density surpasses the chemical doping or gating effect, any p-n junction or transistor made from the semiconductor will fail to function. Here, we measure the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> (|E_F|= 2. 93 k_B*T) or intrinsic carrier density (n_in= 3. 87 * 10 ^ 6 cm^- 2 K^- 2 *T^ 2), carrier drift velocity, and G mode phonon energy of graphene devices and their temperature dependencies up to 2400 K. Our results show intrinsic carrier density of graphene is an order of magnitude less sensitive to temperature than those of Si or Ge, and reveal the great potentials of graphene as a material for high temperature devices. We also observe a linear decline of saturation drift velocity with increasing temperature, and identify the temperature coefficients of the intrinsic G mode phonon energy.

30|$|In summary, we {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} annealing and acid treatment on SWNT films of different M-SWNT content. It was found that M-SWNT is more chemically stable than S-SWNT, as was shown from their response to acid treatment and doping, {{as well as the}} performance stability in ambient. Annealing removes absorbed O 2 and water molecules from the SWNT network, shifts the Fermi level towards <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level,</b> and reduces hole carrier density. The impact is visible for S-SWNT from the considerable worsened sheet resistance after annealing. For M-SWNT, de-doping has not much effect on the carrier density. Reduction in sheet resistance is hence assumed to be from the better tube-to-tube contact (Rcnt-cnt) and lowered surface work function of annealed M-SWNT, which leads to better carrier flow at the interface. Acid treatment, on the other hand, improves the conductivity through few means: (1) introduces O 2 doping to increase hole density, (2) reduces tunneling barriers at tube-tube intersection (Rcnt-cnt), and (3) increases the degree of carrier delocalization to facilitate charge hopping. The impact of acid treatment is very prominent in S-SWNT due to its higher chemical reactivity as compared to M-SWNT. Although the total improvement in S-SWNT is higher than M-SWNT, we found in our experiment that the conductivity of treated M-SWNT film is still superior. Nevertheless, the better chemical reactivity of S-SWNT allows for further potential improvement from doping treatment with other acids or strong oxidizers.|$|E
40|$|Several two- and {{three-dimensional}} {{materials are}} known to present a gapless band structure, in which conduction and valence bands cross at the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level.</b> Notable examples are graphene and Weyl semimetals, which present a linear Dirac-like dispersion in vicinity of their band touching points. Examples exist also of gapless materials exhibiting a contact point between quadratic valence and conduction bands. A parabolic node appears, for instance, in graphene bilayers in the AB stacking configuration and in three-dimensional materials such as mercury telluride (HgTe) and grey tin (αSn). Although the existence of quadratic gapless semimetals in three dimensions {{has been known for}} a long time, these materials continue to attract extensive attention because of the rich phenomenology stemming from their soft gapless bands. This Thesis addresses many-body effects in three-dimensional parabolic semimetals in the weak-coupling Fermi-liquid regime, which arises when the Fermi level is away from the gapless point. The system is studied with the low-energy spin 3 / 2 Luttinger Hamiltonian, which stems from the constraints imposed by crystal symmetries, in the presence of long range Coulomb interactions. In particular, this Thesis addresses the evaluation of the linear density-density response function. Its knowledge allows to describe collective plasmon excitations, screening, and effective inter-particle interactions. The main original result of this Thesis is the analytical calculation of the density response function within the Random Phase Approximation. The dynamical dielectric function is then applied to the determination of the plasmon dispersion relation and to calculate the DC mobility of the many-body system in the presence of screened Coulomb impurities...|$|E

40|$|A density {{functional}} study is presented of the interstitial Zn_i, Ge_i, and N_i in ZnGeN_ 2. Corrections {{to the band}} gap are included {{by means of the}} LDA+U method. The Zn and Ge interstitials are both found to strongly prefer the larger octahedral site compared to the two types of tetrahedral sites. The Zn interstitial is found to be a shallow double donor but has higher energy than previously studied antisite defects. It has a resonance in the conduction band which is Zn-s like. The Ge interstitial is an even higher energy of formation defect and also behaves as a shallow double donor but has also a deep level in the gap, corresponding to a Ge-s orbital character while the Ge-p forms a resonance in the conduction band. The nitrogen interstitial forms a split-interstitial configuration, as also occurs in GaN. Its electronic levels can be related to that of a N_ 2 molecule. The defect levels in the gap correspond to the π_g-like lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the molecule, which here becomes filled with 3 electrons in the defect's neutral charge state. They are found to prefer a high-spin configuration in the q=+ 1 state. The corresponding transition levels are obtained and show that this is an amphoteric trap level occurring in + 2, + 1, 0 and - 1 charge states. The two possible sites for this split interstitial, on top of Zn or on top of Ge differ slightly in N_ 2 bond-length. While the N_i defects have the lowest formation energy among the interstitials, it is still higher than that of the antisites. Hence they are not expected to occur in sufficient concentration to affect the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> position.
