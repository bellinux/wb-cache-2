500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you {{have no choice but to}} use the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} he only {{managed to}} play one match before being loaned out again on 24 March 2005, this time to League Two club Bristol Rovers, {{until the end of}} the season. He made his debut two days later as a substitute on 79 minutes in a 2–1 victory away to Notts County. He stated his desire to stay at the club long-term in April 2005, saying [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> change, just to get myself going again really because it has been disappointing not playing." [...] He made his first start for the club in a 4–0 away defeat against Scunthorpe United on 30 April 2005. The loan expired in May 2005 after playing five times and he again expressed his desire to stay at the club. Wycombe Wanderers agreed to sign Carruthers on a two-year contract on a free transfer on 16 June 2005 and Rovers manager Ian Atkins revealed his disappointment at not signing him, saying [...] "He was high on my list. There are not many players who can play left-back, wing-back or as out-and-out wingers". However, after speaking to Atkins and being guaranteed regular football, he decided to join Rovers instead on 29 June 2005.|$|E

60|$|There is, perhaps, {{this much}} truth in that, {{that most people}} <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> certain {{stimulus}} to exertion and a certain standard of achievement to do their best, {{but to say that}} this is provided by private ownership and can only be provided by private ownership is an altogether different thing. Is the British Telephone Service, for example, kept as efficient as it is--which isn't very much, by the bye, in the way of efficiency--by the protests of the shareholders or of the subscribers? Does the grocer's errand-boy loiter any less than his brother who carries the Post Office telegrams? In the matter of the public milk supply, again, would not an intelligently critical public anxious for its milk good and early be a far more formidable master than a speculative proprietor in the back room of a creamery? And when one comes to large business organizations managed by officials and owned by dispersed shareholders, the contrast is all to the advantage of the community.|$|E

50|$|Euphorbia namuskluftensis is {{a species}} of plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is endemic to Namibia. Its natural habitat is rocky areas. Occurs on white {{limestone}} on Namuskluft. It is a dwarf non-spiny species. It has tubers and rhibozomes, that divide into numerous short branch stems. The branches have tiny sessile caduceus leaves about 2 mm long. They have tiny yellow flowers when they bloom, and are of green coloration. Grows better in mild shade, but <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> place that is bright and warm. Root rot can occur if left in wet soil for too long. Threats include pests and diseases like spider mites and mold.|$|E
50|$|Cost based pricing {{is still}} a useful method for {{specific}} categories of service parts.

Such parts can be priced using the cost based approach with slight markups {{on the cost of}} the parts. Other examples are standard parts such as bolts and screws that must be priced. These can also be priced simply using cost based approach. A useful case for cost based pricing is that of high-warranty parts. Since these parts do not generate revenue for the company, it makes sense to keep them as close to the actual cost as possible.|$|E

Another way to {{eliminate}} the effect of torque created by the rotorwing is by mounting the engine on {{the tips of the}} rotorwing rather than inside the helicopter itself; this is called a tip jet. One example of a helicopter using such a system is the NHI H-3 Kolibrie, which had a ramjet on each of the two wingtips, and an auxiliary power unit to spin up the rotor before starting the ramjets. Another example would be the Fairey Rotodyne. Also, unpowered rotors used in autogyro, gyrodyne, and derived concepts do not need a tail rotor either, although nearly all models that utilize this concept of propulsion <b>do</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> second prop {{in one way or another}} to drive them forward to begin with.|$|E
