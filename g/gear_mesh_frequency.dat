40|$|AbstractGearbox {{failure is}} one of the highest risk events in wind turbines. In most of the wind turbines, {{planetary}} gearboxes are preferred over conventional gearboxes due to their significant advantages. But condition monitoring of planetary gearboxes present a huge challenge to the vibration analysts due to complex design and construction of its unit, vibration transducer type and locations, wide frequency range of the vibrations, resolution required to separate frequencies and dynamic range required to observe both low frequency and high frequency components in the spectrum. Due to strong <b>Gear</b> <b>Mesh</b> <b>Frequency</b> (GMF) signals, gear defect vibration characteristics can often be suppressed in the overall vibration signal.

Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Part K, Journal of Multi-body Dynamics, 231 (3), pp. 504 - 518. Copyright © 2017 Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Reprinted by permission of SAGE Publications. A planetary gearbox model comprising five spur gears (sun, ring and three planets) and the carrier has been developed and analysed. The influence of gear teeth backlash and friction during mixed regime of lubrication has been taken into consideration. Greenwood and Tripp model is employed, while viscous friction is calculated analytically using the functions of Evans and Johnson. A combined tribodynamics modeling approach has been implemented and modal analysis is performed in order to predict the coupled mechanism of tribological and dynamic behavior, subjected to backlash and excited at the <b>gear</b> <b>meshing</b> <b>frequency.</b> The software used for the simulations is ADAMS MSc (Student Edition), where the model variables (concerning gear geometry and forcing functions) have been added in a parametric way. The results showed that small variations of the dynamic transmission error affect notably the viscous friction through changing the contact load between the engaged teeth pairs. Also, higher values of the Stribeck oil parameter due to higher film thickness or lower surface roughness in the mixed lubrication regime lead to reduction of the boundary friction, whereas a reduction of the total generated friction occurs when increasing the angular velocity of the input gear body (due to higher film thickness and smaller asperity interactions). The above lead to reduced power loss of the mechanism. Finally, a characterization of the system dynamics is presented using the calculated eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the corresponding linearized system. Potential interactions with the <b>gear</b> <b>meshing</b> <b>frequency</b> of the system are also examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of vibration-based condition monitoring techniques, especially those focused on prognosis, requires the {{development of}} better computational models that enable the simulation of the vibratory behaviour of mechanical systems. Gear transmission vibrations are governed by the so-called <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>frequency</b> and its harmonics, due to the variable stiffness of the meshing process.

This study introduces an advanced model to assess the consequences of defects such as cracks and pitting on the meshing stiffness and other related parameters such as load transmission error or load sharing ratio. Meshing forces are computed by imposing the compatibility and complementarity conditions, leading to a non-linear equation system with inequality constraints. The calculation of deformations is subdivided into a global and a local type. The former is approached by a finite element model and the latter via a non-linear Herztian-based formu-lation. This procedure enables a reduced computational effort, in contrast to conventional finite element models with contact elements.

40|$|In this paper, {{the direct}} current (DC) offset {{cancellation}} and S transform-based diagnosis method is verified using three case studies. For DC offset cancellation, correlated kurtosis (CK) {{is used instead}} of the cross-correlation coefficient {{in order to determine}} the optimal iteration number. Compared to the cross-correlation coefficient, CK enhances the DC offset cancellation ability enormously because of its excellent periodic impulse signal detection ability. Here, it has been proven experimentally that it can effectively diagnose the implanted bearing fault. However, the proposed method is less effective in the case of simultaneously present bearing and gear faults, especially for extremely weak bearing faults. In this circumstance, the iteration number of DC offset cancellation is determined directly by the high-speed shaft <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>frequency</b> order. For the planetary gearbox, the application of the proposed method differs from the fixed-axis gearbox, because of its complex structure. For those small fault frequency parts, such as planet gear and ring gear, the DC offset cancellation’s ability is less effective than for the fixed-axis gearbox. In these studies, the S transform is used to display the time-frequency characteristics of the DC offset cancellation processed results; the performances are evaluated, and the discussions are given.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop vibration-based fault detection strategies for on-line condition monitoring of gear transmission systems. The study divides the thesis into three sections. First of all, the local stresses created by a root fatigue crack on a pinion spur gear are analyzed using a quasi-static finite element model and non-linear contact mechanics simulation. Backlash between gear teeth which is essential to provide better lubrication on tooth surfaces and to eliminate interference is included as a defect and {{a necessary part of}} transmission design. The second section is dedicated to fixed axis power trains. Torsional vibration is shown to cause teeth separation and double-sided impacts in unloaded and lightly loaded gearing drives. The transient and steady-state dynamic loading on teeth within a two stage crank-slider mechanism arising from backlash and geometric manufacturing errors is investigated by utilizing a non-linear multi-body dynamics software model. The multi-body model drastically reduces the computation time required by finite element methods to simulate realistic operation. The gears are considered rigid with elastic contact surfaces defined by a penalty based non-linear contact formulation. The third section examines a practical differential planetary transmission which combines two inputs and one output.

The approach, using ARL/Penn State s CHAMP methodology, uses Component Mode Synthesis of housing and shafting modes computed using Finite Element (FE) models to allow for rapid adjustment of bearing impedances in gearbox models. The approach has been demonstrated on NASA GRC s test gearbox with three different bearing configurations: in the first condition, traditional rolling element (ball and roller) bearings were installed, {{and in the second}} and third conditions, the traditional bearings were replaced with journal and wave bearings (wave bearings are journal bearings with a multi-lobed wave pattern on the bearing surface). A methodology for computing the stiffnesses and damping in journal and wave bearings has been presented, and demonstrated for the journal and wave bearings used in the NASA GRC test gearbox. The FE model of the gearbox, along with the rolling element bearing coupling impedances, was analyzed to compute dynamic transfer functions between forces applied to the meshing gears and accelerations on the gearbox housing, including several locations near the bearings. A Boundary Element (BE) acoustic model was used to compute the sound radiated by the gearbox. Measurements of the <b>Gear</b> <b>Mesh</b> <b>Frequency</b> (GMF) tones were made by NASA GRC at several operational speeds for the rolling element and journal bearing gearbox configurations.

Previously it has been shown that the decreasing local regularity of the measured acceleration signals can reveal the inner race faults in slowly rotating bearings. The local regularity is estimated from the modulus maxima ridges of the signal’s wavelet transform.

40|$|Each {{false alarm}} {{made by a}} machine {{monitoring}} system carries a high price tag. The machine must {{be taken out of}} service, thoroughly inspected with possible disassembly, and then made ready for service. Loss of use of the machine and the efforts to inspect it are costly. In addition, if a monitoring system is prone to false alarms, the system will soon be turned off or ignored. For aircraft applications, one growing concern is that the dynamic flight environment differs from the laboratory environment where fault detection methods are developed and tested. Vibration measurements made in flight are less stationary than those made in a laboratory, or test facility, and thus a given fault detection method may produce more false alarms in flight than might be anticipated. In 1977. Stewart introduced several metrics, including FM 0 and FM 4, for evaluating the health of a gear. These metrics are single valued functions of the vibration signal that indicate if the signal deviates from an ideal model of the signal. FM 0 {{is a measure of the}} ratio of the peak-to-peak level to the harmonic energy in the signal. FM 4 is the kurtosis of the signal with the gear mesh harmonics and first order side bands removed. The underlying theory is that a vibration signal from a gear in good condition is expected to be dominated by a periodic signal at the <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>frequency.</b> If one or a small number of gear teeth contain damage or faults, the signal will change, possibly showing increased amplitude, local phase changes or both near the damaged region of the gear. FM 0 increases if a signal contains a local increase in amplitude. FM 4 increases if a signal contains a local increase in amplitude or local phase change in a periodic signal. Over the years, other single value metrics were also introduced to detect the onset and growth of damage in gears. These various metrics have detected faults in several gear tests in experimental test rigs. Conditions in these tests have been steady state in the sense that the rpm, torque and forces on the gear have been held steady. For gears used in a dynamic environment such as that occurring in aircraft, the rpm, torque and forces on the gear are constantly changing. The authors have measured significant variation in rpm and torque in the transmissions of helicopters in controlled steady flight conditions flown by highly proficient test pilots. Statistical analyses of the data taken in flight show significant nonstationarity in the vibration measurements. These deviations from stationarity may increase false alarms in gear monitoring during aircraft flight. In the proposed paper, the authors will study vibration measurements made in flight on an AH- 1 Cobra and an OH- 58 C Kiowa helicopters. The primary focus will be the development of a methodology to assess the impact of nonstationarity on false alarms. Issues to be addressed include how time synchronous averages are constructed from raw data as well as how lack of stationarity effects the behavior of single value metrics. Emphasis will be placed on the occurrence of false alarms with the use of standard metrics. In order to maintain an acceptable level of false alarms in the flight environment, this study will also address the determination of appropriate threshold levels, which may need to be higher than for test rigs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHelicopter {{interior}} noise levels are recognized to {{be a source}} of discomfort for crew and passengers, being higher than those in turboprop or jet commercial aircrafts. A previous study^ 1 on comfort indicators for {{interior noise}} in helicopters concluded that sharpness and tonalness of the spectrum together account for 40 % of the discomfort sensation behind loudness (57 %). Transmission noise generated by the main gearbox (MGB) and composed of several tones at <b>gear</b> <b>meshing</b> <b>frequency</b> has a strong contribution to these indicators. It is also one of the main contributor to noise level in dB(A), which is assessed by European regulations on safety and health at work. Reduction of MGB noise levels by passive and active means have therefore been investigated widely. Active solutions have included structural control of roof panel^ 2, 3, transmission beams 4 or gearbox struts^ 5, 6. In this paper, we are addressing another strategy, which is the active reduction of the gearbox noise by local active noise control in the headrest. Not only this solution has been identified has a potential solution for addressing tonal noise^ 7, but also for reducing noise from other sources at passenger’s ear (e. g. aerodynamic noise) without the need for a physical control architecture at each noise source or transmission paths...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} program is to develop technology to reduce helicopter interior noise resulting from multiple <b>gear</b> <b>meshing</b> <b>frequencies.</b> A novel active vibration control approach called Minimum Actuation Power (MAP) is developed. MAP is an optimal control strategy that minimizes the total input power into a structure by monitoring and varying the input power of controlling sources. MAP control was implemented without explicit knowledge of the phasing and magnitude of the excitation sources by driving the real part of the input power from the controlling sources to zero. It is shown that this occurs when the total mechanical input power from the excitation and controlling sources is a minimum. MAP theory is developed for multiple excitation sources with arbitrary relative phasing for single or multiple discrete frequencies and controlled by a single or multiple controlling sources. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of MAP for structural vibration reduction of a realistic rotorcraft interior structure. MAP control resulted in significant average global vibration reduction of a single frequency and multiple frequency excitations with one controlling actuator. Simulations also demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the observed vibration reductions on interior radiated noise...|$|R
40|$|Split torque designs, {{proposed}} as alternatives to traditional planetary designs for helicopter main rotor transmissions, can save weight {{and be more}} reliable than traditional designs. This report {{presents the results of}} an analytical study of the system dynamics and performance of a split torque gearbox that uses a balance beam mechanism for load sharing. The Lagrange method was applied to develop a system of equations of motion. The mathematical model includes time-varying <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> stiffness, friction, and manufacturing errors. Cornell's method for calculating the stiffness of spur gear teeth was extended and applied to helical gears. The phenomenon of sidebands spaced at shaft <b>frequencies</b> about <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> fundamental <b>frequencies</b> was simulated by modeling total composite gear errors as sinusoid functions. Although the gearbox has symmetric geometry, the loads and motions of the two power paths differ. Friction must be considered to properly evaluate the balance beam mechanism. For the design studied, the balance beam is not an effective device for load sharing unless the coefficient of friction is less than 0. 003. The complete system stiffness as represented by the stiffness matrix used in this analysis must be considered to precisely determine the optimal tooth indexing position...|$|R

This conference paper {{was presented at the}} 7 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress, Graz, Austria, 2013. [URL] paper presents an investigation into Elastohydrodynamic (EHL) modeling of differential hypoid gears {{that can be used in}} coupling with Newtonian (or multibody) dynamics to study Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomena, such as axle whine. The latter is a noise of a tonal nature, emitted from differential axles, characterised by the <b>gear</b> <b>meshing</b> <b>frequency</b> and its multiples. It appears at a variety of operating conditions; during drive and coasting, high and low torque loading. Key design targets for differential hypoid gears are improved efficiency and reduced vibration, which depend critically on the formation of an EHL lubricant film. The stiffness and damping of the oil film and friction generated in the contact can have important effects and cannot be neglected when examining the NVH behaviour of hypoid gears. The operating conditions in hypoid gears are usually characterized by high load, relatively low speeds, angled flow and elliptical contact footprint of high aspect ratio. Some extrapolated/empirical equations to estimate friction and film thickness have been reported for moderate loads. However, their use in hypoid gears is questionable. Additionally, the majority of reported numerical models for film thickness and friction have not been applied under such operating conditions. In this paper a numerical model of EHL elliptical point contact has been presented to obtain the EHL film behaviour under the usual range of operating conditions of hypoid gears. Realistic engine torque-speed characteristics are used. For these conditions, the load share per teeth pair contact is in the region of 500 - 6000 N. A suitable method of solution is applied to ease the convergence of the numerical method, namely the distributed line low relaxation effective influence Newton-Raphson method. As the result of the angled direction of the entraining flow in the contact of hypoid gear teeth pairs, this method has been found to be suitable, thus adopted. The geometric and kinematic input data for EHL calculations are calculated using Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) ...|$|R
