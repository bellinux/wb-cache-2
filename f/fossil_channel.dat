40|$|Tectonic {{erosion of}} the {{overriding}} plate by the downgoing slab isbelieved to occur at half the Earth’s subduction zones. In situinvestigation of the geological processes at active erosive marginsis extremely difficult owing to the deep marine environment andthe net loss of forearc crust to deeper levels in the subduction zone. Until now, a fossil erosive subduction channel—the shear zonemarking the plate boundary—has not been recognized in thefield, so that seismic observations have provided the only information on plate boundary processes at erosive margins. Here we show that a fossil erosive margin is preserved in the Northern Apennines of Italy. It formed during the Tertiary transition from oceanic subduction to continental collision, and was preserved by the late deactivation and fossilization of the plate boundary. The outcropping erosive subduction channel is 500 m thick. It {{is representative of the}} first 5 km of depth, with its deeper portions reaching 150 C. The fossil zone records several surprises. Two decollements were simultaneously active at the top and base of the subduction channel. Both deeper basal erosion and near-surface frontal erosion occurred. At shallow depths extension was a key deformation component within this erosive convergent plate boundary, and slip occurred without an observable fluid pressure cycle. At depths greater than about 3 km a fluid cycle is clearly shown by the development of veins and the alternation of fast (co-seismic) and slow (inter-seismic) slip. In the deepest portions of the outcropping subduction channel, extension is finally overprinted by compressional structures. In modern subduction zones the onset of seismic activity is believed to occur at 150 C, but in the <b>fossil</b> <b>channel</b> the onset occurred at cooler palaeo-temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{lowlands}} {{are very}} vulnerable areas {{because they are}} situated at or evenbelow mean sea level. These lowlands {{are the result of}} a combined action of a great number ofgeological processes and forces. This {{is one of the reasons}} why coastal lowlands arecharacterized by frequent and significant changes in lithology. Complex alternations of peat,clay, silt and sand are moreover cut by highly irregular patterns of sand -fIlled <b>fossil</b> <b>channels.</b> These specific characteristics require a proper and detailed geological mapping,yielding the three -dimensional distribution, or geometry, of the geological units. An exampleof mapping in the area of Shanghai (P. R. China) which experienced drasticallandsubsidencedue to groundwater withdrawal, will be discussed. The mapping, focussing on the need of athree -dimentional approach, was carried out in the framework of the design of a mathematicalmodel for the management of the landsubsidence...|$|R
40|$|The lower £upawa {{valley is}} {{situated}} in the Gardno Phase marginal zone. The Gardno Phase represents a short ice readvance on the North Polish Plain. According to ROTNICKI (2001) Gardno Phase should be situated between 14 700 and 14 500 years B. P. The fossil ice-dammed lake has been discovered in the lower £upawa valley. Based on {{the analysis of the}} materials the extent of ice-dammed lake has been determined. Its dimensions are: width – 1, 2 km, length – 5 km. During the first ice recession phase the ice-dammed lake disappeared. The first ice recession phase is situated between 14 300 and 14 000 years B. P. (ROTNICKI 2001). After that the aggradation of the alluvial fan of the £upawa began. <b>Fossil</b> <b>channels</b> of braided £upawa can be found in its top part. The oldest organogenic infillings of these channels started to accumulate 13 800 ± 270 years B. P. (ROTNICKI & BORÓWKA 1995).

50|$|The {{north and}} north-west {{of the park}} are drained by the Deka and Lukosi rivers and their tributaries, and the far south of the park is drained by the Gwabadzabuya River, a {{tributary}} of the Nata River. There are no rivers {{in the rest of the}} park, although there are <b>fossil</b> drainage <b>channels</b> in the main camp and Linkwasha areas, which form seasonal wetlands. In these areas without rivers, grassy pan depressions and pans have formed. Some of these pans, such as many of the pans in the Shumba area, fill with rainwater, while others, such as Ngweshla, Shakwanki and Nehimba, are fed by natural groundwater seeps. Many of the pans are additionally supplied by water pumped from underground by park authorities.|$|R
40|$|Pedogenic {{carbonate}} nodule concentrations are an under-utilized {{resource for}} {{the recovery of}} terrestrial microvertebrate faunas. They have proved productive in Late Cretaceous, late Paleocene, and Miocene rocks of Texas and Louisiana. These concentrations of nodules and <b>fossils</b> form at <b>channel</b> bases and by erosion of soils in interfluves. Treatment of large samples of the conglomerates with dilute acetic acid allows recovery of delicate specimens, with teeth of small vertebrates being the main identifiable component. Geologists and paleontologists should be alert to these rocks’ potential, because relatively small lenses, {{which can be found}} in gullies and stream banks even in heavily vegetated areas such as western Louisiana, may yield significant fossil faunas...|$|R
50|$|Flowing {{water is}} the {{creative}} force shaping the geologic features of the New River Gorge as the river continues to sculpt the longest and deepest river gorge in the Appalachian Mountains. On display in the gorge one can find a variety of unique geologic features and processes that exemplify the geology of the Appalachian Plateau, including the exposure of over 1000 ft of sandstone and shale, house-sized boulders scattered from rim to river, plant and invertebrate <b>fossils,</b> and steep <b>channel</b> drop-offs. The river has exposed four seams of coal, considered among the best bituminous coal in the world. The smokeless New River coal once fed the boilers of the nation's trains, factories, fleets and power plants, and its coke fueled the nation's iron furnaces.|$|R
30|$|Another {{concern is}} the carbon leakage which {{generally}} occurs due to increase in emissions in countries without strong climate policies when countries with climate policies reduce emissions. Such carbon leakage may take place through three specific channels. First, industries in the carbon-constrained country can lose international market shares through decrease in exports and increase in imports {{to the benefit of}} carbon-unconstrained competitors. This is known as the ‘short-term competitiveness channel.’ Second, stringent climate policy at home may reduce returns on investment and hence industries may relocate to countries where less stringent emissions control exists with higher returns. This is the investment channel of carbon leakage. Third, there is a <b>fossil</b> fuel price <b>channel</b> where reduction in global energy prices as a result of reduced demand for fossil fuel-based energy in carbon-constrained countries triggers higher energy demand and hence emissions elsewhere, particularly in large non-constrained developing countries.|$|R
30|$|Burniaux et al. (1992) use the OECD’s ENV-Linkages model (a dynamic {{global model}} of 12 world regions and 22 sectors) {{to assess the}} {{economic}} effects of BAMs under alternative coalitions of countries acting to cut emissions. These authors conclude that BAMs can reduce carbon leakage for small coalitions of acting countries such as the EU because when the coalition is small, the leakage occurs mainly through the short-term competitiveness channel, rather than through the <b>fossil</b> fuel price <b>channel.</b> However, the need for, and effectiveness of, BAMs declines rapidly {{with the size of}} the coalition because the BAMs are addressing smaller rates of leakage. Burniaux et al. (1992) also found that the economic effects of BAMs are small. More strikingly, they found that BAMs do not necessarily curb output losses experienced by the EITEs. This is because the EITEs make significant use of (the higher cost) emission-intensive imports themselves and also because of market contraction effects in the home country.|$|R
40|$|The late Eocene-middle Miocene erosive plate {{boundary}} between the European and Adriatic plates is exhumed in the Northern Apennines of Italy. The fossil fault zone is 500 m-thick and the outcropping portion exposes the first 5 km of its depth extent. At this {{plate boundary}} basal and frontal tectonic erosion incorporated unlithified, fluid-rich sediments into the fault zone. The deformation {{and nature of the}} material along the plate boundary define a <b>fossil</b> subduction <b>channel.</b> Here we couple a detailed structural analysis of the Apennine subduction channel, focusing in particular on calcite veins, with a stable isotope analysis to characterize the fluid regime along an active subduction channel. The 13 C and 18 O composition of calcite vein and host rock samples within the fault zone indicates that there is a deep metamorphic source of fluids migrating upwards along the subduction channel, in addition to locally derived fluid components. Dewatering of subducting turbidites only contributes significantly in the shallowest part of the channel. Structural observations indicate fluid flow along and across the subduction channel. At deep levels, fluid flow is associated with discrete deformation events on shear faults offset by dilational jogs filled with implosion breccias. At intermediate levels, deformation is still cyclic and associated with repeated crack-and-seal events. At the shallowest levels, deformation occurred while portions of the subducting material were still unlithified. Here the deformation is quasi-continuous without associated vein development. Both isotope and structural analyses indicate that this erosive subduction channel behaved as a weak fault with a vertical maximum principal stress...|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate fossils {{from the}} {{continental}} Upper Cretaceous deposits {{in the region}} of Pontal do Triangulo Mineiro (Minas Gerais State, Brazil) have been known since 1930. This sedimentary succession includes deposits of the Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin and are represented by thick deposits of coarse sandstones, sometimes massive or with cross stratification. Previous records from the Campina Verde area are only related to sauropod dinosaurs that were preserved in fluvial channel deposits of the Adamantina Formation. Recent field expeditions in two new fossilbearing areas where sedimentary rocks of this unit are exposed at Campina Verde (Pontal do Triangulo Mineiro, state of Minas Gerais) provided important data on vertebrate <b>fossil</b> assemblages. Fluvial <b>channel</b> deposits were studied and revealed an assemblage composed of 20 fossil specimens, mainly vertebrae, bones, scales, and teeth. The sampled fossils include two dinosaur taxa, among which is the first possible Abelisauridae. These new findings refine the record of the vertebrate fauna from the Adamantina Formation at Campina Verde, and open promissory avenues {{for the study of the}} Upper Cretaceous biota in terms of associated fauna, taphonomy and paleoecology.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} {{that large numbers of}} certain trees can survive in the beds of rivers of northeastern Australia where a strongly seasonal distribution of precipitation causes extreme variations in flow on both a yearly and longer-term basis. In these rivers, minimal flow occurs throughout much of any year and for periods of up to several years, allowing the trees to become established and to adapt their form in order to facilitate their survival in environments that experience periodic inundation by fast-flowing, debris-laden water. Such trees (notably paperbark trees of the angiosperm genus Melaleuca) adopt a reclined to prostrate, downstream-trailing habit, have a multiple-stemmed form, modified crown with weeping foliage, development of thick, spongy bark, anchoring of roots into firm to lithified substrates beneath the channel floor, root regeneration, and develop in flow-parallel, linear groves. Individuals from within flow-parallel, linear groves are preserved in situ within the alluvial deposit of the river following burial and death. Four examples of in situ tree <b>fossils</b> within alluvial <b>channel</b> deposits in the Permian of eastern Australia demonstrate that specialised riverbed plant communities also existed at times in the geological past. These examples, from the Lower Permian Carmila Beds, Upper Permian Moranbah Coal Measures and Baralaba Coal Measures of central Queensland and the Upper Permian Newcastle Coal Measures of central New South Wales, show several of the characteristics of trees described from modern rivers in northeastern Australia, including preservation in closely-spaced groups. These properties, together with independent sedimentological evidence, suggest that the Permian trees were adapted to an environment affected by highly variable runoff, albeit in a more temperate climatic situation than the modem Australian examples. It is proposed that occurrences of fossil trees preserved in situ within alluvial channel deposits may be diagnostic of environments controlled by seasonal and longer-term variability in fluvial runoff, and hence may have value in interpreting aspects of palaeoclimate from ancient alluvial successions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 99 - 112) Late-early {{and middle}} Eocene beds of the Maniobra Formation {{in the northeastern}} Orocopia Mountains, southern California are 1, 460 m thick and consist predominantly of cobble-boulder conglomerate, mudstone, and sandstone. These beds lie unconformably above Cretaceous granite and quartz monzonite and unconformably below nonmarine beds of the Miocene Diligencia Formation. Four facies associations are recognized within the Maniobra Formation: 1) Shoreline, 2) Slope, 3) submarine canyon, and 4) middle-submarine fan. Beds comprising the shoreline association consist of nonmarine gruss and shallow-marine facies that lie unconformably above granitic basement. Gruss is poorly indurated, massive, coarse-grained weathered granite detritus. The shallow-marine facies includes thinly bedded, fine-grained sandstone and gravel deposits which are laminated, cross bedded, and contain marine burrows. Slope deposits consist predominantly of mudstone (facies G of Mutti and Ricci Lucchi, 1972) with conglomerate and sandstone channels (facies A). Many of the channel deposits show Bouma Ta and Tab intervals. Also present are chaotic beds (facies F) that include slumped beds, detached beds, pebbly mudstone beds, glide-blocks, and granitic rock-fall deposits. Arenaceous foraminifers present in these deposits indicate deposition at bathyal depth. Submarine canyon facies are chiefly stacked channel complexes of cobble-boulder conglomerate (facies A) that incise into granitic basement and slope deposits. Channels have broadly concave-up bases, contain granitic clasts up to 5 m in diameter, and displaced shallowmarine <b>fossils.</b> These conglomerate <b>channels</b> grade vertically upsection into sandstone beds with repeated Ta and Tab Bouma sequences and mudstone interchannel deposits. These thinning- and fining-upward sequences are up to 25 m thick. Interchannel facies consist either of thin-bedded turbidites with mostly Tbce intervals (facies D) or sandstone levee deposits. Levee deposits consist of laterally discontinuous sandstone beds, some with dune shaped tops, that interfinger abruptly with mudstone beds and conglomerate channels. Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides burrows are common in interchannel deposits. Interchannel deposits also contain foraminifers indicative of bathyal depth. Middle-submarine fan channel deposits are laterally discontinuous, thick-bedded, amalgamated, channelized, coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate beds (facies A and B). Many beds have erosional bases, rip-up clasts, and displaced shallow-marine fossils. Most sandstone beds are massive, though numerous beds with repeated Ta and Tab sequences do occur. These beds are arranged in thinning- and fining-upward sequences, averaging 5 m thick. Repeated thinning- and fining-upward sequences comprise sandstone packages that are up to 105 m thick. Most of the middle-fan deposits consist of interchannel hemipelagic deposits with crevasse-splay channels locally. These mudstone beds yield foraminifers characteristic of middle bathyal or deeper water depths. Conglomerate analyses indicate that granite and quartz monzonite from the underlying basement were the chief source of sediment for the Maniobra Formation. A nearby metamorphic terrane also supplied a moderate amount of sediment. Submature arkose of the Maniobra Formation averages Q 34 F 65 L 1 and Q 34 P 28 K 38, indicates a nearby granitic and metamorphic source terrane of high relief. Paleocurrent measurements, petrographic analyses, and facies distribution indicate southwest sediment transport from nearby granitic and metamorphic source terranes {{to the north and}} east...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{and presents}} a definitive definition of lithofacies, facies associations and their well-log responses for the Neslen, Farrer, and Tuscher Formations (Mesaverde Group) {{in the southeastern}} portion of Greater Natural Buttes Field, Utah. Stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses were conducted on 1645 ft of core from 6 wells. Cored intervals include 352 ft from the lower Neslen, 293 ft from the upper Neslen, 560 ft from the Farrer, and 439 ft from the Tuscher. The depositional environment and sequence stratigraphic evolution define the subsurface stratigraphy in the study area, and {{may be used to}} further subdivide formations and aid in future reservoir modeling. Eight mudstone-dominated and twelve sandstone-dominated lithofacies were identified and grouped into six facies associations consisting of three channel, two floodplain and one estuarine association. Channel associations were subdivided based on lithofacies assemblage and interpretation of relative stream power. They consist of high-energy, low-energy, and heterolithic (mixed energy) channel deposits. High-energy channel deposits are characterized by cross-bedded sandstone, have an average core thickness of 15. 5 ft, and have the greatest reservoir potential. Low-energy channel deposits are characterized by ripple cross-laminated sandstone and have an average core thickness of 6. 1 ft. Heterolithic channel deposits are characterized by interbedded sandstone and mudstone facies and have an average core thickness of 16. 0 ft. Hypothesis testing of average thickness and gamma-ray response for channel associations indicates that they may be distinguished from each other in the absence of core. Floodplain associations were subdivided based on interpreted water-table conditions and include well- and poorly-drained floodplain deposits. Well-drained floodplain deposits are characterized by fissile and crumbly mudstones, as well as abundant rooting. Poorly-drained floodplain deposits are characterized by darker color, carbonaceous mudstone, and abundance of carbonaceous debris. Estuarine deposits are characterized by lenticular mudstone, bioturbated muddy sandstone and wavy bedded sandstone as well as Planolites, Thalassinoides, and Ophiomorpha trace <b>fossils.</b> Thin fluvial <b>channels,</b> floodplain, and tidal-flat deposits in the lower Neslen interval represent an estuarine complex that grades into a lower coastal plain environment. The upper Neslen interval represents of a coal-bearing upper coastal plain environment with meandering channels crossing poorlydrained floodplains. Thicker channel deposits in the Farrer represent a shift from coastal plain to alluvial plain. The thick channel deposits in the Tuscher Formation are also interpreted to represent deposition on an alluvial plain, but with greater accommodation space than the underlying Farrer as evidenced by a greater preservation of floodplain deposits. The Mesaverde Group in the Greater Natural Buttes area records transition of coastal plain to alluvial plain environments during the 3 rd order high-stand systems tract of the late Campanian sequence. The lower and upper Neslen represent the high-stand systems tract of a 4 th order sequence. The overlying amalgamated alluvial plain channel deposits of the Farrer represent the late high-stand to low-stand systems tract. Floodplain deposits with brackish-water influences separating the Farrer from the overlying Tuscher and signifies a new 4 th order cycle. The Tuscher is a new transgressive to highstand systems tract formed on an alluvial plain...|$|R
