2500|$|Lechuguilla Cave is {{well known}} for its {{delicate}} speleothems and pristine underground environment. Guano mining occurred in the pit below the entrance in the 1910s.

2500|$|In 2013, {{government}} leaders and officials from all 12 countries encompassing the snow leopard's range (Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) came {{together at the}} Global Snow Leopard Forum (GSLF) initiated by the President Almazbek Atambayev of the Kyrgyz Republic, and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under {{the government of the}} Kyrgyz Republic. The meeting was held in Bishkek, the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, and all countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain habitat it lives in need trans-boundary support to ensure a viable future for snow leopard populations, as well as to safeguard their <b>fragile</b> <b>environment.</b> The event brought together many partners, including NGOs like the Snow Leopard Conservancy, the Snow Leopard Trust, and the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union.

30|$|The {{northwest}} {{region is}} China’s major coal-production region (Gu 2015). During the ‘Eleventh Five-Year Plan’ period, 13 national key constructed large coal bases are mainly in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia areas with <b>fragile</b> ecological <b>environment</b> and serious {{soil and water}} loss (Miao et al. 2009). Most coal seams in these areas have large thickness and shallow burial depth. Therefore, large-scale and high-intensity coal mining could easily lead to water inflow and leakage in shallow strata, aggravate the <b>fragile</b> ecological <b>environment</b> and even bring catastrophic destruction (Zhang et al. 2017). To solve the contradiction between <b>fragile</b> ecological <b>environment</b> and high-intensity coal mining in northwest China, the concept of water-conserving mining has been put forward in academic circles (Fan 2005).|$|R

50|$|Associated {{with the}} large number of amateur trips (whether {{accompanied}} by professional cavers or not) is a certain level of degradation in the cave. As cave systems are very <b>fragile</b> <b>environments,</b> many parts of Gardner's Gut cave have been damaged by the relatively frequent visits of inexperienced cavers (with, for example, formations broken off, and limestone formations dirtied, which prevents their continuing growth). However, this damage is almost invisible to a casual amateur.|$|R
2500|$|On March 16, 1991, a year {{prior to}} the Los Angeles riots, {{storekeeper}} Soon Ja Du physically confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins by grabbing her sweater and backpack over whether the 15-year-old {{had been trying to}} steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha {{in the back of the}} head, killing her. (Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was still clutching $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time. As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and looked down on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already <b>fragile</b> <b>environment.</b> [...] The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney King's trial resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, and much of that anger was directed at Koreans.|$|E
