A novel mixed finite element formulation is proposed for the spatial numerical approximation of the equa-tions governing the dynamics of the <b>elastic</b> <b>cable.</b> This is done to allow a robust modeling of the cable, even in the limit of an infinite value of the Young modulus, in a way that is similar to mixed formulations for incompressible fluid–mechanics. The dynamics of the floating body is described by the classical Euler equations of motion, written using quater-nion variables to end up with a numerically robust algorithm in presence of large rotations. For the time discretization of the resulting coupled system of nonlinear differential equa-tions, the Backward Euler implicit method is adopted due to the stability requirements of the problem at hand, while a damped Newton method is used for linearization. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed numerical procedure are validated in the simula-tion of the tethered buoy system under various static and dynamic working conditions.
