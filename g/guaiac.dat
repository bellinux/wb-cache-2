Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are endemic. For example, <b>guaiac</b> wood (Guaiacum officinale), the flower {{of which is the}} national flower of Jamaica and the Bayahibe rose (Pereskia quisqueyana) which is the national flower of the Dominican Republic and the ceiba which is the national tree of both Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize. The caimito (Chrysophyllum cainito) grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are coconut palms and in lagoons and estuaries are found thick areas of black mangrove and red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle).|$|E

50|$|The stool <b>guaiac</b> test or <b>guaiac</b> fecal {{occult blood}} test (gFOBT) {{is one of}} several methods that detects the {{presence}} of fecal occult blood (blood invisible in the feces). The test involves placing a faecal sample on <b>guaiac</b> paper (containing a phenolic compound, alpha-guaiaconic acid, extracted from the wood resin of Guaiacum trees) and applying hydrogen peroxide which, in the presence of blood, yields a blue reaction product within seconds.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{consensus}} on whether to stop warfarin before a <b>guaiac</b> test. Even when using anticoagulants {{a high proportion of}} positive <b>guaiac</b> tests were found to be due to diagnosable lesions, suggesting anticoagulants may not cause bleeding unless there is an abnormality.|$|E
5000|$|Stool <b>guaiac</b> {{test for}} fecal occult blood (gFOBT) {{sensitivity}} {{varies depending on}} the site of bleeding. Moderately sensitive gFOBT can pick up a daily blood loss of about 10 ml (about two teaspoonfuls), and higher sensitivity gFOBT can pick up lesser amounts, requires at least 2 ml. to become positive. The sensitivity of a single stool <b>guaiac</b> test to pick up bleeding has been quoted at 10 to 30%, but if a standard three tests are done as recommended the sensitivity rises to 92%. [...] Reduced patient compliance with the collection of three samples hampers the usefulness of this test. Further discussion of sensitivity and specificity issues that relate particularly to the <b>guaiac</b> method is found in the stool <b>guaiac</b> test article.|$|E
50|$|Oil of <b>guaiac</b> is {{produced}} through steam distillation of {{a mixture of}} wood and sawdust from palo santo. It is sometimes incorrectly called <b>guaiac</b> wood concrete. It is a yellow to greenish yellow semi-solid mass which melts around 40-50 °C. Once melted, it can be cooled back to room temperature yet remain liquid for a long time. Oil of <b>guaiac</b> has a soft roselike odour, similar to the odour of hybrid tea roses or violets. Because of this similarity, it has sometimes been used as an adulterant for rose oil.|$|E

50|$|Guaiacum officinale {{is one of}} {{two species}} {{yielding}} the true lignum vitae, the other being Guaiacum sanctum. <b>Guaiac,</b> a natural resin extracted from the wood, is a colorless compound that turns blue when placed in contact with substances that have peroxidase activity and then are exposed to hydrogen peroxide. <b>Guaiac</b> cards are impregnated with the resin and are used in determining whether stool contains blood. The heme portion of hemoglobin contains peroxidase and will catalyze the oxidation of guaiaconic acid when hydrogen peroxide is placed on the <b>Guaiac</b> card if blood is present in the stool.|$|E

5000|$|Stool <b>guaiac</b> {{test for}} fecal occult blood (gFOBT): - The stool <b>guaiac</b> test {{involves}} smearing some feces onto some absorbent paper {{that has been}} treated with a chemical. Hydrogen peroxide is then dropped onto the paper; if trace amounts of blood are present, the paper will change color {{in one or two}} seconds. This method works as the heme component in hemoglobin has a peroxidase-like effect, rapidly breaking down hydrogen peroxide. In some settings such as gastric or proximal upper intestinal bleeding the <b>guaiac</b> method may be more sensitive than tests detecting globin because globin is broken down in the upper intestine {{to a greater extent than}} is heme. There are various commercially available gFOBT tests which have been categorized as being of low or high sensitivity, and only high sensitivity tests remain an acceptable alternative to FIT testing, which is now the best-practices recommendation in colon cancer screening. Optimal clinical performance of the stool <b>guaiac</b> test depends on preparatory dietary adjustment.|$|E

50|$|Clinical {{laboratory}} examination of feces, usually termed as stool examination or stool test, is {{conducted for the}} sake of diagnosis, for example, to detect the presence of parasites such as pinworms and their eggs (ova) or, to detect disease spreading bacteria. A stool culture—the controlled growth of microbial organisms in culture media under laboratory conditions—sometimes is performed to identify specific pathogens in stool. The stool <b>guaiac</b> test (or <b>guaiac</b> fecal occult blood test) is conducted to detect the presence of blood in stool that is not apparent to the unaided eye.|$|E

50|$|The stool <b>guaiac</b> {{test was}} {{originally}} the principal colon cancer screening technology available, but modern tests which look for globin or DNA are now also available. Several recent colon cancer screening guidelines have recommended replacing any older low-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) with either newer high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), which tests for globin {{rather than the}} heme detected by the <b>guaiac</b> method. The US Multisociety Task Force (MSTF) looked at 6 studies that compared high sensitivity gFOBT (Hemoccult SENSA) to FIT, and concluded {{that there were no}} clear difference in overall performance between these methods, and a similar recommendation was made by the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC).|$|E

5000|$|It may be {{different}} from hemlock, as hemlock is explicitly mentioned in several other writings of his. In favor of it being yew are the familiarity of yew as a poison and the similarity in symptoms. Edmund Spenser for example wrote of [...] "the deadly heben bow". In favor of ebony (specifically, <b>guaiac)</b> are the fact that ebony was sometimes written with an h, but arguing against it is the low toxicity of <b>guaiac.</b> In favour of henbane is its toxic nature and the possible origin of hebenon as metathesis from henbane. Other authors question whether there is sufficient evidence to resolve the issue, or even whether Shakespeare's attention to botany and pharmacology was sufficient to say he meant a specific plant.|$|E

50|$|The stool <b>guaiac</b> {{test method}} may be {{preferable}} to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) {{if there is}} a clinical concern about possible gastric or proximal upper intestinal bleeding. However, although heme breakdown is less than globin during intestinal transit, false negative results can be seen with the stool <b>guaiac</b> tests due to degradation of the peroxidase-activity. This can cause false negative results in upper gastrointestinal bleeding sources, or in right colon adenomas and cancers that have comparable blood losses to positively testing left colon lesions. A positive gFOBT with subsequent negative colonoscopy may lead to an upper endoscopy. It is unclear whether this is an effective intervention {{if there is a}} positive gFOBT but no anemia. Endoscopy when there is a positive gFOBT along with iron deficiency anemia, or iron deficiency anemia on its own, has a higher rate of finding problems.|$|E

50|$|The <b>guaiac</b> {{test can}} often be {{false-positive}} which is a positive test result when there is in fact no source of bleeding.
