5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement. His fragments– perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head– took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> Notable examples are The Walking Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E

40|$|Roy W. Perrett {{argues that}} the Hindu sage, like the western moral saint, seems precluded from {{pursuing}} non-moral ends <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sakes.</b> If he is precluded from pursuing non-moral ends <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sakes,</b> then he is precluded from pursuing non-moral virtues, interests, activities, relationships, and so on <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sakes.</b> A life devoid of every such pursuit seems deficient. Hence, the Hindu sage seems to forsake the good life. In response, I adapt a reply that Vanessa Carbonell offers {{in the context of}} the moral saint. The Hindu sage might pursue non-moral virtues, interests, activities, relationships, and so on <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sakes,</b> so long as his motivation to pursue moksa is read de re rather than de dicto. Indeed, this reply is more convincing in the case of the Hindu sage than it is in the case of the moral saint...|$|R

25|$|The role {{of secular}} life and culture: In the Hirschian view, {{interaction}} with the secular and the requisite acquisition of culture and knowledge is encouraged, only insofar as it facilitates the application of Torah to worldly matters.

25|$|Samizdat distinguishes itself {{not only}} by the ideas and debates which it helped spread to a wider audience, but also by its {{physical}} form. The hand-typed, often blurry and wrinkled pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian samizdat from Western literature. The physical form of samizdat arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> the ragged appearance of samizdat contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form samizdat took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. In effect, the physical form of samizdat itself elevated the reading of samizdat to a prized clandestine act.|$|E

500|$|The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1910. [...] The tale is about housekeeping and insect pests in the home, and reflects Potter's own sense of tidiness and her abhorrence of insect infestations. The character of Mrs. Tittlemouse debuted in 1909 in a small but crucial role in The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies, and Potter decided to give her a tale of her own the following year. Her meticulous illustrations of the insects may have been drawn <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> or to provoke horror and disgust in her juvenile readers. 25,000 copies of the tale were initially released in July 1910 and another 15,000 between November 1910 and November 1911 in Potter's typical small book format.|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica [...] "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band [...] "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".|$|E
500|$|Potter's {{source for}} the {{wildlife}} and the insect drawings in Mrs. Tittlemouse were those she had executed in her early adulthood, either directly from nature or by observing specimens in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The interest in the book's illustrations lies in the microscopic accuracy of the insects rather than in any human qualities exhibited by Mrs. Tittlemouse or Mr. Jackson. [...] Potter is uncharacteristically careless in the depiction of the insects however. They appear to be drawn <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> or seem {{to be out of}} scale with the heroine, or to change scale without reason. The ladybird seems larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse, and the spider appears first larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse in one picture and then smaller in another. The bees are sometimes out of scale with both the toad and the mouse.|$|E
500|$|The {{emphasis}} of the jewellery is very firmly on spectacular badges and pendant jewels of the late Renaissance in {{what is known as}} the [...] "Spanish Style" [...] that was adopted throughout Europe between about 1550 and 1630, using gems together with gold and enamel to create dazzling tiny sculptures. [...] These were originally worn by both men and women, but as a collection the Waddesdon group was chosen for display (and in a specifically male setting) rather than for wearing, except at the occasional fancy-dress ball, a fashion at the time. [...] The group demonstrate little interest in gemstones and pearls <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> Although such pieces have survived more often than styles emphasizing gem stones and massy gold, which were typically recycled for their materials when fashion changed, the demand from 19th-century collectors greatly exceeded the supply of authentic survivals, and many pieces include much work from that period (see below).|$|E

He was interested in sounds <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake,</b> particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion. Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began when he read a LOOK magazine article about the Sam Goody record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Volume One. The article described Varèse's percussion composition Ionisation, produced by EMS Recordings, as [...] "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". Zappa decided to seek out Varèse's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the [...] "mad scientist" [...] looking photo of Varèse on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount. Thus began his lifelong passion for Varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers.|$|E
500|$|Foot binding is {{the process}} in which the arch of a woman's feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch. These [...] "fists of flesh" [...] were seen as {{attractive}} and arousing for men and the practice was passed down as a prerequisite to marriage from mother to daughter across generations. The process of foot binding was painful and often confined women to their rooms. Few lower class women were able to have their feet bound because they needed {{to be able to walk}} normally to accomplish house work. Bound feet came to be an indication of high class and wealth for women. Chinese male reformers during the imperialism period recognized the liberation of the Chinese women as something necessary <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> The humiliation that China had gone through on an international level was turned on the Chinese [...] "women". Naturally, the foot binding was recognized as [...] "national shame," [...] and people found it as a serious problem to be disappeared, thus raging anti-footbinding campaigns in the 1890s to the 1900s. Moreover, the new government that came in after the 1911 revolution banned foot binding practice. Thus, it started to disappear in the coastal areas in 1900 to 1920. However, the practice was still popular within the interior areas of China till the 1930s and even in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Shero's introverted, enigmatic {{personality}} had {{an effect}} on the way in which he coached players. Shero often communicated with his players by way of notes left in their lockers. When he did talk to them, he was known for never yelling. He believed that when coaches yell they do it <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sake.</b> He always defended his player whether it was in the press or even against management. He always tried to make sure his players were focused during the game. He often asked them how much time was left in the period to force them to pay attention. He had a unique take on practice as well. If the team was winning then he worked the team hard. If they were losing then there would be a low key practice. He believed that he could get more out of players when they were winning. He often had drills designed to let the players have fun, stating that [...] "Hockey is a child's game played by men. Since it's a child's game it ought to be fun". To have fun the Flyers occasionally had 12-on-12 games with the winning team earning a small monetary reward. He sometimes had the players perform drills that lacked purpose which the team performed until a player questioned the validity of the drill. At that point Shero stopped the drill and praised the player for being alert. Shero was notoriously bad with names. On one occasion it led to him trading for the wrong player. While GM of the Rangers Shero traded for Cam Connor believing it was Colin Campbell. Upon his arrival Conner had to explain that he was a winger and not a defenceman.|$|E
