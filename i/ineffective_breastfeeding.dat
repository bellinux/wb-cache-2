40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyze the occurrence of nursing diagnoses related to breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum {{in the context of the}} community. This is a descriptive study of which 30 post-partum women participated. Data collecting was made from August 2009 through February 2010 at the participants’ residence, including interview, anamnesis, physical examination and observation. After data collection, was made clinical thinking to confirm the diagnosis of NANDA-I Taxonomy II. Effective Breastfeeding was observed in 60 % post-partum women, <b>Ineffective</b> <b>Breastfeeding</b> in 26, 6 % and Risk of <b>Ineffective</b> <b>Breastfeeding</b> in 13, 3 %. Although most post-partum women have presented effective breastfeeding, the health professionals, especially nurses, need to offer and enhance information so the post-partum woman feel supported, safe and confident when choosing maternal breastfeeding...|$|E
40|$|This study {{identified}} the demographic profile, obstetric and clinical diagnoses, nursing diagnosis and most common collaboration problem among pregnant women subject to high-risk {{at a hospital}} in São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected by means of a form based on Gordon's Functional Health Patterns. Nursing diagnoses were determined {{on the basis of the}} NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) taxonomy. The nursing diagnoses found in 50 % or more of the pregnant women were: risk for infection (90. 1 %), altered health maintenance (84. 5 %), altered comfort (80. 3 %), risk of <b>ineffective</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> (59. 2 %), altered sexuality patterns (52. 1 %), fear (52. 1 %) and pain (50. 7 %). The collaboration problem found in 50 % or more of the cases was: potential complication: preterm labor (62. 0 %), potential complication: maternal tachycardia (54, 9 %) and potential complication: hypotension (54, 9 %). Thus, these results will allow us to guide the nursing care rendered to these pregnant women...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} nursing diagnoses {{and theoretical}} frameworks used in neonatal units through a literature review. METHOD: Cinahl, Medline and Lilacs, database {{were used to}} perform this study. The descriptors used were: "Nursing Diagnosis" AND "Models, Nursing" OR "Nursing Theory" AND "Infant" OR "Newborn". The search was limited to articles published from 2000 to November 2013. Studies were selected only if they were written in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. RESULTS: In the literature review two taxonomies and six major theoretical frameworks were identified. The most frequently detected nursing diagnoses were: activity intolerance, impaired spontaneous ventilation, ineffective breathing pattern, risk for aspiration, delayed growth and development, <b>Ineffective</b> <b>breastfeeding,</b> Ineffective infant feeding pattern, hyperthermia / hypothermia, risk for infection, impaired tissue integrity, Interrupted family processes, risk for impaired parenting, risk for impaired attachment, interrupted family processes. Diagnoses applying to parents' psychosocial sphere were identified, enabling the newborn's integral evaluation, including the family. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing diagnoses provide nurses working in neonatal units the opportunity of an effective management of the care process {{as well as the}} availability of the needed data in order to continuously improve a quality-based nursing care. The use of one model or more reference models represents a way to help professional action...|$|E
50|$|Majaj {{realised}} that malnutrition among mothers {{was making}} <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>ineffective</b> and {{that lack of}} animal protein in the rations {{was the cause of}} iron-deficiency anemia, and protein deficiency resulting in diseases such as kwashiorkor. The remedy, a diet rich in animal proteins and vitamin B12 injections, was easier to recommend than to implement.|$|R
40|$|NoThere {{is now a}} body of {{research}} evaluating breastfeeding interventions and exploring mothers' and health professionals' views on effective and <b>ineffective</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> support. However, this literature leaves relatively unexplored a number of questions about how breastfeeding women experience and make sense of their relationships with those trained to provide breastfeeding support. The present study collected qualitative data from 22 breastfeeding first-time mothers in the United Kingdom on their experiences of, and orientation towards, relationships with maternity care professionals and other breastfeeding advisors. The data were obtained from interviews and audio-diaries at two time points during the first 5 weeks post-partum. We discuss a key theme within the data of 'Making use of expertise' and three subthemes that capture {{the way in which the}} women's orientation towards those assumed to have breastfeeding expertise varied according to whether the women (1) adopted a position of consulting experts vs. one of deferring to feeding authorities; (2) experienced difficulty interpreting their own and their baby's bodies; and (3) experienced the expertise of health workers as empowering or disempowering. Although sometimes mothers felt empowered by aligning themselves with the scientific approach and 'normalising gaze' of health care professionals, at other times this gaze could be experienced as objectifying and diminishing. The merits and limitations of a person-centred approach to breastfeeding support are discussed in relation to using breastfeeding expertise in an empowering rather than disempowering way...|$|E
40|$|Pasteurized donor {{human milk}} (PDHM) as feeding supplementation {{has been shown}} to prevent and lower rates of {{gastrointestinal}} infection and increase exclusive human milk consumption (EHM) in critically-ill, low birthweight and premature infants. Policies/ procedures for the use of PDHM in “well” newborns and low birth weight newborns with non-life-threatening illness, level I and II nurseries, respectively, have not been established. The objective of this research is to gather and summarize policies/procedures and experiences from four hospitals in the northeast US that use PDHM in level I/II nurseries. Data was collected from interviews with hospital administrators and each hospital’s PDHM policies/procedures on PDHM procurement, storage and distribution, as well as patient inclusion criteria. Interview and policy/procedure data were analyzed to identify similarities, differences, successes, and barriers to PDHM program implementation and outcomes. Findings revealed policies and procedures of all four hospitals cited five indications for PDHM supplementation: <b>ineffective</b> <b>breastfeeding,</b> preterm birth, hypoglycemia, weight loss greater than 10 %, and hyperbilirubinemia. One hospital did not include a step-by-step procedure on distributing PDHM, but the remaining three hospitals cited thirteen similar distribution steps. Three barriers to implementation and maintenance of each PDHM program were funding, “ick” factor, and time limit on supplementation. Two successes reported by all hospitals included increased EHM rates and gratitude for PDHM as a supplement option. Although sample size was limited to four hospitals, the findings were consistent, suggesting that this research can be used to develop a template on PDHM policy/procedures for level I/II nurseries in the US...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is no {{comprehensive}} {{definition of}} successful breastfeeding that consequently leads to failure in identification of <b>ineffective</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> and clinical problems that, in turn, result in infants’ early hospitalization. The present study aimed {{to describe the}} concept of successful breastfeeding using Walker and Avant approach. Data sources: CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, Medline and Google Scholar databases were searched for literature published between 1995 and 2015 using the term successful breast-feeding. Materials and Methods: To analyse the concept of successful breastfeeding in this study, Walker and Avant approach was used. Primary research was conducted by searching for “successful breastfeeding” and “infant”. Finally, 84 resources were selected as the sample. Then, the data were classified as characteristics, influencing factors, incidences, consequences, and empirical referents related to successful breastfeeding. Results: Four basic characteristics of successful breastfeeding, as an interactive process, included how to hold the infant while breastfeeding, how to put the breast in the infant’s mouth, sucking, and transmission of milk from mother to infant. Moreover, some events related to successful breastfeeding contain “infant’s posture during breastfeeding”, “physiology and anatomy of the breast”, and “physiology and anatomy of infant’s mouth”. The consequences were also “infant’s behaviour when s/he is full”, “leaving the breast”, “not responding to sucking reflex”, “seemingly calm infant”, and “lack of pain and discomfort in the breast”. Discussion and Conclusion: The study results revealed that determining the characteristics, events, and consequences of successful breastfeeding is very essential and important for both clinical application and nursing discipline purposes. In fact, precise definition {{of the concept of}} successful breastfeeding leads to identification of the related problems and provision of strategies to solve them...|$|E
