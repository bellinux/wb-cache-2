5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes and thus many of Krusty's <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> anecdotes are based on real <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E

Using a large administrative dataset for Norwegian manufacturing, I find that more educated workers have higher <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> seniority premiums, indicating that they accumulate more human capital (both general and firm-specific) than workers with less education. Firm characteristics are also found to be important for <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> seniority premiums.

These exercises aimed to increase naval inter-operability, enabling the two navies to function with enhanced coordination during possible HADR operations. In addition, during the port visits, the Fleet Commander along with the Commanding Officers of the ships met high-ranking officials of the navy, state administration, port management, coastal security organisation, police, and other stakeholders of maritime security in the countries visited, to share professional <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> exchange best practices in areas of mutual interest.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is centred around <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> {{its relation to}} thinking. In some respects, <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> thinking represent two ends of the polarity of our relation to the world: experience represents the first person, intimate relation with things happen immediately around us, and thinking represents {{a more or less}} detached, usually not so spontaneous mode of interacting between ourselves and the world. However, in other respects, the relation between <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> thinking is never so simple: what we experience would definitely influence our thinking, and how and what we think would in return affect the way we <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> the content of such experience. This research seeks to better understand the complicated relationships between <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> thinking from available human knowledge, and by working on a case study, suggest a possibility of seeing the two ends of the polarity in a new way, namely “thinking within experience”...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Information on patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> {{satisfaction}} with individual physicians could {{play an important}} role for performance measures, improved health care and health literacy. Physician rating sites (PRSs) bear {{the potential to be a}} widely available source for this kind of information. However, patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction are complex constructs operationalized by multiple dimensions. The way in which PRSs allow users to express <b>and</b> rate patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction could likely influence the image of doctors in society and the self-understanding of both doctors and patients. This study examines the extent to which PRSs currently represent the constructs of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. Methods First, a systematic review of research instruments for measuring patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction was conducted. The content of these instruments was analyzed qualitatively to create a comprehensive set of dimensions for patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> patient satisfaction. Second, PRSs were searched for systematically in English-language and German-language search engines of Google and Yahoo. Finally, we classified every structured question asked by the different PRS using the set of dimensions of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. Results The qualitative content analysis of the measurement instruments produced 13 dimensions of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. We identified a total of 21 PRSs. No PRSs represented all 13 dimensions of patient satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> with its structured questions. The 3 most trafficked English-language PRS represent between 5 and 6 dimensions and the 3 most trafficked German language PRSs between 8 and 11 dimensions The dimensions for patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction most frequently represented in PRSs included diversely operationalized ones such as professional competence and doctor-patient relationship/support. However, other less complex but nevertheless important dimensions such as communication skills and information/advice were rarely represented, especially in English-language PRSs. Conclusions Concerning the potential impact of PRSs on health systems, further research is needed to show which of the current operationalizations of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction presented in our study are establishing themselves in PRSs. Independently of this factual development, the question also arises whether and to what extent health policy can and should influence the operationalization of patient <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction in PRSs. Here, the challenge would be to produce a set of dimensions capable of consensus from among the wide range of operationalizations found by this study. </p...|$|R

5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society.

A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
