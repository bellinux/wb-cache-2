25|$|The {{specific}} birthdate of Plato is not known. Based {{on ancient}} sources, most modern scholars estimate that Plato was born between 428 and 427 BC.

According to another biographer of him, Neanthes, Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> Neanthes' version, Plato was younger than Isocrates by six years, and therefore he {{was born in the}} second year of the 87th Olympiad, the year Pericles died (429 BC).|$|E

Although that traditional claim is not as problematic as this recent prominent view suggests, my main claim is that even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> that withdrawing LST should be classified as an act rather than as an omission, it could still be classified as letting die rather than killing. Even though omissions are contrasted with acts, letting die need not be, for one can let die by means of acts.

We use gravity model and do regression, to compare and analyze data for 8 chosen EU countries, including those, that were in EMU and using Euro from the beginning, those that declined Euro and the Czech Republic, which has not adopted Euro yet.

2500|$|Pindar's actual phrasing in Pythian 11 was [...] "I deplore {{the lot of}} tyrants" [...] {{and though}} this was {{traditionally}} interpreted as an apology for his dealings with Sicilian tyrants like Hieron, an alternative date for the ode has led some scholars to conclude {{that it was in}} fact a covert reference to the tyrannical behaviour of the Athenians, although this interpretation is ruled out <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> the earlier note about covert references.

2500|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> {{that the}} extra-Calvinisticum's motto, Finitum non capax infinitum (the finite is {{not capable of}} the infinite), is a sound insight, {{it would appear that}} Künneth is {{adjusting}} or even giving up a strictly Lutheran view on the subject, while simultaneously providing a new and better explanation for the significance and resolution of the Lutheran and Calvinist debates over the presence of the body of Christ. In separating the issue from the Eucharist, and in essentially coming {{down on the side of}} Calvin's principle, Künneth has driven a wedge into dogmatic discussions of God that would prohibit such discussions apart from the doctrine and the historical reality of the Resurrection : in fact, he has conjoined them in the person and work of the Son, the bearer of both the infinite (in latent, pre-existent, and divinely right form) and the finite, through the vehicle of servanthood to both God and man. It is important to remember that for Künneth, Christ assumes our mortality in more than the fashion of [...] "putting on the clothes of our flesh" [...] (the Gnostic view of appearances), but that he is not half-human, nor is Jesus subordinated to [...] "time-bound humanity" [...] : he is the transcendent Son. For Künneth, steering a path between Gnosticism on the one hand, and empirical Liberalism on the other, does not mean accepting the neo-Orthodoxy of the paradox theologians. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> Placher's [...] "post-liberal" [...] reasoning on the subject, the answer as to how he does this is that he returns to the issue of the extra-Calvinisticum : that is, he returns to a wrestling with Christology that accepts the Nicene Creed, but that (unlike Logos Christianity), is unwilling to interpret the difficult Pauline passages about the Recapitulation and the relationship between the Father and the Son solely in light of a simplistic and literal reading of the first chapter of John.|$|E
6000|$|There has of late {{years been}} a tendency, {{as a result}} of the teachings of certain {{historical}} authorities, to minimize the influence of the leadership of the so-called Great Men, and to question the importance of their work as a factor in shaping the history of the time.

[...] Then, too, there is the attitude of Ibsen: that iron moralist to whom the whole scheme of salvation was only an ignoble attempt to cheat God; to get into heaven without paying the price. To be let off, to beg for and accept eternal life as a present instead of earning it, would be mean enough even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the contempt of the Power on whose pity we were trading; but to bargain for a crown of glory as well! that was too much for Ibsen: it provoked him to exclaim, [...] "Your God is an old man whom you cheat," [...] and to lash the deadened conscience of the XIX century back to life with a whip of scorpions.|$|R
