It describes the professional group established to ensure the maintenance of high standards in the use of the Rorschach and other projective tests; the contribution made by the both the Tavistock Clinic and the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations (TIHR) in London to the teaching, training, and supervision in the Rorschach; the early use made of the Rorschach in clinical practice; the international links, which included the British Rorschach Forum acting as host for the <b>International</b> <b>Rorschach</b> <b>Society</b> (IRS) Congress in London in 1968; and the decline in the use of the Rorschach, followed by a recent resurgence of interest. ...|$|E

Prior to the Second World War, Rorschach testing in Britain had attracted advocates and critiques. Afterward, the British Rorschach Forum, a network with a high proportion of women, developed around the Tavistock Institute in London and The Rorschach Newsletter. In 1968, the <b>International</b> <b>Rorschach</b> Congress was held in London but soon after the group became less exclusive, and fell into decline. A comparative account of the Rorschach in Britain demonstrates how different national institutions invested in the ‘projective hypothesis’ according to the influence of psychoanalysis, the adoption of a nationalized health system, and the social positioning of ‘others’ throughout the twentieth century.

Although he had served as Vice President of the Swiss Psychoanalytic <b>Society,</b> <b>Rorschach</b> had difficulty in publishing the book and it attracted little attention when it first appeared.|$|R
