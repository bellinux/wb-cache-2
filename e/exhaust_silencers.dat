50|$|The {{square-shaped}} {{rear wheel}} arches became rounded in January 1972. Also in this year, a Triumph steering rack was fitted, giving a gearing that was somewhat lower than earlier Midgets.

50|$|The {{locomotive}} used components {{from the}} 20-22 t axleload Vossloh Euro locomotive series, {{but with a}} C175 engine from Caterpillar Inc. (12- or 16-cylinder of 2.3 or 2.8 MW) and traction electronics from ABB Group. The CAT engines meet European Stage IIIA emission standards, and can be modified to meet 2012 IIIB emission standards by replacing the <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> with a diesel particulate filter.|$|R
50|$|The wagon's primary {{differences}} were a five speed manual gearbox, and no air conditioning (at least for UK market.) The estate had steel wheels and rear drum brakes {{instead of the}} saloon's discs, and had one less <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer.</b> Altogether a less luxurious but more rugged car. There is a flip-up rear-facing seat in the cargo area technically making the 300C wagon a seven seater.|$|R
5000|$|It had twin <b>exhausts</b> and <b>silencers,</b> and pillion pegs {{where they}} belong for riding any distance. The <b>silencers</b> (<b>exhausts)</b> {{have more of a}} [...] "Silentium" [...] look and were not {{designed}} to resemble the original 'reverse cone' [...] "Conti" [...] silencers that were present on the original 1970s Ducatis that inspired the GT1000.|$|R
50|$|This series, numbers 내연601 to 내연665 {{is made up}} of the 64 units {{delivered}} new to North Korea {{from the}} factory, as well as one unit obtained second-hand from the Polish State Railways (내연665). Interestingly, 내연656 (works number 1384, built 1971), although built for the Korean State Railway, wasn't delivered immediately, instead having served for some years with Soviet Railways, assigned to the Lvov region as M62-1265. Some of the units originally built for the DPRK have since been retrofitted with <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Minor changes such as: {{modified}} lower bodywork, {{changes to}} graphics and silver <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers.</b> Magazines {{reported that the}} exhaust manifold now featured small chamfers on the collector for increased ground clearance. Cycle magazines also reported a change to the rear shock mounting geometry and front fork length to improve ground clearance. Graphics/paint schemes varied slightly between global markets. US models were available in blue/white and red/white schemes. The SACS acronym decal, located on the lower body work of the blue/white models, changed from a diagonal lettering to a straight lettering.|$|E
50|$|It was at 10am on the Tuesday 28 May 1907 that 25 riders {{started in}} pairs in a time-trial format for the road-legal touring {{motorcycles}} with <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers,</b> saddles, pedals and mud-guards. On lap 1, Jack Marshall riding a Triumph suffered a fall and F. Applebee Junior a puncture to his 5 hp Rex machine. By lap 2, Stanley Webb riding a 5 hp Triumph {{had to stop}} at St. Johns to adjust a belt and retired on lap 3 with an engine exhaust-valve problem. At the compulsory 10‑minute replenishment stop, Oliver Godfrey had to retire when his 5 hp Rex motorcycle caught fire.|$|E
50|$|By definition, this {{configuration}} allows {{exhaust gases}} to flow straight to atmosphere. Consequently the gases do not {{pass through the}} catalytic converter or <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> which renders it illegal for street use due to noise and exhaust emission regulations in many countries. Whilst exhaust emission laws do not apply away from the public highways in most countries, many race tracks have strict noise rules in place once again outlawing screamer pipe use.|$|R

50|$|For the 1908 race {{the fuel}} {{consumption}} {{was raised to}} 100 mpg for single-cylinder machines and 80 mpg for twin-cylinder machines {{and the use of}} pedals was banned. The race was won by Jack Marshall on a Triumph motorcycle at an average speed of 40.49 mph. For the 1909 event the fuel consumption regulations was abandoned along with the use of <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers.</b> The single-cylinder machines where limited to a capacity of 500cc and the twins to a 750cc engine capacity. Due to the concern over increasing lap-speed, the 1910 event saw the capacity of the twin-cylinder machines reduced to 670cc. However, Harry Bowen riding a BAT twin-cylinder motor-cycle increased the lap record to an average speed of 53.15 mph, later crashing-out on the wooden banking at Ballacraine.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1951, at the German International Motorcycle Show in Frankfurt, BMW {{displayed}} {{a new high}} performance model. [...] The machine had improved performance of [...] compared to the low-compression R67/2, a racing-type magneto, bigger bore 26 mm Bing carburetors and improved twin leading-shoe front brake. It also came with a more modern sporty narrow front fender rather than the deeply valanced fender used on other BMW twins. BMW announced the R68 as [...] "The first 100 mph motorcycle." [...] It was shown as a road bike, capable of 105 mph, with normal two low <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers,</b> and an off-road version with a single high silencer. A separate pillion pad resembled a passenger saddle, but was provided for the rider to slide backward in order to crouch low for higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|The CM250TB {{is based}} on the Honda Superdream CB250N engine but with a {{five-speed}} and not six-speed gearbox. The model is instead characterised by its North American cruiser styling with stepped seat, high handlebars, 'megaphone' <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencers,</b> teardrop-shaped tank and many chromium-plated and polished alloy parts. The quality of the chromium finish and polished alloy meant corrosion was a problem, the outside of the engine casings becoming white and furring up in damp or winter conditions. Particularly vulnerable to deterioration in finish was the exhaust system balance box. Moreover, the front disc brake was also noted as likely to seize as a result of low resistance to corrosion. For the 1982 and 1984 production years, CM250C had a chain drive whilst in the 1983 production year it featured a belt drive. The CM250T has an inverted tooth type camchain and was fitted with Honda Comstar cast alloy wheels as standard.|$|E

5000|$|Images of a {{glowplug}} {{engine and}} a [...] "diesel" [...] engine are shown below for comparison. The most obvious external difference is seen {{on top of}} the cylinder head. The glowplug engine's glow plug has a pinlike terminal for its center contact, which is an electrical connector for the glowplug. The [...] "diesel" [...] engine has a T-bar which is used for adjusting the compression. The cylindrical object behind the glowplug engine is an <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer</b> or muffler.|$|R

The Clubman dispensed with the unpopular glass fibre enclosure and instead made a feature of its highly polished crankcase and gearbox castings. Supplied with [...] "rearset" [...] controls, lowered handlebars and a steering damper, the Clubman also had a range of optional accessories including a [...] "megaphone" [...] <b>exhaust</b> <b>silencer,</b> a rev counter and light alloy wheel rims.|$|R
