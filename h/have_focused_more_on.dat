500|$|Several reviewers {{commented that}} Elsa was more {{interesting}} than Anna, Frozens primary protagonist. ABS-CBN writer Fred Hawson described Elsa as [...] "an incredible character with a unique and interesting predicament because of the powers she possessed" [...] and expressed the opinion that Frozen should <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> her rather than Anna. Samra Muslim of The Express Tribune wrote {{that it was her}} presence that kept viewers [...] "hooked" [...] throughout the movie, elaborating, [...] "Her character is complex and sympathetic and deserved to be explored even further. Instead the story revolves more around the relationship of the two sisters and Anna who is the typical, feisty, charming Disney heroine and her love trysts—instead of the alluring Elsa." ...|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} of the Flannagan sisters referred to them as [...] "disciple of Lucrezia Borgia" [...] or as [...] "the Borgias of the Slums", in reference to their use of poison and the tales of how Borgia had been known to do the same. Modern {{accounts of}} the Flannagan sisters, such as those by Angela Brabin and the television series Deadly Women, <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the cooperative aspect of the crimes rather than the poison aspect, and tend to {{refer to them as}} [...] "black widows" [...] or [...] "The Black Widows of Liverpool", particularly in reference to the allegation that the Flannagan sisters were part of a larger murder ring.

500|$|Writing in {{a review}} in Asimov's Science Fiction, science fiction and mystery author Peter Heck called City at the End of Time a [...] "big, sweeping, heavily {{symbolic}} tale", and [...] "one of Bear's most ambitious". He {{said that while the}} story could <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the future city, [...] "in the end, the plotlines come together, and the complexities merge into a satisfying unity". Speculative fiction writer Simon Petrie writing in Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine was impressed by the book's [...] "grandiosity to the total synthesis of cosmology and myth", and Bear's [...] "ability to encapsulate a universal future history in just the one book", but found the mix of science, fantasy, horror, mythology and religion a little [...] "incongruous" [...] at times. Petrie also felt that the use of so many [...] "viewpoint characters" [...] results in these characters being underdeveloped, and tends to [...] " [...] the pathos as the plot edges towards climax".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly negative. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C" [...] {{and called it}} a [...] "muddled, tepid bit of television that never really seems to know what story it’s trying to tell". He noted, that while the episode is built around a distinctly [...] "old structure" [...] that harkens back to the show's earlier seasons, the plot becomes predictable quickly. Ultimately, however, he concluded that the episode is compromised by its story which [...] "would’ve been a dud {{even if it had}} aired back in 1993". He did, however, compliment the character of Karin Berquist, but wished the episode would <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> her and Mulder's relationship. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "no matter how good the effects, there's a limit to the number of times a dog with glowing red eyes pouncing on a human can be interesting." [...] The two also were critical of the romantic connection between Mulder and Karin Berquist, calling the sub-plot [...] "an attempt to instill a bit of emotion into this repetitive and formulaic tale [...] fails utterly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Donovan was {{especially}} {{critical of the}} role played by the OCC. [...] "We got tackled by a player standing on the sideline as we were sprinting toward the goal line".

However, if hatred is conceived as a historically formed [...] "schema" [...] that guides action in some situations, then the conception should be taken more seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, {{the festival}} saw an {{increase}} in the number of bands and venues as well as public attention - a transformation that has not escaped criticism. In 2005, the festival included 107 acts featured on 10 stages across town, a number that led the festival manager, to call for a scaleback. Critical voices <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the choice of venues and artists, claiming that venues have been spread too far out and the choice of musicians has gotten safer and less varied. Political interest in the festival has grown with the commercial successes of acts such as Mew, The Raveonettes and Junior Senior. In 2005, the minister for culture, Brian Mikkelsen, proclaimed it [...] "the most important musical event in Denmark" [...] due to its potential as a vehicle for [...] "networking and musical export". However, this attention has prompted questions about the relative weights given to artistic merit and marketability as criteria for band selection and claims that the new focus on big business has alienated the local music scene. The inclusion of by now well-established names (or at least names that were felt to have had their chance of international recognition) such as Saybia and Outlandish was greeted with muted enthusiasm in the music press and occasional hostility from audiences.|$|E
