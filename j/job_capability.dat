40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of {{industrial}} design {{in the formulation of}} technology strategy for certain firms that compete in markets of high-tech consumer products. The initial intuition is that {{the role of}} industrial design becomes more important at mature stages of the product evolution cycle. Industrial design makes products more user-friendly and attractive, which are highly valued by later stage, mainstream users. Successes of such firms are largely dependent on user's experiences of the firms' products. A utility-based concept model is created to formalize four components that are responsible for user's experience: functional performance (how well it does its <b>job),</b> <b>capability</b> (what jobs can the product do), usability (how easy to use the product to do its Cajnobd), aestetics (how externally beautiful is the product). The concept model is then converted into a testable framework for analyzing existing high-tech consumer product trends. A case study on the mobile phone industry is conducted to test the concept model and to understand the role of industrial design in various mobile phone evolution cycle scenarios. 36 phones are evaluated in detail and a survey is constructed to measure "prettiness" of the products. The final result confirms the initial intuition: soft factors of industrial design become more important in determining product success at later stages of the product evolution cycle. (cont.) There are also strong supporting evidence to show the series of product evolution cycles that can occur for a given high-tech consumer product, when there is a dramatic shift in the importance of industrial design. The recommendation for firms of high-tech consumer products is to (i) understand the stage of product evolution cycle, (ii) understand the appropriate level of functional performance, capability, usability, and aesthetics in comparison to competitor's products, and (iii) make industrial design to be the core component of technology strategy for the firm's products. by Arthur T.

40|$|The paper {{examined}} {{staff welfare}} and organization’s productivity, using Patani Local Government Council in Delta State, Nigeria as a reference. The methodology was primarily qualitative and involved use of In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus Group Discussion (FGDs) to secure information from {{employees at the}} Council. Motivational models and conflict theory of Dahrendorf were used as the theoretical framework. The theory presupposes social changes as an inevitable outcome of activities of societal elements, typified in the contrasting positions of the management and employees that could retard motivation and employee performance. Data revealed general awareness about staff welfare among the employees and ability to identify the elements of welfare. There was absence of staff welfare in the council. The working environment was poor, in terms of office accommodation and furniture, paucity of working materials, scarcely available monetary incentives and unreliable health and safety facilities, which altogether reduce morale (job satisfaction) and efficiency in job performance.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the scheduling problem that popular data parallel programming {{systems such as}} DryadLINQ and MapReduce are facing today. Designing a cluster system in a multi-user environment is challenging because cluster schedulers must satisfy multiple, possibly conflicting, enterprise goals and policies. Particularly for these new types of data-intensive applications, {{it continues to be}} a challenge to simultaneously achieve both high throughput and predictable end-to-end performance for jobs (e. g., predictable start/end times). The conventional approach of scheduling these types of jobs is to attempt to determine a best mapping between a task and a node before the job executes, and the scheduling system ceases to be involved for a given job once the job starts executing. Instead, as described in this paper, we define a reactive containment and control mechanism for scheduling and executing distributed tasks, schedule the jobs, and then continually monitor and adjust resources as the job executes. More specifically, a DryadLINQ task in our system is contained in virtual machine and distributed controllers regulate progress of the task at runtime. Using online, feedback-controlled VM CPU scheduling, our system provides a <b>job</b> a <b>capability</b> to speed-up or slow-down progress of concurrent sub-tasks so that the job can make predictable progress while sharing system resources with other <b>jobs.</b> The new <b>capability</b> allows an enterprise to enforce flexible scheduling policies such as fair-share and/or prioritizing jobs. Our evaluation results using five well-known DryadLINQ applications show the implemented distributed controllers achieve high throughput as well as predictable end-to-end performance. 1...|$|R

Based on surveys of 217 male and female officers, results show that male and female officers perceive themselves equally qualified to carry out tasks required in law enforcement, including administration and supervision. This research suggests that male and female police officerswork equallywell on their jobs and there are no significant differences in their <b>job</b> performance, <b>capabilities,</b> and administration skills even when level of education and years of experience are controlled. Historically, law enforcement has been an organized occupation almost exclusively dominated by men (Horne, 1980; Golden, 1982; Lord, 1989; Martin, 1980; Palombo, 1992). However, over the past 28 years, women have increased their representation in sworn law enforcement positions to 13 % in 2000, from a low of 2 % in 1972 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2000). This 11 % increase has been spread over the intervening years, averaging an annual gain of less than one-half of 1 % per year. In 1978, women in the larg-est municipal agencies held 4. 2 % of the sworn law enforcement positions. Ten years later, in 1988, that number had barely doubled to 8. 8 % (Martin, 1989 a), and it was not until 1993 that police agencies on average had reached a major benchmark, crossing into the double digits.
