Farrell appeared on screen and provided the narration, donating his earnings to a homeless shelter in Ireland. The film was released simultaneously in theatres and on television, airing on ESPN2 in a very short window before its DVD release. Farrell received positive reviews for his involvement in the true story.|$|E

25|$|Although never {{a leading}} actor, {{he made a}} number of small {{appearances}} as character actors alongside Italy's leading film stars in films throughout the early to mid-1960s and is arguably best known in world cinema for his role as the store keeper in the Sergio Leone classic Spaghetti Western film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in 1966. His roles ranged from storekeepers and cobblers to priests and <b>homeless</b> <b>men.</b> His role of most esteem, however, is perhaps as Napoleon in Sergio Corbucci's comedy Chi si ferma è perduto in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Housing First has {{met with}} success since its initial {{implementations}} in 2009 by providing relatively no strings-attached housing to homeless people with substance abuse problems or mental health issues. Housing First allows <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women to be taken directly off the street into private community-based apartments, without requiring treatment first. This allows the homeless to return to some sense of normalcy, from which {{it is believed that}} they are better-poised to tackle their addictions or sicknesses. The relapse rate through these types of programs is lower than that of conventional homeless programs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} episode, Nathan {{is sent to}} prison for killing a <b>homeless</b> <b>man</b> with a can of cat food.

Nathan remained in prison throughout the run of the series; the first episode of the second season opened with an Oz parody in which he criticized the hip hop-inspired slam poetry of his cellmate.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the last}} {{published}} pieces by Ludlow was written for the New York Tribune, and published {{early in the year}} of his death. Probably prompted by his work with destitute opiate addicts, the article, “Homes for the Friendless,” advocated the establishment of homeless shelters in New York City, particularly for alcoholics and other drug addicts, noting that the existing shelters served women and children only, and that there was a growing class of <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> in need of assistance. The idea was enthusiastically endorsed in an editorial by Tribune editor Horace Greeley.|$|E
25|$|Carrfour Supportive Housing, {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} established in 1993 by the Homeless Committee of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce – develops, operates and manages innovative housing communities for individuals and families in need through a unique approach combining affordable housing with comprehensive, on-site supportive services. As the leading not-for-profit provider of supportive housing in Florida, Carrfour has supplied homes for more than 10,000 formerly <b>homeless</b> <b>men,</b> women and children since its founding. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2007, a non-profit organization named Back on My Feet was created by runner Anne Mahlum as a running club for <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> {{and women in the}} area, to help overcome homelessness through a multi-step self-help program centered on running three days a week, plus sponsored running events. Participants, drawn from local homeless shelters partnered with the organization, are assigned to different teams within each chapter and monitored by a nonresident member, and are required to commit to punctuality, endurance, self-optimism, team spirit, and sobriety. The members earn incentives through continued participation and progress, culminating in educational scholarships and assistance in finding permanent housing and employment. Back on My Feet counted a total of 400 homeless runners in nine cities after five years, and by the beginning of 2013 counted 10 different city chapters in the United States, with four more chapters planned {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Various {{studies and}} surveys {{indicate}} that homeless {{people have a}} much higher criminal victimization rate than the non-homeless, but that most incidents never get reported to authorities. A 2007 {{study found that the}} number of violent crimes against homeless people is increasing. In 2013, there were 109 attacks on homeless people, a 24 percent increase on the previous year, according to the NCH. Eighteen people {{died as a result of}} the attacks. In July 2014, three boys 15, 16 and 18, were arrested and charged with beating to death two <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> with bricks and a metal pole in Albuquerque.|$|E

Haven for Hope is expanding its core and complementary services available to their families residents and CCSA has implemented a series of Music Together early childhood classes specifically for the children of families in residence to aid in transforming the lives of the youngest of San Antonio’s homeless population.|$|E
25|$|St Batholomew's {{became a}} popular {{place of worship}} {{for many of the}} wealthier and {{predominantly}} Anglican households in the city which typically lived on Adelaide Terrace and overlooked the Swan River. Attendances declined, however, from about the 1930s when many of Perth and East Perth residents moved to West Perth and other more socially acceptable areas. It was refurbished in 1954 but ceased to function as a parish church in 1963 and for a period operated as a refuge for <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> from nearby St Bartholomew's House. In November 2002 the Perth Diocese recommenced services at the church and these continue to be held on the 1st, 3rd and 5th Saturdays of each month.|$|E
25|$|When McNulty {{finds that}} most dead <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> are {{concentrated}} in the Southern District, Freamon puts him in touch with an old patrol partner there who agrees to tip them off when new bodies are found. Freamon also devises a plan to show maturation in their serial killer's pattern and acquires dentures to create bite marks on the victims, thus enhancing the media appeal for the story. While canvassing an area frequented by local homeless, McNulty complains that Landsman barely noticed {{his work on the}} case, but Freamon reminds him that if their plan works, the case will attract more interest and sloppiness could be their downfall. Upon returning home, McNulty is confronted by Russell over his drinking and philandering.|$|E

25|$|The {{homeless}} {{are often}} the victims of violent crime. A 2007 {{study found that the}} rate of violent crimes against the homeless in the United States is increasing. In the United States in 2013 there were 109 reported attacks on homeless people, an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. Eighteen of those attacked died as a result. In July 2014 three boys 15, 16 and 18, were arrested and charged with beating to death two <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> with bricks and a metal pole in Albuquerque. The 18-year-old was subsequently found guilty of second-degree murder and other felony charges and sentenced to 67 years in prison, the 16-year old was sentenced to 26 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Since {{returning}} to council in 2007, she {{has focused on}} initiatives that are fundamental to building a strong Cincinnati and result in enhanced quality of life, a globally competitive local economy, and smart management of city resources. Her Great Neighborhoods Initiative is using the best approaches {{from around the country}} to strengthen and revitalize Cincinnati's neighborhoods by giving communities innovative, new tools to protect neighborhood character while encouraging investment. She is working to develop a 21st-century transportation system that reinforces walkable neighborhoods and increases investment in multi-modal transportation systems that accommodate public transportation, bicycles, and pedestrians. Qualls has worked to ensure that the I-75/Brent Spence Bridge project supports economic development in Cincinnati neighborhoods. She started the Homeless to Homes Initiative to take <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> and women off the streets and help them become productive members of our community.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} groups of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for weeks to come. The art gallery closed {{for the duration of}} the occupation, probably more because of the spectacle of shabbily dressed <b>homeless</b> <b>men</b> juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of high art than for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of the}} occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. But even as the strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E
