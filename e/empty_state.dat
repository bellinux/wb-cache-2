5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher <b>empty</b> <b>state,</b> which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A high {{performance}} soft x-ray appearance potential spectroscopy (SXAPS) {{system has been}} designed and built. Non-derivative spectra (without using a lock-in-amplifier) are measured at a few µA incident electron currents on samples. This is about 1 / 1000 of typical electron currents for SXAPS measurements. A new analytical method to obtain local density of <b>empty</b> <b>states</b> is developed. SXAPS Cr 2 p spectra of a Cr(110) surface have been measured by the system and density of <b>empty</b> <b>states</b> is deduced by using the method. The result is compared with x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra, and a theoretical calculation. The present result indicates that local density of <b>empty</b> <b>states</b> for material surfaces can be easily deduced by the analytical method...|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{advantages}} of light-front quantization is that the <b>empty</b> <b>state,</b> the so-called perturbative vacuum, is the physical vacuum. The massive states of a theory can then be built on this lowest state without having any contributions from vacuum structure, and the wave functions for these massive states do not contain vacuum contributions. This occurs because each [...] is positive, and the interactions of the theory cannot produce particles from the zero-momentum vacuum without violating momentum conservation. There is no need to normal-order the light-front vacuum.|$|E

In the north, now very largely Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and Dutch Golden Age painting concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as genre painting, landscape art and still-lifes, with results that might sometimes have surprised the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this [...] "was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic M. H. Abrams called [...] "art as such", first began to take shape", replacing a [...] "construction model" [...] where art theory concerned itself with how the maker created his work, with a [...] "contemplation model" [...] concerned with the effect of the finished work on a [...] "lone perceiver" [...] or viewer.|$|E

The wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from feeling by the immersion I had undergone since drinking it. They talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our condition, Peters repeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket. Augustus, too, I remember, approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore. Parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come to hand. To this I consented, and, in the first attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk belonging to Captain Barnard. This was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. We found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen shirts. I now went down again, and returned without any success. As my head came above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before I saw them. I remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope never again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent that the stimulus, in the <b>empty</b> <b>state</b> of their stomachs, had taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated.
