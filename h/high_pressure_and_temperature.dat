5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature,</b> much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E

25|$|At <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{the organic}} {{material}} {{of a dead}} organism undergoes chemical reactions in which volatiles such as water and carbon dioxide are expulsed. The fossil, in the end, consists of {{a thin layer of}} pure carbon or its mineralized form, graphite. This form of fossilisation is called carbonisation. It is particularly important for plant fossils. The same process is responsible for the formation of fossil fuels like lignite or coal.|$|E

The <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> environment {{at the center}} of an exploding fission weapon compresses and heats a mixture of tritium and deuterium gas (heavy isotopes of hydrogen). The hydrogen fuses to form helium and free neutrons. The energy release from this fusion reaction is relatively negligible, but each neutron starts a new fission chain reaction, speeding up the fission and greatly reducing the amount of fissile material that would otherwise be wasted when expansion of the fissile material stops the chain reaction. Boosting can more than double the weapon's fission energy release.|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} rest of Madagascar, the rocks of Marojejy National Park were once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which began to break up 160million years ago to form the {{southern}} continents. [...] However, the bedrock of Marojejy formed over 500million years ago during the Precambrian beneath an ancient mountain range that has since eroded away completely. [...] The bedrock is composed mostly of granitic rocks, although it also contains a significant amount of gneiss, a high-grade metamorphic rock that formed under <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> deep beneath the ancient mountain range. [...] In places where heat and pressure were highest, the rock melted completely and eventually recrystallized at depth as granite, an igneous rock. [...] Later, veins of quartz formed in cracks in the bedrock; these are the source of the quartz and amethyst crystals mined in the region today. [...] In more recent geological times, the area's abundant quartzite formed when quartz-rich sands were deposited on the bedrock, and were then buried and recrystallized (metamorphosed). [...] The soil pH is expected to be acidic to neutral.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{temperature}} {{difference between the}} Earth's surface and outer core {{and the ability of}} the crystalline rocks at <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> to undergo slow, creeping, viscous-like deformation over millions of years, there is a convective material circulation in the mantle. Hot material upwells, while cooler (and heavier) material sinks downward. Downward motion of material occurs at convergent plate boundaries called subduction zones. Locations on the surface that lie over plumes are predicted to have high elevation (because of the buoyancy of the hotter, less-dense plume beneath) and to exhibit hot spot volcanism. The volcanism often attributed to deep mantle plumes is alternatively explained by passive extension of the crust, permitting magma to leak to the surface (the [...] "Plate" [...] hypothesis).|$|E
