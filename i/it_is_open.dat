5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention.

5|$|However, {{the judge}} noted that whether a {{discretionary}} power {{is subject to}} any precedent fact depends {{on the construction of}} the legislation creating the power, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>open</b> to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on a public authority out of the precedent fact category, thus excluding judicial review of the discretion even if the liberty of a person affected by the exercise of the discretion is implicated. On the facts of the case, the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held to fall outside the precedent fact category. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E
