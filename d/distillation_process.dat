25|$|Membranes {{can also}} be used to {{separate}} ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane <b>distillation</b> <b>process.</b> This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode.

25|$|Zone {{distillation}} is a <b>distillation</b> <b>process</b> in long {{container with}} partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate pulling in cold area.

Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with number of repetitions of the process.|$|E

25|$|Mezcal {{is highly}} varied, {{depending}} on the species of agave used, the fruits and herbs added during fermentation and the <b>distillation</b> <b>process</b> employed, creating subtypes with names such as de gusano, tobalÃ¡, pechuga, blanco, minero, cedrÃ³n, de alacran, creme de cafÃ© and more. A special recipe for a specific mezcal type known as pechuga uses cinnamon, apple, plums, cloves, and other spices that is then distilled through chicken, duck, or turkey breast. It is made when the specific fruits used in the recipe are available, usually during November or December. Other variations flavor the mash with cinnamon, pineapple slices, red bananas, and sugar, each imparting a particular character to the mezcal. Most mezcal, however, is left untouched, allowing the flavors of the agave used to come forward.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{wine was}} {{distilled}} as a preservation method {{and as a}} way {{to make it easier for}} merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the <b>distillation</b> <b>process</b> led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.|$|E

The influence of the sensitive model parameters on simulation/design is highlighted through a systematic analysis of the models typically employed for steady-state and dynamic simulations of reactive distillation operations. For reliable and consistent simulation and design of reactive distillation operations, a necessary first step is a systematic analysis of the model parameters and the design/operational variables.

25|$|As f {{decreases}} progressively during condensation, {{the remaining}} vapor {{becomes more and}} more depleted of the heavy isotopes, and the magnitude of depletion becomes larger as f approaches zero. The Rayleigh <b>distillation</b> <b>process</b> can explain some first-order spatial patterns observed in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the globe, including isotopic depletion from the tropics to the poles, isotopic depletion from coastal to inland regions, and isotopic depletion with elevation over a mountain range, all of which are associated with progressive moisture loss during transport. The Rayleigh distillation model {{can also be used to}} explain the strong correlation between Î´D and Î´18O observed in global precipitation, expressed as the global meteoric water line (GMWL): Î´D=8Î´18O+10 (later updated to Î´D=8.17Â±0.07 Î´18O+11.27Â±0.65) The slope of the GMWL reflects the relative magnitude of hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation during condensation. It should be noted that the intercept of GMWL is non-zero (called deuterium-excess, or d-excess), which means ocean water does fall on GMWL. This is associated with the kinetic isotope effect during evaporation when water vapor diffuses from the saturated boundary layer to the unsaturated transition zone, and cannot be explained by the Rayleigh model. Nevertheless, the robust pattern in GMWL strongly suggests a single dominant moisture source to the global atmosphere, which is the tropical western Pacific. It should also be pointed out that a local meteoric water line can have a different slope and intercept from the GMWL, due to differences in humidity and evaporation intensity at different places. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water thus serve as an excellent tracer of the hydrological cycle both globally and locally.|$|E
