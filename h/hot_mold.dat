50|$|There are {{two types}} of release agents used in the molding of rubber products. Both are {{silicone}} based. The decision on which to use has to do with lubricity and release. Water-diluted silicon is used when you have rubber sliding over a <b>hot</b> <b>mold</b> (sheets or slugs). The silicon keeps the rubber from sticking to the mold but just as important it lubricates the rubber so it will slide over the <b>hot</b> <b>mold</b> as it is loaded. Diluted silicon typically has to be applied every cycle. Semi-permanent mold release builds a silicon matrix on the mold that becomes a barrier between the rubber and the metal surface of the mold. The matrix is created by the other ingredients in the semi-permanent mold release. Applications of semi-permanent mold release vary from every cycle to once daily applications depending on the compound being molded and the design and quality of the mold. Silicone-based rubber products, however, require a non-silicone based releasing agent.|$|E

40|$|Although Polylactic acid (PLA) {{possesses}} many desirable properties, {{above all}} biodegradability, its {{heat deflection temperature}} is too low for many desirable applications. Similarly, to any other polymers, also for PLA the physical and mechanical properties in the solid state depend on the morphology and crystallinity degree, which in their turn {{are determined by the}} thermomechanical history experienced during solidification. A large crystallinity degree is highly desirable to increase the heat resistance of PLA but is rather difficult to reach during injection molding due to the very slow crystallization kinetics of this material. In this work, the crystallization kinetics of an injection molded PLA grade was assessed in function of the thermal history by using calorimetric analysis. The cold crystallization kinetics (starting from the amorphous glassy sample) turned out to be faster than melt crystallization kinetics. Following the indications gained from crystallization kinetics, some samples were injection molded imposing different thermal histories. The effect of molding conditions on crystallinity was determined. This finding was adopted to develop a post-molding stage which allows obtaining crystalline samples in times much shorter (of a factor about two) with respect to samples injection molded in a <b>hot</b> <b>mold</b> kept at temperatures close to the maximum crystallization rate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{manufacturing}} process of organic friction material used for braking applications is of importance {{with regard to}} their properties and performance. This article deals with a friction material manufactured according to two different <b>hot</b> <b>molding</b> conditions. An original analysis of polymerization of the phenolic resin matrix led to the choice of temperature and duration of the <b>hot</b> <b>molding</b> process. Two materials were developed, changing the <b>hot</b> <b>molding</b> process according to these two dependent parameters, and their friction and wear behaviors were investigated for various thermal severities of sliding conditions. The thermal conductivity was also analyzed and found to be higher when the <b>hot</b> <b>molding</b> temperature was low and the <b>hot</b> <b>molding</b> duration was long. Wear test results showed that friction was not significantly affected by the process change. On the contrary, wear appeared to be sensitive to <b>hot</b> <b>molding</b> temperature and duration. <b>Hot</b> <b>molding</b> at elevated temperature for a short duration led to higher wear resistance because the rubbing conditions were not severe. On the contrary, <b>hot</b> <b>molding</b> at low temperature for a long duration was in favor of the wear resistance for higher severities of the rubbing conditions...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{pharmaceutical}} tablets {{are manufactured}} in large batch operations that have inefficiencies {{associated with the}} stopping, re-configuration and testing between batches. Continuous manufacturing {{has the potential to}} lower manufacturing costs and energy consumption while enhancing process reliability and flexibility. Although there are many manufacturing processes that could make an impact in this sector, I focused on <b>hot</b> extrusion <b>molding.</b> <b>Hot</b> extrusion <b>molding</b> consists of heat melting a pharmaceutical resin in an extruder and packing it in a mold where it is allowed to solidify until it is ready to be ejected. I designed a <b>hot</b> extrusion <b>molding</b> system after estimating the injection pressure and cooling parameters needed to meet functional requirements. As a result, I realized the importance of using a hot runner system in order to meet criteria and be able to produce the tablets. The hot runner allows for the temperature of the melt to be controlled up until it is to be extruded into the mold, preventing pre-mature solidification and clogging in the system. From the estimations and available hardware I was able to fabricate the components for the <b>hot</b> extrusion <b>molding</b> system. The components were then assembled to be tested. by Giorgio Zampierollo. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2010. Vita.

40|$|Composite is a {{combination}} of two or more constituent materials, when two materials with a different properties were combined, it produces a material which has superior properties than a single material. Natural fibers can be defined as a fiber that produces by a plant or animal, which is categorized as a renewable resource. Natural fibers are commonly used as a reinforced such as hemp, jute, kenaf, and sisal. Mostly, they contribute in a lot of sectors such as an automobile, furniture, packing construction and sport. This experiment used thermoplastic (Polypropylene) as matrix and natural bamboo from a “Gigantochloa Levis” species as the fiber of the composite. The first objective of this project is to design and fabricate a bamboo composite specimen by using a Polypropylene as a matrix. The second objective is to investigate the tensile and impact properties of the composite and lastly to characterize the bamboo specimen after fracture. Firstly, the process to extract the fiber from the raw bamboo is to separate the fiber from the raw bamboo culm. There are various extraction techniques, and for this experiment, mechanical extraction technique was implemented by using the Hammer Mill machine. Based on this technique, the raw bamboo was cut into a long strip before were put into the machine, and then the bamboo strip will be grinded to produce a bundle of fiber. After a bundle of fiber extracted, the next process is to mix up the matrix and reinforcement material. This mixing process is very crucial to ensure that the composites have a good bonding. For the mixing process, composite mixed into three different compositions which are 20 % BF + 80 % PP, 30 % BF + 70 % PP and 40 % BF + 60 % PP by using Internal Brabender Mixer machine. After that, Hot Press & Cold Press technique was used to form a composite. This technique started with installing a mixed composite into a mold, and then the mold will be transferred to the hot press section. Next, the <b>hot</b> <b>mold</b> was moved to the cold press section for the curing process. This process repeated for three different compositions as mentioned before. By using this fabricating technique, the composite was formed with a dimension of 3 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm sheet shape. Finishing process was required to obtain the desired specimen by referring to the ASTM D 638 for Tensile Test and ASTM D 256 standard for the impact test. Finally, the composite was cut manually by using Vertical Band saw machine to get the requirement shape specimen for Izod Impact Test and Tensile Test. For the prepared specimens, Impact Test and Tensile Test were conducted by using INSTRON 3369 test machine and CEAST 9050 test machine, respectively. In order to characterize the bamboo specimen, the broken specimens from the tests were collected and the characteristics of the composition are observed under Video Measuring System Machine. As a conclusion, based on the collected result, the increment of the bamboo fiber composition into the composite lead to lower tensile and impact properties. This occured because the interfacial bonding of composite became weak due to less amount of bonding agent. In this experiment, the one and only bonding agent for the composite is polypropylene. Thus, when the composition of polypropylene reduces, bonding agent of composite minimize. As a consequence, the interfacial bonding of composite became weak and easily to fail when force is applied...|$|E
40|$|The use of polyamic acid (PAA) {{precursor}} as interphase in polymer composites {{is one of}} {{the many}} applications of polyimides (PIs). In this work, composites based on poly(ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) and carbon fibers were prepared using two manufacturing techniques for thermoplastic composites: <b>hot</b> compression <b>molding,</b> and aqueous polymeric suspension prepregging using PIs as interphase. Two PAAs were synthesized and used as interphases: 3, 3 '- 4, 4 '-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride/oxydianiline (BTDA/ODA) and pyromellitic dianhydride/oxydianiline (PMDA/ODA). The PAA/PI systems were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Results from these analyses confirmed the synthesis of these compounds. Aqueous polymeric suspension prepregging was more efficient than <b>hot</b> compression <b>molding</b> when the PMDA/ODA PAA/PI interphase was used; also, the interlaminar shear strength of composites produced using this technique was 14. 5 % higher than the one produced using <b>hot</b> compression <b>molding...</b>|$|R

The amount of charcoal flour was gradually increased up to 60 wt%. The thickness swelling and water absorption of WPC panels considerably decreased with increasing charcoal flour content. The internal bond strength and bending properties of the WPC panels significantly improved with increasing charcoal flour content.

The test temperature was set to 200 °C. Before the thermal flow test, powder was dry-heated in a capillary rheometer at 200 °C with a variable heating time. Thermogravimetry was conducted to understand the thermal changes of the powder during an increasing temperature and constant temperature. Fluidity of untreated powder was improved with a short dry-heating but decreased with a long dry-heating. In contrast, steam treated powder fluidity was high compared to untreated one, but its fluidity did not improve from dry-heating. From these thermogravimetry results, the chemical changes associated with component volatilization relate with the thermal fluidity. Therefore, the decrease in fluidity from dry-heating occurred because fluidity related components escape from the powder through volatilization...|$|R
