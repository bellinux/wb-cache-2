50|$|The first Fairlie {{locomotives}} {{later became}} known as Double Fairlies. In general appearance, {{most of them were}} reminiscent of the German-built Zwillinge which saw service on the narrow gauge lines in German South West Africa and other German territories. However, while the Zwillinge were pairs of individual locomotives which were semi-permanently coupled back-to-back, the Double Fairlie was a single locomotive with either a double-ended boiler or two separate boilers with smokeboxes at each end, a central firebox and a central cab, all mounted on one rigid frame. It ran on two swiveling engine units or powered bogies similar to those of a Garratt locomotive, with the cylinders on each engine unit at the respective locomotive <b>ends.</b> <b>Couplers,</b> buffers and, where they were in use, cowcatchers were mounted on the engine units so that they could more accurately follow the curvature of the track.|$|R

40|$|Wavelength-insensitive {{single-mode}} {{optical fibre}} couplers are useful components in spectral measurements {{and will be}} important in future wavelength-multiplexed optical fibre networks. In a normal single-mode fibre coupler, the power transfer between two fundamental modes of each fibre {{can be considered as}} interference between the first two normal modes in the composite waveguide. Since the difference between the propagation constants of the normal modes is wavelength-insensitive, the power division between the coupling arm and the throughput arm is also sensitive to wavelength change. In our new scheme, the propagation constants of the fundamental modes in each fibre are unequal and the difference between them, as well as the coupling coefficient, varies slowly along the coupler. Only the first mode in the composite waveguide is excited significantly, while the second mode is either negligibly excited or is cut-off. Due to absence of interference, the power division between the two arms depends only on the power distribution of the first mode in the composite waveguide at the <b>end</b> of the <b>coupler,</b> which is wavelength-insensitive. If at the <b>end</b> of <b>coupler</b> the two coupled-fibres are identical, then a 3 dB wavelength-independent coupler results...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{more than}} 12, 000 homes of deaf people are {{equipped}} with a system that enables the deaf to communicate by telephone. It consists of a teletype machine hooked up to an "acoustic coupler. " The deaf person taps out {{a message on the}} teletype keyboard and the acoustic coupler converts teletype pulses into audio signals that can be sent over phone lines. At the other <b>end,</b> another <b>coupler</b> reconverts the signals to activate the teletype's printer and provide a readable message. Though a boon to the deaf, the system presents a problem when something goes wrong. It is difficult to pinpoint the trouble because of the multiple units involved-the teletype's keyboard or its printer, the coupler's sending circuit or its receiving circuit. Finding the trouble is time-consuming and it usually involves removing the equipment from service, leaving the deaf person temporarily without communication. Seeking an answer to this difficulty, NASA's Biomedical Applications Team at Research Triangle Institute, North Carolina, circulated a problem statement to NASA field centers. Langley Research Center responded by developing a compactly-packaged portable Teletype Test Unit...|$|R

One end of the cord set {{is attached to a}} molded electrical plug; the other is typically a molded electrical receptacle to prevent the possibility of having an exposed live prong or pin which would cause electric shock. The female connector attaches to the piece of equipment or appliance while the male plug connects to the electrical receptacle or outlet.|$|R
50|$|For a small railroad, the FEMRR {{rostered}} {{a surprising}} extensive collection of passenger, freight, maintenance-of-way and other cars, totaling 168 pieces. Most {{of these were}} equipped with traditional AAR knuckle couplers, but a number were outfitted with European link-type buffers and chain couplers at one or both ends in case they were needed overseas. Adapter cars had AAR <b>couplers</b> on one <b>end</b> and link-type <b>couplers</b> at the other end, whereas foreign service cars had link-type <b>couplers</b> at both <b>ends.</b> The cars listed below are from the 1958 timetable and probably constitute the maximum equipment roster of the FEMRR. Many of these cars, plus a few others that were added later as replacements for worn-out equipment, are still at Fort Eustis in varying states of repair, and several are {{in the collection of}} the Transportation Museum.|$|R
40|$|This thesis work proposes the {{integration}} of MIMO antenna (i. e., two bowtie dipole antennas) with a fully differential 180 o hybrid coupler in the frequency range of 0. 7 - 3 GHz which falls in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band as per the spectrum allocated by International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The applications in this band are Long Term Evolution (LTE), Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), Global Positioning System (GPS), Digital Communication System, Personal Communication System, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and Global star satellite phone downlink and uplink. This thesis introduces a new technique of integrating two bowtie dipole antennas with a fully differential 180 o hybrid coupler. The first part is design of bowtie dipole antenna in the desired frequency range of 0. 7 - 3 GHz simulated using Advanced Design System (ADS) 2009 from Agilent Technologies Inc. In the design of bowtie dipole antenna started with a stepwise design with simple dipole antenna followed by parametric study. After literature study on different articles of wideband dipole antennas finally a bowtie dipole antenna was designed which covers the required bandwidth. The second part is to design a differential 180 o hybrid coupler in the frequency range of 0. 7 - 3 GHz simulated using ADS. Before implementing the actual differential 180 o hybrid coupler started with a design of fundamental single <b>ended</b> 90 o <b>coupler</b> followed by single <b>ended</b> 180 o <b>coupler</b> and by analyzing the results of both finally differential 180 o hybrid coupler was designed and observed the simulated results. The {{last part of the}} thesis work is to integrate MIMO antenna with a fully differential 180 o hybrid coupler and to compare the results of isolation between antennas with and without coupler. To see in which degree the isolation can be improved by adding an 180 o hybrid coupler to the antennas. ...|$|R
40|$|Mitotic {{chromosome}} motions {{are driven}} by microtubules (MTs) and associated proteins that couple kinetochores to MT <b>ends.</b> A good <b>coupler</b> should ensure a high stability of attachment, even when the chromosome changes direction or experiences a large opposing force. The optimal coupler {{is also expected to}} be efficient in converting the energy of MT depolymerization into chromosome motility. As was shown years ago, a “sleeve”-based, chromosome-associated structure could, in principle, couple MT dynamics to chromosome motion. A recently identified kinetochore complex from yeast, the “Dam 1 ” or “DASH” complex, may function as an encircling coupler in vivo. Some features of the Dam 1 ring differ from those of the “sleeve,” but whether these differences are significant has not been examined. Here, we analyze theoretically the biomechanical properties of encircling couplers that have properties of the Dam 1 /DASH complex, such as its large diameter and inward-directed extensions. We demonstrate that, if the coupler is modeled as a wide ring with links that bind the MT wall, its optimal performance is achieved when the linkers are flexible and their binding to tubulin dimers is strong. The diffusive movement of such a coupler is limited, but MT depolymerization can drive its motion via a “forced walk,” whose features differ significantly from those of the mechanisms based on biased diffusion. Our analysis identifies key experimental parameters whose values should determine whether the Dam 1 /DASH ring moves via diffusion or a forced walk...|$|R
