40|$|This {{article focuses}} on help {{received}} by a nationally-representative sample of 2, 376 Mexican men age 60 + in 1994.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{informal}} instrumental help received by a nationally-representative sample of elderly Mexican men age 60 and over gathered in 1994. About half the men received <b>in-kind</b> or domestic <b>assistance</b> {{in the last}} month, while about two-fifths received financial assistance, {{and a little more}} than a quarter received physical assistance. These figures must be interpreted alongside the facts that almost half of the men were still working, over half (57 %) had no discernable health limitation and roughly a quarter were still living in simple family households with one or more unmarried children. The common assumption that living arrangements helps indicate assistance seems valid. When receipt of help was regressed on living arrangements and a number of other socioeconomic characteristics, living arrangements stayed an important predictor. Other factors stayed important too however. This suggests that help is a multidimensional concept that includes, but is not limited to coresidence. Coresidence is neither a sufficient nor even a necessary condition. In fact, many elders who received help, received some of that help from non-coresiding relatives.

30|$|Fiduciary {{risks are}} risks that funds {{are not used}} for the {{intended}} purposes, do not achieve value for money, or are not properly accounted for. Evidence shows that resistance to CBI because of risks around corruption and potential diversion of cash are largely unfounded, {{in the sense that}} risks of theft or fraud in CBI are no greater than risks associated with <b>in-kind</b> humanitarian <b>assistance</b> (Doocy et al. 2016). Fiduciary risks associated with any type of humanitarian assistance in Syria, however, are myriad and substantial. For example, a recent US government report revealed that it did not provide the agencies it funds with guidelines on fraud risk assessment and mitigation, that most of these agencies had not assessed the risks of fraud within their operations, and that best practices in financial oversight are difficult to implement in Syria due to the deteriorating security environment, limited access to PiN, and need to rely on remote management and third-party monitoring of assistance programs (United States Government Accountability Office 2016). Risks that funds are misdirected, misused, or not properly accounted for are not only risks that vulnerable populations do not receive the assistance they need but also that humanitarian organizations are unintentionally providing resources to the Assad regime or Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Limited understanding of these risks and lack of consensus on effective risk mitigation and management mechanisms are likely the greatest barrier to expansion of CBIs within Syria. Much work is still needed to understand system dynamics and reach agreements on acceptable risk thresholds for the humanitarian community and what due diligence looks like in a system that is largely unregulated by formal authorities and exposed both directly and indirectly to money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Expansion of cash transfer programming within Syria will not be feasible without much broader understanding of fiduciary risks by humanitarian stakeholders at multiple levels (Beachwood International 2015 a).|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 113 - 121). International {{recognition of}} the health problems being faced by developing countries have resulted in significant increases in external development assistance for health since the late 1980 s. However, it has been established that this aid has not been effective due to poor coordination, harmonization and alignment. As part of the aid development architecture, donors and recipient countries have defined approaches, modalities and methods of working aimed at improving harmonization, alignment and management of aid for results. One such approach is the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) which involves ensuring that "all significant funding for the sector supports a single sector policy and expenditure programme, under government leadership, adopting common approaches across the sector, and progressing towards relying on government procedures to disburse and account for all funds. " (Foster et ai, 2000 a, p. 6). In Zambia, the health SWAp has been in existence since 1993. The adoption of the health SWAp was necessitated {{by a desire to}} optimize the use of domestic and externally mobilised financial and <b>in-kind</b> development <b>assistance</b> through the integration of all vertical programmes into a sectoral framework that would meet common national goals and objectives. This was after it was realised that the health system was inefficient in its provision of health services due to the existence of fragmented, multiple donor-assisted projects which the Ministry of Health could not effectively coordinate and manage. This paper explores the contribution of the health SWAp to the provision of effective health care in Zambia since its inception in 1993. The study considered the SWAp as both an aid instrument and as a process and the evaluation is made by looking at both the individual elements of a SWAp and the SWAp mechanism as a whole. The study assesses the contribution of the SWAp to fostering working relationships, accountability for finances and progress, efficient allocation and use of resources, financial sustainability and promotion of geographical equity of access to health care resources. The study was exploratory and a retrospective approach was used to track and associate changes before the introduction of the health SWAp and after the SWAp implementation period 1993 - 2005. In order to take account of certain contextual factors in the broad health reform continuum, a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques were used. This includes 21 in-depth key informant interviews, a Focus Group Discussion (FGD), non-participant observation at 4 different SWAp coordination meetings and a comprehensive document review. Study participants were senior members of the Health Sector AdviSOry Committee that were drawn from 6 provinces (including the capital city Lusaka). The actual selection of interviewees was done purposively based on the possession of requisite expertise, diversity and availability...|$|R
40|$|The Umatilla River Basin Anadromous Fish Habitat Enhancement Project {{continued}} to identify impacted stream reaches throughout the Umatilla River Basin for habitat improvements during the 2000 project period. Public outreach efforts, biological and physical monitoring, and continued {{development of a}} Umatilla River Basin Watershed Assessment assisted the project in fostering public cooperation, targeting habitat deficiencies and determining habitat recovery measures. Habitat enhancement projects {{continued to}} be maintained on 44 private properties, four riparian easements and one in-stream enhancement agreement were secured, two new projects implemented and two existing projects improved to enhance anadromous fish habitat and natural fisheries production capabilities in the Umatilla River Basin. New project locations included sites on the mid Umatilla River and Buckaroo Creek. Improvements were implemented at existing project sites on the upper Umatilla River and Wildhorse Creek. A stream bank stabilization project was implemented at approximately River Mile 37. 4 Umatilla River to stabilize 760 feet of eroding stream bank and improve in-stream habitat diversity. Habitat enhancements at this site included construction of six rock barbs with one large conifer root wad incorporated into each barb, stinging approximately 10, 000 native willow cuttings, planting 195 tubling willows and 1, 800 basin wildrye grass plugs, and seeding 40 pounds of native grass seed. Staff time to assist in development of a subcontract and fence materials were provided to establish eight spring sites for off-stream watering and to protect wetlands within the Buckaroo Creek Watershed. A gravel bar was moved and incorporated into an adjacent point bar to reduce stream energy and stream channel confinement within the existing project area at River Mile 85 Umatilla River. Approximately 10, 000 native willow cuttings were stung and trenched into the stream channel margins and stream banks, and 360 basin wildrye grass plugs planted and 190 pounds of native grass seed broadcast on terraces between River Mile 10 and 12. 5 within the existing Wildhorse Creek Project Area. Approximately 70 pounds of native grasses were seeded in the existing McKay Creek Project Area at approximately River Mile 21. 5. Financial and <b>in-kind</b> cost share <b>assistance</b> {{was provided by the}} Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, U. S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, U. S. Department of Agriculture, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Fish and Wildlife Federation and the Umatilla National Forest for the enhancements at River Mile 37. 4 Umatilla River and within the Buckaroo Creek Watershed. Monitoring continued to quantify effects of habitat enhancements in the upper basin. Maximum, minimum and average daily stream temperatures were collected from June through September at 22 sites. Suspended sediment samples were obtained at three gage stations to arrive at daily sediment load estimates. Photographs were taken at 94 existing and two newly established photo points to document habitat recovery. Umatilla Basin Watershed Assessment efforts were continued under a subcontract with Washington State University. This endeavor involves compiling existing information, identifying data gaps, determining habitat-limiting factors and recommending actions to improve anadromous fisheries habitat. This watershed assessment document and working databases will be completed in fiscal year 2002 and made available to assist project personnel with sub-watershed prioritization of habitat needs...|$|R
40|$|This report {{identifies}} {{opportunities to}} improve transit performance using Advanced Public Transportation System (APTS) Technologies, assesses transit operator viewpoints on and experiences with APTS technologies, and proposes how current adoption and utilization practices might be improved {{so that these}} technologies are used in a more efficient and effective manner. The research consisted of three main phases. First, we identified APTS technologies and developed a framework for assessing their potential value in improving transit system performance. We considered three types of APTS technology, automatic vehicle monitoring (AVM), advanced traveler information systems (ATIS), and advanced fare payment systems (AFP). After describing these technologies, we employ the theory of cybernetics to explain their potential performance benefits. From the standpoint of cybernetics, APTS technologies promise {{to reduce the cost}} and improve the effectiveness of a set of regulatory processes by which transit operators and users respond to disturbances in their environment. The categories of APTS benefit thus include (I) cost reduction, (II) improved ability to correctly choose regulatory responses and (III) a richer set of regulatory responses from which to choose. Examples of these benefits {{for a wide range of}} transit regulatory processes are presented. The second phase of the research consisted of a set of seven case studies of individual transit operators chosen to include properties that have adopted APTS technologies as well as those that have not. Through interviews with management, staff, and line personnel, we investigated the properties’ experiences with and attitudes toward APTS technologies. On the basis of these case studies, we generalize about the circumstances leading to active consideration of APTS adoption, the factors influencing the outcome of adoption decisions, and the process of implementing adopted technologies. We also identify opportunities for improving the adoption process, including (I) more explicit identification of the performance goals the technology is expected to further, and consideration of alternative means of achieving these goals, (II) better information about the organizational resources required to successfully implement APTS technologies, and more balanced assistance programs that combine capital assistance for purchasing hardware with other <b>in-kind</b> and financial <b>assistance</b> to facilitate implementation, (III) development of methodologies, perhaps based on the cybernetic paradigm, to systematically identify “information bottlenecks” that hamper transit system performance and that APTS technologies can alleviate. The third phase of the study consisted of a transit operator survey, in which 52 transit operators, 37 of which had adopted at least one APTS technology and 15 had not, were included. The main findings of the survey are (I) AVM is rated somewhat lower than electronic farebox (EFB) technology (which we use as a “benchmark for the ratings) with regard to ease of implementation and satisfaction with vendors, while ATIS ratings are not significantly different that those of EFB, (II) many operators that have not adopted a given APTS technology are actively investigating doing so, (III) most transit operators have positive attitudes about APTS technologies, but do not expect that they will pay for themselves in a direct monetary sense, and thus will required government financial assistance in order to acquire them. We conclude with recommendations for a program that we believe will lead to more effective and efficient use of APTS technologies. The proposed program, entitled MOTUS, for MOdel Technology USer, involves intensive assistance and collaboration with a small number of operators identified as promising APTS users. The program would consist of identifying a set of areas in which performance improvements are desired, developing integrated strategies, often involving APTS technologies, designed to improve performance in these areas, implementing the programs, and monitoring the results. Transit operators would receive MOTUS assistance in all aspects of these initiatives. By concentrating assistance in this way, MOTUS is expected to substantially increase the capacity of participating operators, and others who will learn from the participants, to use APTS technologies wisely and aggressively...|$|R

50|$|The Government of Bulgaria {{sustained}} {{its overall}} victim assistance and protection efforts during the year, though it penalized two identified victims of trafficking for crimes committed {{as a direct}} result of being trafficked. In 2009, the government identified 289 victims of trafficking - including 44 children - and referred nearly all of them for assistance, compared with 250 victims identified in 2008. The majority of adult victims were assisted by privately funded NGOs, although both the national and local governments did provide limited <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> to six anti-trafficking NGOs. The local government in Varna operated an adult trafficking shelter in that city; six victims were assisted by this shelter in 2009. Approximately 100 victims were assisted by government-funded NGOs during the reporting period. The government continued to operate six child-crisis centers that provided rehabilitative, psychological, and medical assistance to identified child victims of trafficking, as well as other children in distress. In 2009, 44 children were provided with government-funded assistance, a significant increase from 25 child trafficking victims assisted in government shelters in 2008. All victims in Bulgaria were eligible for free medical and psychological care provided through public hospitals and NGOs. The government encouraged victims to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; victims who chose to cooperate with law enforcement were provided with full residency and employment rights for the duration of the criminal proceedings; the government reported that no foreign victims requested temporary residency permits during the reporting period. The government permitted foreign victims who chose not to cooperate with trafficking investigations to stay in Bulgaria for one month and 10 days before they faced mandatory repatriation; in 2009, the government granted one such permit to stay for 10 days plus one month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided training to its officials posted at its embassies regarding the identification and treatment of trafficking victims, including how to refer Bulgarian victims of trafficking found overseas to local NGOs for assistance. During the reporting period, the Bulgarian embassy in Spain identified and referred for assistance six Bulgarian victims of forced labor, including three children. In 2009, five victims participated in the police witness protection program, compared with seven in 2008.

30|$|The {{majority}} of humanitarian assistance in Syria and worldwide is provided as in-kind aid. However, {{over the past}} decade, cash-based interventions (CBIs) have become increasingly common. Examples of cash-based interventions include both unconditional and multipurpose cash transfers, cash transfers with eligibility conditions (including cash for work), and vouchers that can be exchanged for specific items, services, or cash. When designed well, cash can be more effective, efficient, and acceptable to beneficiaries than <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance,</b> though the efficiency of cash compared to <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> can vary significantly and depends on transportation and storage costs {{as well as local}} market prices (Doocy et al. 2015; Harvey and Bailey 2015; Gairdner et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|Although {{cost-effectiveness}} {{and value}} for money are increasingly considered as factors in design and evaluation of assistance programs, many other political and programmatic factors {{must also be taken}} into account.

The costs and cost drivers of cash, voucher, and <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> programs may vary substantially depending on the type, size, complexity, duration, and location of the program, level of management oversight and monitoring required, and other factors. In most settings, CBIs are less costly than <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> (Harvey and Bailey 2015).|$|E
30|$|Preferences {{expressed}} by community key informants varied more than household survey findings, though most expressed {{a preference for}} cash. For food assistance, cash was preferred because in-kind food baskets may not provide the quantity or quality of items desired. Some key informants noted a preference for cash assistance in USD or <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> over the local currency because of declines {{in the value of}} the Syrian pound. In one rural area, preference for <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> was due to the small number of shops with limited stock and no nearby hawala agents. Consensus among community key informants was that vouchers are the least appealing form of assistance because vendors will raise prices; however, experience with vouchers was limited, and shop monitoring can prevent price manipulation (Doocy et al. 2016). Local council members expressed a need for more consistent assistance with broader coverage and raised a number of concerns about vouchers, including that vendors may raise prices or force the purchase of certain items, the “hidden” transport costs incurred for travel to contracted shops in rural areas, and the greater ease of sharing <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance.</b> Finally, participants in both community and local council interviews expressed unmet needs for programs with lasting impacts for the community as a whole, such as employment opportunities, rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, and support for small businesses.|$|E
30|$|The {{possibility}} of more sustained, continuous assistance provided through cash transfer or voucher mechanisms negates {{many of the}} barriers faced in providing <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance.</b> Consideration of the feasibility of cash as an alternative modality relies on local-level assessment of capacity, resources, political environment, beneficiary needs and preferences, and lessons learned from previous programs in those areas.|$|E
30|$|For {{the most}} part, donor and NGO {{preferences}} for either cash or <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> {{seemed to be}} driven by their perceptions of intervention effectiveness in a given context. NGO key informants generally perceived cash transfers to be the most effective modality for assisting people in need within Syria. <b>In-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> programs were perceived by NGO and donor key informants as less effective than cash-transfers and voucher programs were perceived as the least effective modality within Syria, not {{because of a lack of}} functional markets or any objections to the way voucher programs are intended to work but because of additional management and monitoring systems that must be put in place to process vouchers and prevent fraud or manipulation. To a large extent, donor policies and preferred approaches for addressing humanitarian needs within Syria are governed by global policy positions, funding approval mechanisms, and reporting requirements.|$|E
30|$|For the {{purposes}} of this assessment, indications for how the use of different assistance modalities may influence the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance were sought. For the most part, stakeholder preferences for either cash or <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> were driven by their perception of intervention effectiveness in a given context. Cash transfers were widely perceived as the most effective modality, assuming currency values remain relatively stable. <b>In-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> was perceived as less effective than cash transfers because beneficiaries may need to sell some items received to purchase more needed items and resale is likely to occur below market value. Finally, voucher programs were perceived to be the least effective modality, not {{because of a lack of}} functional markets or any objections to the way voucher programs are intended to work but because of concerns that voucher programs are more susceptible to fraud or manipulation than other assistance modalities.|$|E
30|$|Staff {{from the}} CBR-TWG member {{organizations}} described {{different levels of}} experience with each assistance modality and challenges faced in implementation; however, none expressed an explicit organizational preference for one assistance modality over another. There was widespread agreement that CBIs are preferable to <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> where markets are functioning. Some NGO informants noted that cash-for-work programs {{are most likely to}} be effective in addressing basic needs in relatively stable communities whereas unconditional cash transfers (if markets are functioning) or <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> is more suitable for addressing the immediate needs of displaced households. Many NGO key informants emphasized that program design considerations like assistance modality and delivery mechanism should be driven by beneficiary preferences and evidence of effectiveness, not NGO or donor preferences. The two donor agency representatives expressed the understanding or assumption that populations in Syria would prefer cash assistance because of its flexibility. Neither were funding CBIs or expressed plans to do so in 2016; however, within organizational policy constraints, both expressed commitments to provide maximum flexibility in selection of assistance modalities.|$|E
30|$|The {{international}} community {{has a responsibility to}} protect the people within Syria and assist them to meet both immediate humanitarian and longer-term recovery needs. As the conflict extends into the fifth year, new approaches that will increase the reach, efficiency, and effectiveness of response efforts and promote resilience need to be adopted. This includes a shift away from <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> towards a blended response including more preferred CBI modalities and <b>in-kind</b> <b>assistance</b> only where necessitated by sector-specific needs or contextual constraints. Cash-based approaches that should be considered include multipurpose (unconditional) cash transfers and cash-for-work programming that can generate employment and livelihood opportunities, rehabilitate infrastructure, and benefit local markets in addition to addressing immediate humanitarian needs. Restoring infrastructure and livelihoods can increase recovery opportunities for households and communities, potentially reducing vulnerability and dependence on aid. Voucher programs should be promoted only in circumstances where less burdensome CBI modalities (e.g., multipurpose cash transfers) are not feasible; vouchers were the least desired form of assistance because they are perceived as more susceptible to manipulation.|$|E
