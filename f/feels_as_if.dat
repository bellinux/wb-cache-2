The youth {{does not know what}} the Grail is, but remarks that as they walk he seems to {{scarcely}} move, yet <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is traveling far. Gurnemanz says that in this realm time becomes space ("").|$|E
5|$|By {{chance he}} then runs into another man his age, {{the far more}} {{spontaneous}} Trygve Sissener, who has fallen asleep in the snow-covered street. The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E
5|$|It is Christmas, and Christine {{is having}} dinner with Marion, Ernie, Fung, Bobby and Adam. Christine unwraps her present to find an album of photos from her life. She says that she <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her life is {{flashing}} before her eyes, and then realises what is happening. Christine sits {{in a car wreck}} as emergency services attempt to free her. On the front seat & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that he stepped into the road causing the crash, and, though he could free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it is time for Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E

25|$|The area {{is named}} either for the 1950 storm that {{supposedly}} cleared the view by blowing {{most of the}} trees down, or for the strong winds felt due {{to the absence of}} trees. It is the only area of the Catskills that <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were above tree line.|$|E
25|$|Vertigo is {{a medical}} {{condition}} where a person <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they or the objects around them are moving when they are not. Often {{it feels like a}} spinning or swaying movement. This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking. It is typically worsened when the head is moved. Vertigo is {{the most common type of}} dizziness.|$|E
25|$|The radio operator's story continues: {{he finds}} himself in a garden home where he thinks he's been before. References abound linking Camões to the Irishman, who <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is being taken over by another. Later, his ship is {{attacked}} near Hong Kong by pirates and the crew abducted and taken deep into China, where he finds clothes containing gold coins— here, Camões and the Irishman merge.|$|E

60|$|The way to {{your good}} opinion, favour, and support, {{has been to}} me very pleasing--a path strewn with flowers and cheered with sunshine. I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I stood amongst old friends, whom I had intimately known and highly valued. I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the deaths of the}} fictitious creatures, in which you have been kind enough to express an interest, had endeared us to each other as real afflictions deepen friendships in actual life; I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been real persons, whose {{fortunes}} we had pursued together in inseparable connexion, and that I had never known them apart from you.|$|R
5000|$|Crowe noted, [...] "We {{wanted to}} do two things for the player. One, we wanted him to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were in a movie, where he could just sort of kick back and enjoy the scenery. We also wanted the player to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he really was the {{character}} on the screen." ...|$|R
25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it {{has little to do}} with the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Erika {{calls her}} mother, stating {{that she will}} be coming to visit. Erika also grieves her father's death. Hilde becomes {{impatient}} with Erika, hinting at the contradictory nature of their relationship. Hilde wants to be with her daughter, yet she <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her daughter is a total stranger. Erika acts boldly and actively pursues her career as a writer. Hilde believes the only reason Erika wishes to come home is to get information for her book, which is true. Hilde is angry at her daughter for forcing her to relive her past experiences; her childhood was full of poverty, loneliness, and shame. Anton had been her way out of the past, and she only wants to move forward.|$|E
25|$|Calvin is {{the third}} oldest of Paddy and Branwen O'Keefe's eleven children, a tall, thin, red-haired 14-year-old high school junior who {{is not the best}} in math but has to study to play on the school {{basketball}} team, {{and is one of the}} popular boys in high school. His mother is a very cranky, tired woman with too many children. Neglected by his own family, Calvin joyfully enters the lives of the Murry family, starting in Chapter Two. He also loves Meg Murry. He shows some signs of being able to communicate telepathically, the same power Charles Wallace seems to have, a technique referred to in later books as kything. He also <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he has been hiding his true self all his life, and likes the Murry family much more than his own, which is characterized by abuse and dysfunctional dynamics. Calvin also supported Meg through the adventure.|$|E
50|$|If {{a person}} pushes {{outwards}} {{with their hands}} against something for a while, then stops, it will <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there is something stopping the person's hands from closing together. Similarly, if a person pulls outwards with their arms, for example pulling their pants outwards, then stops, it will <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> something is keeping their hands from staying at their sides.|$|R

But isn't it strange to {{think of all the}} dead people in there who were once alive like you and me. I don't <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I could EVER die. Do you?" ...|$|R

25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is moving both up and down as well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the hind legs engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as its hind leg steps under. As the legs push off the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the leading leg (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they will be for the stride, and then they begin to come back up as the horse places its weight on its leading leg. During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the hind legs come back under the body.|$|E
500|$|When someone punches you so {{much and}} so hard, it <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> your face is broken. People hit me {{on my back and}} on my sides with their hands and then kicked me.... they psychologically {{tortured}} me; they didn't hit me, but they made strong threats to kill me.|$|E
500|$|Franco has {{described}} himself as Jewish; regarding his secular upbringing, he told The Guardian that he <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he has [...] "missed out on the Jewish experience", but has been told {{not to worry about}} that by his Jewish friends and said in the same interview that he likes [...] "the idea of religion as a source of community". When asked if he was a [...] "believer," [...] he responded [...] "In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question". In 2015, Franco had an official Bar Mitzvah ceremony, presided over by a rabbi.|$|E

500|$|At the 32nd Japan Academy Prize {{ceremony}} held in February 2009, Departures {{dominated the}} competition.

In the Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role category, Hirosue lost to Tae Kimura of All Around Us, while in the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction category Departures Tomio Ogawa lost to Paco and the Magical Book Towako Kuwashima. Hisaishi, nominated for two Outstanding Achievement in Music awards, won for his scoring of Studio Ghibli's animated film Ponyo. In response to the wins, Motoki said [...] "It <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> everything miraculously came together in balance this time with Okuribito".|$|E
500|$|Deodato filmed Cannibal Holocaust {{using the}} cinéma vérité {{technique}} {{he learned from}} his mentor Roberto Rossellini, a style which production designer Massimo Antonello Gelend called [...] "hyperrealistic." [...] Film historian David Kerekes contends that the film's sense of reality {{is based on the}} direction and the treatment of the film team's recovered footage, noting that the [...] "shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and 'The Green Inferno,' the ill-fated team's film-within-a-film here, is no exception," [...] and that [...] "this very instability gives the 'Green Inferno' film its authentic quality." [...] David Carter of the cult horror webzine Savage Cinema says that Deodato's methods added a first-person quality to the film team's footage, claiming, [...] "The viewer <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them." [...] Deodato was proud of other aspects of the cinematography, namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted camera, foregoing the use of a steadicam.|$|E

50|$|Although not all phantom limbs are painful, {{people will}} {{sometimes}} <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are gesturing, feel itches, twitch, or {{even try to}} pick things up. The missing limb often feels shorter and may <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it is in a}} distorted and painful position. Occasionally, the pain can be made worse by stress, anxiety, and weather changes. Phantom limb pain is usually intermittent. The frequency and intensity of attacks usually declines with time.|$|R

500|$|Considerable {{attention}} was {{generated by the}} more sexual image of Furtado presented in promotion and publicity for the album, {{and in particular the}} music videos for [...] "Promiscuous" [...] and [...] "Maneater", in which she dances around with her midriff exposed. According to Maclean's magazine, some said that Furtado's progression was a natural transformation of a pop singer; others believed that she had [...] "sold out" [...] in an effort to garner record sales, particularly after her second album was a commercial failure in comparison to her first. Maclean's wrote that her makeover [...] "seems a bit forced" [...] and contrasted her with singers such as Madonna and Emily Haines of Metric: [...] " [...] seem to be completely in control, even somewhat intimidating in their sexuality: they've made a calculated decision for commercial and feminist reasons. In contrast, Furtado's new, overt sexuality comes off as unoriginal—overdone by thousands of pouty pop stars with a quarter of Furtado's natural talent ... the revamping <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it's been imposed rather than chosen by the unique, articulate singer we've seen in the past." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by MTV News, Ira Madison III noted [...] "The Life" [...] features a [...] "increasingly frantic beat" [...] and [...] "the distorted ’90s house vocals on the bridge". He notes similarities from previous work of mid-2000's girl-group Danity Kane. Jessica Hopper raves about {{the structure of the}} song and its themes of [...] "earned relaxation and feeling good" [...] about yourself. Hanif Willis-Abdurraqib, echoing the thought of Madison III, note similar [...] "Danity Kane vibes", and highlighted the [...] "production and execution" [...] of the song. He noted the more relaxing atmosphere in the recording, compared to the group's past single, [...] "Work from Home". Simon Vozick-Levinson says the song <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is [...] "all chorus" [...] but [...] "in the best way", and also called the verses [...] "effusive". Levinson, like Willis-Abdurraqib and Hopper, also raves about the stressless environment in [...] "The Life", saying it is the [...] "est use of mai tais as a totem of stressless thriving since Jay sipped one with Ty Ty out in Nevada." [...] Hazel Cills noted that the song does not [...] "have that “pass it off to the next singer” feel", but reaffirms her review by praising the [...] "distorted house vocals", calling the recording a [...] "serious banger".|$|E
500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Richard Edwards {{was more}} negative, giving the episode three stars out of five. He {{felt that the}} story {{had a lot of}} interesting ideas but then became standard. He also criticised the use of the sonic screwdriver and the Doctor's monologue, which he felt had been overused too much recently, but said that the episode was saved by Clara. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was also disappointed, saying that it [...] "amounts to little more than series of events and has a more preposterous premise than usual". He questioned the physics and noted that there was not much of an ending and surprisingly found Smith not up to his usual performance. Doctor Who Magazine reviewer Graham Kibble-White also reacted negatively, writing, [...] "There wasn't a wet eye in the house, as pathos run nauseatingly amok," [...] and claimed it [...] "by some stretch the least awesome Doctor Who we've encountered for a long time." [...] He also claimed it seemed like [...] "Cross hadn't seen an episode since the 1980s" [...] and that [...] "even the leftfield mention of the Time War <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it's come from a quick consult with Wikipedia." [...] Additionally, he felt that it could be [...] "mockable" [...] and complained that it was [...] "turning the aliens into a freak show, something to be goggled at, rather than truly met." ...|$|E
