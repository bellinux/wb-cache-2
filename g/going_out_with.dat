The fact that Roy can come between them here is fun – and reminds us that it was more interesting when something could still come between them!" [...] In summary, he concluded that, [...] "is one of the better early episodes of the show, and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Dwight talking to the camera – his hair dyed blonde – is genius and gives us (up to this point) the most perfect 'Dwight' moment of the show so far." [...] Television critic Robin Pierson noted that in the episode, [...] "The Jim and Pam relationship begins to take real shape here." [...] He later called the moment when Roy nearly attacks Jim as [...] "a much more 'real' moment {{that the rest of the}} episode."
