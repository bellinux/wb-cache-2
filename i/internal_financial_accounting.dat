40|$|A cost {{transfer}} is an accounting entry that transfers costs between accounts to correct an accounting or clerical {{error in the}} original entry. A proper system of <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> control with respect to cost transfers dictates that such accounting entries be properly documented, explained and appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, Federal regulations and Cost Accounting Standards require that such transfers be treated consistently across all University funding sources. II. Scope This guideline establishes the requirements for recording cost transfers on the financial accounting records of the University in accordance with a proper system of <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> control and Federal regulations. The guideline also establishes {{the responsibility of the}} Principal Investigator (PI) to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the cost transfers made to or from their sponsored project accounts. In addition, the Departmental Administrator is responsible to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the cost transfers made to or from departmental funds. The University’s cost transfer guideline applies to all faculty and staff who record cost transfers on the accounting records of the University. It also applies to all sources of University funding including unrestricted, restricted, endowment, and plant funds. III. Guideline An appropriate cost {{transfer is}} made when the charge qualifies as a bona fide cost of the sponsored project or indirect activity being charged. Typically, cost transfers are appropriate when their purpose is to: • correct an accounting or clerical error in the original charge • reallocate resources between accounts for reasons other than covering an over or under expenditure of budgeted costs • transfer pre-award costs in the limited circumstances under which some sponsors will accept such costs according to the provisions o...|$|E
40|$|Cost Sharing or {{matching}} is {{the funding}} or costs contributed or allocated to a sponsored project or program not {{borne by the}} sponsor. Cost sharing can be required by law, regulation or administrative decision of a Federal agency or other sponsor. Cost sharing requirements vary by sponsor and between grants from the same sponsor. Funding agencies believe that cost sharing reflects: a grantee’s interest in or commitment to the sponsored research or, the potential benefits derived by the grantee beyond the reimbursable costs on the grant. Generally, cost sharing is applicable to grants and cooperative agreements but not usually to contracts on the Federal level. This is because grants and cooperative agreements represent financial assistance rather than the acquisition {{of goods and services}} required by contracts. In short, a proper system of <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> control with respect to cost sharing dictates that such costs be reasonable and necessary for the project, verifiable to the University’s financial accounting records and allowable and auditable in accordance with sponsor requirements. In addition, Federal regulations and Cost Accounting Standards require that the University’s contributed cost sharing be treated consistently with costs that are reimbursed by a sponsor from an accounting perspective. II. Scope This guideline identifies cost sharing by type and source of funding. This guideline also establishes the requirements for accounting for cost sharing in accordance with a proper system of <b>internal</b> <b>financial</b> <b>accounting</b> control and Federal regulations. The guideline also establishes the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI) and the Department Administrator to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the cost sharing on sponsored projects within their department.

Lacking a critical underlying theory, the FASB’s Conceptual Framework is feeble at best in providing guidance for accounting measurement.
