25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but I could tell by their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E

I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
500|$|Claire Zulkey of The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "In {{some ways the}} episode almost felt too comfortable, with the {{familiar}} story lines and even the obligatory fantasy featuring Baldwin as a former president. The show, thus far post-strike, hasn't seemed like it has distinguished itself too much from Season 1. [...] But <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> so bad?" [...] Ann Oldenburg of USA Today said that [...] "As always, [...] 30 Rock was filled with fast one-liners." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Even for the always politically astute 30 Rock, last night's episode was unusually so." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] episode of 30 Rock had more jokes and one-liners - the kind where you actually smile and laugh out loud" [...] and that [...] "There's no other comedy that's running on all cylinders like 30 Rock is right now." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] was filled not with just great laughs, but also some heart.

500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, Kevin P.

It looks like Fargo, {{and it sounds like}} Fargo. But <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> Fargo in there? [...] All of the pieces are here for a season of Fargo, but there’s no heart.

Then in my next scene I went up to the C sharp and it just stayed there. Christine, the soprano, was walking towards me and her mouth fell open and she whispered to me, 'Wow, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> you?' I've had those notes ever since." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{function}} {{and meaning of}} blackface in the film is intimately involved with Jack's own Jewish heritage and his desire to make his mark in mass American culture—much as the ethnically Jewish Jolson and the Warner brothers were doing themselves. Jack Robin [...] "compounds both tradition and stardom. The Warner Brothers thesis <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>really</b> to succeed, a man must first acknowledge his ethnic self," [...] argues W. T. Lhamon. [...] "he whole film builds toward the blacking-up scene at the dress rehearsal. Jack Robin needs the blackface mask as the agency of his compounded identity. Blackface will hold all the identities together without freezing them in a singular relationship or replacing their parts." ...|$|E

6000|$|EDITH. She got married. When she {{had three}} children--the eldest only four years old--her husband {{committed}} a murder, and then attempted to commit suicide, but only succeeded in disfiguring himself. Instead of hanging him, they sent him to penal servitude for life, for the sake, they said, {{of his wife and}} infant children. And she could not get a divorce from that horrible murderer. They would not even keep him imprisoned for life. For twenty years she had to live singly, bringing up her children by her own work, and knowing that just when they were grown up and beginning life, this dreadful creature would be let out to disgrace them all, and prevent the two girls getting decently married, and drive the son out of the country perhaps. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> the law?

6000|$|The Duchess {{took her}} time, {{but at last}} she {{accepted}} her duty. [...] "Well, if you will have it. You know my ideas. If it isn't my notion {{of the way to}} bring up a girl to give her up, in extreme youth, to an intimacy with a young married woman who's both unhappy and silly, whose conversation has absolutely no limits, who says everything that comes into her head and talks to the poor child about God only knows what--if I should never dream of such an arrangement for my niece I can almost as little face the prospect of throwing her MUCH, don't you see? with any young person exposed to such an association. It would be in the natural order certainly"--in spite of which natural order the Duchess made the point with but moderate emphasis--"that, since dear Edward is my cousin, Aggie should see at least as much of Nanda as of any other girl of their age. But what will you have? I must recognise the predicament I'm placed in by the more and more extraordinary development of English manners. Many things have altered, goodness knows, since I was Aggie's age, but nothing's so different as what you all do with your girls. It's all a muddle, a compromise, a monstrosity, like everything else you produce; there's nothing in it that goes on all-fours. I see but one consistent way, which is our fine old foreign way and which makes--in the upper classes, mind you, for it's with them only I'm concerned--des femmes bien gracieuses. I allude to the immemorial custom of my husband's race, which was good enough for his mother and his mother's mother, for Aggie's own, for his other sisters, for toutes ces dames. It would have been good enough for my child, as I call her--my dear husband called her HIS--if, not losing her parents, she had remained in her own country. She would have been brought up there under an anxious eye--that's the great point; privately, carefully, tenderly, and with what she was NOT to learn--till the proper time--looked after quite as much as the rest. I can only go on with her in that spirit and make of her, under Providence, what I consider any young person of her condition, of her name, of her particular traditions, should be. Voila, ma chere. Should you put it to me whether I think you're surrounding Nanda with any such security as that--well, I shouldn't be able to help it if I offended you by an honest answer. What it comes to, simply stated, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> she must choose between Aggie and Tishy. I'm afraid I should shock you were I to tell you what I should think of myself for packing MY child, all alone, off for a week with Mrs. Grendon." ...|$|E
