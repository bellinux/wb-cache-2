60|$|It {{appears from}} {{what has been}} said, that justice is a name for certain moral requirements, which, {{regarded}} collectively, stand higher in the scale of social utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation, than any others; though particular cases may occur in which some other social duty is so important, as to overrule {{any one of the}} general maxims of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only be allowable, but a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or medicine, or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical practitioner. In such cases, as we do not call anything justice which is not a virtue, we usually say, not that justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case. By this useful accommodation of language, the character of <b>indefeasibility</b> attributed to justice is kept up, and we are saved from the necessity of maintaining that there can be laudable injustice.|$|E

40|$|Neither the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) nor {{the various}} State and Territory real {{property}} Acts adequately address the effect upon native {{title of the}} administrative act of registering an instrument creating or affecting ordinary (non-native title) interests in land under the Torrens system of land registration. The possibility that native title qualifies the concept of <b>indefeasibility</b> of title in two situations is examined in this paper. The first possible qualification relates {{to whether or not}} registration of a statutory grant of land made pursuant to land rights legislation attracts the <b>indefeasibility</b> provisions of the Torrens statutes vis a vis native title. The second possible qualification stems from the Federal Court decision in Hayes v Northern Territory. It relates to whether or not registration of an invalid 'previous exclusive possession act', which is relied upon to confirm the extinguishment of native title, confers an indefeasible title on the registered proprietor in relation to native title. The practical legal implications of classifying native title as an exception to <b>indefeasibility</b> and as a ground for invoking the deferred <b>indefeasibility</b> theory are considered.

40|$|This thesis explores {{whether the}} {{doctrine}} of <b>indefeasibility</b> of title and its three associated principles – the mirror principle, the curtain principle, and the insurance principle – are mythical constructs, and not legal facts as they are portrayed in the dominant legal discourse and in traditional legal research sources. It is commonly understood that <b>indefeasibility</b> of title {{is the hallmark of}} land titles systems of registration, especially those based on the Torrens model, and Saskatchewan is a jurisdiction which operates such a system. When one examines the genesis of land titles systems and <b>indefeasibility</b> of title, Saskatchewan’s land titles statutes and recent court decisions, one discovers that there is a dichotomy between <b>indefeasibility</b> of title in practice and how it is portrayed in theory. Given that land titles systems of registration are statutory creations, it is more appropriate to utilize the language in the legislation and therefore to avoid reliance upon these constructs...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of <b>indefeasibility</b> of title - {{should it be}} immediate or should it be deferred? - has, for many years, but significantly not for the last 15 - been a hotly debated topic among academics of property law in New Zealand. Under the principle of deferred <b>indefeasibility</b> a title obtained fraudulently can be defeated until it is "perfected" by a subsequent bona fide transfer for value. In contrast, the immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> theory provides that registration will immediately validate a transfer, {{even if it is}} forged or otherwise void or voidable. This latter theory was confirmed in the landmark decision of Frazer v Walkel 3 in 1967. Many subsequent critical appraisals explored the consequences of the judgment. However, little academic writing on the topic is apparent in any of the New Zealand periodicals from the mid- 1970 s. Does this imply that the principle of immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> is "set in stone" in this country...|$|E
40|$|Immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> {{has been}} adopted in Australia for close to 40 years. Recently however, and against the {{backdrop}} of economic fragility and global deregulation, there has been a polite questioning of its place. In Australia, some may argue that case law developments and legislative reform have placed <b>indefeasibility</b> under the microscope — in New Zealand, a similar telescoping by the respected views of their Law Commission. This note examines these reforms. It concludes that these reforms do not place immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> under threat. Rather, they modify and adapt the doctrine to fit within the context of contemporary financial instruments. Nevertheless, changes have so far been piecemeal, and its time for a consistent and logical examination of this issue to occur on the national, rather than the stage of each state. ...|$|E
40|$|Immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> is the {{cornerstone}} of the Torrens system of land registration. However, when combined with the apparent ease in which forged mortgages become registered, the operation of this doctrine can come into question. This article seeks to argue that, rather than question <b>indefeasibility,</b> the focus should be on the verification of identity of parties to land transactions. Whilst no system can ever be infallible, it is suggested that by correctly imposing the responsibility for identity verification on the appropriate individual, the Torrens system can retain immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> as its paramount principle, yet achieve the optimum level of fairness in terms of allocation of responsibility and loss. With the dawn of a new era of electronic conveyancing about to begin, the framework suggested here provides a model for minimising the risks of forged mortgages and appropriately allocating the loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of <b>indefeasibility</b> of title {{is one of}} the main features and attributes of the Torrens System of conveyance. It involves the proposition that once a person is registered as proprietor of a certain estate or interest in land he or she acquires a title that cannot be vitiated except as prescribed in the legislation establishing the system. The <b>indefeasibility</b> principle was designed not only to protect title of the registered proprietor from unregistered interests, but also to save persons dealing with registered land from the trouble and expense of going behind the Register Book in order to investigate the validity of title or possible rival claims to the land. The aim was to simplify and expedite the process of transfer of title to land. Yet, almost thirty years ago one William Kaputin, then a recent law graduate of the University of Papua New Guinea, made a scathing attack against the operation of the {{principle of}} <b>indefeasibility</b> of title in his country. He claimed that the Tolai people of New Britain's Gazelle Peninsula viewed the principle of <b>indefeasibility</b> with contempt because it frustrated all their attempts to recover land they lost at the hands of the colonial administration. Kaputin charged that the doctrine of <b>indefeasibility</b> was deliberately introduced in PNG by the Australian colonial administration in order to protect foreigners' land titles, which both the administration and the courts knew were acquired by dubious means. He demanded that in the interest of justice for the indigenous people it was necessary to review the operation of this doctrine in Papua New Guinea...|$|E

This article examines the mortgagee’s position with the benefit of <b>indefeasibility</b> and then considers the impact of the careless mortgagee provisions on the rights of a mortgagee under a forged mortgage, concluding that the provisions significantly change the dynamic between a registered mortgagee and registered owner who has not signed the mortgage.

40|$|In November 2005, {{as part of}} an omnibus statute {{amending}} 11 different acts, the British Columbia {{government made}} several significant changes to BC 2 ̆ 7 s Land Title Act. The government announced that the changes to the title registration system would 2 ̆ 7 ensure immediate legal certainty of land title for a person acting in good faith, who unknowingly acquired a fee simple interest in the property through a forged transfer, provided the individual did not participate in the fraud 2 ̆ 7. In an effort to assuage fears of those who had acquired interests in a system that, if it needed to be fixed, had been somewhat less than secure, the government 2 ̆ 7 s information bulletin assured the public that BC’s registration system was 2 ̆ 7 already highly regarded 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 considered world-class 2 ̆ 7. The changes then were to be understood as improvements to what was already a good title registration system. Whatever its quality, the title registration system laboured with uncertainty over its central organizing principle. Did title registration in BC operate on the basis of immediate or deferred <b>indefeasibility?</b> The difference between the two principles lies in the security they provide the person who in good faith acquires an interest in land based on a void document such as a forged transfer instrument. Put simply, under immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> the registered owner of a fee simple interest is immune to a challenge that the registered owner acquired the interest {{on the basis of a}} void instrument. Under a deferred system the registered owner of a fee simple interest only holds indefeasible title if he or she is one step away from the fraudulent activity. A person who acquires an interest on the basis of a void instrument remains vulnerable to the claim of the person who has wrongfully deprived of his or her interest. The language in the government’s information bulletin – 2 ̆ 7 immediate legal certainty 2 ̆ 7 – suggests it intended to establish that BC’s title registration system rests on a foundation of immediate <b>indefeasibility.</b> If that were the intent, is that what the November 2005 amendments have done? Is it now unequivocally clear that BC operates on the basis of immediate <b>indefeasibility?</b> And if so, are property interests more secure as a result? This article reviews the previous sources of uncertainty in the Land Title Act, outlines the changes to it, and suggests their effect on those whose property interests are affected by fraudulent activity. It begins with a brief description of the manner in which the common law treated forged instruments purporting to transfer an interest in land and then outlines the nature of, and different approaches to, indefeasible title in title registration systems...|$|E
