5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the <b>housing</b> <b>sector.</b> While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E

25|$|In October 2014 by the Linking Melbourne Authority {{announced}} it would compulsorily acquire more than 100 homes for the East West Link. After abandoning the project the Andrews Labor government {{announced it}} would progressively sell most of them over the following two years, but transfer 20 houses to the social <b>housing</b> <b>sector</b> specifically to accommodate homeless people. In March 2016 a group of homeless women attempted to squat in one of about nine houses in Bendigo Street Collingwood that remained vacant, but were evicted by the state government. The action sparked the ongoing Bendigo street housing campaign by Homeless Persons Union Victoria, homeless people, squatters and housing campaigners.|$|E

25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} {{that nearly all}} the Spanish representatives in Congress had large investments in the <b>housing</b> <b>sector,</b> some owning up to twenty houses. Over time, more and more news has emerged about the informal alliance between Spanish central and regional governments, the banking sector (bear in mind for example the recent government pardon of the second in command at the Santander Bank, while all the major parties are strongly indebted with banks, and such debts are extended from time to time) which increased the bubble size over the years. Most regional semi-public savings banks (cajas) lent heavily to real estate companies {{that at the end}} of the bubble went bankrupt, then the cajas found themselves left with the collateral and properties of those companies, namely overpriced real state and residential-zoned land, now worthless, rendering the cajas in essence bankrupt.|$|E
500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} federal borrowing rate for like-term instruments {{as determined by the}} Treasury, but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes. [...] An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the <b>housing</b> <b>sector</b> since the investment would no longer be tax-favored. In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations. The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to municipal bonds. Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through environmental economics and the re-use and re-sale of used goods. Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to legalize as they would otherwise not receive the rebate. Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system, such as social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} a South Australian case study of a period of mental health reform (2000 - 2005) to answer the {{question}} of how different policy networks set agenda and implement policy to ensure that people with psychiatric disabilities have access to appropriate housing. Qualitative methods were used, including interviews (nÂ =Â  31) and focus groups (nÂ =Â  8) with non-government organisations (NGOs), consumers and carers and professionals from health, disability and <b>housing</b> <b>sectors,</b> and participant observation with South Australian NGOs (nÂ =Â  52). These data were supported by a thematic analysis of national and State (i. e. South Australian) policies in mental health and <b>housing</b> <b>sectors.</b> The research indicated that, despite a number of 'inter-sectoral projects' and regional networks, the health and <b>housing</b> <b>sectors</b> were essentially separate policy systems with little integration. It also concluded that the absence of strategic integration across sectors leads to inadequate housing for people with a psychiatric disability. Research participants considered the need for better collaboration secondary to the need for additional housing and support resources and political commitment to such resources. A number of barriers and enablers to policy agenda setting and collaboration were identified. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy and policy processes which will support housing outcomes for people with psychiatric disability.
