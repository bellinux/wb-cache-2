25|$|In other areas, more to {{the west}} or away from the coast, the plates are most {{reminiscent}} of the indigenous cuisine, with many vegetables being cultivated in the area since {{before the arrival of}} the Portuguese. Examples include baião de dois, made with rice and beans, <b>dried</b> <b>meat,</b> butter, queijo coalho and other ingredients. Jaggery is also heavily identified with the Northeast, as it is carne-de-sol, paçoca de pilão, and bolo de rolo.|$|E
25|$|In December, the Pemmican War {{returned}} to the Athabasca District. The NWC’s Alexander Stewart with 22 men seized the HBC’s Green Lake post and confiscated 11-1/2 packs of furs, 1,500lbs of <b>dried</b> <b>meat,</b> 3 bags of pemmican and all the post’s trade goods. They then dismantled the post and carried off the doors, hinges, windows & other useful materials. That winter, Archibald Norman McLeod attempted to starve the HBC posts in Athabasca by preventing their Indian hunters from entering any HBC posts and bribing others to switch sides.|$|E

60|$|Pemmican is {{a mixture}} of about five-ninths of pounded <b>dry</b> <b>meat</b> to four-ninths of melted or boiled grease; it is put into a skin bag or tin can whilst warm and soft.

The skin bags for the pemmican should be shaped like pillow (not bolster) cases, for the convenience of packing on horseback. The pemmican is chopped out with an axe, when required.|$|R

25|$|The autumn hunt {{started in}} August {{and ended in}} late October or early November. When the hunters {{returned}} {{about half of the}} pemmican and <b>dried</b> <b>meat</b> was kept for their winter provision and the rest sold to the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Garry. The hunters also had some fresh meat (preserved by the cold). This hunt was smaller than the summer hunt as many of the hunters, the hivernants or winterers, who had taken part of the summer hunt leave the settlements to pass the winter on the Prairies with their families to trap and hunt.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the main}} causes of the spread of this disease were the {{insufficient}} supply of drinking water, pollution of ground water by human waste, the warm and humid climate in summer, the overcrowding suffered by the black people and, since 1871, the overcrowding of the European immigrants who entered the country incessantly and without sanitary measures. Also, the saladeros (manufacturing establishments for producing salted and <b>dried</b> <b>meat)</b> polluted the Matanza River (south of the city limits), and the infected ditches full of debris which ran through the city encouraged {{the spread of the}} mosquito Aedes aegypti, which was responsible of transmitting Yellow Fever.|$|E
25|$|Circumcision is an {{important}} ritual among the Tanala, {{as in many other}} Malagasy ethnic groups. A range of fady are associated with the practice, particularly for nobles. A noble Tanala mother became subject to a new range of fady after the circumcision of her son. She was thereafter forbidden to take her son for a walk, eat on her own bed or in secret, or consume <b>dried</b> <b>meat</b> of any kind or the meat of a zebu that had been slaughtered (as opposed to having died of natural causes). If she broke any of these taboos, or if the child urinated or defecated during the circumcision ceremony, the child would lose his noble status (an older fady previously required that the child be put to death in such cases).|$|E

50|$|Many {{different}} foods can {{be prepared}} by dehydration. Meat has held an historically significant role. For centuries, much of the European diet depended on dried cod—known as salt cod, bacalhau (with salt), or stockfish (without). It formed the main protein source for the slaves on the West Indian plantations, and was a major economic force within the triangular trade. <b>Dried</b> shark <b>meat,</b> known as Hákarl, is a delicacy in Iceland, while <b>dried</b> reindeer <b>meat</b> is a traditional Sami food. Currently popular <b>dried</b> <b>meats</b> include prosciutto (a.k.a. Parma ham), bresaola, biltong and beef jerky.|$|R

25|$|By 6000 BCE predynastic Egyptians in {{the southwestern}} corner of Egypt were herding cattle and {{constructing}} large buildings. Subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic Egypt {{by the middle of}} the 6th millennium BCE centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture: cattle, goats, pigs and sheep. Metal objects replaced prior ones of stone. Tanning of animal skins, pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also. There are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the Al Fayyum in the 6th millennium BCE, with food activities centering on fishing, hunting and food-gathering. Stone arrowheads, knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found. Burial items included pottery, jewelry, farming and hunting equipment, and assorted foods including <b>dried</b> <b>meat</b> and fruit. Burial in desert environments appears to enhance Egyptian preservation rites, and the dead were buried facing due west.|$|E
25|$|The {{first nations}} guides turned for home {{as had been}} agreed, as did Wentzel, leaving Franklin with fifteen voyageurs and his four Britons. Franklin gave orders to those departing that caches of food were to be left on route and that most {{importantly}} Fort Enterprise be stocked with {{a large amount of}} <b>dried</b> <b>meat.</b> With the lateness of the season the latter point was crucial because Franklin now feared that if, as seemed likely, he failed to reach Repulse Bay, the sea would freeze and prevent him returning to the mouth of the Coppermine River. If so, he would be forced to make a direct return across the Barren Lands, where he and his men would be dependent on whatever food they could forage. There was therefore a real risk that they would be close to starvation {{by the time they reached}} Fort Enterprise; he frequently repeated that their survival would depend on the huts being well stocked.|$|E
25|$|Franklin's party reached Fort Enterprise on 12 October 1821, {{two days}} after Back. They found it deserted and unstocked. The promised {{supplies}} of <b>dried</b> <b>meat</b> had not appeared, {{and there was nothing}} to eat except bones from the previous winter, a few rotting skins which had been used as bedding, and a little tripe de roche. A note from Back explained that he had found the fort in this state, and that he was heading towards Fort Providence to look for Akaitcho and his first nation members. The party despaired. Two voyageurs, Augustus and Benoit, set off upriver in the hope of meeting some first nation people. The rest of the group remained, too weak to go any further. Two of the voyageurs lay down crying and waited to die, and even the normally optimistic Franklin wrote of how quickly his strength was evaporating. None of them had eaten meat for four weeks.|$|E

500|$|Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs {{and open}} {{woodlands}}. They prefer Acacieae, Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands. The Angolan giraffe {{can be found}} in desert environments. Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring trees of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia, which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate. They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit. A giraffe eats around [...] of foliage daily. When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches. Although herbivorous, the giraffe has been known to visit carcasses and lick <b>dried</b> <b>meat</b> off bones.|$|E
500|$|However, dissension {{broke out}} almost {{immediately}} after Bartlett's departure over the sharing of food. It had not been possible to drag all the supplies from Shipwreck Camp, and the trek had taken longer than expected; consequently there were shortages of biscuit, pemmican (a compound of <b>dried</b> <b>meat,</b> fat and sugar) and dog food. There was little prospect of augmenting supplies by hunting birds and game until the weather improved in May or June. When Hadley and the Inuit, Kuraluk, returned from a seal hunt on the ice, Hadley was widely suspected of concealing the proceeds of the hunt for his own consumption; the same pair were also accused of wasting scarce cooking oil. McKinlay records that the circumstances depressed morale and destroyed comradeship: [...] "The misery and desperation of our situation multiplied every weakness, every quirk of personality, every flaw in character, a thousandfold." ...|$|E
