5|$|Faramir {{appears in}} several {{illustrations}} created by John Howe, Ted Nasmith and Anke Eißmann for The Lord of the Rings and related products. One {{of the scenes}} from the book that received many depictions is Faramir and Éowyn's meeting {{at the top of}} Minas Tirith. Eißmann apparently follows the book in presenting Faramir as dark-haired and beardless, also emphasising <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> recovery in the illustration for the dialogue with Éowyn; Nasmith depicts Faramir as bearded and brown-haired.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{returned}} to Australia {{and participated in}} the 1953–54 season, which was purely domestic. He continued <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> strong form against Queensland in the first match, taking 4/56 and 5/61 {{to set up a}} 254-run win. However, {{the rest of the season}} was not so productive; Johnston managed only 20 more wickets in the remaining seven matches at an average of almost 50. He ended the season with 29 wickets at 38.24.|$|E

5|$|On October 27, 2009 it was {{announced}} that Striker would move from commentary on ECW to SmackDown, reuniting with Grisham. The move was made to help accommodate Jim Ross, who had been taking time off to deal with <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> Bell's palsy attack. The following October, Striker and Grisham were joined by Michael Cole on SmackDown, forming a three-man announce team. Striker, however, was replaced in early February 2011 by Booker T.|$|E
5|$|Pressed {{for time}} by <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> {{marriage}} to Emily Lee {{earlier in the}} year, an increase in practice due to the town's rapid population growth and his increasing political roles, Wilson sold his drug store in 1886 to a town alderman, Philip Daly. He then partnered with Herman McInnes in practice.|$|E
5|$|The NBC {{site also}} {{featured}} {{more than two}} minutes-worth of clips involving the subplot between Kevin and Lynne, including Andy discussing his new method of being mean to women while courting dates, in response to <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> failed engagement with Angela.

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> business activities.|$|E
5|$|Allemand {{requested}} that Cotes come aboard Carmagnole, but Cotes responded {{that he was}} unable to do so as his ship's boats had all been destroyed. Allemand sent a boat from his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents. Allemand questioned Cotes intently about the nature of <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> combat and, on identifying Uranie as one of his own squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in half the time the action had taken.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E

5|$|As President of the FA since 2006, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge is a {{frequent}} guest of honour at the FA Cup final, attending the 2007 and 2010 finals, but <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> marriage to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge meant he could not attend. Instead, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron awarded the medals to individual players at Wembley Stadium. Presenting the trophy was British Army Corporal Mark Ward, a lifelong Manchester City supporter who served in Afghanistan and whose bravery was rewarded with the Military Cross. Corporal Ward presented the trophy to the winning captain, Carlos Tevez, after the game.|$|E
5|$|At one tour date in England, the {{tensions}} {{came to a}} head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> despondence, leading to a band meeting where Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment {{to the rest of the}} group. After some discussion, the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band. Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E
5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having narrowed the performance gap on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances and said his team had more motivation to succeed despite <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on form for {{the second half of the}} year and believed McLaren should have a successful balance of their car in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E

5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to {{establish}} {{peace in the}} Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it probable {{that one of the}} Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> replacement.|$|E
5|$|Fame of Zamoyski, {{significance}} in life, endured after his death. He was praised by {{artists such as}} Szymon Starowolski and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, and historians, including Stanisław Staszic, Stanisław Tarnowski and Artur Śliwiński. There were also those critical of him: Hugo Kołłątaj, Józef Szujski, Michał Bobrzyński. Nonetheless, Polish historiography and culture treatment of Zamoyski is mostly positive, and historian Janusz Tazbir remarked that Zamoyski posthumous career was even more magnificent than his real one. Leśniewski, ending <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> biography of Zamoyski, concludes {{that he is a}} significant, if controversial, figure of Polish Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and <b>his</b> <b>recent</b> successes added to his power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated {{with the idea of}} a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E
