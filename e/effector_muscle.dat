50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that both {{activity}} and inactivity of motor unit affect the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic relationship of the neuromuscular junction of the motor unit. The ability of a motoneuron to branch at the neuromuscular junction represents the pre-synaptic plasticity of the motor unit. The ability of acetylcholine receptors to increase and decrease in number on the motor end plate of the <b>effector</b> <b>muscle</b> represents the post-synaptic plasticity of the motor unit. Studies {{have shown that}} with increased physical activity (resistance training or otherwise), volume of nerve terminal branching significantly increases. However, physical activity {{did not seem to}} increase the amount of acetylcholine receptors on the <b>effector</b> <b>muscle.</b> On the contrary, inactivity of the motor unit proved to significantly decrease the amount of acetylcholine receptors on the <b>effector</b> <b>muscle</b> and have no effect on nerve terminal branching. It is assumed that this loss of acetylcholine receptors due to inactivity is a result of a decrease in muscle fiber size. However, it is not known why the number of acetylcholine receptors does not increase as a result of activity or why nerve terminal branching does not decrease as a result of inactivity. Prior to activity based research having been done on the motor unit, it perhaps would have been logical to assume that the amount of acetylcholine receptors nerve terminal branching would both increase or decrease as a result of activity or inactivity, respectively. The cause of the apparent incongruence between the effects of inactivity and activity on the motor unit is not yet known.|$|E

40|$|The main {{generator}} {{source of a}} longitudinal muscle contraction was identified as an M (mechanical-stimulus-sensitive) circuit composed of a presynaptic M- 1 neuron and a postsynaptic M- 2 neuron in the ventral nerve cord of the earthworm, Amynthas hawayanus, by simultaneous intracellular response recording and Lucifer Yellow-CH injection with two microelectrodes. Five-peaked responses were evoked in both neurons by a mechanical, but not by an electrical, stimulus to the mechanoreceptor in the shaft of a seta at {{the opposite side of}} an epidermis-muscle-nerve-cord preparation. This response was correlated to 84 % of the amplitude, 73 % of the rising rate and 81 % of the duration of a longitudinal muscle contraction recorded by a mechano-electrical transducer after eliminating the other possible generator sources by partitioning the epidermis-muscle piece of this preparation. The pre- and postsynaptic relationship between these two neurons was determined by alternately stimulating and recording with two microelectrodes. Images of the Lucifer Yellow-CH-filled M- 1 and M- 2 neurons showed that both of them are composed of bundles of longitudinal processes situated {{on the side of the}} nerve cord opposite to stimulation. The M- 1 neuron has an afferent process (A 1) in the first nerve at the stimulated side of this preparation and the M- 2 neuron has two efferent processes (E 1 and E 3) in the first and third nerves at the recording side where their <b>effector</b> <b>muscle</b> cell was identified by a third microelectrode...|$|E
50|$|A {{motor nerve}} is a nerve that carries command {{information}} out of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and toward <b>effectors</b> (<b>muscles</b> or glands) that will execute the commands. It is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of efferent nerve fibers (the axons of motor neurons) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

Motor nerves are often paired with sensory nerves, which are bundles of afferent nerve fibers that travel from the PNS to the CNS.|$|R

50|$|The {{withdrawal}} reflex is {{a reflex}} that protects an organism from harmful stimuli. This reflex occurs when noxious stimuli activate nociceptors that send an action potential to nerves in the spine, which then innervate <b>effector</b> <b>muscles</b> and cause a sudden jerk {{to move the}} organism away from the dangerous stimuli. The withdrawal reflex involves both the nervous and immune systems. When the action potential travels back down the spinal nerve network, another impulse travels to peripheral sensory neurons that secrete amino acids and neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and Substance P. These chemicals act by increasing the redness, swelling of damaged tissues, and attachment of immune cells to endothelial tissue, thereby increasing the permeability of immune cells across capillaries.|$|R

40|$|Breathing in mammals {{relies on}} {{permanent}} rhythmic and bilaterally synchronized contractions of inspiratory pump muscles.

40|$|Initial studies re-examine {{the role}} of certain central nervous system {{structures}} {{in the production of}} vestibular-induced vomiting and vomiting in general. All experiments were conducted using cats. Since these studies demonstrated that the essential role of various central structures in vestibular-induced vomiting is only poorly understood, efforts were re-directed to study the control of the <b>effector</b> <b>muscles</b> (diaphragm and abdominal muscles) that produce the pressure changes responsible for vomiting, with the goal of determining how this control mechanism is engaged during motion sickness. Experiments were conducted to localize the motoneurons that innervate the individual abdominal muscles and the portion of the diaphragm that surrounds the esophagus. A central question regarding respiratory muscle control during vomiting is whether these muscles are activated via the same brain stem pre-motor neurons that provide descending respiratory drive and/or by other descending input(s). In other experiments, the use of a combination of pitch and roll motions to produce motion sickness in unrestrained cats was evaluated. This stimulus combination can produce vomiting in only the most susceptible cats and is thus not as provacative a stimulus for cats as vertical linear acceleration...|$|R
40|$|Breathing is {{a rhythmic}} {{behavior}} that requires organized contractions of respiratory <b>effector</b> <b>muscles.</b> This behavior must adapt to constantly changing conditions {{in order to}} ensure homeostasis, proper body oxygenation, and CO 2 /pH regulation. Respiratory rhythmogenesis is controlled by neural networks located in the brainstem. One area considered to be essential for generating the inspiratory phase of the respiratory rhythm is the preBötzinger complex (preBötC). Rhythmogenesis emerges from this network through the interplay between the activation of intrinsic cellular properties (pacemaker properties) and intercellular synaptic connections. Respiratory activity continuously changes under the impact of numerous modulatory substances depending on organismal needs and environmental conditions. The preBötC network has been shown to become active during the last third of gestation. But only little is known regarding the modulation of inspiratory rhythmicity at embryonic stages and even less on a possible role of pacemaker neurons in this functional flexibility during the prenatal period. By combining electrophysiology and calcium imaging performed on embryonic brainstem slice preparations, we provide evidence showing that embryonic inspiratory pacemaker neurons are already intrinsically sensitive to neuromodulation and external conditions (i. e., temperature) affecting respiratory network activity, suggesting a potential role of pacemaker neurons in mediating rhythm adaptation to modulatory stimuli in the embryo...|$|R

40|$|The {{neural pathway}} that governs an escape {{response}} of Drosophila to sudden changes in light intensity can be artificially induced by electrical {{stimulation of the}} brain and monitored by electrical recording from the <b>effector</b> <b>muscles.</b> We have refined previous work in this system to permit reliable ascertainment of two kinds of response: (i) a short-latency response that follows from direct excitation of a giant fiber neuron in the interior of the fly brain and (ii) a long-latency response in which electrical stimulation triggers neurons in the optic ganglia that ultimately impinge on the giant fiber neuron. The general anesthetic halothane is reported here to have very different potencies in inhibiting these two responses. The long-latency response is obliterated at concentrations similar to those that cause gross behavioral effects in adult flies, whereas the short-latency response is only partially inhibited at doses that are 10 -fold higher. Three other volatile anesthetic agents show a similar pattern. Thus, as in higher organisms, the Drosophila nervous system is differentiated into components of high and low sensitivity to general anesthetics. Moreover, this work shows that one of the sensitive components of the nervous system lies in the optic lobe and is readily assayed by its effect on downstream systems; it should provide a focus for exploring the effects of genetic alteration of anesthetic sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{reflex system}} of higher vertebrates {{has been extensively}} used {{as a model for}} spinal sensorimotor integration, nociceptive processing and plasticity. In the rat, the nociceptive withdrawal reflex system appears to have a modular organization. Each reflex module controls a single muscle or a few synergistic muscles, and its cutaneous receptive field corresponds to the skin area withdrawn upon contraction of the <b>effector</b> <b>muscle(s)</b> when the limb is in the standing position. This organization principle is at odds with the 'flexion reflex' concept postulated from cat studies. To assess the generality of the modular organization principle we have therefore re-examined the cutaneous input to the withdrawal reflex system of the cat. The cutaneous receptive fields of hindlimb and forelimb muscles were mapped using calibrated noxious pinch stimulation and electromyographic recording technique in barbiturate anaesthetized animals. The investigated muscles had specific cutaneous receptive fields that appeared to correspond to the area of the skin withdrawn upon contraction of the muscle when the limb is in the standing position. The spatial organization of receptive fields in the cat was similar to that in the rat. However, differences in gain properties of reflexes to some anatomically equivalent muscles in the two species were observed, possibly reflecting adaptations to the biomechanics characteristic of the digitigrade and plantigrade stance in cats and rats, respectively. Implications of the findings for the generality of the modular organization of the withdrawal reflex system and for its adaptive properties are discussed...|$|R

This doctoral thesis addresses different protocols to analyze motor gestures and brain oscillations through visual perception. Our brain encompasses a changing symphony of oscillating activity throughout our lives. Up to the time we are born, we are ready to feel and move to interact with our world. Our senses develop rapidly and we start to perceive the world and learn. We visually perceive and process big amounts of information on a daily basis. At the same time we see movements from ourselves and from others in order to communicate and interact with our environment. We watch the world move. Moreover, from the links that exist between motor and sensory systems in human beings we may approach individual motor activity as a loop between a control (brain) over the <b>effectors</b> (<b>muscles)</b> which act, perceive and send the information back to the control source.

The binding of these substances to PFK was indirectly estimated by {{their ability to}} stabilize the tetrameric enzyme. At near-physiological concentrations of other allosteric <b>effectors,</b> <b>muscle</b> PFK was activated AMP-dependently by Ins(1, 4) P 2 (Ka = 43 microM), Ins(2, 4) P 2 (Ka = 70 microM) and GroPIns 4 P (Ka = 20 microM). These compounds activated PFK by a mechanism similar to that established for activating hexose bisphosphates. Indirect binding experiments indicated minimal Kd,app. values of about 5 microM for the binding of Ins(1, 4) P 2 {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 mM-AMP at pH 7. 4. This apparent affinity was comparable with that of fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate and glucose 1, 6 -bisphosphate at identical conditions. The enzyme was also found to interact specifically with PtdIns 4 P (Kd,app. = 37 microM), the inositol phospholipid carrying Ins(1, 4) P 2 as its head group. The regulatory behaviour of muscle-type PFK in vitro and the concentrations of Ins(1, 4) P 2 in vivo (between 4 and greater than 50 nmol/g wet wt. of tissue) are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a functional interaction in vivo. Furthermore, a role of PtdIns 4 P in membrane compartmentation of PFK is suggested. Comparative experiments with liver PFK indicate that these regulatory properties may be relatively specific for the muscle isoform. Unlike muscle PFK, the liver isoform was slightly activated by sub-micromolar concentrations of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3...|$|R
40|$|Motor neurons (MNs) are {{neuronal}} cells {{located in}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) controlling a variety of downstream targets. This function infers the existence of MN subtypes matching the identity of the targets they innervate. To illustrate the mechanism involved in the generation of cellular diversity and the acquisition of specific identity, this review will focus on spinal motor neurons (SpMNs) that have been the core of significant work and discoveries during the last decades. SpMNs are responsible for the contraction of <b>effector</b> <b>muscles</b> in the periphery. Humans possess more than 500 different skeletal muscles capable to work in a precise time and space coordination to generate complex movements such as walking or grasping. To ensure such refined coordination, SpMNs must retain the identity of the muscle they innervate. Within the last two decades, scientists around the world have produced considerable efforts to elucidate several critical steps of SpMNs differentiation. During development, SpMNs emerge from dividing progenitor cells {{located in the}} medial portion of the ventral neural tube. MN identities are established by patterning cues working in cooperation with intrinsic sets of transcription factors. As the embryo develop, MNs further differentiate in a stepwise manner to form compact anatomical groups termed pools connecting to a unique muscle target. MN pools are not homogeneous and comprise subtypes according to the muscle fibers they innervate. This article aims to provide a global view of MN classification as well as an up-to-date review of the molecular mechanisms involved in the generation of SpMN diversity. Remaining conundrums will be discussed since a complete understanding of those mechanisms constitutes the foundation required for the elaboration of prospective MN regeneration therapies...|$|R

After his accident he learned to write with the right hand developing this skill for 8 years. Once he was fitted with the myoelectric arm he began again to write with the left hand.

Using genetic and electrophysiological methods, we have begun to deconstruct the motor system driving Drosophila larval feeding behavior into its component parts. In this paper, we identify distinct clusters of motor neurons that execute head tilting, mouth hook movements, and pharyngeal pumping during larval feeding. This basic anatomical scaffold enabled the use of calcium-imaging to monitor the neural activity of motor neurons within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) that drive food intake. Simultaneous nerve- and muscle-recordings demonstrate that the motor neurons innervate the cibarial dilator musculature (CDM) ipsi- and contra-laterally. By classical lesion experiments we localize a set of CPGs generating the neuronal pattern underlying feeding movements to the subesophageal zone (SEZ). Lesioning of higher brain centers decelerated all feeding-related motor patterns, whereas lesioning of ventral nerve cord (VNC) only affected the motor rhythm underlying pharyngeal pumping.

In Ecuador, my country of origin, this thesis takes part in the good living national plan (Plan Nacional Buen Vivir) for Ecuadorian citizens. Promoted by local government from 2013 this plan has attached to an initiative started in 2007 to integrate the population, support in education and economy as well as implement facilities along the country people attained with handicaps. As the government has raised attention towards handicap there have been some difficulties to take specific actions. When looking closely to physical handicaps development and implemented help there has been a push towards basic rehabilitation and patient management but there has not been any country related research related to new methods on diagnosis nor rehabilitation.

A multiplicity of transmitters are utilized by autonomic nerves, and co-transmission occurs often involving synergistic actions of the co-transmitters, although pre- and post-junctional neuromodulation of neurotransmitter release also take place. It is suggested that autonomic neural control of immune, epithelial and endothelial cells also involves non-synaptic transmission.|$|R

We identify muscle connective tissue {{as the site of}} action of these transcription factors and show that N-Cadherin and β-Catenin are key downstream <b>effectors</b> acting in <b>muscle</b> connective tissue and regulating soft-tissue morphogenesis. In humans, TBX 5 mutations lead to Holt-Oram syndrome, which is characterized by forelimb musculoskeletal defects.

A critical mediator of cell-cycle transitions, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. Although the APC/C has been detected in several differentiated cell types, a functional role for the complex in postmitotic cells has been elusive. We describe a novel postmitotic role for the APC/C at Drosophila neuromuscular synapses: independent regulation of synaptic growth and synaptic transmission. In neurons, the APC/C controls synaptic size via a downstream <b>effector</b> Liprin-α; in <b>muscles,</b> the APC/C regulates synaptic transmission, controlling the concentration of a postsynaptic glutamate receptor...|$|R
40|$|A general {{model of}} the {{autonomic}} neuroeffector junction is proposed. In this model, {{emphasis is placed on}} the <b>muscle</b> <b>effector</b> bundle with electrotonic coupling between individual cells via gap junctions (or nexuses) and en passage release of transmitter from autonomic nerve varicosities. This release results in transmission to effector cells across junctional clefts ranging from about 20 nm in the vas deferens and iris to as much as 2000 nm in some large arteries. The ultrastructural identification of different autonomic nerve types is described. Current theories on the synthesis, storage, release, and inactivation of transmitter during cholinergic, adrenergic, and purinergic transmission are summarized. Some speculations are made about the possible involvement of purinergic nerves in the innervation of vessels and mast cells in the skin, and whether this involvement results in a functional link between ATP, histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandin in cutaneous vasodilatation. Another possibility considered as the basis for this reflex is the release of substance P from sensory (pain) nerve collaterals in the skin...|$|R
