5|$|The {{interlocking}} GT logo {{was created}} in 1967 {{at the request of}} Bobby Dodd. One of the varsity players was asked to design a logo for the helmets. Several variations of the design were submitted, including a yellow jacket design. The yellow <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> not submitted because to make the insect look mean {{it would have to be}} stinging and therefore flying backwards. The interlocking GT was selected during the summer of 1967 and formalized into decals for the helmets. Over the years it became the official logo for Georgia Tech Athletics.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, McNair's {{idea for}} a Yellow <b>Jacket</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was {{apparently}} unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellow jacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student, {{a few weeks later}} simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans naturally believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980 this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E
5|$|The green {{jacket is}} only {{allowed to be}} removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always {{followed}} the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket); Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedreña, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inner and}} outer <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> woven separately. The inner <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> woven to a {{slightly}} smaller diameter {{so that it will}} fit inside the outer jacket.

50|$|A <b>jacket</b> <b>is</b> a mid-stomach-length garment for {{the upper}} body. A jacket {{typically}} has sleeves, and fastens in the front or slightly on the side.

50|$|The MA-1 bomber jacket (also {{known as}} the MA-1 flight <b>jacket)</b> <b>is</b> an American {{military}} <b>jacket</b> which <b>was</b> first developed in the mid 1950s. The MA-1 and its predecessor, the B-15 flight <b>jacket,</b> <b>were</b> originally developed and needed at that time because {{the emergence of the}} Jet Age created new requirements for pilot performance, safety, and comfort.|$|R
5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform <b>jacket</b> <b>was</b> the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed jacket, looking much like a pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with collar and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's mascot Buzz got {{his start}} in the 1970s. The {{original}} Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket mascot was Judi McNair who donned a homemade yellowjacket costume in 1972 and performed at home football games. She rode on the Ramblin' Wreck and appears in the 1972 Georgia Tech Blueprint yearbook. McNair's mascot was considered a great idea, {{as it was a}} big hit with the fans. In 1979, McNair's idea for a Yellow <b>Jacket</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland.

50|$|In 1922, the Western Cartridge Company {{introduced}} a copper-washed bullet jacketing called Lubaloy {{which stands for}} lubricating alloy. Lubaloy replaced standard bullet <b>jacketing</b> which had <b>been</b> cupro-nickel coated steel or solid cupro-nickel. The original <b>jacketing</b> <b>was</b> found to be detrimental to firearm performance over time. Lumps of the hot <b>jacketing</b> <b>were</b> deposited {{near the end of}} the barrel during firing, eventually creating a hazard or destroying the barrel. The Lubaloy-Palma ammunition <b>jacketing</b> <b>was</b> a breakthrough solution to this persistent dilemma. It was composed of 90% copper, 8% zinc, and 2% tin.|$|R

Finally, in specimen J-SJ 3, the free ends of the steel <b>jackets</b> <b>were</b> welded together.|$|R

40|$|This paper proposescompatibility as an additionalvariable or {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to lifesaving performance of life jackets. In order to support the proposal, a model and seven hypotheses were developed based on previous literatures and accidents reports. The hypotheses are compatibility of life jackets with CPV contributes to the lifesaving performance of a life jacket (H 1); Inherently buoyant life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> not compatible to don inside the fully enclosed spaces of CPV (H 2); Inherently buoyant life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don in open spaces of CPV (H 3), Inherently buoyant life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don inside the partially enclosed spaces of CPV (H 4), Inflatable life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don inside the fully enclosed space of CPV (H 5),: Inflatable life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don in open space of CPV (H 6); and Inflatable life <b>jackets</b> <b>are</b> compatible to don inside the partially enclosed spaces of CPV (H 7). Verification of the hypotheses and model was based on opinion fromthree groups of maritime professional. The opinionswere gathered by a survey questionnaire, and the response was using a five-point Likert Scale. The development of the survey questionnaires were according to standards of IMO. The performed analyses were descriptive analysis, variance analysis, exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis. Based on the result, the proposed model and hypotheses were supported...|$|R

25|$|Semi-dress/walking-out uniform (Ausgangsuniform) – With a few details, the semi-dress uniform was {{the same}} for all ranks and was worn for walking-out {{purposes}} (i.e. off-duty and off-post). It consisted of a single-breasted tunic without belt, a silver-gray shirt with dark-gray tie, the service cap, long trousers, and black low-quarter shoes. Officers also wore the tunic with a white shirt. During periods of warm weather, there was the option of omitting the tunic, and furthermore omitting the tie.
