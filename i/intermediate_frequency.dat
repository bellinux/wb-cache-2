As a German invasion of the west loomed in 1940, the British contacted Philips and arranged a plan to remove the company's board of directors to the UK, along with 25,000 more EF50s and another 250,000 bases, onto which Mullard, Philip's UK subsidiary, could build complete tubes. A destroyer, , was dispatched {{to pick them up}} in May, and left the Netherlands only days before the German invasion on 15 May 1940.

5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|Image {{rejection}} is {{an important}} factor in choosing the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> of a receiver.

25|$|A {{superheterodyne}} receiver, often shortened to superhet, {{is a type}} {{of radio}} receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency.

25|$|In electronics, a {{superheterodyne}} receiver uses frequency mixing or heterodyning to convert a received signal to a fixed <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency,</b> {{which can be}} more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency.

25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the {{superheterodyne receiver}} {{is the problem}} of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input frequency equal to the station frequency plus twice the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency.</b> The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the RF amplifier filter of the superheterodyne receiver.|$|E
25|$|The range {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a single}} half-wave dipole mounted at {{the middle of the}} horizontal antenna array, fed into a four-tube RF receiver, and then into a four-tube <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> (IF) system. The output was fed directly into the lower Y-axis plate of one of the two CRTs. The upper plate on the Y-axis was fed the output of a calibrator, allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically.

25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency.</b> FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of terminal units designed by W6FFC, such as the TT/L-2, ST-3, ST-5, and ST-6.

40|$|International audienceCommonly {{isolated}} carbon nanotubes {{in suspension}} have been modelled as a perfectly straight structure. Nevertheless, single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) contain naturally side-wall defects and, in consequence, natural bent configurations. Hence, a semi-flexile filament {{model with a}} natural bent configuration was proposed to represent physically the SWNT structure. This continuous model was discretized as a non-freely jointed multi-bead–rod system with a natural bent configuration. Using a Brownian dynamics algorithm the dynamical mechanical contribution to the linear viscoelastic response of naturally bent SWNTs in dilute suspension was simulated. The dynamics of such system shows the apparition of new relaxation processes at <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequencies</b> characterized mainly by the activation of a mild elasticity.

25|$|Usually the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is lower}} than the {{reception}} frequency fRF, but in some modern receivers (e.g. scanners and spectrum analyzers) a higher IF frequency is used to minimize problems with image rejection or gain the benefits of fixed-tuned stages. The Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver covers 10kHz to 30MHz. It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the input to a first IF of 81.4MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4MHz, so the primary images are far away. The first IF stage uses a crystal filter with a 12kHz bandwidth. There is a second frequency conversion (making a triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4MHz first IF with 80MHz to create a 1.4MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second IF is not a major problem because the first IF provides adequate image rejection and the second mixer is fixed tuned.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a television receiver designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> stage of a superheterodyne system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this should be just as easily adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts pulse-to-pulse, and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency step-down like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After trying a variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E

Gerald Touch, originally from the Clarendon Laboratory, converted the EMI receiver to this wavelength by using the existing set as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> (IF) stage of a superheterodyne circuit. The original 45MHz frequency would remain the IF setting for many following radar systems. On its first test on 17 August, Anson K6260 with Touch and Keith Wood aboard immediately detected shipping in the English Channel at a range of [...] The team later increased the wavelength slightly to 1.5m to improve sensitivity of the receiver, and this 200MHz setting would be common to many radar systems of this era.|$|E

500|$|The {{first volume}} {{production}} of mechanical filters was undertaken by Collins Radio Company {{starting in the}} 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone frequency-division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of guard band, which in turn leads {{to the ability to}} squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable. [...] This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason. [...] Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio <b>intermediate</b> <b>frequency</b> (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, amateur radio and the like) manufactured by Collins. [...] They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent LC filter. [...] High Q allows filters to be designed which have high selectivity, important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers. [...] They also had an advantage in stability over both LC filters and monolithic crystal filters. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500kHz band.|$|E
