5|$|Despite {{never having}} heard of female doctors, {{from an early}} age Mayo had been set on {{pursuing}} a career <b>in</b> <b>medicine.</b> However, Edward Rennie, then a professor at the University of Adelaide advised Helen's father that she was too young to commence study <b>in</b> <b>Medicine,</b> so in 1896, Mayo enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Adelaide. The death of her younger sister Olive {{at the end of her}} first year of study meant that Mayo was unable to sit her final exams for that year, and when she repeated her first year in 1897, she failed two of her five subjects (Latin and Greek). Having gained her father's permission, Mayo enrolled <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> in 1898. She was a distinguished medicine student, coming top of her class and winning the Davis Thomas scholarship and the Everard Scholarship in her fourth and fifth years of study, respectively.|$|E
