40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{penetration}} depth and the installing method of screw (with drill and without drill) on withdrawal resistance in face and edge of wood plastic panel were investigated. To meet this objective, the wood plastic panels from the malach choob factory with density of 1. 017 gr/cm 3 and 100 × 100 × 1. 4 cm 3 indimension were prepared, and for withdrawal resistance test the screw with 3 mm in diameter and 2. 5 mm in length were used. Then, the samples with dimension of 2 × 6 × 1. 6 cm 3 according to Iranian national standard (No: 7416) were selected and the screw joint in face and edge of panels according to variables including penetration <b>depth</b> of <b>screw</b> (6, 9 and 12 mm) and penetration type of screw (with drill and without drill) was done and the withdrawal resistance were measured on the samples. The {{results indicated that the}} withdrawal resistance of screw in wood plastic panels increases with increase of penetration <b>depth</b> of <b>screw</b> from 6 to 12 mm. Also, because of fibre compression and high density, the face of panels had higher withdrawal resistance of screw as compared with edge of them.

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{predicting}} bending moment resistance plywood of screw (coarse and fine threads) joints using regression models. Thickness {{of the member}} was 19 mm and compared with medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard with 18 mm thicknesses. Two types of screws including coarse and fine thread drywall screw with nominal diameters of 6, 8 and 10 mm and 3. 5, 4 and 5 cm length respectively and sheet metal screw with diameters of 8 and 10 and length of 4 cm were used. The {{results of the study}} have shown that bending moment resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws diameter and penetrating <b>depth.</b> <b>Screw</b> Length was found to have a larger influence on bending moment resistance than screw diameter. Bending moment resistance with coarse thread drywall screws was higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. The highest bending moment resistance (71. 76 N. m) was observed in joints made with coarse screw which were 5 mm in diameter and 28 mm in depth of penetration. The lowest bending moment resistance (12. 08 N. m) was observed in joints having fine screw with 3. 5 mm diameter and 9 mm penetrations. Furthermore, bending moment resistance in plywood was higher than those of medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard. Finally, it has been found that the ultimate bending moment resistance of plywood joint can be predicted following formula Wc = 0. 189 ×D 0. 726 ×P 0. 577 for coarse thread drywall screws and Wf = 0. 086 ×D 0. 942 ×P 0. 704 for fine ones according to diameter and penetrating depth.

40|$|When {{assessing}} existing timber structures it is {{not possible}} to obtain density as the ratio mass/volume, so nondestructive probing methods are used to predict density. As in other nondestructive techniques, moisture content influences measurements. The goal of this paper is to study the influence of timber moisture content on two nondestructive probing techniques (penetration resistance and pullout resistance). 25 large cross section specimens of laricio pine from Spain were measured. The moisture content ranged from 65. 1 % to 8. 3 %. Penetration <b>depth</b> decreases and <b>screw</b> withdrawal strength increases when moisture content decreases below the fiber saturation point. There are lineal tendencies in both techniques. No moisture content influence was found in measures above fiber saturation point...|$|R
40|$|The field {{distributions}} and eigenfrequencies of {{a microwave}} resonator which {{is composed of}} 20 identical cells have been measured. With external screws the periodicity of the cavity can be perturbed arbitrarily. If the perturbation is increased a transition from extended to localized field distributions is observed. For very large perturbations the field distributions show signatures of Anderson localization, while for smaller perturbations the field distribution is extended or weakly localized. The localization length of a strongly localized field distribution can be varied by adjusting the penetration <b>depth</b> of the <b>screws.</b> Shifts in the frequency spectrum of the resonator provide further evidence for Anderson localization.

30|$|Despite {{the absence}} of visible impact craters {{on the surface of}} RB-QD 04 - 0042, the dust {{particle}} is heavily fractured on one side, and only below this surface, distinct signs of shock metamorphism were detected by TEM. Based on the penetration <b>depth</b> of [001] <b>screw</b> dislocations in olivine and their propagation velocity, we estimate the pulse duration of the shock wave to be less than 10 ns, indicating that the particle was involved in a small-scale impact. The fractured concave surface and the exposure of a sulfide-metal aggregate {{on one side of the}} regolith particle suggest that either material was spalled off the surface or that the particle represents a spallation fragment resulting from the collisional fragmentation of a larger regolith particle.|$|R

In {{order to}} enhance design {{reliability}} of a co-rotating twin screw pulping extruder (TSPE), optimum design on screw {{parameters of the}} TSPE was studied based on the extrusion model.

50|$|If the hub has no {{freewheel}} mechanism {{built into}} it, then a front freewheel is required, which <b>screws</b> onto the <b>crank.</b> These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes {{and use the}} same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX freewheels weren't strong enough for trials use {{and for this reason}} trials specific freewheels were designed. Trials freewheels are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the freewheel must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the freewheel will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a ratchet with 120 teeth and small ratchet pawls to engage them, the ratchet ring has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 ratchet pawls at a time, with 9 in total in the freewheel. Each set of 3 pawls is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical pawls with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the pawls or by having the pawls in each set of 3 pawls shorter or longer than the other sets of 3.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Minimally {{invasive}} sacroiliac (SI) {{screw fixation}} carries {{a high risk}} for implant malposition. Only idealised shape conceptions of the safe bony corridor exist. METHODS: Two SI corridor models were generated based on a 3 D CT reconstruction of a human pelvis. Therefore two penetration <b>depths</b> of the <b>screws</b> into the sacrum were defined. RESULTS: By inserting screws into {{the centre of the}} first sacral body an osseous volume of 121 cm(3) and an iliac entrance area of 53 cm(2) were utilizable. Screw positioning beyond the opposite sacral isthmus leads to a reduction of the bony volume to 72 cm(3) (60 %) and a decrease of the iliac screw entrance to 20 cm(2) (38 %). CONCLUSION: The computed realistic 3 D models provide exact references to confining bone structures for safe screw positions. The implementation of a software algorithm for fully automated calculation of such volumes based on fluoroscopic or CT images could enhance the performance of computer-assisted navigation systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} {{awareness of the environment}} and the growing energy needs of countries like China and India have accelerated the search for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel energy sources. Generating electricity from ocean waves is a viable alternative. This is because energy densities are sufficient to supplement the grid and thus make it economically viable. The seasonal supply profile also matches the demand profile. There are currently many different devices operating on different principles, the most promising of these is the oscillating body device using a linear generator. Linear generators are able to convert linear motion into electrical energy without the need for intermediate gears, <b>screws</b> or <b>crank</b> shafts. This increases the overall efficiency and makes the device more reliable. Static force simulations were done on a novel linear generator design. The generator combines the duel air-gap of a double sided topology with the encapsulation of the magnetic field in a tubular topology. This results in an increased force density, but also large cogging forces. The cogging forces consist of end-effects cogging forces that are caused by the interaction of the Permanent Magnets (PMs) with the stator ends, as well as cogging forces which are due to the interaction of the PMs and stator slots. The topic of this thesis is to find suitable methods of reducing the cogging forces. The end-effect forces were reduced by changing the stator length and altering the stator ends shape. Creating a quadratic b’ezier curve end shape and optimising the stator length reduced the end-effect cogging force from 630 N to 7 N. The slot cogging forces were reduced by dividing the PMs into two sections and to shift the outer PMs by one slot pitch relative to the inner PMs. This resulted in a decrease from 663 N to 25 N. However, a compromise needs to be made between reducing the cogging forces and not reducing the machine performance. Increasing the stator length increases the machine volume and dividing the magnets reduces the thrust force. This needs {{to be taken into account}} when designing a new machine...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. The {{pull-out}} {{strength of}} sacral screw fixation after cyclic loading {{was tested using}} young human cadaveric specimens. Objectives. To evaluate the effects of fatigue loading on the pull-out strength of medial and lateral unicortical and bicortical sacral screws and to correlate the pull-out strength with sacral bone density and the screw insertion torque. Summary of Background Data. The immediate biomechanical effects of <b>depth</b> of penetration, <b>screw</b> orientation, and bone density on sacral screw fixation have been studied in aged cadaveric specimens. The effect of cyclic loading on the pull-out strength of sacral screw fixation is unknown, however, and data from young specimens is rare. Methods. Eleven fresh specimens of human sacrum were used in this study. Bone mineral density at the vertebral body and the ala were determined by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Seven-millimeter compact Cotrel-Dubousset sacral screws were inserted into the sacrum anteromedially and anterolaterally, both unicortically and bicortically, and the insertion torque for each screw was measured. Cyclic loading from 40 to 400 N was applied to each screw at a frequency of 2 Hz up to 20, 000 cycles. Pull-out tests were conducted after completion of the fatigue tests. Results. The average bone density was 0. 38 ± 0. 08 g/mL at the S 1 body and 0. 24 ± 0 05 g/mL at the S 1 ala. The insertion torque and average pull-out force after cyclic loading were significantly higher for bicortical fixation than for unicortical fixation for a particular screw alignment. The pull-out strength and insertion torque of medially oriented fixation was always higher than that for lateral fixation, however, {{regardless of whether the}} insertion was unicortical or bicortical. The pull-out force of unicortical and bicortical medial screw fixations after cyclic loading showed significant linear correlations with both the insertion torque and the bone mineral density of the S 1 body. Conclusions. In a young population, screw orientation (anterolateral or anteromedial) was more important in determining pull-out strength than <b>screw</b> <b>depth</b> (unicortical or bicortical) after fatigue loading, anteromedially directed screws being significantly stronger than laterally placed screws. Bone mineral density of the S 1 body andinsertion torque were good preoperative and intraoperative indicators of screw pull-out strength. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Load bearing LSF {{walls are}} {{commonly}} made of cold-formed steel frames, gypsum plasterboards and insulation, and their fire performance {{is an important}} aspect of design. Many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the fire performance of LSF walls at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). These studies have shown that increasing the number or thickness or quality of gypsum plasterboards has improved the fire resistance ratings (FRR) of LSF walls while the use of cavity insulation has reduced their FRR. Therefore new LSF wall systems with external insulation sandwiched between two layers of plasterboards were proposed, which provided higher FRR than cavity insulated walls. There are also other parameters that can improve the fire performance of LSF walls such as the steel type, stud geometry and <b>depth,</b> type of <b>screw</b> fasteners used, joints in the plasterboard and the plasterboard fall off time. This paper presents a review of the fire performance of LSF walls as a function of these parameters based on our research at QUT. Their effects on both the thermal and structural performance of LSF walls are discussed in detail and suitable improvements are recommended, for example, improved plasterboard joint types...|$|R
