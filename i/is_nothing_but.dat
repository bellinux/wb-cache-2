Led by him, they perform remarkably well in combat, and manage to rescue Archer, Tucker, and Kessick. Enterprise then leaves orbit just as the warships arrive. Unfortunately, Kessick dies, but not before providing coordinates for the Xindi homeworld. When the ship reaches this position, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a 100-year-old field of space debris.|$|E

25|$|In {{some special}} cases, the stackification can be {{described}} in terms of torsors for affine group schemes or the generalizations. In fact, according to this point of view, a stack in groupoids <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a category of torsors, and a prestack a category of trivial torsors, which are local models of torsors.|$|E
25|$|According to Rajneesh {{every human}} being is a Buddha with the {{capacity}} for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a barrier of dreams. Otherwise man's innate being can flower in a move from the periphery to the centre.|$|E
25|$|Well, John {{has been}} on hunger strike since July. He {{resisted}} the forcible feeding for a good while, but submitted to the inevitable. Now he is being fed by a stomach tube twice daily.

25|$|Any ring R can {{be viewed}} as a preadditive {{category}} with a single object. With this understanding, a left R-module <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a (covariant) additive functor from R to the category Ab of abelian groups. Right R-modules are contravariant additive functors. This suggests that, if C is any preadditive category, a covariant additive functor from C to Ab should be considered a generalized left module over C; these functors form a functor category C-Mod which is the natural generalization of the module category R-Mod.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, {{the philosopher}} Hermann Ulrici {{wrote that the}} play and its {{depiction}} of human life reflected the views of Platonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a dream, suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour {{as an indication of}} parody about class differences.|$|E
25|$|Performance of cross {{interleaver}} : As {{shown in}} the above interleaver figure, the output <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the diagonal symbols generated {{at the end of}} each delay line. In this case, when the input multiplexer switch completes around half switching, we can read first row at the receiver. Thus, we need to store maximum of around half message at receiver in order to read first row. This drastically brings down the storage requirement by half. Since just half message is now required to read first row, the latency is also reduced by half which is good improvement over the block interleaver. Thus, the total interleaver memory is split between transmitter and receiver.|$|E

25|$|In the Doctor Who Past Doctor Adventures novel The Shadow in the Glass, the Sixth Doctor and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart {{discover}} {{the existence of}} a Fourth Reich led by Hitler's son, Eva Braun having been smuggled away to give birth and another woman killed in her place. At the conclusion of the novel the Fourth Reich's threat is ended when Hitler's son forces the Doctor to take him back in time to meet his father, only for Hitler to shoot his son in the head in the belief that he <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a madman. The Seventh Doctor also met Hitler in the Virgin New Adventures novel , where Hitler was possessed by the powerful being known as the Timewyrm from pre-WW2 to 1940, learning to control its power before the Doctor tricked Hitler into banishing it by claiming that it was doing nothing to help him when in reality the Timewyrm's power was all that kept Hitler remotely stable {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|The news of {{the victory}} was {{received}} in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed {{the power and the}} prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report says my nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it <b>is</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>but</b> the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it <b>is</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>but</b> Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
