2500|$|Terra sigillata as {{an archaeological}} term refers chiefly to a {{specific}} type of plain and decorated tableware made in Italy and in Gaul (France and the Rhineland) during the Roman Empire. [...] These vessels have <b>glossy</b> <b>surface</b> slips ranging from a soft lustre to a brilliant glaze-like shine, in a characteristic colour range from pale orange to bright red; they were produced in standard shapes and sizes and were manufactured on an industrial scale and widely exported. [...] The sigillata industries grew up in areas where there were existing traditions of pottery manufacture, and where the clay deposits proved suitable. The products of the Italian workshops are also known as Aretine ware from Arezzo and have been collected and admired since the Renaissance. [...] The wares made in the Gaulish factories are often referred to by English-speaking archaeologists as samian ware. [...] Closely related pottery fabrics made in the North African and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire are not usually referred to as terra sigillata, but by more specific names, e.g. African red slip wares.

2500|$|The {{designation}} 'fine wares' {{is used by}} archaeologists for Roman pottery {{intended for}} serving food and drink at table, as opposed to pots designed for cooking and food preparation, storage, transport and other purposes. Although there were many types of fine pottery, for example, drinking vessels in very delicate and thin-walled wares, and pottery finished with vitreous lead glazes, the major class that comes first to mind is the Roman red-gloss ware of Italy and Gaul made, and widely traded, from the 1st century BC to the late 2nd century AD, and traditionally known as [...] These vessels have fine, fairly hard and well-fired buff to pink fabrics, with a naturally <b>glossy</b> <b>surface</b> slip ranging in colour from light orange to quite a bright red. The variations in the colour and texture of both body fabric and slip, {{as well as the}} vessel-shapes and the designs on the decorated forms can enable a trained student to identify source, date and often individual workshop quite accurately. Arretine ware, made at Arezzo in Tuscany, was the pre-eminent type of fine pottery in the 1st century BC and early 1st century AD, and was succeeded by samian ware, manufactured in a number of centres in Gaul, modern France and Germany. However the definition of all these terms has varied and evolved over the many generations during which the material has been studied. Technically, red-gloss wares have much in common with earlier Greek painted pottery, but the decorated forms employ raised, relief decoration rather than painting.|$|E

This dissertation focuses on efficient computation of global illumination in presence of <b>glossy</b> <b>surfaces</b> with low-frequency reflectance functions.

The algorithm takes advantage of the shading smoothness on these surfaces by interpolating indirect illumination from a set of sparsely distributed, cached values.

It is concluded that the Phong-based model is best suited for this type of application. ...|$|R

Left: The radiance gradient computation proposed {{in this paper}} handles occlusion changes and leads to a smoother indirect illumination interpolation on the glossy floor. The two images in the middle are cut out from the two images on the very left and very right.

The gradient characterizes how the incoming directional radiance function changes with displacement on a surface. We use the gradient for a smoother radiance interpolation over <b>glossy</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the framework of the radiance caching algorithm. The proposed algorithm generalizes the irradiance gradient computation by [Ward and Heckbert 1992] to allow its use for non-diffuse, <b>glossy,</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Compared to previous method for radiance gradient computation, the new algorithm yields better gradient estimates in the presence of significant occlusion changes in the sampled environment, allowing a smoother indirect illumination interpolation...|$|R
40|$|Radiance caching {{methods have}} proven {{efficient}} for global illumination. Their {{goal is to}} compute precisely illumination values (incident radiance or irradiance) at a reasonable number of points lying on the scene surfaces. These points, called records, are stored in a cache used for estimating illumination of other points in the scene. Unfortunately, with records lying on <b>glossy</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the irradiance value alone {{is not sufficient to}} evaluate the reflected radiance; each record should also store the incident radiance for all incident directions. Memory storage can be reduced with projection techniques using spherical harmonics or other basis functions. These techniques provide good results with low shininess BRDFs. However, they get impractical for shininess of even moderate value since the number of projection coefficients increase drastically. In this paper, we propose a new radiance caching method, that handles highly <b>glossy</b> <b>surfaces,</b> while requiring a low memory storage. Each cache record stores a coarse representation of the incident illumination thanks to a new data structure called Equivalent Area light Sources (EAS), capable of handling fuzzy mirror surfaces. In addition, our method proposes a new simplification of the interpolation process since it avoids the need for expressing and evaluating complex gradients...|$|R

A small fragment examined {{under the microscope}} appeared, {{from the number of}} minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles, like an assay fused before the blowpipe. The sand is entirely, or in greater part, siliceous; but some points are of a black colour, and from their <b>glossy</b> <b>surface</b> possess a metallic lustre. The thickness of the wall of the tube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch, and occasionally even equals a tenth. On the outside the grains of sand are rounded, and have a slightly glazed appearance: I could not distinguish any signs of crystallisation. In a similar manner to that described in the [...] "Geological Transactions," [...] the tubes are generally compressed, and have deep longitudinal furrows, so as closely to resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk, or the bark of the elm or cork tree. Their circumference is about two inches, but in some fragments, which are cylindrical and without any furrows, it is as much as four inches. The compression from the surrounding loose sand, acting while the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat, has evidently caused the creases or furrows. Judging from the uncompressed fragments, the measure or bore of the lightning (if such a term may be used) must have been about one inch and a quarter. At Paris, M. Hachette and M. Beudant succeeded in making tubes, in most respects similar to these fulgurites, by passing very strong shocks of galvanism through finely-powdered glass: when salt was added, so as to increase its fusibility, the tubes were larger in every dimension. (3/11. [...] "Annales de Chimie et de Physique" [...] tome 37 page 319.) They failed both with powdered feldspar and quartz. One tube, formed with pounded glass, was very nearly an inch long, namely [...] .982, and had an internal diameter of [...] .019 of an inch. When we hear that the strongest battery in Paris was used, and that its power on a substance of such easy fusibility as glass was to form tubes so diminutive, we must feel greatly astonished at the force of a shock of lightning, which, striking the sand in several places, has formed cylinders, in one instance of at least thirty feet long, and having an internal bore, where not compressed, of full an inch and a half; and this in a material so extraordinarily refractory as quartz! ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for exactly computing glossy reflections and transmissions of polygonal Lambertian luminaires with linearly-varying radiant exitance. To derive the underlying closed-form expressions, we introduce a rational generalization of irradiance tensors and an associated recurrence relation. The generalized tensors allow us to integrate a useful class of rational polynomials over regions of the sphere; this class of rational polynomials can simultaneously account for the linear variation of radiant exitance across a planar luminaire and simple forms of non-Lambertian scattering. Applications include the computation of irradiance at a point, view-dependent reflections from <b>glossy</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and transmissions through <b>glossy</b> <b>surfaces,</b> where the scattering is limited to Phong distributions and the incident illumination is due to linearlyvarying luminaires. In polyhedral environments, the resulting expressions can be exactly evaluated in quadratic time (in the Phong exponent) using dynamic programming or efficiently approximated in linear time using standard numerical quadrature. To illustrate the use of generalized irradiance tensors, we present a greatly simplified derivation of a previously published closed-form expression for the irradiance due to linearly-varying luminaires, and simulate Phong-like scattering effects from such emitters. The validity of our algorithm is demonstrated by comparison with Monte Carlo...|$|R
