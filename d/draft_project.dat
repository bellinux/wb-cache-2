6000|$|... (M112) The <b>draft</b> <b>project</b> of {{surrendering}} complete taxing-power to the Irish {{legislative body}} was eventually abandoned. It was soon {{felt that the}} bare possibility of Ireland putting duties on British goods—and it was not more than a bare possibility in view of Britain’s position as practically Ireland’s only market—would have destroyed the bill in every manufacturing and commercial centre in the land. Mr. Parnell agreed {{to give up the}} control of customs, and also to give up direct and continuous representation at Westminster. On this cardinal point of the cesser of Irish representation, Mr. Gladstone to the last professed to keep an open mind, though to most of the cabinet, including especially three of its oldest hands and coolest heads, exclusion was at this time almost vital. Exclusion was favoured not only on its merits. Mr. Bright was known to regard it as large compensation for what otherwise he viewed as pure mischief, and it was expected to win support in other quarters generally hostile. So in truth it did, but at the cost of support in quarters that were friendly. On April 30, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Granville, “I scarcely see how a cabinet could have been formed, if the inclusion of the Irish members had been insisted on; and now I do not see how the scheme and policy can be saved from shipwreck, if the exclusion is insisted on.” ...|$|E
