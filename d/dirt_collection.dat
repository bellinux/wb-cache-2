[...] Fabric covering on the fuselage and wings was replaced with a transparent plastic material, called Cellon or Rhodoid, and the opaque structure was painted with a white paint mixed with aluminium powder. Trials with ground and airborne observations confirmed Kozlov's theories, with the bonus of excellent visibility for the crew. After the initial success, the film was found to become opaque through <b>dirt</b> <b>collection</b> {{and the effects of}} the sun, diminishing the invisibility effect.|$|E

Many cyclonic vacuum systems now feature translucent <b>dirt</b> <b>collection</b> canisters, allowing quick inspection without removing the canister.|$|E

50|$|The <b>dirt</b> bag or <b>collection</b> bin in {{a central}} vacuum system is usually so large that {{emptying}} or changing {{needs to be done}} less often, perhaps a few times per year for an ordinary household. The central unit usually stays in stand-by, and is turned on by a switch on the handle of the hose. Alternately, the unit powers up when the hose is plugged into the wall inlet, when the metal hose connector makes contact with two prongs in the wall inlet and control current is transmitted through low voltage wires to the main unit.|$|R
40|$|Today we {{have more}} {{information}} at our fingertips {{than at any other}} time in human history. The problem is no longer finding information, the problem is being overwhelmed with the amount of information. This is no different in the realm of the digital humanities. Information on people, projects, resources, methods, and tools exists in quantity everywhere we look, and yet we still have difficulty finding what we need. This paper describes a transatlantic effort on the part of DiRT in the United States and DARIAH in Europe to construct a taxonomy of scholarly methods, called TaDiRAH or Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities, that can be used not only to organize single collections of DH information and resources but also to allow these collections to interface with each other, creating a web of linked data that can be effectively searched for information across distributed <b>collections.</b> <b>DiRT</b> and DARIAH are not trying to impose a restrictive, monolithic scheme on DH; rather, our goal is to construct a lightweight, basic taxonomy of higher order goals and first-order methods that can be easily expanded in all directions by linking lower order techniques to multiple goals and/or methods to create machine-readable paths among the various resources. In building this taxonomy, we heavily rely on input and feedback from the digital humanities community. Still, at least for the intended use cases, we believe a stable taxonomy has advantages over more open, folksonomy-based solutions...|$|R
5000|$|Increased {{suction power}} — Because {{the vacuum cleaner}} motor and <b>dirt</b> <b>collection</b> system need not be portable, the weight {{and size of the}} unit are not as {{severely}} constrained as in a portable system; some units even use two motors for extra power. [...] In addition, bagless filterless systems avoid the inevitable loss of suction in filtered systems caused by collected dust clogging the filters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{owners manual}} for the cloth bag {{equipped}} machines {{recommended that the}} cloth bag be emptied after cleaning had been finished, to avoid dirt and bacteria from setting in the fibers of the bag, and preparing the machine for the next time. The cloth bag can be laundered periodically, if necessary. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally {{in addition to the}} cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. The disposable paper bag offered the convenience of storing the cleaner when finished, and not requiring that the bag be emptied every time. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of <b>dirt</b> <b>collection</b> was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled [...] "Micron Magic" [...] with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns, while the cotton cloth bag traps any remaining particles that pass through. Starting with the Ultimate G Diamond Edition, the disposable paper bag was upgraded to HEPA standards.|$|E
