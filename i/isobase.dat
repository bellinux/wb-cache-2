50|$|Bushy Island is a vegetated coral cay in Queensland, Australia in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Queensland, Australia. It {{is about}} 70 km east of Mackay. There {{are no other}} vegetated cays {{in the more than}} 600 km stretch between Bushy Island and Green Island. The coral species Acropora bushyensis, one of many species in the Acropora genus, is most heavily {{concentrated}} in Bushy Island lagoon, existing only rarely elsewhere in the eastern portion of the Great Barrier Reef and not at all in the western portion. The island is an accumulation of biogenic sediment similar to Heron Island, and it has been sufficiently stable to accumulate vegetation. A major component of the mobile sands of Bushy Island is Foraminifera, a type of amoeboid protist. Foraminiferan sands are more easily eroded off of the cay. Bushy Island is located inside the zero <b>isobase</b> on an elevated reef flat, onto which the cay often erodes.|$|E

The groupings were computed using the IsoRankN algorithm that uses spectral methods to combine sequence and PPI data and produce clusters of functionally related proteins.

50|$|The Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, Scottish Highlands, {{represent}} {{a series of}} ice-dammed proglacial lake shorelines produced during the cold climate of the Younger Dryas (GS1). It has been demonstrated by Dawson, Hampton, Harrison, Greengrass and Fretwell (2002) that each lake shoreline exhibits evidence of glacio-isostatic tilting associated with the decay of the last (Late Devensian) ice sheet. The directions of tilting of the three shorelines (in the quadrant between north and east), are at variance with published glacio-isostatic uplift <b>isobases</b> based on marine shoreline data that suggest a pattern of decreased uplift towards the northwest. The gradient of shoreline tilting (between 0.11 and 0.14 m/km) is similar to measured regional tilts of a well-developed marine shoreline (the Main Rock Platform) considered to have been produced in Scotland {{during the same period}} of extreme cold climate. Consideration of the ice-dammed lake shoreline data also points to the former occurrence of two separate episodes of tectonic activity during the Younger Dryas (Greenland Stadial 1 - GS1).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{overview}} of 85 sites of Holocene buried organic sediments in Estonia is presented. This number includes 45 sites of pre-Ancylus and Ancylus age, which were buried during the Ancylus transgression, 31 sites of pre-Litorina and Litorina age, buried under Litorina transgression sediments, and 9 sites formed after post-Litorina time and mostly covered by aeolian sand. According to radiocarbon dates, the Ancylus Lake transgression started about 9500 yr BP (10 800 cal BP), and culminated {{several hundred years}} later. Around 9000 yr BP (10 100 cal BP) a rather rapid regression followed. Its magnitude reached up to 30 m {{in the areas of}} rapid uplift. Pollen spectra of these beds are characterized by a high frequency of Pinus pollen, which seems to be typical of the coastal waterbodies of this age and confuses determination of their Preboreal age. 14 C dates of Litorina buried beds differ considerably. We have evidence that the Litorina transgression started about 75007000 yr BP (83007800 cal BP) and culminated at different times in different regions. Pollen spectra of Litorina buried organic strata vary considerably between sites; however, their Atlantic age is easily discernible.

The data are modified to ensure comparability and are compared against the pattern of glacio-isostatic uplift in the area.

40|$|Melting of {{the late}} Pleistocene ice sheet has left a {{semicircle}} of glacial deposits around the coast of eastern Newfoundland west of the Avalon Peninsula. A discontinuous end moraine accentuates the curvature and separates ground moraine on the coastal side (outer drift zone) from slightly younger eskers, kames, and ground moraine {{on the inner side}} (inner drift zone). The distribution of ground moraine, glacial striations, indicator boulders, and glaciated bedrock ridges in the two drift zones indicates that an ice sheet once covered all eastern Newfoundland west of the Avalon Peninsula. The ice center was somewhere in western Newfoundland. At about the same time local ice caps existed on the Avalon Peninsula. Small valley glaciers persisted in a few elevated regions of the north and south coasts west of longitude 55 ° after the retreat of the main ice sheet.

40|$|We combine <b>isobase</b> maps with {{a digital}} terrain model of Atlantic Canada to map coastlines from 13 14 Ckyr BP to the present. At 13 14 C kyrBP there are ridges of high {{relative}} sea level (rsl) values over Newfoundland and the Maritime Provinces, and a re-entrant of low values in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This pattern persists well into the Holocene, and reflects crustal response to the slow wasting of ice caps that persisted in Newfoundland and the Maritime Provinces {{for up to five}} millennia after the removal of ice from the Gulf of St. Lawrence by a migrating calving embayment. The palaeogeographic reconstructions reveal an archipelago on the outer shelf, from Grand Bank to the continent, that persisted from> 13 14 CkyrBP until ca. 8 14 C kyr BP. Much of the Magdalen Shelf was exposed, but the Magdalen Islands were never connected to the mainland. Prince Edward Island was initially separated from the mainland, became connected after 11 14 C kyr BP, and was separated again just before 6 14 C kyr BP, when Northumberland Strait formed.

40|$|A {{number of}} ancient shorelines formed by late-Pleistocene proglacial lakes {{have been found}} in eastern upper Michigan. These shorelines delimit several water planes, the {{uppermost}} of which is correlated with the Main Lake Algonquin stage. This correlation is based on the continuity of the highest water plane with Main Algonquin shorelines in Wisconsin and Ontario, the strength of the shoreline features, its altitudinal relationship with lower water planes, and a reinterpretation of radiocarbon dates from the Sault Ste. Maria area. The <b>isobases</b> of this water plane have a bearing of S 75 [deg]E. At the time of the maximum extent of Lake Algonquin, ca. 10, 600 yr B.

Radiocarbon dates on wood found beneath till or outwash at several sites indicate a minor ice readvance from the central Lake Superior basin ca. 10, 000 yr B. P.

40|$|During the Late Wisconsinan, a {{precursor}} of the Prince of Wales Icefield, southern Ellesmere Island, formed a prodigious ice divide of the Innuitian Ice Sheet. Initial buildup occurred after 19 ka BP, when the icefield advanced west (inland) across Makinson Inlet from margins similar to present. Subsequent reversal of {{flow to the}} east required ice divide migration to the west onto a plateau that is largely ice-free today. From this divide, a trunk glacier flowed eastward through Makinson Inlet to join the Smith Sound Ice Stream en route to nothern Baffin Bay. Westward flow from this divide filled Baumann Fiord, depositing a granite dispersal train that extends a further 600 km across the archipelago to the polar continental shelf. Deglaciation of most of Makinson Inlet occurred catastrophically at ~ 9. 3 ka BP, forming a calving bay that thinned the Innuitian divide, thereby triggering deglaciation of most of Baumann Fiord by 8. 5 ka BP. Ninety 14 C dates on Holocene shells and driftwood constrain deglacial isochrones and postglacial emergence curves {{on opposite sides of}} the former Innuitian divide. <b>Isobases</b> drawn on the 8 ka BP shoreline rise northwest towards Eureka Sound, the axis of maximum former ice thickness. Ice margins on Ellesmere Island were similar to present from ~ 50 � 19 ka BP (spanning marine isotope stages 3 and 2). However, significant regional variation in ice extent during this interval is recorded by ice rafting from the Laurentide Ice Sheet into Baffin Bay. Later buildup of the Innuitian Ice Sheet occurred during the low global sea level that defines the last glacial maximum (18 ka BP). We also suggest that the Innuitian Ice Sheet was influenced by the buttressing and subsequent removal of the Greenland Ice Sheet along eastern Ellesmere Island...|$|R

During the Lateglacial-Holocene transition relative sea level had fallen to below c. 0. 5 m OD and remained at this depth until c. 8830 ' 4 C years BP. Thus, the early-Holocene minimum sea level is here, relatively well constrained altitudinally.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of glacial {{isostatic}} adjustment (GIA) of the British Isles {{is essential for the}} assessment of past and future sea-level trends. GIA has been extensively examined in the literature, employing different research methods and observational data types. Geological evidence from palaeo-shorelines and undisturbed sedimentary deposits has been used to reconstruct long-term relative sea-level change since the Last Glacial Maximum. This information derived from sea-level index points has been employed to inform empirical <b>isobase</b> models of the uplift in Scotland using trend surface and Gaussian trend surface analysis, as well as to calibrate more theory-driven GIA models that rely on Earth mantle rheology and ice sheet history. Furthermore, current short-term rates of GIA-induced crustal motion during the past few decades have been measured using different geodetic techniques, mainly continuous GPS (CGPS) and absolute gravimetry (AG). AG-measurements are generally employed to increase the accuracy of the CGPS estimates. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) looks promising as a relatively new technique to measure crustal uplift in the northern parts of Great Britain, where the GIA-induced vertical land deformation has its highest rate.

All the lakes except one (interpreted as having an unconformable slumped transition) show a regressive I-II-III (marine-transitional-lacustrine) facies succession, indicating a postglacial history of continuous emergence. The RSL curve shows rapid emergence between 10 000 and 8000 BP, very slow emergence between 7000 and 5000 BP, increased rate of emergence between 4500 and 4000 BP, and a moderate rate of emergence after 3500 BP. The low rate of emergence around 6000 BP correlates with the Tapes transgression of more coastal regions, but corresponding sea level, at 25 - 26 ma. present s. l., lies 5 - 10 m lower than the elevation predicted based on existing <b>isobase</b> maps for the region.

Information on the altitude, distribution, stratigraphical context, age, particle size profile and microfossil characteristics of the deposits is presented. The tsunami involved a greater area than previously described, reaching a coastline over 600 km long. The ubiquitous sand layer which forms the main deposit associated with the event is shown to exhibit a consistent morphology and a particle size profile marked by fining-upwards sequences. An analysis of new and previously published radiocarbon dates indicates that from evidence in the United Kingdom, the event took place sometime around 7100 radiocarbon years BP (7900 calibrated years BP). A new <b>isobase</b> model for mainland Scotland and adjacent areas, providing a preliminary estimate of land uplift since the tsunami, is presented.

40|$|Two well dated lateglacial {{relative}} sea-level curves {{have been}} constructed from Hordaland, western Norway, by the isolation basin method. The easternmost curve is based on six basins from the Os area, close to the Younger Dryas (YD) ice-sheet margin, at a YD <b>isobase</b> of 58 m a. s. l. The western curve was constructed at a site 20 km further west, at a YD <b>isobase</b> of 40 m, {{and is based on}} detailed studies of three basins located on the island of Sotra. In addition 22 basins from an earlier conducted study on Sotra have been re-evaluated and calibrated, and the presented curve consists of 43 sea-level index points documenting the complete late- and postglacial sea-level history of Sotra. A major feature in the lateglacial sea-level history of western Norway is the YD transgression, representing a rise in relative sea level of 10 m. It temporarily reversed the ongoing relative sea-level fall following the deglaciation. The transgression started in late Allerød, 200 - 300 years before the YD cooling, and culminated in the late YD. The highstand at the YD transgression maximum had duration of about 200 years, and the sea level fell rapidly slightly after the YD/Holocene boundary and the rise in the birch (Betula) pollen curve. The two sea-level curves and marine limit terraces in the area have been used to construct a shoreline diagram with shorelines for the regression minimum in Allerød and the YD transgression maximum. These shorelines have almost parallel tilts of 1. 2 - 1. 4 m km- 1, indicating that no isostatic tilting, and thus neither uplift nor depression occurred during the sea-level rise. It is concluded that the YD transgression was caused by a major YD ice-sheet advance mapped in the same area. This stopped the isostatic uplift and increased the gravitational attraction on the sea which elevated the geoid in this area. There may also have been a contribution from rising glacio eustatic sea level. The YD transgression started in the late Allerød, thus it is concluded that the YD ice-sheet advance started before the onset of the YD. Recently, several scientists have postulated that there was no major glacier advance during the YD, based on observations along the Hardangerfjord. If correct, this has consequences for the proposed explanation of the YD transgression, and it is therefore performed a test by dating the large terminal moraine crossing the fjord close to the fjord mouth. The results indicate that the terminal moraine at the mouth of Hardangerfjorden was deposited in mid and late YD (10. 6 - 10. 0 kyr 14 C BP). It is concluded that the there was a major YD ice-sheet advance in western Norway, also in the Hardangerfjord area...|$|E
40|$|We present new isobases {{constraining}} the Holocene isostatic uplift of the South Shetland Islands, northern Antarctic Peninsula, {{based on}} evidence from raised shorelines. Holocene shorelines were described and surveyed at fifteen sites to determine the spatial variability of relative sea level (RSL) change across the South Shetland Islands, and provide new spatial RSL change corrections for the region. Results show that the highest shoreline is a transgressive feature, correlated by geomorphological evidence on most exposed coastlines of the archipelago. Its surveyed height was corrected for local variability in wave energy by subtracting the measured altitude of the present day shoreline. These corrected surveyed heights of the highest raised beach were modelled using quadratic polynomial trend surface analysis to constrain differing rates of regional isostatic uplift. We present two <b>isobase</b> models of isostatic uplift since formation of the highest Holocene raised beach circa 7360 – 7000 years ago. These models suggests a maximum uplift of ca 20 m was centred on an area north of Greenwich Island, with isobases implying an elongate zone of uplift orientated east-southeast to west-northwest along {{the spine of the}} island chain.

40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} a lengthy and {{detailed}} investigation into middle- and late-Holocene raised shorelines in mainland Scotland indicate that three shorelines are sufficiently widely distributed to permit an examination of their extent and of the patterns of uplift which they indicate. The shorelines are the Storegga Tsunami Shoreline, reached at c. 7100 14 C years BP, at {{the culmination of the}} Main Postglacial Transgression; and the Blairdrummond Shoreline, reached after the Main Postglacial Shoreline, at c. 2000 – 4200 14 C years BP, at the time of a tsunami believed to have been caused by the Second Storegga submarine slide; the Main Postglacial Shoreline, reached at c. 5800 – 6850 14 C years BP. The Main Postglacial Shoreline, previously believed to be the highest Holocene raised shoreline in Scotland, is now believed to be overlapped around the periphery of the uplifted area by the later Blairdrummond Shoreline. <b>Isobase</b> models, based upon quadratic trend surface analysis of available comparable height data consisting of altitudes on former estuarine surfaces and related to the local High Water Mark of Ordinary Spring Tides, depict the pattern of uplift for each shoreline.

40|$|The {{island of}} Suursaari {{in the middle}} of the Gulf of Finland is {{exceptionally}} high (175 m a. s. l.). Sediment profiles from one mire and three lakes were in-vestigated using diatom and pollen analysis, radiocarbon dating and levelling of the elevations of ancient shorelines. The pollen stratigraphy of the Lounatkor-kiasuo Mire sediment suggests a sedimentary record dating from the late Allerød. The development of late-glacial vegetation went through the same phases as in southern Finland, however these are probably somewhat earlier on the island of Suursaari. There are differences in the Holocene vegetation history of the high-er and lower areas of the island. Lake Ruokalahenjärvi was isolated around 10 000 BP during the initial phase of the Yoldia Sea and the diatom assemblage indicates that at that time brackish-water flow had not penetrated into the Gulf of Finland. Diatoms from the isolation sediments of Lake Liivalahenjärvi and Lake Veteljärvi indicate a freshwater environment for the Yoldia Sea final phase at 9500 – 9600 BP. Levelling of coastal formations on Suursaari Island reveals that the Late Weichselian and early Holocene ancient shorelines are 5 – 15 m high-er than expected from the <b>isobase</b> data for similar land uplift areas on the main-land. The anomalous shoreline levels on Suursaari Island may be explained by irregular land uplift. By the time of the Litorina Sea differences in shoreline altitudes had disappeared...|$|E

40|$|Five coastal {{sites have}} been {{studies on the}} Isle of Skye to {{investigate}} Late Devensian and Holocene relative sea level changes. In the field, detailed stratigraphical work, geomorphological mapping and levelling were undertaken and representatives cores were sampled. Detailed pollen and diatom analyses were undertaken in the laboratory and samples were submitted for radiocarbon assay where distinct pollen, diatom or lithostratigraphical changes were recorded. Loss on ignition analysis was also undertaken to ascertain the carbon content of the samples. The investigations have revealed that during the Late Devensian marine transgressions were experienced at two sites in southern Skye. These are thought to relate to readvances of the ice that arrested the isostatic recovery of the land, caused renewed isostatic depression and upon deglaciation, allowed marine waters to penetrate the sites. At Inver Aulavaig the transgression is thought {{to relate to the}} Wester Ross Readvance recorded in Wester Ross, Coll and Tiree and at Point of Sleat the transgression is thought to relate the Loch Lomond Readvance recorded extensively in Scotland. Relative sea level at Point of Sleat (southern Skye) then fell below an altitude of 4. 13 mOD at 10460 +- 50 BP and remained low during the early Holocene until the Main Postglacial Transgression occurred. This transgression is recorded at three of the sites: at Inver Aulavaig (southern Skye) at 8850 +- 70 BP where it had attained an altitude of at least 5. 10 mOD, at Peinchorran (eastern Skye) where it is thought to have been underway by 7980 +-BP and attained an altitude of 4. 49 mOD and at Talisker Bay (western Skye) at 7790 +- 100 BP where it had attained an altitude of - 2. 18 mOD. At Ardmore Bay (northern Skye) it is thought that the Main Postglacial Transgression did not reach an altitude of 3. 34 mOD. It is possible that barrier formation at some of the sites accompanied the early states of the Mian Postglacial Transgression. It is thought that regression of the sea occurred between circa 6600 BP and circa 5400 BP and remained low until circa 4200 BP when a later rise in relative sea level took place at Peinchorran attaining a maximum altitude of 4. 90 mOD. A late Holocene transgression is also recorded at Point of Sleat at between circa 3800 BP and circa 2900 BP where it attained an altitude of greater than 4. 13 mOD and at Inver Aulavaig after circa 3200 BP where it attained an altitude of between 5. 10 - 6. 01 mOD. It is unclear whether this episode of high relative sea level represents the diachronous nature of one late Holocene transgression or several fluctuations in relative sea level during the late Holocene. Following the late Holocene transgression, relative sea level fell until the present day. Comparison of the data obtained from Skye with the <b>isobase</b> maps and rheological models suggests that the isobases for the Main Lateglacial Shoreline (Firth et al., 1993) show a good fit in age and altitude but the rheological model of Lambeck (1993 b) for 10500 BP requires modification. The isobases for the Main Postglacial Shoreline appear to lie circa 4 m too high for the sites studied on Skye and the isobases produced for a late Holocene shoreline appear to be greatly in error (Firth et al., 1993). It is possible that the build up of ice during the Loch Lomond Stadial may have had a greater effect on crustal movements than previously thought and this may account for discrepancies identified in the <b>isobase</b> maps. The study of isolation basins and back-barrier environments has allowed an assessment of their potential in recording relative sea level changes. The use of isolation basins in areas devoid of estuarine sedimentation has been particualrly demonstrated. The vegetation reconstruction undertaken, suggests that variations do occur in coastal locations compared to sites further inland, although these are subtle. The dates obtained for the increase in taxa such as 'Corylus avellana' and 'Alnus' and the recording of anthropogenic indicators on the vegetation, agree with those previously obtained for Skye. The use of pollen analysis in verifying the radiocarbon dates obtained, particualrly for the Late Devensian, has been recognised and, combined with diatom analysis, has provided a comprehensive database from which to reconstruct past relative sea levels...|$|E
40|$|The Turnagain Area {{covers the}} {{continental}} shelf and slope off {{the east coast}} of North Island, New Zealand between Napier and Castlepoint. Its late Quaternary stratigraphy, tectonic history, sedimentation and foraminiferal distribution are described with the aid of continuous seismic profiles, sediment samples and cores. Results are presented in seven papers and a chart. The first three papers deal mainly with sub-bottom layers revealed by continuous seismic profiles; the next three papers describe dried sediment samples and cores and the last paper is a study of foraminifera in alcohol-preserved sediment samples. The topics discussed in each of the seven papers are as follows: 1. stratigraphy, sedimentation rates and origin of present topography on the continental shelf and upper slope; 2. rates of tectonic processes; 3. slumping; 4. distribution of sediments; 5. ages of indurated sediments; 6. ash horizons and rates of deposition on {{the lower part of the}} continental slope. 7. the distribution of living and dead foraminifera. The chart shows bathymetry and nature of sediment at the seabed. The sediments beneath the sea have been folding since Miocene times in the same way as marine sediments on the adjacent land. On the seabed anticlinal crests are preserved as ridges and banks and synclines form depressions. The present land area is rising and much of the seabed is sinking; the zero <b>isobase</b> between then is situated on the inner continental shelf. It has been at about the same position throughout Late Quaternary times, being always close to the dividing line between net erosion and net deposition. Rates of tilting have ranged from 2 to 36 microdegrees/thousand years and rates of vertical movement from + 1. 7 to - 1. 5 m/thousand years. Seaward of the zero <b>isobase</b> the continental shelf and upper slope has been built upwards and outwards by prisms of sediment, each prism representing a phase either of low sea level or of high sea level. Prisms deposited during periods of glacially lowered sea level are at their thickest beneath the upper slope; prisms deposited during periods of relatively high sea level are at their thickest beneath the continental shelf. Parts of the youngest prism on the upper slope have slumped on gradients as low as 1 [degree]. The topography and sediments formed during the last 20 thousand years have received the most attention. The present continental shelf if a composite feature. The inner part has been formed by wave-planation of hard rock near shore and deposition of the latest prism of sediment offshore. The outer part and the shelf break were formed by wave-planation and by deposition during the last low sea level about 20 thousand years ago. At that time the shelf break ranged in depth from about 40 m to about 70 m, being shallowest where eroded into soft sediment and deepest where deposited beyond the seaward edge of erosion. In adjacent areas the shelf break was probably formed at depths of less than 20 m being eroded into hard rock. The inner part of the wave-planed surface formed at that time is now deeply buried by the latest prism of sediment but the outer part is covered by only a thin veneer. The outer shelf is still essentially a drowned low sea level feature. At the thickest part of the prism on the mid continental shelf, rates of deposition above an 8 thousand year old seismic reflector range from about 1 to about 4 m/thousand years, being most rapid south of major rivers. Rates are too slow to be measured at some places near the shelf break and at ridges on the continental slope. In depressions on the continental slope, sedimentation rates are indicated by the depth of the 3. 4 thousand year old Waimihia ash and range from 0. 36 m/thousand years in a depression relatively near land to 0. 02 m/thousand years in the depression furthest from land. Sediments range from fine sand near shore to clayey fine silt on the lower slope. Many sediments are bimodal because they were deposited as a mixture of floculated and unfloculated grains. Rapidly deposited sediment on the continental shelf is predominantly detrital sand and silt; slowly deposited sediment near the shelf break and on ridges consists mostly of volcanic ash, foraminifera, and glauconite Muddy sediment in continental slope depressions contains sandy turbidite layers. Different environments are characterised by sediment types and foraminiferal faunas that can be matched in Tertiary Rocks...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the cell}} {{as a system}} {{has become one of}} the {{foremost}} challenges in the post-genomic era. As a result of advances in high-throughput (HTP) methodologies, we have seen a rapid growth in new types of data at the whole-genome scale. Over the last decade, HTP experimental techniques such as yeast two-hybrid assays and co-affinity purification couple with mass spectrometry have generated large amounts of data on protein-protein interactions (PPI) for many organisms. We focus on the sub-domain of systems biology related to understanding the interactions between proteins that ultimately drive all cellular processes. Representing PPIs as a protein interaction network has proved to be a powerful tool for understanding PPIs at the systems level. In this representation, each node represents a protein and each edge between two nodes represents a physical interaction between the corresponding two proteins. With this abstraction, we present algorithms for the prediction and analysis of such PPI networks as well as web servers and databases for their public availability: 1. In many organisms, the coverage of experimental determined PPI data remains relatively noisy and limited. Given two protein sequences, we describe an algorithm, called Struct 2 Net, to predict if two proteins physically interact, using insights from structural biology and logistic regression. Furthermore, we create a community-wide web-resource that predicts interactions between any protein sequence pair and provides proteome-wide pre-computed PPI predictions for Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 2. Comparative analysis of PPI networks across organisms can provide valuable insights into evolutionary conservation. We describe an algorithm, called IsoRank, for global alignment of multiple PPI networks. The algorithm first constructs an eigenvalue problem that models the network and sequence similarity constraints. The solution of the problem describes a k partite graph that is further processed to find the alignments. Furthermore, we create a communitywide web database, called <b>IsoBase,</b> that provides network alignments and orthology mappings for the most commonly studied eukaryotic model organisms: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. by Daniel K.
