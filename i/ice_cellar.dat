5000|$|Stüde Ice House : In former times, {{blocks of}} ice were sawn from the Tiefwarensee in winter, stored in an <b>ice</b> <b>cellar</b> and taken away {{during the course}} of the year for use in the {{fisheries}} and breweries. Today there is a good view of the lake from the roof of the <b>ice</b> <b>cellar.</b>|$|E

50|$|Atanik is a pre{{historic}} {{and historic}} Native Alaskan community site on {{coast of the}} Chukchi Sea in North Slope Borough, Alaska. A Native village was documented {{to be at the}} site in 1838, and the area may have evidence of much earlier habitation. Archaeological features of interest include the ruins of sod houses, <b>ice</b> <b>cellars,</b> a cemetery, and evidence of whaling-related activity. The site is also believed to have been a point from which inland hunting expeditions were launched.|$|R
5000|$|The name Eiswoog {{may have}} two derivations: it {{probably}} just means [...] "reservoir of the Eis" [...] (Stausee der Eis); for the stream itself {{was named after}} the iron ore (German: Eisenerz) deposits in the region. Several linguistic researchers also suggest that another derivation is possible: Before the introduction of refrigerators by Lindes in the 1870s, the reservoir was also used to provide ice. At that time, during the late winter, ice was broken and carried on horse and cart to the <b>ice</b> <b>cellars</b> and <b>ice</b> houses of the breweries and pork butchers in the surrounding area.|$|R
40|$|The Research Institute for Nature Management (R. I. N.) has {{compiled}} all available {{information on the}} distribution of bats in the Netherlands up till 1968. The data were derived from literature and museum specimens, as well as from numerous unpublished observations. Around 1960 much was known already on the winter dwellings of various species of bats, especially those in marl pits and fortresses. Less details were available concerning the distribution of bats in summer. Only one species, Nyctalus noctula, had been studied during the summer. During the past ten years valuable information on hibernacula could be added by continued research in marl pits and fortresses, and by investigations in cellars of castles and in former <b>ice</b> <b>cellars.</b> Besides, Dutch investigators started to pay attention to summer resorts of bats in towers and on lofts of churches, castles and other old buildings. From 1961 to 1969 about 1320 buildings have been inspected...|$|R

50|$|The Pelči park is 9.21 ha. In 1902 the {{reconstruction}} project (extended {{to the old}} plantation-based area) {{was developed by the}} Riga Park Director Georg Kuphaldt. Most of the park was designed as a free planning landscape park, except for the greenery immediately around and south of the palace used for regular planting programming. Close of the palace there is a stable, an <b>ice</b> <b>cellar,</b> a taskmaster's and manor workers' house.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seasonal}} harvesting of {{snow and}} ice is an ancient practice estimated to have begun earlier than 1000 B.C. A Chinese collection of lyrics from this time period known as the Shijing, describes religious ceremonies for filling and emptying <b>ice</b> <b>cellars.</b> However, {{little is known about}} the construction of these <b>ice</b> <b>cellars</b> or what the ice was used for. The next ancient society to harvest ice may have been the Jews according to the book of Proverbs, which reads, “As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them who sent him.” [...] Historians have interpreted this to mean that the Jews used ice to cool beverages rather than to preserve food. Other ancient cultures such as the Greeks and the Romans dug large snow pits insulated with grass, chaff, or branches of trees as cold storage. [...] Like the Jews, the Greeks and Romans did not use ice and snow to preserve food, but primarily as a means to cool beverages. The Egyptians also developed methods to cool beverages, but in lieu of using ice to cool water, the Egyptians cooled water by putting boiling water in shallow earthen jars and placing them on the roofs of their houses at night. Slaves would moisten the outside of the jars and the resulting evaporation would cool the water. [...] The ancient people of India used this same concept to produce ice. [...] The Persians stored ice in a pit called a Yakhchal and may have been the first group of people to use cold storage to preserve food. In the Australian outback before a reliable electricity supply was available where the weather could be hot and dry, many farmers used a [...] "Coolgardie safe". This consisted of a room with hessian [...] "curtains" [...] hanging from the ceiling soaked in water. The water would evaporate and thereby cool the hessian curtains and thereby the air circulating in the room. This would allow many perishables such as fruit, butter, and cured meats to be kept that would normally spoil in the heat.|$|R

One of the medieval towers, the Sint-Alenatoren, can still be seen in the park surrounding the current building. On his visit to this fort, Charles V was reportedly served rabbit instead of his favourite hare, which resulted in the nickname konijnenfretters (rabbit eaters) for the inhabitants of Dilbeek.

5000|$|Nicholas II abdicated {{the throne}} of Russia on March 2, 1917. Thirteen days later, he {{returned}} to the Alexander Palace not as Emperor of Russia, but as Colonel Romanov. The Imperial Family were now held under house arrest and confined to a few rooms of the palace and watched over by a guard with fixed bayonets. The regime of their captivity, worked out by Alexander Kerensky himself, envisaged strict limitations {{in the life of the}} Imperial Family: an isolation from the outer world, a guard during their promenades in the park, prohibition of any contacts and correspondence apart from approved letters. Gillard noted, [...] "In their spare time, free from studies, the Empress and her daughters were engaged in sewing something, embroidering or weaving, but they were never idle.... During daytime walks all the members of the family, excluding the Empress, were engaged in physical work: they cleaned paths in the park from snow, chopped <b>ice</b> for the <b>cellar,</b> cut dry branches or old trees, storing firewood for the future winter. With the arrival of the warmer weather the entire family worked on an extensive kitchen-garden...." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} served Niederwalluf as {{the parish}} church until the 18th century, even though, by this time, the village itself had {{migrated to the}} west, {{on the other side}} of the Wallufbach. In the mid-18th century, the people of Niederwalluf built a new chapel, the Adelheidkapelle, in the center of the village and dedicated it also to St. John the Baptist. The altars and artistic objects from the old parish church were transferred there. From the beginning of the 19th century, the original church, badly damaged in the war of 1793-95, was abandoned. It served only as a barn and <b>ice</b> <b>cellar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{building}} is undergoing renovation towards being reopened as Rockford Brewery in spring 2014. The <b>Ice</b> <b>Cellar</b> Bar, one of three event rooms has been updated with a 10-line draft system and changeable colored LED lights set into he base of the copper lined bar. The lighting overhead is now renovated to LED lights shine through a surface that resemble the blocks of ice once stored in this room. The overhead lights are made from ancient beer and liquor bottles, many produced here originally. The bar's copper lining is the same aged color as the copper vats once used in the brewing process. The beams and bar supports are raw steel as was commonly used in the industrial age.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{sources of}} information as to when Appeltofft started to brew Munich beer. According to one source it was brewed from the start, {{but that is not}} very likely given the above information about the introduction in 1843. Another source says it was in the 1850s but most likely it must have been in the late 1840s. Munich beer requires longer storage time than [...] "svensköl" [...] and we know that Krönleins had the possibility to store Munich beer in the <b>ice</b> <b>cellar</b> that was built in 1849. The fact is that the cellar was probably built for this purpose. In any case, Krönleins was well ahead in this respect compared to many other Swedish breweries. The local competitor [...] "Östra Bryggeriet" [...] did not start brewing Munich beer until 1863.|$|E
50|$|The new complex {{covered the}} entire block. It {{included}} a penal prison with cells for 421 inmates, a detention centre for 278 inmates, {{as well as}} several other buildings. Those included an office building, kitchen, bakery, baths, <b>ice</b> <b>cellar</b> and a laundry. In addition, there were family apartments for the warden, his four deputies and 37 officers, and 24 smaller flats for single officers. One of the most distinctive buildings in the complex was the Orthodox St. Nicholas Church, one of the finest Orthodox churches in Vilna. However, as most of the inhabitants of the Vilna Governorate were Catholics or Jews, a separate Catholic church and a small synagogue were also built into one of the prison blocks. The new prison had its own water supply and had its own sewage system. The complex was surrounded with a stone wall.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} {{the business was}} quite modest. Every step in the production process was done manually. In 1849 new ground was bought, situated {{a couple of hundred}} meters from the brewery. On the new ground there was an old bastion from the early 17th century, placed next to the old moat. The purpose of the bastion was to protect the town from enemies from the west - hence the name [...] "Wester Katt". The purchase of the ground had two purposes. An <b>ice</b> <b>cellar</b> was built and control was gained over the water supply. A malting for the production of malt was also built. Below the bastion was a well with spring water, where many citizens in Halmstad fetched their water. The water was of very high quality. It is from this well that Krönleins has taken its water since the start in 1836.|$|E

5000|$|Although Gao Wei was emperor, both Emperor Wucheng and Retired Empress Hu favored Gao Yan {{more than}} Gao Wei. As of 567, Gao Yan carried, among his other {{official}} titles, {{the title of}} Chief Examiner (御史中丞, Yushi Zhongcheng). As the Chief Examiner had the official responsibility of investigating official misconducts, during Northern Qi's predecessor dynasty Northern Wei, {{in order to show}} the authority of the Chief Examiner, he was allowed to take on the same honor as a crown prince while out on the street, and that even officials as honored as princes and duke were required to yield to the Chief Examiner's trains. This ritual, however, had been long abolished, but Emperor Wucheng, in order to give Gao Yan greater honor, revived the ritual. Gao Yan was so honored that even his uncles would bow down to him, and he was allowed to use all kinds of imperial implements that Gao Wei used, normally reserved to use by the emperor. Once, when he was visiting Gao Wei's palace, he saw fresh plums that had come from an <b>ice</b> <b>cellar,</b> and he threw a temper tantrum, stating, [...] "Why is it that my brother gets to have them and I do not?" [...] From that point on, if Gao Wei was supplied with something and Gao Yan was not, the imperial supplier would be punished.|$|E
