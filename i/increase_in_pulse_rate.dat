30|$|To {{clarify the}} visual effects of room {{interior}} with wooden materials on humans, pulse rate, blood pressure, and brain activity were measured while {{the subjects were}} exposed to visual stimuli using actual-size model rooms. The wood ratios (the ratio of the area covered with wooden material to the whole area of the ceiling, walls, and floor) of the rooms were 0 %, 45 %, and 90 %. Subjective evaluation was also conducted. In the 0 % room, diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly, but the observed change in the autonomic nervous activity was relatively small. In the 45 % room, {{a significant decrease in}} the diastolic blood pressure and a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> were observed.

40|$|Introduction. Intraoperative stress {{responses}} and postoperative pain can be monitored using photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG signal has two components, AC and DC. Effects of noxious stimuli-induced stress responses {{have not been}} studied on the DC component of PPG. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of a known noxious stimulus (endotracheal intubation) on both the AC and DC components of PPG. Methods. 15 surgical patients having general anesthesia were enrolled into this clinical study. PPG was recorded electronically from a pulse oximeter. Maximum changes in the AC and DC components of the PPG and pulse rate were determined in response to endotracheal intubation from high frequency (62. 5 [*]Hz) PPG recordings. Results. Endotracheal intubation-induced autonomic stress response resulted in a significant decrease in the AC component of the PPG and an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> in every subject (p < 0. 05 for all). The decrease in the AC component of the PPG was 50 ± 12 % (p < 0. 05) and the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> was 26 ± 10 [*]bpm (p < 0. 05). The response of the DC component was variable (p = NS). Conclusion. Endotracheal intubation-induced stress response resulted in a significant and consistent change in the AC, but not the DC component of the PPG.

40|$|Expecting to blush is {{a common}} source of social anxiety, and is {{associated}} with heightened perceptions of blushing and embarrassment. To assess whether sensory cues associated with heightened facial blood flow are an additional source of anxiety, the vasodilator niacin (100. mg) or placebo was administered double-blind to 33 participants, and facial blood flow was investigated when they sang a children's song. Vasodilatation during singing was greater in the niacin than placebo condition, and niacin-evoked flushing and <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> were greater <b>in</b> participants with high than low fear of negative evaluation. Nevertheless, ratings of embarrassment, anxiety, blushing and facial heat were similar in both drug conditions.

Recovery from masking was faster at higher carrier <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> and masking increased linearly with current level. We fit the data with a dual-exponential recovery function, consistent with a peripheral and a more central process.

MethodsPostural flow {{changes in the}} femoral vessels and cervical carotids were measured in healthy normal adults using duplex equipment. Nutrient skin flow was measured using Hyperspectral imager (OxyVu- 2 ™), a newer non-touch measurement technology. ResultsThere are regional variations in cutaneous capillary density, sparse in the abdomen but richer in the forehead and ankle. Orthostatic microvascular congestion displays regional variations reflective of the non-linear pressure–volume relationship in thin walled vessels. There is profound cutaneous deoxygenation (≈ 40 % reduction) in the lower body starting {{at the level of}} the umbilicus and involving all levels below, in the erect posture; upper body is unaffected. Quantitative regional flow is preserved however, with an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> despite a velocity decrease in the femoral vessels.

Salbutamol-induced plasma cyclic 3 ', 5 '-adenosine monophos-phate (cyclic AMP) rise in a group of 10 elderly (mean age 77 years) patients, 8 of whom were hospitalized 6 to 8 weeks after femoral fracture, and 10 younger (mean age 27 years) individuals was compared. Parallel clinical response was monitored by changes in pulse rate and blood pressure. In the younger group there was a three-fold increase in plasma cyclic AMP levels after salbutamol infusion. In the older adults only a one-and-one-half-fold rise in plasma cyclic AMP levels was observed. There was an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and systolic blood pressure and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure in the younger group compared with the older participants. These results suggest that the basis for reduced catecholamine responsiveness in elderly hospitalized individuals is due to a defect in the peripheral beta-receptor-linked adenylate cyclase complex.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on a total of 24 junior national boxing campers to assess pattern of change in body weight (BW) during the camp and effect of weight reduction on selected physiological parameters. On the day of joining the camp, BW, standing height, grip strength, grip endurance, resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> resting blood pressure, body fat percent (BF%) and fat free mass percent (FFM%) were measured using standard techniques. However, BW was measured thrice during 20 days ‟ camp; firstly {{on the day of}} joining and subsequently on 10 th and 19 th (one day before competition) days of camp. Change in BW (as measured on 1 st and 19 th day) was calculated. Campers who reduced their BW by> 1 % during the camp were selected and studied further for relative changes in selected parameters. Out of 24 subjects only 10 reduced BW by 4. 68 % during the camp and weight reduction indicated a gradual pattern. Comparison before and after weight reduction revealed <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> resting blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and BF%. However, only resting diastolic blood pressure indicated significant (p< 0. 05) increase. A non-significant decline in grip strength, grip endurance and FFM was observed after weight reduction. Thus, gradual weight reduction up to 5 % of BW to compete on the top of lower weight category may not affect grip strength and endurance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{long-term}} {{safety of}} budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FM) inhalation {{has not been}} fully evaluated, particu-larly in elderly patients with bronchial asthma. To evaluate the 12 -month safety of BUD/FM inhalation for elderly asthmatic patients, the changes in serum potassium levels and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> were examined. A retrospective chart review was conducted of consecutive patients who were treated with BUD/FM inhala-tion (two inhalations of 160 / 4. 5 mg, twice daily; Symbicort Turbuhaler, AstraZeneca) at a hospital between February 2010 and January 2012. A total of 350 patients were treated with BUD/FM inhalation {{during the study period}} and were followed up over 12 months. The mean age of the patients was 60 years, and 19. 4 % and 21. 4 % of the patients were aged 65 - 74 years and ≥ 75 years, respectively. One hundred and fourteen (32. 6 %) of the 350 patients continued the inhalation therapy for> 12 months. Compared with the pretreatment data, reduc-tions in serum potassium levels at 1, 6 and 12 months were not observed, even in the patients aged 65 - 74 and ≥ 75 years. There was also no <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> at 1, 6 and 12 months, even in the patients aged 65 - 74 and ≥ 75 years. The usual dosage of BUD/FM showed no adverse effects on the serum potassium levels and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> the adults, including the elderly with persistent asthma...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Female sex hormones, {{estrogen}} and progesterone regulate various {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle. Hormonal changes tend to affect various parameters of physical fitness. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) {{is a measure of}} aerobic power. This study was planned to assess effect of different phases of menstrual cycle on cardiorespiratory parameters like <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> respiratory rate and VO 2 max. Methods: 100 female medical students in the age group of 17 - 22 years were studied for three consecutive menstrual cycles. Weight, resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> respiratory rate and VO 2 max were measured during premenstrual phase (20 th- 25 th day) and postmenstrual phase (5 th to 10 th day). Results: It was observed that there was a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> body weight, <b>pulse</b> <b>rate,</b> and respiratory rate during premenstrual phase. There was a decrease in VO 2 max during the premenstrual phase. Conclusion: This study indicates that there is decreased cardio-respiratory efficiency during premenstrual phase...|$|R
