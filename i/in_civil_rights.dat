5|$|Legally, the ACLU {{consists}} of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations: the American Civil Liberties Union, a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. Both organizations engage <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political lobbying. The two organizations share office space and employees.|$|E
5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights,</b> but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, {{a member of the}} ACLU.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E

5|$|He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney {{law firm}} specializing <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> {{litigation}} and neighborhood economic development, {{where he was}} an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed {{as one of the}} lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The case was settled out of court. Final Judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees. His law license became inactive in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E
5|$|The {{psychiatric}} incarceration {{of certain}} individuals {{was prompted by}} their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities. The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, {{was considered to be}} a form of mental illness that required treatment. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds. Highly classified government documents which have become available after the dissolution of the Soviet Union confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.|$|E

5000|$|Colonel Stone Johnson (September 9, 1918 [...] - [...] January 19, 2012) was an African-American activist <b>in</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement.

5000|$|The {{influence}} of secularism <b>in</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement <b>in</b> the United States {{is another important}} subject for Jacoby.

25|$|The {{state had}} some {{advances}} <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights.</b> The 1935 case Murray v.

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made {{significant}} changes <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> and governance. As {{in many other}} states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the US Supreme Court ruling in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Wright {{involved}} himself <b>in</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> efforts, beginning in college when he missed {{three weeks of}} school to join picket lines protesting D.

At Harvard he insisted on equal treatment when a professor prevented him from delivering white patients' babies. He joined the NAACP after medical school and remained involved with the organization {{for the rest of}} his life, eventually serving as chairman of its national board of directors.|$|E
25|$|Brownsville {{was also}} a place for radical {{political}} causes during this time. In 1916, Margaret Sanger set up the first birth control clinic in America on Amboy Street. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the neighborhood elected Socialist and American Labor Party candidates to the state assembly. Two Socialist candidates for mayor in 1929 and 1932 both received roughly a quarter of Brownsville residents' mayoral votes. Socialist attitudes prevailed among Brownsville residents until World War II.
