40|$|Contour lines {{recognition}} from raster topographic map {{is an interesting}} research in Geographic Information System. The majority of previous studies, either associates with manual digitizing, interactive or semi-automated process has several drawbacks. Generally, these approaches are time-consuming, inefficient and produced unreliable digitized data. Due to textured background and diverse information characterize on the map, extraction process has become complicated. This study concentrates on establishing an efficient approach for contour line recognition using local geometry and relationship derived from their neighbourhood pixels locality. The approach consists of three fundamental phrases: (1) preprocessing to obtain initial contour layer, (2) processing for enhancement and reconnection, and (3) post-processing to validate the extracted contour information. The entire methodology is decomposed {{into a number of}} tasks: (1) scan paper-based map into raster image, (2) colour quantization to reduce colour, (3) map layer separation and integration to acquire a comprehensive contour layer, (4) contour lines enhancement and thinning, (5) <b>endpoints</b> <b>detection,</b> (6) derivation of local geometries (distance, angle and directional information), (7) determination of best connection with identified endpoints, (8) reconnection of broken contour lines using cubic spline interpolation. In order to evaluate the applicability of this study, several experiments are conducted on topographic map in different scale and resolution. The results indicated that the usage of colour quantization is capable to extract contour layer from topographic map. Alternatively, the employment of cubic spline interpolation for contour lines reconnection has proven a favourable result. As a conclusion, this study has shown an acceptable result with low computation time and cost...|$|R

None of the core species are indigenous to the UK or other European waters and none of them have an unambiguous, diagnostic <b>endpoint</b> for the <b>detection</b> of androgens and their antagonists. A small inter-laboratory calibration was conducted to generate information on the reproducibility of a stickleback-based method. Three participating laboratories each tested two compounds – the oestrogen 17 ß-oestradiol (E 2) and the synthetic androgen trenbolone. In the E 2 exposure, all three laboratories detected a significant increase in VTG in males after 14 and 21 days at a concentration of 100 ng/L In the trenbolone exposure all three laboratories detected a significant increase in spiggin (the main diagnostic endpoint for androgenic activity) in females after 14 and 21 days at the highest concentration 5000 ng/L.

Despite importance of such behavioral biotests, their implementation is profoundly {{limited by the}} lack of appropriate biocompatible automation, integrated optoelectronic sensors, and the associated electronics and analysis algorithms. This work outlines development of a proof-of-concept miniaturized Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) platform for rapid water toxicity tests based on changes in swimming patterns exhibited by Artemia franciscana (Artoxkit MTM) nauplii. In contrast to conventionally performed end-point analysis based on counting numbers of dead/immobile specimens we performed a time-resolved video data analysis to dynamically assess impact of a reference toxicant on swimming pattern of A. franciscana.

40|$|The {{stimulation}} of collateral artery growth (arteriogenesis) is a promising alternative approach to non-invasively treat arterial obstructive disease, such as coronary, peripheral or cerebral artery disease. Patients unable to undergo conventional revascularization strategies {{may benefit from}} adaptive arteriogenesis.

A new analytical method was developed involving affinity chromatography and subsequent reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with a post-column chemical reaction detector and <b>endpoint</b> fluorescence <b>detection.</b> The detection limit of this fluorimetric assay was 1. 6 ng thymidine glycol per ml urine, which corresponds to about half of the physiological excretion level in healthy control persons.

Severe proteinuria with an excretion rate of up to 7. 2 g of total protein per mmol creatinine was also observed immediately after transplantation and declined within the first 24 h of allograft function (0. 35 + 0. 26 g/mmol creatinine). The protein excretion pattern, based on separation of urinary proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophorosis (SDS-PAGE), as well as excretion of individual biomarker proteins, indicated nonselective glomerular and tubular damage.

We established <b>endpoints</b> for <b>detection</b> of propagated Chlamydia trachomatis L 2 434, diluted according to swab and urine protocols for APTIMA Combo 2 (AC 2), ProbeTec ET (PT), and Amplicor (AMP) assays. AC 2 was 1, 000 -fold more sensitive than PT and 10 -fold more sensitive than AMP on mock swab specimens. For urine, AC 2 analytical sensitivity was 100 -fold greater {{than those of the}} other assays. Spiking an aliquot of each clinical-trial sample from 298 women demonstrated inhibition rates in first-void urine (FVU), cervical swabs (CS), and vaginal swabs (VS) of 12. 1 %, 12. 8 %, and 10. 4 % for AMP; 27. 2 %, 2 %, and 2 %, for PT; and 0. 3 %, 1. 7 %, and 1. 3 % for AC 2. Inhibition of our C. trachomatis spike and the PT or AMP amplification controls from the manufacturers showed less than 50 % correlation. Using an infected-patient reference standard (a specimen positive in at least two tests or a single test positive in two of three samples) in AC 2, the VS identified 68 / 69 (98. 6 %) infected women compared to CS (89. 9 %) or FVU (81. 2 %).

40|$|Since the {{development}} of the immunoassay, biomolecule detection via binding assays has become vitally important in many fields. High sensitivity in such assays usually requires low molecular weight labeling species (i. e., tracers) that typically must be detected using complex instrumentation (fluorimeter, etc.). In this thesis, the use of a specific enzyme cofactor reconstitution reaction employing pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) with apo-glucose dehydrogenase (apo-GDH) is explored as a simple and high sensitivity tracer system for detecting DNA and antimicrobial peptides, either visually or using conventional spectrophotometry. First, PQQ is encapsulated in liposomes, which are tagged with DNA and used in a sandwich-type heterogeneous assay for the detection of single-stranded DNA. After the binding reaction, the bound liposomes are lysed to release the PQQ. This assay has a detection limit of 62 fmol of single-stranded DNA, and thus rivals more conventional fluorescence-based DNA detection systems, even though only a visual read is required to detect the presence of target DNA. PQQ-loaded liposomes are also utilized in the homogeneous detection of the membrane bilayer permeabilization induced by antimicrobial peptides. Detection of such peptides at nM levels is possible using this assay scheme. Further, PQQ is doped into polymeric nanospheres, which are subsequently tagged with DNA, and also employed in a sandwich-type assay for single-stranded DNA detection. The nanoparticles show enhanced PQQ-loading capacity compared to the liposomes, and could eventually exhibit even lower limits of detection than the liposome-based assay. Lastly, initial results with a PQQ-linked oligonucleotide probe for homogeneous <b>endpoint</b> PCR <b>detection</b> of target DNA at levels of 15 molecules with only 40 PCR cycles are demonstrated, along with initial work to optimize the synthesis of the required probe.

For this purpose, we have used RO 5126766, a first-in-class orally active and highly selective dual protein kinase inhibitor, specific for Raf and MEK.

RO 5126766 inhibits ERK signalling more effectively that a standard MEK inhibitors. It suggests a new therapeutic approach for ras tumors by blocking feedback activation of ERK signalling [24]. RO 5126766 has shown potent in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in diverse human tumor xenografts models and has recently been evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation study in humans in which [18 [*]F]FDG-PET was included as one of the biomarker assessments [18, 25].
