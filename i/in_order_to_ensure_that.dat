5|$|Proposals from shipbuilders for two dreadnoughts (along with a {{possible}} third, to match Brazil should a third ship be ordered) and twelve destroyers were solicited in 1908 by open tender. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the designs reflected the most modern practices, the requirements were intentionally vague.|$|E

It was also designed by Ralph Lavers, with the frame for the torch created by EMI, and the magnesium candle supplied by Wessex Aircraft Engineering.

5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, {{whether he or she}} is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether, as Bede understood, Sigebert and Eorpwald were brothers, {{or whether they}} shared the same mother but not the same father, as was stated by the 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury. According to the {{historian}} Barbara Yorke, Sigebert {{may have been a}} member of a different line of Wuffings who as his rival was forced into exile, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> Eorpwald became king.|$|E

As further security, tickets also had to be presented with an adequate form of photographic identification. However, despite these security measures, counterfeit tickets were still produced, forcing UEFA to issue a statement warning people against buying tickets from touts.|$|E
5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E

5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe {{to be with}} a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, Shiva retires to Mount Kailash {{where he}} lives {{the rest of his}} days peacefully, though missing Sati every day. Ganesh, Kali and Kartik become renowned as Gods for their prowess, all over India. They take revenge for Sati's death by wiping out the whole clan of the Egyptian assassins. Bhrigu {{continues}} teaching and collates his knowledge in a book called Bhrigu Samhita. Sati's death is not forgotten and she is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti). It is revealed that <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the Somras is not mass-manufactured again, the course of the Yamuna is turned towards the east, thus drying up the Saraswati River.|$|E

5|$|Sigeberht was {{probably}} either a younger son of Rædwald of East Anglia, or his step-son from Rædwald's {{marriage to a}} pagan princess from the kingdom of Essex. Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> Rædwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia and (perhaps {{in the aftermath of}} a military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, who may have been either a son of Rædwald's, or his nephew.|$|E
5|$|Steuart was {{exchanged}} {{later in}} the summer of 1864, returning to command a brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia, in the division of Major General George Pickett. Steuart's brigade consisted of the 9th, 14th, 38th, 53rd and 57th Virginia regiments, and served in the trenches north of the James River during the Siege of Petersburg (June 9, 1864– March 25, 1865). By this stage of the war, Confederate supplies had dwindled to the point where Lee's army began to go hungry, and the theft of food became a serious problem. Steuart was forced to send armed guards to the supply depot at Petersburg <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> his men's packages were not stolen by looters.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which opened in 1827, directly affected the River Tone Navigation, as it provided a more direct route between Taunton and Bridgwater. The Conservators attempted to limit the supply {{of water from the}} river to the canal, while the canal company breached the river bank near Firepool lock, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> boats could reach Taunton Bridge wharf from the canal. In order to compete with the canal, they chose to reduce the tolls, although they were unsure of the legality of this action while they had outstanding debts. The canal company challenged their right to reduce the tolls in court, but the action was defeated, and the tolls remained at the lower level.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format and set on board a starship. Taking {{on the role of}} the robot, Alien 8, the player must explore the large starship <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the cryogenic life support systems preserving the biological crew are re-activated. The core of this system is a series of geometrically-shaped circuits. However, the circuits have been removed by the invading aliens and distributed around the starship. The main objective of the game is to collect the correct circuits and return them to their respective locations before the starship reaches its destination. The circuits are variously shaped as cubes, pyramids, domes or cylinders.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his many}} successes, {{during the last}} twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh {{measures}} he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. Conscription was introduced, causing resentment among the peasantry, despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army. In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{mountain}} tourists, ease of access {{into the high}} mountain environment, plus promotion and encouragement by tour companies offering ascents of Mont Blanc to people {{with little or no}} previous alpine experience, have led to an increase in mountain accidents and even inappropriate demands to be rescued. With up to 30,000 climbing parties now attempting to ascend Mont Blanc each year, it has gained the reputation of being one of the world's deadliest mountains. Deaths from mountaineering-related accidents across the Mont Blanc massif average almost 100 a year, with the majority occurring on Mont Blanc itself. There have also been various stunts, some of which the local authorities have decried as reckless or stupid. In recent years, guards have been placed on the most popular route of ascent to Mont Blanc's summit at peak periods <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> those entering the mountain environment are adequately equipped and skilled. This has led to calls to limit access to the most popular summits and for the mountains to be treated with greater respect.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{negotiating}} with the Tripolitanian envoy, Sivori {{was able to get}} an agreement restoring the diplomatic situation to as it had been prior to the events that had sparked the hostilities. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> Karamanli would abide by the terms of the treaty, the Sardinians included a provision that if the treaty were not ratified within four hours of its signing, Sardinian hostilities against Tripoli would recommence. Karamanli promptly acceded to the treaty upon receiving it and had the Sardinian consulate's national colors raised and saluted by his forces. The next day Sivori upon invitation arrived at Karamanli's palace, where he and his force were greeted with great respect and honor by the monarch. Though a stipulation was included in the peace treaty that required Sardinia to pay Tripoli 7,000 gold francs, it was canceled and as a result the long practice of Sardinian tributary payments to the Tripolitanians finally ended.|$|E
5|$|The torch {{lighting}} ceremony {{took place}} on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector, which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia. In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as {{a gift from the}} Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed overnight in the city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane gas torch <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours.|$|E
