40|$|Prostate tissue {{characteristics}} play {{an important}} role in predicting the recurrence of prostate cancer. Currently, experienced pathologists manually grade these prostate tissues using the <b>Gleason</b> scoring <b>system,</b> a subjective approach which summarizes the overall progression and aggressiveness of the cancer. Using advanced image processing techniques, Aureon Biosciences Corporation has developed a proprietary image analysis system (MAGIC TM), which here is specifically applied to prostate tissue analysis and designed to be capable of processing a single prostate tissue Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) stained image and automatically extracting a variety of raw measurements (spectral, shape, etc.) of histopathological objects along with spatial relationships amongst them. In the context of predicting prostate cancer recurrence, the performance of the image features is comparable to that achieved using the <b>Gleason</b> scoring <b>system.</b> Moreover, an improved prediction rate is observed by combining the Gleason scores with the image features obtained using MAGIC^TM, suggesting that the image data itself may possess information complementary to that of Gleason scores...|$|R
50|$|The Gleason Grade/Score has {{two main}} points: 1: Based on {{architectural}} patterns, rather than cytological ones. The <b>Gleason</b> <b>System</b> separates architectural features into 1 of 5 histological patterns.

5000|$|In 2005 the International Society of Urological Pathology {{altered the}} <b>Gleason</b> <b>system,</b> {{refining}} the criteria {{and changing the}} attribution of certain patterns.

Gleason realized that prostatic carcinomas have multiple patterns and that the prognosis of prostatic carcinoma was split between the most prevalent and the second most prevalent neoplasm pattern. So using the <b>Gleason</b> <b>system,</b> the most prevalent and second most prevalent pattern, if at least 5% of the neoplasm, are added together equaling the overall Gleason score.|$|E

40|$|Histological grading of {{pathological}} {{images is}} {{used to determine the}} level of malignancy of cancerous tissues. This task is done by pathologists. Pathologists are inconsistent in these judgments from day to day and from person to person.

This paper presents a new method for automatic grading of pathological images of prostate based on <b>Gleason</b> grading <b>system.</b> According to <b>Gleason</b> grading <b>system,</b> each cancerous specimen is assigned one of five grades. In our method the decision is based on features extracted from the multiwavelet transform of images. Energy and entropy features are extracted from submatrices obtained in decomposition. Then a k-NN classifier {{is used to}} classify each image. We also used features extracted by wavelet packet and second order moments to compare various methods. Experimental results show the superiority of multiwavelet transform compared to other techniques. For multiwavelets, critically sampled preprocessing outperforms repeated row preprocessing and has less sensitivity to noise. We also found that the first level of decomposition is very sensitive to noise and thus should not be used for feature extraction. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{pathologist}} then sums the pattern-number of {{the primary}} and secondary grades to obtain the final Gleason score. If only two patterns are seen, the first number of the score {{is that of the}} tumor's primary grade while the second number is that of the secondary grade, as described in the previous section. If three patterns are seen, the first number of the score would be the primary grade and the second number the pattern with the highest grade. For example, if the primary tumor grade was 2 and the secondary tumor grade was 3 but some cells were found to be grade 4, the Gleason score would be 2+4=6. This is a slight change from the pre-2005 <b>Gleason</b> <b>system</b> where the second number was the secondary grade (i.e., the grade of the second-most common cell line pattern).|$|E
50|$|However, {{problematic}} {{aspects of}} the original Gleason grading system still characterize the 2005 revision. The predominant lowest score assigned is Gleason 3+3 = 6. Patients who are told their Gleason score is 6 out of 10 may interpret {{that they have a}} more aggressive intermediate cancer and experience greater anxiety. More importantly, some classification systems fail to clearly distinguish between Gleason 3+4 = 7 and Gleason 4+3 = 7, with the latter having a worse prognosis. Therefore, in 2014 an international multidisciplinary conference convened to revise the 2005 system. A 5-point Gleason Grade grouping similar to those such as PI-RADS used with prostate MRI evaluations was proposed to denote prognostically distinct stratification. The number 1 would indicate the lowest-risk cancer while 5 would indicate the most aggressive disease. The system was tested and validated against 20,000 prostatectomy specimens and at least 16,000 biopsy samples. The majority of conference participants concurred on the superiority of the scale over the 2005 Gleason grading system, pointing to the likelihood that overtreatment could be avoided for patients whose cancer was assigned a 1. The World Health Organization's 2016 edition of Pathology and Genetics: Tumours of the Urinary System and Male Genital Organs has accepted the 2014 system, which can be used in conjunction with the 2005 <b>Gleason</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Donald F. Gleason in 1966 {{created a}} unique grading systemfor prostatic {{carcinoma}} {{based solely on}} the architectural pattern of the tumor. 3, 14, 22 Another innovative aspect of this sys-tem was, rather than assigning the worst grade as the grade of the carcinoma, the grade was defined as the sum of the two most common grade patterns and reported as the Gleason score. The original description of this system, based on a study of 270 patients from the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital, is seen in Table 1. Initially, Gleason intended to classify carcinomas into four patterns, but a small group of distinctive tumors (clear cell) was observed and they were placed in a separate fifth category (pattern 4). 14 Certain aspects of the original <b>Gleason</b> <b>system</b> would be interpreted differently in today’s practice. The crib-riform pattern described as a component of Gleason’s original patterns 2 and 3 would today typically be considered higher grade. Individual cells listed under Gleason’s original pattern 3 would also be currently assigned a higher grade. Pattern 4 has become significantly expanded beyond Gleason’s original de-scription of tumors with clear cytoplasm that resembled renal cell carcinoma (Table 1). By 1974, Gleason and theVeteransAdministrationCoop-erative Urological Research Group expanded their study to 1032 men. 15 Gleason pattern 4 was described in a figure legend as ‘‘raggedly infiltrating, fused-glandular tumor, fre-quently with pale cells, may resemble hypernephroma of kid-ney. ’ ’ The <b>Gleason</b> <b>system</b> was further refined by Mellinger in 1977 when the papillary and cribriform tumor under Gleason pattern 3 was described as having a ‘‘smooth and usually rounded edge. ’’ 23 These modifications of the <b>Gleason</b> <b>system</b> are depicted in Table 1.

We queried our institutional RP database for men with NCCN clinically localized intermediate to high-risk disease undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) between 1992 and 2010 with no additional treatment until the time of metastatic progression. A case-cohort design was utilized.

30|$|Since 1966, Gleason Grading {{is used in}} {{evaluation}} {{prostate cancer}} {{and it is the}} strongest prognostic factor in prostate cancer (Gleason 1966; Sauter et al. 2016).

Although tumor volume and PSA level increase may trigger treatment, the main treatment criteria is a Gleason score of 7 or more (Komisarenko et al. 2016). The <b>Gleason</b> grading <b>system</b> was updated in 2005 at a consensus conference of international experts in urological pathology (Epstein 2010) and they agreed that Gleason score between 2 and 4 should not be given on prostate biopsies.

40|$|The <b>Gleason</b> <b>system</b> for grading {{prostate}} cancer assigns a {{score on the}} basis of the most prevalent and second most prevalent grade. Several studies have investigated the clinical significance of a tertiary grade in radical prostatectomy samples. A systematic search of the published work identified seven studies that reported the prognostic value of a tertiary Gleason grade. Three studies correlated the presence of a tertiary grade with pathological stage, and six with prostate-specific antigen recurrence or clinical progression. In the small number of studies available, the frequency of a tertiary grade was consistently higher in samples characterised with pathological variables of poor outcome, such as extra-prostatic extension and positive surgical margins, but not lymph-node metastases. In five studies the presence of a tertiary grade increased the risk of prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy by a factor of 2 · 5. However, modification of the Gleason score to include a tertiary grade in Gleason 4 + 3 tumours might overestimate the risk of seminal-vesicle or lymph-node invasion. This systematic review has established the association of a tertiary grade with poorer outcome than that associated with no tertiary grade. A tertiary grade should, therefore, be included in the pathological reporting of {{prostate cancer}} and be considered in the interpretation and design of clinical trials. However, all studies assessed for this review were retrospective, potentially affected by selection bias, and based on radical prostatectomy samples or transurethral resections rather than biopsy samples.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the correlation between}} prognostic factors (age, differentiation grade assessed using the <b>Gleason</b> scoring <b>system,</b> serum prostate specific antigen, prostate volume, and serum testosterone) and the volume of skeletal metastasis expressed as bone metastasis index (BMI) in patients with disseminated prostate cancer (DPC). Material and methods. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 157 patients with initially diagnosed DPC treated at the Khabarovsk Regional Cancer Center from 2003 to 2013. Bone metastases were revealed in all patients. The volume of skeletal metastasis was measured using a novel automated computeraided diagnosis system devised by the specialists of Computer Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Results. The patients were divided into four groups. Group 1 : BMI≤ 1 % and Gleason score≤ 5; group 2 : BMI ≤ 1 % and Gleason Score≥ 3; group 3 : BMI> 1 % and Gleason score≤ 5; group 4 : BMI> 1 % and Gleason score> 5. The median survival time was 48 months in group 1 patients, 36. 5 months in group 2, 33 months in group 3 and 20 months in group 4 patients. Both log-rank and Wilcoxon tests demonstrated {{a statistically significant difference}} in survival curves between the groups 1 and 3, and between the groups 2 and 4.

One was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Gleason scored; FTIR spectra were collected from malignant locations using a second unstained section. FTIR spectra, representing different Gleason grades, were used to construct a diagnostic classifier for pCA using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This model was blind tested using 383 IR spectra from 36 biopsies. Using a three-band Gleason criteria, we obtained sensitivity of ≥ 70 % for the FTIR-LDA model to predict Gleason 7, with specificities of ≥ 81 %.
