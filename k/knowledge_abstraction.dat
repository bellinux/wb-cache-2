40|$|Since a query {{language}} {{is used as}} a handy tool to obtain information from a database, users want more user-friendly and fault-tolerant query interfaces. When a query search condition does not match with the underlying database, users would rather receive approximate answers than null information by relaxing the condition. They also prefer a less rigid querying structure, one which allows for vagueness in composing queries, and want the system to understand the intent behind a query. This paper presents a data abstraction approach to facilitate the development of such a fault-tolerant and intelligent query processing system. It specifically proposes a <b>knowledge</b> <b>abstraction</b> database that adopts a multilevel knowledge representation scheme called the <b>knowledge</b> <b>abstraction</b> hierarchy. Furthermore, the <b>knowledge</b> <b>abstraction</b> database extracts semantic data relationships from the underlying database and supports query relaxation using query generalization and specialization steps. Thus, it can broaden the search scope of original queries to retrieve neighborhood information and help users to pose conceptually abstract queries. Specifically, four types of vague queries are discussed, including approximate selection, approximate join, conceptual selection and conceptual join. � 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Abstract. In {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} knowledge representation, notions such as tolerance measures on data, distance between objects or individuals, and similarity measures between primitive and complex data structures are rarely considered. There {{is often a}} need to use tolerance and similarity measures in processes of data and <b>knowledge</b> <b>abstraction</b> because many complex systems which have knowledge representation components such as robots or software agents receive and process data which is incomplete, noisy, approximative and uncertain. This paper presents a framework for recursively constructing arbitrarily complex knowledge structures which may be compared for similarity, distance and approximativeness. It integrates nicely with more traditional knowledge representation techniques and attempts to bridge a gap between approximate and crisp knowledge representation. It can be viewed in part as a generalization of approximate reasoning techniques used in rough set theory. The strategy {{that will be used}} is to define tolerance and distance measures on the value sets associated with attributes or primitive data domains associated with particular applications. These tolerance and distance measures will be induced through the different levels of data and <b>knowledge</b> <b>abstraction</b> in complex representational structures. Once the tolerance and similarity measures are in place, an important structuring generalization can be made where the idea of a tolerance space is introduced. Use of these ideas is exemplified using two application domains related to sensor modeling and communication between agents. ...|$|E

The goal is to allow comprehensive communication among the systems. This will provide enhanced possibilities thus making way for intelligent buildings. Traditionally, integration is achieved using gateways which require considerable configuration effort. To alleviate this overhead and provide a unified system view, a generic application model is proposed that can accommodate all functionality found in building automation systems. The employment of this model promises several benefits such as a central point for configuration and system access. The method of choice are ontologies, which allow to offer a seminal representation of <b>knowledge,</b> an <b>abstraction</b> of the heterogeneous network infrastructure and automatic reasoning on the stored knowledge.

Semantic relation discovery is a fundamental technology in analytical domains, such as business intelligence and homeland security. Because of the decentralized and distributed nature of Semantic Web development, semantic data tend to be created and stored independently in different organizations. Under such circumstances, discovering semantic relations faces numerous challenges, such as isolation, scalability, and heterogeneity.
