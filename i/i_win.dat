500|$|Moon {{displayed}} what {{he described}} as a humble and self-deprecating manner during the World Series of Poker, repeatedly acknowledging his lack of poker experience throughout the tournament, and often attributing his success to luck and a high number of strong cards, rather than talent.

Moon also said one of his philosophies was, [...] "Make the other guy pay to see the cards", a strategy attributed to many re-raises Moon made during the 2009 World Series of Poker despite weak hands. Moon had almost no experience in heads-up poker, which some commentators said factored into his loss against Cada in the final hours of the 2009 World Series. Many fans and commentators praised his working stiff style, with some dubbing him [...] "Darvin Gump", a reference to the underdog protagonist of the 1994 drama film, Forrest Gump.

On June 4, Beholder appeared to be facing a much sterner task when she took on the 2015 American Champion three-year-old filly Stellar Wind in the Grade I Vanity Mile at Santa Anita. In a slowly run race, Stevens tracked the early leader, Lost Bus, before taking the lead on the turn and winning [...] "effortlessly" [...] by one and a half lengths from Stellar Wind.

The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If I go through with this, <b>I</b> <b>win</b> big-time. There's no way I lose.

[...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E
