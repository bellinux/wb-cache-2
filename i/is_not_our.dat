500|$|In early March 2017, in an {{interview}} with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, [...] "One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse <b>is)</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> fault. We were violated and it's not right." [...] She said, [...] "I’ve been raped, I’ve been sexually abused as a child and I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t sleep with my boss." [...] She said, [...] "I always thought it was my fault; that I didn’t do or say the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t even know it was rape. They think, ‘It must have been because I said ‘no’ the wrong way.’" ...|$|E
500|$|Ships {{registered}} by the Cambodia Shipping Corporation (CSC) {{were found}} smuggling drugs and cigarettes in Europe, breaking the Iraq oil embargo, {{and engaging in}} human trafficking and prostitution in Europe and Asia. In response to these activities, in 2000, Ahamd Yahya of the Cambodian Ministry of Public Works and Transport told industry publication Fairplay [...] "We don't know or care who owns the ships or whether they're doing 'white' or 'black' business ... it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> concern." [...] Less than two years later, French forces seized the Cambodian-flagged, Greek-owned MV Winner for cocaine smuggling. Shortly after the seizure, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen closed the registry to foreign ships, and Cambodia canceled its contract with CSC shortly thereafter.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{campaign}} as low-key as possible, General Abrams had suggested that the commencement of the incursion be routinely announced from Saigon. At 21:00 on 30 April, however, President Nixon appeared on all three U.S. television networks to announce that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> power but our will and character that is being tested tonight" [...] and that [...] "the time has come for action." [...] He announced his decision to launch American forces into Cambodia with the special objective of capturing COSVN,"the headquarters of the entire communist military operation in South Vietnam." [...] COSVN as a single headquarters for control of PAVN operations in South Vietnam probably did not exist, or, at least, was never found.|$|E
500|$|Through her work, Fonda {{said she}} wants to help abuse victims [...] "realize that [...] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> fault". Fonda said that her {{difficult}} past led her to become such a passionate activist for women’s rights. The actress is an active supporter of the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health, which aims to help prevent teen pregnancy. She {{was a victim of}} the [...] "disease to please" [...] in her early life, which plagued many American females of her generation. [...] Fonda revealed in 2014 that her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, was recurrently sexually abused as young as eight, and this may have led to her suicide when Jane was 12.|$|E
500|$|In Bosnia and Herzegovina, President Alija Izetbegović made a {{televised}} appeal to Bosnian citizens to refuse the draft {{on the grounds}} that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> war". He called it their [...] "right and duty" [...] to resist the [...] "evil deeds" [...] being committed in Croatia and said: [...] "Let those who want it, wage it. We do not want this war." [...] When JNA troops transferred to the front via the Višegrad region of north-eastern Bosnia, local Bosnian Croats and Muslims set up barricades and machine-gun posts. They halted a column of 60 JNA tanks but were dispersed by force the following day. More than 1,000 people had to flee the area. This action, nearly seven months {{before the start of the}} Bosnian War, caused the first casualties of the Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia.|$|E

500|$|Alf Ramsey {{took control}} of the team in 1962, but unlike Winterbottom, Ramsey had been a club manager, winning the League {{championship}} with Ipswich Town. [...] Upon his appointment, he declared England would win the 1966 World Cup. [...] His first match in charge resulted in a 5–2 loss at Parc des Princes against France. England automatically qualified for the 1966 World Cup as hosts and, after a goalless draw in the first match against Uruguay, four consecutive victories saw England through to the final against West Germany. [...] A 4–2 victory, after extra time, won England the World Cup for the only time. As a result of his and England's achievements, Ramsey was awarded a knighthood in 1967. The following year England finished third in the 1968 European Championship in Rome, but Ramsey reflected [...] "We are world champions. [...] Third place <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> real position." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 June 2007, Sony {{issued the}} {{following}} statement: [...] "We {{do not accept}} {{that there is any}} connection between contemporary issues of 21st century Manchester and a work of science fiction in which a fictitious 1950s Britain is under attack by aliens. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> intention to cause offence by using a representation of Manchester Cathedral in chapter eight of the work. If we have done so we sincerely apologise." [...] The apology was also included in an advertisement in a Manchester newspaper. The Dean of the Manchester Cathedral, the Reverend Rogers Govender, said in a statement: [...] "We acknowledge the admission by Sony that the building in the game is Manchester Cathedral. We thank Sony for the apology they have made. However, we do not move from the position that we are against violence and especially the gun violence seen in this portrayal of the Cathedral." [...] On 6 July 2007, Sony issued an unreserved apology to Manchester Cathedral by publishing it in the Manchester Evening News, although they refused to make a donation.|$|E
500|$|Stolar was not {{supportive}} of the Saturn due to his belief that the hardware was poorly designed, and publicly announced at E3 1997 that [...] "The Saturn <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> future." [...] While Stolar had [...] "no interest in lying to people" [...] about the Saturn's prospects, he continued to emphasize quality games for the system, and subsequently reflected that [...] "we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer." [...] At Sony, Stolar opposed the localization of certain Japanese PlayStation titles that he felt would not represent the system well in North America, and he advocated a similar policy for the Saturn during his time at Sega, although he later sought {{to distance himself from}} this perception. These changes were accompanied by a softer image that Sega was beginning to portray in its advertising, including removing the [...] "Sega!" [...] scream and holding press events for the education industry. Marketing for the Saturn in Japan also changed with the introduction of [...] "Segata Sanshiro" [...] (played by Hiroshi Fujioka) as a character in a series of TV advertisements starting in 1997; the character would eventually star in a Saturn video game.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} five years Playford was to remain a backbencher, and to involve himself {{relatively}} little in government matters. His speeches were short, but to the point, and, running against the norm, he often attacked the government itself when he saw fit. The historian Peter Howell said that Playford was [...] "an unusually insolent and disloyal backbencher, always concerned to cut a figure and ridicule his party's leader". A new member's maiden speech is traditionally heard politely without the interruption and heckling prevalent in Australian politics, but Playford's aggressive debut in parliament was not accorded this privilege as [...] "a casual visitor could have mistaken him" [...] for an opposition member. At one point, a visibly angry Premier Butler interjected after Playford attacked the members of the Employment Promotion Council. In his opening address, Playford individually mocked the bureaucrats who comprised various government bodies, and then condemned public transport monopolies, as well as declaring [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> business to worry whether people go broke or not". This comment provoked interjections from both government and opposition members—in the midst of the Great Depression, Playford's unashamed and aggressive promotion of his unbridled laissez faire philosophy stood out amidst the increasing prevalence of government intervention.|$|E
500|$|On 4 August 1914 the King {{wrote in}} his diary, [...] "I held a council at 10.45 to declare war with Germany. It is a terrible {{catastrophe}} but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> fault.... Please to God it may soon be over." [...] From 1914 to 1918, Britain and its allies were {{at war with the}} Central Powers, led by the German Empire. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II, who for the British public came to symbolise all the horrors of the war, was the King's first cousin. The King's paternal grandfather was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; consequently, the King and his children bore the titles Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke and Duchess of Saxony. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the German Dukes of Württemberg. The King had brothers-in-law and cousins who were British subjects but who bore German titles such as Duke and Duchess of Teck, Prince and Princess of Battenberg, and Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein. When H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's [...] "alien and uninspiring court", George famously replied: [...] "I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to long-standing {{disagreements}} with Sega of Japan, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske became {{less interested in}} his position. On July 16, 1996, Sega announced that Shoichiro Irimajiri had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America, while Kalinske would be leaving Sega after September 30 of that year. Sega also announced that Sega Enterprises cofounder David Rosen and Sega of Japan CEO Hayao Nakayama had resigned from their positions as chairman and co-chairman of Sega of America, though both men remained with the company. Bernie Stolar, a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, was named Sega of America's executive {{vice president in charge}} of product development and third-party relations. Stolar did not support the Saturn due to his belief that the hardware was poorly designed and publicly announced at E3 1997 that [...] "The Saturn <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> future." [...] After the launch of the Nintendo 64, sales of the Saturn and Sega's 32-bit software were sharply reduced. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47 percent of the console market, Nintendo controlled 40 percent, and Sega controlled only 12 percent. Neither price cuts nor high-profile games were proving helpful to the Saturn's success. Due to the Saturn's poor performance in North America, Sega of America laid off 60 of its 200 employees in the fall of 1997.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, it was {{reported}} that United continued to harbour plans to increase the capacity of the stadium further, with the next stage pointing to a redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which, unlike the rest of the stadium, remains single tier. A replication of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand development and North-East and North-West Quadrants would see the stadium's capacity rise to an estimated 95,000, which would give it a greater capacity than Wembley Stadium (90,000). Any such development is likely to cost around £100million, due to the proximity of the railway line that runs adjacent to the stadium, and the corresponding need to build over it and thus purchase up to 50 houses {{on the other side of}} the railway. Nevertheless, the Manchester United group property manager confirmed that expansion plans are in the pipeline – linked to profits made from the club's property holdings around Manchester – saying [...] "There is a strategic plan for the stadium... It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>our</b> intention to stand still". One criticism of the plans, however, is that increasing the height of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand would further reduce the amount of light coming onto the pitch, which has caused problems in similarly large stadia – such as Wembley Stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the San Siro; according to Alex Ferguson, the developments on the other stands have already caused problems. It was also suggested that, should such an expansion take place, Old Trafford could be used instead of Wembley for big matches such as England internationals – in order to increase the ability of fans in the north of the country to watch England play; and FA Cup semi-finals – to maintain the prestige of the national stadium for the final.|$|E
