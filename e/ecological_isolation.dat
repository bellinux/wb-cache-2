40|$|Context: Ecological {{speciation}} {{is commonly}} inferred {{with evidence of}} the parallel evolution of pre-mating isolation: individuals from populations in similar environments show higher mating success in laboratory experiments than do individuals from different environments.

Solution: We show how comparisons of mate preference functions among replicate populations in divergent environments {{can be used to}} reveal subtle signatures of ecological speciation.

40|$|The role of {{chromosomal}} inversions in {{adaptation and}} speciation is controversial. Historically, inversions {{were thought to}} contribute to these processes either by directly causing hybrid sterility or by facilitating the maintenance of co-adapted gene complexes. Because inversions suppress recombination when heterozygous, a recently proposed local adaptation mechanism predicts that they will spread if they capture alleles at multiple loci involved in divergent adaptation to contrasting environments. Many empirical studies have found inversion polymorphisms linked to putatively adaptive phenotypes or distributed along environmental clines. However, direct involvement of an inversion in local adaptation and consequent <b>ecological</b> reproductive <b>isolation</b> has not to our knowledge been demonstrated in nature.

5000|$|Whether {{the drug}} and non-drug, {{cultivated}} and wild types of Cannabis constitute a single, highly variable species, or the genus is polytypic {{with more than one}} species, has been a subject of debate for well over two centuries. This is a contentious issue because there is no universally accepted definition of a species. One widely applied criterion for species recognition is that species are [...] "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups." [...] Populations that are physiologically capable of interbreeding, but morphologically or genetically divergent and isolated by geography or ecology, are sometimes considered to be separate species. Physiological barriers to reproduction are not known to occur within Cannabis, and plants from widely divergent sources are interfertile. However, physical barriers to gene exchange (such as the Himalayan mountain range) might have enabled Cannabis gene pools to diverge before the onset of human intervention, resulting in speciation. It remains controversial whether sufficient morphological and genetic divergence occurs within the genus as a result of geographical or <b>ecological</b> <b>isolation</b> to justify recognition of more than one species.|$|E

5000|$|Bombus {{individuals}} forage {{in small}} areas of several square meters for many days. Small areas {{they have been}} found to feed in are separated by brush from neighboring spaces, displaying <b>ecological</b> <b>isolation.</b> In a study examining diet preferences of Bombus hortorum, it was determined that foraging behavior of individual bumblebees affects isolation and hybridization of flowering plants. In comparing choices of Rhinanthus plant species, B. hortorum queens and workers showed a strong preference for R. serotinus which has a long corolla length, but it easily reached with B. hortorum’s long tongue length. [...] Observations of B. hortorum foraging patterns reveal that they are nototribic, or upright pollinators. Thus, when feeding, pollen is deposited on their head and thorax rather than on their legs and the underside of their abdomen as seen in sternotribic, or inverted foragers. When feeding on plants in quick continuation, bumblebees have their proboscis extended as they approach the flower. Data from this study reveals that when pollinating, Bombus hortorum visit eighteen flowers per minute, which is more than other species. This large quantity is most likely due to the greater efficiency B. hortorum experience by having longer tongues. Bombus hortorum play a prominent role in causing cross-pollination in Rhinanthus flowers and thus, make hybridization possible.|$|E
5000|$|Wright {{introduced}} {{two different}} models of population structure, one not taking short-distance dispersal into account and one model incorporating short-distance dispersal. The [...] "island model" [...] is quite artificial and proposes {{the idea that}} a population is divided into two geographically, unique subpopulations (islands) with random mating occurring with exchange of individuals occurring when a migrant is drawn randomly from the total population.In a more realistic model, where short-distance dispersal is taken into account, a population is compiled of continuously distributed individuals over a region of space. Populations in remote locations may become differentiated simply by isolation by distance, restricting the probability of individuals mating with one another. Local populations are small in comparison to the total population and reproduction occurs solely within the local population. This <b>ecological</b> <b>isolation</b> by distance, according to Wright, can create genetic differentiation among subpopulations, leading to evolutionary change. Individuals within the subpopulation are neighbors in the sense that their gametes may come together and inbreeding within the subpopulation increases homozygosity. Wright’s statistical theory for isolation by distance looks at population genetic consequences measured by F-statistics where the correlation of randomly uniting gametes within a subpopulation relative to those of the total population is the FST value.|$|E

This study examines whether <b>ecological</b> <b>isolation</b> can explain the continuing integrity of Silene dioica and S. latifolia where floral isolation is weak and hybrids are fully viable. Eighteen small replicate founder populations of 6 individuals (3 males and 3 females) of either S. latifolia, S. dioica or hybrids were created in woodland and in open sites in southern UK. Survival, reproduction and introgression of these populations were examined over 9 years. S. latifolia and hybrid plants suffered higher mortality than S. dioica in woodland. In open sites, there was extensive introgression, with few or no pure S. latifolia or S. dioica surviving {{by the end of}} the experiment. The experiment suggests that the integrity of S. dioica is maintained by its ability to survive in shaded habitats where S. latifolia and hybrids cannot persist.

40|$|In <b>ecological</b> speciation, {{reproductive}} <b>isolation</b> evolves as {{a consequence}} of adaptation to different selective environments. A frequent contributor to this process is the evolution of positive assortative mate choice between ecotypes. We tested this expectation for lake and inlet stream threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from the Misty system (Vancouver Island, Canada), which show strong genetically based adaptive divergence and little genetic exchange in nature. This, and work on other stickleback systems, led us to expect positive assortative mating. Yet, our standard “no-choice” laboratory experiment on common-garden fish revealed no evidence for this—despite divergence in traits typically mediating assortative mating in stickleback. These results remind us that divergent natural selection may not inevitably lead to the evolution of positive assortative mate choice.

The class of Bacillariophyta (diatoms) has distinct ecological preferences and tolerances, making them useful indicators of contemporary <b>ecological</b> conditions. <b>Isolation</b> and selection of microorganisms is the first step in bioremediation. Palmer assessed the tolerance of algal species to organic pollution, and incorporated the data into an organic pollution index for rating water quality. Biovolume is used as a measure of relative algal biomass. The present work was conducted to isolate and select the tolerance diatoms from Kermanshah Oil Refinery wastewater treatment systems. This helped to improve diatoms community of Iran and prepare a list of tolerance diatom in bioremediation. Materials and methods: Wastewater samples were collected aseptically at six points in and transferred to the laboratory. The serial diluted were prepared in BG broth, and then samples were cultured into Bristol agar and BG agar with chloramphenicol. Finally they were cultured in NA to assurance that there are no bacteria. The brown diatoms colonies were cultured in new plates. The samples were observed through microscope, and keys were used to classify them. Also biovolume according to geometric shapes (um 3) were calculated. Results: There was no bacterial growth after 48 hours thus this method is an applied method in order to isolate diatoms. A variety of classes were observed such as Navicula, Nitzschia and Frustulia. Analysis of the biovolume revealed that the species of Fragilaria capucina has the maximum biovolume. Discussion and conclusion: This research revealed that the diatoms diversity in Kermanshah Oil Refinery wastewater treatment systems is low due to the high rate of organic pollution according to Palmer index. Also Pinnularia, Fragilaria can be used in the list of tolerance diatoms...|$|R
