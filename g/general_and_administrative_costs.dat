40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find the indication of sticky cost behavior in Indonesian manufacturing. The cost stickiness can be indicated by asymetric reaction of costs to changes. This study employs Anderson, Banker, Janakiraman (ABJ) model to identify the sticky cost behaviour on selling expense <b>and</b> <b>general</b> <b>administrative</b> expense. The samples of this study are 351 firm years of manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange during 2009 - 2012. This study found that selling, <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>cost</b> increase 0, 475 percent and cost of good sold increase 1, 063 percent when sales increase 1 percent.

At the time of Compaq's acquisition announcement, DEC had a total of 53,500 employees, down from a peak of 130,000 in the 1980s, but it still employed about 65% more people than Compaq to produce about half the volume of sales revenues.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} amount of discussion on the topic of short-run asymmetric cost response to activity changes. This kind of cost behaviour has been labelled as cost stickiness in the accounting literature. The model of cost stickiness suggests that the direction of the change in cost driver influences the magnitude of the change in the sense that cost are found to increase more than they decrease from an equivalent activity rise and fall. This is what differentiates the model from the traditional textbook cost model, which argues that cost changes follow linearly and proportionally the changes in the cost driver. Prior literature successfully finds cost stickiness in cross sectional samples and different individual factors that influence its existence. This study contributes to the literature by considering whether the existence and the degree of cost stickiness is conditional to external circumstances in a field specific sample. The purpose is to evaluate the influence of economic downturn to the existence and degree variation of cost stickiness. The focus is on degree variations before and after the financial crisis of 2008 in the field of electronic equipment. This study is conducted through an empirical model that evaluates selling, <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>cost</b> changes relative to contemporaneous sales revenue changes. The data sample consist of US listed companies in the field of electronic equipment during 2001 - 2015. The data is derived from Compustat database of Wharton Research Data Services. The results of the study suggest that economic downturn influences the degree of cost stickiness but the variation is subject to the field in question. No statistically significant results are found in the degree variation of the field of electronic equipment. However, results from additionally conducted robustness test identify that the field of retail and wholesale, shows more cost stickiness after the beginning of the crisis than before it. This study strengthens the findings of prior literature and offers evidence of the influence of external factors to the degree of cost stickiness...|$|R
40|$|Some studies {{indicate}} that selling, <b>general,</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrative</b> (SG&A) <b>cost</b> have sticky characteristics. A cost is sticky if it increases as the activity increases, {{but it does not}} decrease as the activity decreases, in the same proportion as it increases. Different from previous studies that focus solely on SG&A costs in, mostly, manufacturing companies, we specifically focus on specific cost and specific industry. In this case, we focus on compensation costs in banks from four South East Asian countries. We choose banks’ executive compensations since banks in South East Asia have been publicly reporting their compensation. Executive compensation itself is a component of SG&A, so it may have sticky characteristic with it. We apply bootstrap method to tackle small sample problem in every country. Results show that executive compensations are not sticky, but, on the contrary, anti-sticky since the compensation decreases faster when the revenue decreases than its increases when the revenue increases. This finding gives a new perspective on the characteristics of executive compensation expenses as a part of SG&A cost...|$|R

Federal contractors must deal with an exceptional amount of paperwork and bureaucracy relative to firms that deal only with the private sector. I investigate whether federal contractor’s costs have different responses to revenue increases and decreases. I start by generating a set of federal focus firms that have a business unit name that incorporates the words federal, military, and defense. These firms have built their organizational structure around federal contracting. Because extra paperwork costs are likely {{to be part of the}} Selling, <b>General,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Administrative</b> (SGA) <b>costs,</b> I estimate a model of SGA sticky costs. I find that when revenues increase, federal focus firms have greater increases in SGA costs compared to controls. This increase is consistent with higher fulfillment costs for federal contracts. When revenues decrease, federal focus firms have a much lower decrease in SGA costs compared to controls. Federal focus firms have extremely sticky SGA costs. This stickiness is consistent with federal focus firms having higher fixed costs in their procurement systems. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R

40|$|In {{fundamental}} analysis, it is customary {{to interpret}} {{an increase in}} the ratio of selling, <b>general,</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>costs</b> to sales (the SG&A cost ratio) between two periods as a negative signal about future profit-ability and firm value. Implicit in this interpretation is an expectation that SG&A costs should normally move proportionately with increases or decreases in revenues, and that {{an increase in the}} ratio signals man-agement inefficiency in controlling costs. While this expectation provides a straightforward interpretation for analysis purposes, it ignores impor-tant aspects of SG&A cost behavior. We observe that both fixity of costs and stickiness of costs may cause the ratio of SG&A costs to sales to increase, rather than decrease proportionately with sales, when revenue declines. Sticky costs, in fact, may represent deliberate retention of SG&A resources based on managers ’ expectations that revenue will increase in the future. In this case, an increase in the SG&A cost ratio may actually convey positive information about managers ’ expectations of future earnings. We estimate an earnings prediction model and find that future earnings are positively related to changes in the SG&A cost ratio in periods in which revenue declines, inconsistent with traditional interpretation of SG&A cost changes. We also find that abnormal posi-tive returns may be earned on portfolios formed by going long on firms with high increases in the SG&A cost ratio (and short on firms with low increases in the SG&A cost ratio) in revenue-declining periods...|$|E

The goal of this {{research is}} to identify the cost environment component, and to measure the correlation between environmental cost and improving financial performance of companies. Analysis tool used is the profitability ratio analysis which is consists of five ratio. They are; Operating Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, Asset Turn Over, Return On Assets, and Return On Equity. Besides also used Pearson Correlation to measure the closeness relationships between the environment cost and financial performance which is measured by the ratio of profitability to increase the company's financial performance. The results of the analysis indicate that the cost environment in the PG Kebon Agung Malang does not have the post and consists of eight components, namely Daily Workers, overtime LMG (Outside Giling Period), overtime DMG (In Giling Period), Contract Workers, Electricity and Water, Cost of Testing (Water Quality), Materials Chemistry DMG (In Giling period), and Repairs / Maintenance Machine. Environmental costs on PG Kebon Agung Malang included in manufacturing and operational costs. Proportion with the increase in sales does not increase the cost of comparable neighborhood, so the company can be losers. The calculation of the ratio indicates that the financial performance of financial PG Kebon Agung Malang within six years (2002 - 2007) continues to increase from year to year.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how firm-level corporate expenditure represented by R&D, capital expenditure (CAPEX) <b>and</b> selling, <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrative</b> (SGA) <b>costs</b> responds to stock price informativeness. Using {{data from the}} United States public listed companies for the years 2003 to 2009 covering the post-Sarbanes Oxley Act period, a current year’s stock price informativeness, proxied by idiosyncratic volatility, {{is found to be}} negatively associated with the subsequent year’s R&D expenditure and SGA costs. However, it was observed there is no relationship between a current year’s idiosyncratic volatility and CAPEX level of the subsequent year. Additional insights are revealed by using a change model which examines the relationship between changes in a current year’s stock price informativeness and changes in the subsequent year’s R&D and SGA expenditure. The results exhibit that when firm-level stock price informativeness is strengthening, a change in the current year’s idiosyncratic volatility is positively related to changes in R&D and SGA expenditure in the following year. When stock price informativeness is deteriorating, firm managers do not react immediately to modify R&D and SGA costs. This asymmetric cost response is attributable, in part, to the cost “stickiness” behaviour of firm managers when it comes to changing R&D investment and SGA costs. These managers may be reluctant to increase corporate expenditure when stock price informativeness worsens as they need to assess whether the declining idiosyncratic volatility is temporary or permanent in nature. It is found that firm managers will only react by intensifying R&D expenditure and SGA costs when it is critically compelling, that is, when the relative idiosyncratic volatility (1 -R 2) drops significantly by 20 per cent. This finding is consistent with the learning theory that managers learn about firms’ fundamental values from the market’s feedback and they incorporate this new private information to make efficient corporate decisions in R&D expenditure and SGA costs. However, this study finds that firm managers do not rely on the input from the capital markets to make their capital investment decisions. Given the significance of stock price informativeness in enhancing allocation of firms’ scarce resources, this study provides useful insights and understanding on how firms modify their corporate expenditure in response to changes in stock price informativeness. Further analyses show that the relationship between stock price informativeness and corporate expenditure is dependent on information asymmetry, proxied by firm size, analyst following and bid-ask spreads. The analyses highlight that managers respond and learn more quickly from the new firm-specific information available in small firms and in firms with low analyst following as well as in firms with high bid-ask spread. These findings are consistent with the learning theory and information asymmetry theory. Consequently, firm managers react more “aggressively” by altering R&D expenditure and SGA costs in the subsequent year as stock price informativeness of a current year changes...|$|R
