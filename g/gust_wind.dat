This estimate correlates with the Bureau of Meteorology's re-analysis of Cyclone Larry at landfall. Their reviews of data suggest that Larry was a Category 4 system when it crossed the coast.

The distributed pressure acted on the vehicle side surface {{is equivalent to the}} six-component force on vehicle gravity center. The six-component force are explored and compared in different Force level of <b>gust</b> <b>wind.</b> The results show that the lateral force Fy and yaw moment Mz vary with v shape and Λ shape under <b>gust</b> <b>wind,</b> respectively.

40|$|AbstractIn East Asia {{the large}} range dust storm almost occur after cold front passage in spring. Here, {{we try to}} find the {{mechanism}} of dust entrainment by the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> by analyzing observation data and numerical simulation result. First, the ultra-sonic anemometer-thermometer data during the dust storm periods in 2000 - 2004 have been analyzed. It is revealed that the air motion during dust storm can be divided into three parts, the turbulent small eddies, the <b>gust</b> <b>wind,</b> and large scale basic flow. In the lower part of atmospheric boundary layer, the descending component of basic flow suppresses the dust particles keeping them within the bottom layers. But the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> has coherent structure, and due to the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> not turbulence, the dust can entrain from lower to upper levels. Second, we use Lagrangian Stochastic Model to simulate the particle trajectory during dust storm period. The wind condition comes from the observation wind profiles. It includes basic flow profile, <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> profile and turbulent intensity. When there are only turbulent fluctuations, particles have random trajectories and can reach 250 m height. Once adding <b>gust</b> <b>wind,</b> particles are carried in the air stream and have the potential to be transported to great heights (higher than 500 m) and over great distances. But if no <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> and adding descending component of basic flow, particles are only accumulated in the bottom of layer. The simulation result shows that the mechanism of dust entrainment during strong wind is mainly due to the <b>gust</b> <b>wind...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Dines {{pressure}} tube anemometer {{was the primary}} wind speed recording instrument used in Australia until it was replaced by Synchrotac cup anemometers in the 1990 s. Simultaneous observations of the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds recorded using both types of anemometers during tropical cyclones have, however, {{raised questions about the}} equivalency of the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds recorded using the two instruments. An experimental study of the response of both versions of the Dines anemometer used in Australia shows that the response of the anemometer is dominated by the motion of the float manometer used to record the wind speed. The amplitude response function shows the presence of two resonant peaks, with the amplitude and frequency of the peaks depending on the instrument version and the mean wind speed. Comparison of the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds recorded using Dines and Synchrotac anemometers using random process and linear system theory shows that, on average, the low-speed Dines anemometer records values 2 %– 5 % higher than those recorded using a Synchrotac anemometer under the same conditions, while the high-speed Dines anemometer records values 3 %– 7 % higher, depending on the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity. These differences are exacerbated with the adoption of the WMO-recommended 3 -s moving average <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speed when reporting the Synchrotac anemometer <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds, rising to 6 %– 12 % and 11 %– 19 % for low- and high-speed Dines anemometers, respectively. These results are consistent with both field observations and an independent extreme value analysis of simultaneously observed <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds at seven sites in northern Australia...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of IMAC-XX: A Conference on Structural Dynamics, Los Angeles, CA, 4 - 7 February 2002 This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation for determining dynamic responses of coupled vehicle-cable stayed bridge systems under <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> {{in the time}} domain. Road vehicles are idealised as {{a combination of a}} number of rigid bodies connected by a series of springs and dampers. A cablestayed bridge is modeled using the conventional finite element approach taking into account geometric nonlinearity. The wind forces acting on the bridge include steady-state wind forces, buffeting forces and self-exciting forces. The wind forces acting on the vehicle are expressed as a function of aerodynamic parameters obtained from wind tunnel tests. The equations of motion of coupled vehiclebridge systems under <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> are then established using a fully computerised approach. The application to a real long span cable stayed bridge with a group of moving road vehicles under <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> demonstrates that the proposed method and the associated computer program can efficiently predict dynamic responses of coupled vehicle-cable stayed bridge under <b>gust</b> <b>wind.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates, {{by means}} of Singular Value Decomposition analysis, the springtime {{relationships}} between the mean sea-level pressure field over the North Atlantic and the regional wind gusts over the Iberian Peninsula, identifying the main atmospheric circulation patterns linked to <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speed anomaly configurations. The statistical significance of the obtained modes is investigated {{by means of}} Monte Carlo approach. The analysis highlighted that the covariability is dominated by two main large-scale features of the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. The first mode relates to Iberian <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds to the Scandinavian pattern (SCAND), linking the large-scale pattern to above-normal wind gusts. The second covariability mode, associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern, correlates with maximum wind speeds over Iberia. An enhanced spring NAO pattern is related to positive (negative) wind gust correlations over northern (southern) Iberia. To find true relationships between large-scale atmospheric field and the <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds, composite maps were built up to give an average atmospheric circulation associated with coherent wind gust variability over Iberia...|$|E

40|$|A set of velocity-azimuth display (VAD) {{wind speed}} {{profiles}} derived from coastal Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) systems was paired with Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) 10 -m standardized mean and nonstandardized <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds measured within 10 km of nearby WSR- 88 Ds. The {{goal was to}} formulate an appropriate methodology and empirical relationships to estimate overland near-surface wind conditions in landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) using VAD tropical cyclone boundary layer (TCBL) lower-tropospheric wind measurements. A total of 17 TCs and seven ASOS/WSR- 88 D sites were used to construct a unique comparative dataset. Four estimation methods including the log and power laws, mean and <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speed ratio (WSR) methods, and curve fitting with linear regression and polynomial fits were evaluated. Results from the evaluation show that WSR- 88 D site-specific linear regression equations using a VAD 0 - 200 -m layer average wind speed and nonzero intercepts provided the most accurate predictions of the ASOS 10 -m standardized mean wind speed. Results also show that a non-site-specific linear regression model using a VAD 0 - 500 -m mean boundary layer (MBL) wind speed and nonzero intercept is 1. 07 % more accurate than using a single-gust WSR to predict ASOS 10 -m nonstandardized <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds. Only 2. 15 % of the ASOS 10 -m nonstandardized maximum 3 -s <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speeds were found to exceed the VAD 0 - 500 -m MBL wind speed, indicating that the VAD 0 - 500 -m MBL wind speed represents a viable source of momentum available for transport to the surface {{in the form of}} a gust...|$|E
40|$|The weather {{forecast}} centers in Australia {{and many other}} countries use a scale of cyclone intensity categories (categories 1 - 5) in their cyclone advisories, which {{are considered to be}} indicative of the cyclone damage potential.

In a recent research project involving computer modeling of cyclonic wind forces on roof claddings and fatigue damage to claddings, it was found that cyclone damage not only depends on the maximum <b>gust</b> <b>wind</b> speed, but also on two other cyclone parameters, namely, the forward speed and radius to maximum winds.
