40|$|In the {{presented}} {{study we}} have developed and implemented a methodology for ellipsometry measurements at liquid interfaces {{that makes it possible}} to determine the amount adsorbed without assumptions of refractive index or thickness of the adsorbed layer. It was demonstrated that this is possible by combined measurements from different aqueous phases, H 2 O and D 2 O, which were shown to have sufficiently different refractive indices. The methodology was tested by studying adsorption of two types of nonionic poly(ethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> surfactants, CnH 2 n+ 1 (OC 2 H 4) (m) OH or CnEm at the decane-aqueous interface, where C 12 E 5 was adsorbed from the oil phase and C 18 E 50 from the aqueous phase. The observed plateau values of the adsorbed amounts were 1. 38 and 0. 93 Mg/M- 2 for C 12 E 5 and C 18 E 50, respectively, which is in agreement with the corresponding values of 1. 49 and 1. 15 Mg/M- 2 obtained from applying the Gibbs equation to interfacial tension data for the same systems. We will briefly discuss the adsorption behavior in relation to the molecular structure of the surfactant and the phase behavior of the oil - surfactant- aqueous systems in relation to our experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the short {{non-ionic}} amphiphiles: n-alc. (n = 3 - 6), polypropylene <b>glycol</b> <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> (CnPOm, for n = 3, 4; m = 1 - 3) and polyethylene glycol (CnEOm, for n = 3; m = 1 and n = 4; m = 1 - 3) on the crit. micellar concn. (CMC) of SDS in aq. solns. at 25 ° was detd. exptl. by measuring the elec. conductance. There is a linear relation between the no. of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol groups and {{the slope of the}} CMC decrease with amphiphile concn. The propylene glycol group appears to be more efficient in lowering the CMC than the ethylene glycol group which is less hydrophobic. Considering the polypropylene glycol alkyl ethers as the condensation of an n-alc. and a certain no. of propylene glycol groups it was possible to classify these amphiphiles according to their efficiency to decrease the CMC of SDS: C 4 PO 3 > C 6 PO 0 > C 4 PO 2 > C 3 PO 3 > C 4 PO 1 > C 3 PO 2 > C 5 PO 0 > C 3 PO 1 > C 4 PO 0 > C 3 PO 0. This trend is different from the series of hydrophobicity of these compds., inferred recently from water/CnPOm binary phase diagrams: C 6 PO 0 > C 5 PO 0 > C 4 PO 4 > C 4 PO 3 > C 4 PO 1 > C 4 PO 0 > C 3 PO 3 > C 3 PO 2 > C 3 PO 1 > C 3 PO 0. The hydrophobicity of these compds. increases much more with the addn. of 1 C in the alkyl chain than with the addn. of one propylene glycol group. The co-surfactant behavior of some of these mols. is also discussed and compared in terms of the topol. of their ternary phase diagrams SDS/water/co-surfactant. Some striking differences in the co-surfactant behavior of the studied amphiphiles are found between their CMC decrease property and the topol. of their corresponding ternary systems...|$|E

40|$|Frothers are {{surfactants}} {{commonly used}} to reduce bubble size in mineral flotation. This paper describes a methodology to characterize frothers by relating impact on bubble size reduction represented by CCC (critical coalescence concentration) to frother structure represented by HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance). Thirty-six surfactants were tested from three frother families: Aliphatic Alcohols, Polypropylene <b>Glycol</b> <b>Alkyl</b> <b>Ethers</b> and Polypropylene <b>Glycols,</b> covering a range in alkyl groups (represented by n, the number of carbon atoms) and number of Propylene Oxide groups (represented by m). The Sauter mean size (D 32) was derived from bubble size distribution measured in a 0. 8 m 3 mechanical flotation cell. The D 32 vs. concentration data were fitted to a 3 -parameter model to determine CCC 95, the concentration giving 95 % reduction in bubble size compared to water only. It was shown that each family exhibits a unique CCC 95 -HLB relationship dependent on n and m. Empirical models were developed to predict CCC 95 either from HLB or directly from n and m. Commercial frothers of known family were shown to fit the relationships. Use of the model to predict D 32 is illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alkoxyethanols (ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>alkyl</b> <b>ethers)</b> {{are used}} as {{mixtures}} {{in a variety of}} industrial and household products. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the effects of 2 -methoxyethanol (ME) and 2 -ethoxyethanol (EE) on hematological changes induced by 2 -butoxyethanol (BE) in rats. Material and Methods: Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats treated subcutaneously with BE, ME, and EE alone (in the dose of 0. 75 mM/kg/day and 1. 25 mM/kg/day) and their mixtures with the molar ratio 1 : 1, for 4 weeks. Hematological analyses were performed on the day 0, 4, 11, 18, and 29. Hemoglobin (HGB) concentration in the urine was also determined in the rats treated with BE alone and co-exposed to BE and ME and also BE and EE. Results: The rats co-exposed to BE and ME or BE and EE demonstrated significantly less pronounced hematological changes in comparison with animals treated with BE alone at the beginning of exposure. At the later period the hematological alterations in the same animals were markedly pronounced and progressing with exposure time. The rats co-exposed to BE and ME or BE and EE did not demonstrate hemoglobinuria. Conclusions: ME or EE co-administered to rats with BE lead to the amelioration in the majority of the hematological parameters {{at the beginning of the}} exposure. The hematological changes at the end of the co-exposure to BE and ME or BE and EE were markedly pronounced. The effects observed in this study appear to be related with metabolic interactions of the examined ether. Med Pr 2015; 66 (3) : 303 – 31...|$|R
40|$|Surfactant {{segregation}} in solid polymer films {{is a little}} studied area of scientific research. This investigation launches an initial exploration into the behaviour of surfactant and plasticiser (glycerol) molecules in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. By understanding the nature of segregation within these systems, information regarding the compatibility of components can be gained. A greater understanding of what dictates compatibility and small molecule {{segregation in}} polymers is of importance to many industrial products and processes. Using a series of ion beam analysis and neutron reflectometry experiments the segregation behaviour of three non-ionic, and two ionic surfactants is studied in great detail, both in binary non-plasticised and ternary plasticised PVA films. In order to use these techniques effectively, samples were mostly spin-cast, silicon substrate bound polymer films, of thickness < 200 nm. The non-ionic surfactants studied were a series of poly(oxyethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>alkyl</b> <b>ethers</b> with a 12 -carbon lipophilic tail-group (C 12 Ex). Each of these surfactants exhibited spontaneous segregation to the air and/or substrate interface of the polymer film in binary films with PVA. Upon the introduction of plasticiser under ambient conditions, the amount of surface segregating surfactant is reduced, causing a greater concentration {{to be present in}} the bulk. However, when studied under relative humidity control the opposite effect is realised, and the presence of water in the films causes increased surfactant segregation. The ionic surfactants studied are cetlytrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). In binary films with PVA, CTAB shows no segregating nature, until glycerol is introduced, at which point substrate and surface segregation is induced. SDS shows development of significant surfactant-plasticiser multi-lamella structures {{on the surface of the}} thin films upon the introduction of the glycerol. SDS-glycerol structures like this, with interstitial regions of plasticiser stabilising the surfactant lamellae are unlike anything seen on the surface of a solid polymer film before. Both of these features infer a complex array of interactions with the plasticiser. Surface energy and compatibility arguments are provided throughout to explain the diverse range of surfactant behaviours discovered in this work. Where surface energy is believed to be the driving force of surface segregation, with lower energy components segregating more, and compatibility to be the force which dictates how segregation behaves upon the introduction of plasticiser. Compatibility arguments are mostly comprised of the hydrogen bonding potential of the compounds within the films, where strong interactions between the polymer, plasticiser and surfactant give rise to increased compatibility, and therefore reduced segregation. Through this work, new, exciting information on the nature of small molecules in polymer systems is realised...|$|R

In the present study several structurally related <b>alkyl</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>ethers</b> were examined for their ability to block junction-mediated intercellular communication. Interruption of intercellular communication was measured in vitro by an assay that depends on the transfer of metabolites via gap junctions, i. e., metabolic cooperation.

The potencies of the compounds were inversely related to the length of the aliphatic chain, the dose required for maximum blockage increasing as the aliphatic chain shortened. Some differences in the maximum amount of blockage were detected, but these were not consistent and hence were not considered significant. Cytotoxicity, as measured by cell survival, was also related to the structure of the compound, generally increasing with increased length of the aliphatic chain.
