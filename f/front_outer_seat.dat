5000|$|In 1974, GM {{made its}} [...] "Air Cushion Restraint System" [...] (ACRS) {{available}} as a regular production option (RPO code AR3) in full-size Cadillacs, Buick and Oldsmobile models. The GM cars from the 1970s equipped with ACRS had a driver-side airbag, a driver-side knee restraint (which consists of a padded lower dashboard), and a passenger-side airbag. The passenger-side airbag protects both front passengers and unlike most newer ones, it integrated a knee cushion and a torso cushion, and it also had dual stage deployment which varied depending on {{the force of the}} impact. The cars equipped with ACRS had lap belts for all seating positions but they did not have shoulder belts. Shoulder belts were already mandatory equipment in the United States on closed cars without airbags for the driver and <b>outer</b> <b>front</b> passenger <b>seating</b> positions, but GM chose to market its airbags as a substitute for shoulder belts. Prices for this option on Cadillac models were USD$225 in 1974, USD$300 in 1975, and USD$340 in 1976.|$|R

The possibility of folding down the backrest, and then folding the entire seat forwards, has not been changed. Once the seats have been folded over and forwards in this way, they can be removed {{by means of a}} simple release function.|$|R
5000|$|Differences {{compared}} to the VarioFlex system used in the Roomster: the cushion of the middle seat has been repositioned {{so that it is}} 70 mm (2.76 in) more towards the back {{compared to}} the <b>outer</b> <b>seat</b> cushions (in the Roomster it is level); the cushion of the middle seat is approximately 35 mm longer than the cushion in the Roomster; after the middle seat is removed, the <b>outer</b> <b>seats</b> can be moved towards the centre by 80 mm (in the Roomster by 110 mm / 4.33 in).|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} automotive {{steel wheel}} rim {{is made from}} a rectangular sheet metal. The metal plate is bent to produce a cylindrical sleeve with the two free edges of the sleeve welded together. At least one cylindrical flow spinning operation is carried out to obtain a given thickness profile of the sleeve—in particular comprising in the zone intended to constitute the <b>outer</b> <b>seat</b> an angle of inclination relative to the axial direction. The sleeve is then shaped to obtain the rims on each side with a radially inner cylindrical wall in the zone of the <b>outer</b> <b>seat</b> and with a radially outer [...] wall inclined at an angle corresponding to the standard inclination of the rim seats. The rim is then calibrated.|$|R
50|$|The M30 {{came with}} a driver's airbag and ABS (anti-lock brakes) as {{standard}} equipment, though it lacked belt pretensioners, and had no rollover protection on the convertible. All M30s came with 3-point self-locking seatbelts located at each <b>outer</b> <b>seat,</b> and the rear-center seat had an adjustable lapbelt.|$|R

50|$|Kryptodrakon has an {{estimated}} wingspan of 1.47 m. Its fourth metacarpal is relatively slender and elongated, a strong indication that Kryptodrakon is a pterodactyloid. The fourth metacarpal has a minimum length of 72.2 millimetres, while the humerus has {{an estimated}} length of between 75 and 86 millimetres. These relative proportions {{are within the}} range of pterodactyloids. The radius shows an autapomorphy: it possesses an extra lump on the <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> lower side. The skeleton shows no signs of pneumatisation.|$|R
30|$|The {{construction}} {{method that}} connected a lining fabric {{to the outer}} shell fabric was separate over-locking sewing steps (the front lining was overlocked to <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> shell, the back was overlocked to the back outer shell), then all were sewn together (84.6 %, 11 out of 13). The important factors {{on the length of}} the lining pattern were “the comfortableness on the knee area” (53.8 %, 7 out of 13) and “product cost by fabric consumption” (30.8 %, 4 out of 13).|$|R

5000|$|Averostra, or [...] "bird snouts", is a clade that {{includes}} most theropod dinosaurs {{that have a}} promaxillary fenestra (fenestra promaxillaris), an extra opening in the <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> side of the maxilla, the bone that makes up the upper jaw. Two groups of averostrans, the Ceratosauria and the Orionides, survived into the Cretaceous period. When the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event occurred, ceratosaurians and two groups of orionideans within the clade Coelurosauria, the Tyrannosauroidea and Maniraptoriformes, were still extant. Only one subgroup of maniraptoriformes, Aves, survived the extinction event and persisted to the present day.|$|R

50|$|To {{support the}} {{cylindrical}} rim structure, a disc {{is made by}} stamping a metal plate. It has to have appropriate holes for the center hub and lug nuts. The radial outer surface of the wheel disk has a cylindrical geometry to fit inside the rim. The rim and wheel disk are assembled by fitting together under the <b>outer</b> <b>seat</b> of the rim and the assembly welded together. The disk is welded in place such that {{the center of the}} wheel is equal {{to the center of the}} hub. The distance of the disc to the back edge of the rim is called 'offset', or ET, from German Einpresstiefe.|$|R

25|$|Parts of {{this record}} are lost. Kharavela is {{mentioned}} as Bhikshuraja (the king of monks), a worshipper of all sects, the possessor of an invincible army and an illustrious king in general. According to Bhagwan Lal, the record mentions {{that he did}} some work near the <b>outer</b> <b>seat</b> close to the Arhat temple on the Kumari Hill. He organized an assembly of scholars and ascetics, and commissioned the construction of something (probably a cave) by skillful workmen. He also commissioned erection of pillars in Vaiduryagarbha in Patalaka and Chetaka (probably names of caves). This work was executed in 165th year, after 164 years of Maurya rule had passed. Two ancestors of Kharavela are mentioned: Khemraja and Vriddharaja.|$|R

5000|$|The Shuttle {{was subject}} to several minor facelifts and running changes over its {{production}} run. In the middle of 1983, a centre front seat was added. This consisted of two <b>outer</b> bucket <b>seats</b> and a centre bench seat, giving {{the impression of a}} single bench.|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} the few blades {{signed by}} Masamune that is not in question. It was bought by Toyotomi Hidetsugu in 1601 for 500 Kan and was passed to Shogun Ieyasu and from him to Maeda Toshiie. Maeda Toshitsune {{presented}} it again to the Shogun, possibly on his retirement. Later, the sword was handed down among the Owari Tokugawa. This blade is a tantō approximately 25 cm (8 sun 6.5 bun) with a carving of roots on the Omote (<b>Front,</b> <b>outer</b> edge) side. It also has chopstick like grooves (Gomabashi 護摩箸) on the back and a Dragon at the ura part of blade (Kurikara 倶利伽羅). The blade features an engraving of Fudo Myo-o, the buddhist deity which gives this blade its name.|$|R

5000|$|The Star Bird manual {{describes}} it as [...] "THE AMAZING SPACESHIP with realistic engine sounds and flashing laser blasts". The toy was constructed in three main pieces: the front inner hull which held the electronics and front lasers, the <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> hull (a thin plastic shell over the inner hull), the main body consisting of the center stalk like section and wings. A molded plastic engine piece fitted into {{the rear of the}} main body and was removable. The toy is only used in three configurations: the Star Bird which consists of all available pieces, the Star Bird Fighter which is mostly only the front hull attached to the bare engine piece, and the Star Bird Orbiter which is the main body without the <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> hull. When turned on the Star Bird mimics an engine sound. If the toy is pointed upwards the sound would be altered by a ball bearing switch to imply a doppler effect acceleration or taking-off, while a nose down orientation gives the sound of decelerating engines. A button {{at the rear of the}} cockpit activates the LEDs at the front of the toy, along with a blast noise, to simulate the firing of its lasers. The button was designed to be pressed by the thumb while the ship was held by the main body or engine piece (in [...] "dragster" [...] configuration). Two simple, detachable drone-like [...] "Interceptors" [...] are provided at the end of each wing. Star Bird also had a rotating laser turret which doubled as an escape-pod/orbiter-type ship. Very much to the dismay of current-day collectors the twin lasers from the turret are often missing in today's offerings of the play set.|$|R

5|$|Kentrosaurus can be {{distinguished}} from {{other members of the}} Stegosauria by a number of osteological characters. Mallison (2011) provided a revised diagnosis, an updated list of distinguishing traits or autapomorphies. Most notably, the neural spines, the blade-like upper extensions of the vertebrae, in the tail do not run sub-parallel, as in most dinosaurs. In the front third of the tail, they point backwards, the usual direction. In the middle tail, however, they are almost vertical, and further back they are hook-shaped and point obliquely forward. Also typical is that the dorsal (back) vertebrae have a neural arch more than twice as high as the centrum, the vertebral body, and almost completely occupied by the extremely spacious neural canal. The preacetabular process, front blade, of the ilium widens laterally, to the <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> side, and does not taper.|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{individuals}} of Caiuajara had an estimated wingspan of 2.35 metres. The species {{had a large}} toothless head with, in adult individuals, an enormous shark fin-shaped crest on the snout. The describing authors established several distinguishing unique traits, autapomorphies. The {{tip of the snout}} is strongly oriented to below, at 142 to 149°, relative {{to the edge of the}} upper jaw. The rear ascending branches of the praemaxillae on their midline form an elongated bony rim projecting to below into the nasoantorbital fenestra, the large skull opening in the side of the snout. In the concave upper rear of the symphysis, the fronts of the lower jaws grown together, a rounded depression is present. The <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> edge of the quadrate shows a longitudinal groove. Below the front part of the nasoantorbital fenestra, a depression is present in the upper jaw edge.|$|R

50|$|The Waratah was {{designed}} at the Downer EDI Rail design offices, then at Clyde, NSW, Australia. The sets are formed of eight carriages - {{a break from}} the previous standard Sydney practice of four car sets, which are then coupled to form eight car trains. The configuration is: trailer driving car + motor car + motor car + trailer car + trailer car + motor car + motor car + trailer driving car. This means that guards operate {{from the rear of the}} train rather than the centre and that commuters are able to walk through the entire train in an emergency. Nightshine Australia was selected to produce luminescent arrow signs line, which are affixed on the base of <b>outer</b> <b>seats</b> on the lower and upper decks to direct passengers the most appropriate route of exit.The trains include external CCTV cameras to assist guards.|$|R
50|$|The {{describing}} authors established some diagnostic traits. In {{the depression}} for a skull opening, the fenestra antorbitalis, {{to the front}} a second opening is present, a fenestra maxillaris, that occupies much of the front part of this depression. The teeth in the maxilla only on their rear edges have denticles which are very small and directed towards {{the point of the}} teeth. The neck vertebrae are mildly opisthocoelous: with centra that are convex in front and concave at the rear. The claws of the hand are different from each other: the thumb claw is large and curved, but the other two claws are smaller and feature a straight underside. The shinbone has on its <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> side only a high narrow groove functioning as contact with {{the upper part of the}} astragalus. This processus ascendens however, though indeed positioned on the outer side, is low.|$|R
5000|$|Communication through subtle weight {{shifts and}} body {{language}} is essential. The dancers stand close, touching upper <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> sides of torsos along {{outer edge of}} pectoral muscle and ribcage. Sometimes the connection extends down to knees, depending {{on the degree of}} room needed for specific variations within pure balboa. Height difference between partners can cause the connection to vary considerably. They are offset by about 1/4 of their body width, creating a slight [...] "V" [...] between their torsos and allowing the feet and legs to offset to a greater degree than in ballroom styles. The balboa follower often dances in heels to get the proper [...] "forward" [...] connection. This can be misinterpreted however. The follower still has her own weight. Foot balance is neutral with slightly more pressure on the ball of the feet for the follow, but generally across the entire foot for the lead.|$|R
50|$|Messerschmitt, {{the notable}} German {{aeroplane}} manufacturer, weren't allowed to produce aircraft after World War II. Instead, they produced cars. These {{were designed by}} the aircraft engineer Fritz Fend.A vehicle canopy was a new concept that {{is believed to be}} invented by Messerschmitt; this originated from their aircraft design. They quickly adopted the canopy as this was a simple solution that they had experience in. Unlike most car canopies, the Messerschmitt canopies are hinged on the side, as was the canopy of their famous Bf 109 fighter (as was common with numerous other pre-war and wartime fighter designs). A problem with side hinging, is that for a car with normal side-by-side seating arrangement, the passengers sitting closest to the hinge will have to climb across the <b>outer</b> <b>seat</b> {{to get out of the}} car. For that reason the side-hinging canopy is best suited for single-occupant or tandem-seat cars, and after this, canopies were usually hinged at the front or back.|$|R

Muskie was reelected in 1964, 1970 and 1976, each time with over 60 percent of the vote. In Washington, Muskie often clashed with the Majority Leader, Lyndon B. Johnson, who subsequently relegated him to <b>outer</b> <b>seats</b> in the Senate. In the next five years, he gained significant power and influence and was considered among the most effective legislators in the Senate.

5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the <b>front</b> <b>outer</b> side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low.
