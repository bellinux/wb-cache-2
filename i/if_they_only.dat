5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 the queues {{outside the}} toilets became {{so long that}} the police had to {{regulate}} access. To keep traffic moving through the toilets, men headed for the toilets were directed first to the urinals (giant enclosed grates) <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> needed to urinate. Consequently, the number of toilets was increased by 20% in 2005. Approximately 1,800 toilets and urinals are available today.|$|E

25|$|Quicksand: A {{variation}} of penalizing overtricks, a team who exactly makes their contract gets full value. Overtricks subtract 10 points each from that value, and teams {{who do not}} make their contract subtract 10 points for each missed trick. For instance, consider a bid of 7 tricks. If the team made exactly 7 tricks, they would earn the full 70 points. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> took 5 tricks, they would lose 20 points. If the team made 9 tricks, they would earn the 70 points, −20 points for the two overtricks, resulting in a score of 50 points.|$|E
25|$|High {{frequency}} {{radio signals}} transmitted at relatively low power can {{travel around the}} world under ideal propagation conditions, which are affected by local RF noise levels, weather, season, and sunspots, and can then be received with a properly tuned antenna of adequate size, and a good receiver. However, spies often have to work only with available hand-held receivers, sometimes under difficult local conditions, and in all seasons and sunspot cycles. Only very large transmitters, perhaps up to 500,000 watts, are guaranteed {{to get through to}} nearly any basement-dwelling spy, nearly any place on earth, nearly all of the time. Some governments may not need a numbers station with global coverage <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> send spies to nearby countries.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of trying to shoot the moon, players attempt to discard high cards, especially high hearts or spades, and try to avoid winning points. This can either be accomplished by creating a void, or playing a high card last in a trick that has no points. Generally speaking, it is advantageous to play the highest card possible without winning the trick. Players particularly concentrate on getting rid of high cards in suits {{that they do not}} have padding low cards in. For example, if a player had A,5,4,3,2 the A would not be much of an issue; they can play the four lower cards and hopefully exhaust other player's spades before being forced to play the A. In contrast, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> had A, then they would be forced to play the A the first time spades were led, with the risk that another player will respond with the queen.|$|E

25|$|Before the event, Jeff Jarrett {{was on his}} way out of the company, as {{management}} felt he {{had been}} a bad investment for the company. Vince McMahon, the WWF Chairman, came up with the idea for Jarrett and Chyna to become involved in a storyline together. Vince Russo was asked to write the storyline leading up to the match, including when Jarrett would taunt Chyna and hit her with random household objects. The fans responded positively to the battle-of-the-sexes match-ups. They were originally supposed to have their match-up at Rebellion, but the WWF extended the storyline for another month due to its popularity. In the midst of the feud, Russo left the WWF for rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In her autobiography <b>If</b> <b>They</b> <b>Only</b> Knew, Chyna implies that Russo was the person who convinced McMahon to delay their pay-per-view match for a month, because he knew Jarrett was also going to sign with WCW. Because of the delay, Jarrett's contract expired the day before the match, so he was not contractually required to wrestle at the event. Hours before the event began, Jarrett demanded (and received) somewhere between $300,000–500,000 to wrestle Chyna for the night.|$|E

500|$|After the match, 150 guests {{attended}} a {{dinner at the}} Old Royal Hotel in central Birmingham [...] "in order that the shareholders {{and friends of the}} Small Heath Club might meet the players and congratulate them of their achievements and wish them still further success". Walter Hart, the club's chairman, spoke of the good character of the players, most of whom still worked at their own trades when not required for football, suggesting that [...] "a man who had nothing to do but loaf about from week's end to week's end was not ready for play, and such a mode of life was not conducive to good football". He praised the players' esprit de corps and pluck which had taken them {{to the top of the}} division, and encouraged them to resist the temptation to sign for other clubs, insisting that [...] "whatever money [...] made after providing things of necessity would come to the players and... the club could do as well for its players, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> clung together, as any club in the country". In reply, captain Caesar Jenkyns agreed that the players' efforts meant they [...] "deserved all the praise that had been bestowed on them", and promised they would do their utmost to beat First Division club Burnley the following week in the FA Cup.|$|E

2500|$|Over 400,000 cat bites occur {{each year}} though {{the actual number}} of bites is much higher since many such bites are under-reported. [...] 40 million {{households}} in the United States have pet cats. Data on the number of people bitten or scratched by cats are limited because these incidents are not reported; however, 20%-80% of cat bites and scratches become infected. Cat-scratch disease or cat-scratch fever, an infection that causes fever and swollen lymph nodes, can develop from cat scratches even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> break the surface of the skin. Based on reports of people treated for cat bites at hospitals, women {{are most likely to be}} victims of cat bites and scratches. Because of their smaller build, children are more likely to be bitten on their head, neck and face. Adults are more likely to bitten on the hands and arms. Those who are immunocompromised are more susceptible to infection from a cat bite.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} {{report of}} a South Melbourne v Melbourne game appeared in The Australasian of 14 July 1894: Someone told them (Melbourne) that McKnight, Windley and Waugh were {{the backbone of the}} Southern team and they immediately conceived the idea of telling men off to block these players. [...] Moysey was directed to shadow McKnight, young Wardill had to prevent Windley getting possession ... and Lewis was appointed to control the movements of Waugh. [...] Their instructions were very definite. [...] They were all three told that it did not matter whether they got a kick themselves at all in the match, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> succeeded in spoiling the play of the three South cracks. [...] Those who were present at the match can say how well these instructions were carried out. [...] There was nothing in the tactics adopted that infringed a solitary rule of the game and the plan was singularly effective, but I own to feeling a shade of doubt concerning the manliness of the whole proceeding. [...] I would certainly have preferred to see the representatives of the grand old Melbourne win ... purely upon their superior prowess as players.|$|E
2500|$|Five {{years after}} the Munich study was published, Jim T. Enright, a {{professor}} of physiology who emphasised correct data analysis procedure, contended that the study's results are merely consistent with statistical fluctuations and not significant. He believed the experiments provided [...] "the most convincing disproof imaginable that dowsers can do what they claim", stating that the data analysis was [...] "special, unconventional and customized". Replacing it with [...] "more ordinary analyses", {{he noted that the}} best dowser was on average [...] out of [...] closer to a mid-line guess, an advantage of 0.04%, and that the five other [...] "good" [...] dowsers were on average farther than a mid-line guess. Enright emphasized that the experimenters should have decided beforehand how to statistically analyze the results; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> afterward chose the statistical analysis that showed the greatest success, then their conclusions would not be valid until replicated by another test analyzed by the same method. He further pointed out that the six [...] "good" [...] dowsers did not perform any better than chance in separate tests. Another study published in Pathophysiology hypothesized that such experiments as this one that were carried out in the 20th century could have been interfered with by man-made radio frequency radiation, as test subjects' bodies absorbed the radio waves and unconscious hand movement reactions took place following the standing waves or intensity variations.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{inappropriate}} {{to distinguish between}} two well-ordered sets <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> differ in the [...] "labeling of their elements", or more formally: if {{the elements of the}} first set can be paired off with the elements of the second set such that if one element is smaller than another in the first set, then the partner of the first element is smaller than the partner of the second element in the second set, and vice versa. [...] Such a one-to-one correspondence is called an order isomorphism and the two well-ordered sets are said to be order-isomorphic, or similar (obviously this is an equivalence relation). [...] Provided there exists an order isomorphism between two well-ordered sets, the order isomorphism is unique: this makes it quite justifiable to consider the two sets as essentially identical, and to seek a [...] "canonical" [...] representative of the isomorphism type (class). [...] This is exactly what the ordinals provide, and it also provides a canonical labeling of the elements of any well-ordered set. [...] Formally, if a partial order < is defined on the set S, and a partial order <' is defined on the set S' , then the posets (S,<) and (S' ,<') are order isomorphic if there is a bijection f that preserves the ordering. That is, f(a) <' f(b) if and only if a < b. Every well-ordered set (S,<) is order isomorphic to the set of ordinals less than one specific ordinal number [...] under their natural ordering.|$|E

[...] The terrain is mixed prairie featuring rolling moraines and valleys. [...] North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA super corridors are a concept of huge transportation corridors connecting Mexico, United States, and Canada. [...] The CanAm highway was a concept begun in the 1920s. This area has been subject to criticism as the entry way to Canada of this route. [...] "The CanAm matters so little to Saskatchewan highway planners that they've turned the most southern part of it within the province -- the Highway 35 link from Weyburn to the little U.S. border crossing at Oungre -- to gravel. SK Hwy 35 achieved a dishonorable mention in the Canadian contest entitled 'Highways from Hell'. [...] "Brenda Bakken Lackey called Highway 35 an “embarrassment’’ and a hazard for truckers’ business since it {{was turned into a}} gravel roadway last year. [...] 'When it rains, there is mud and when it is dry, there is flying dust and gravel,' she said. 'Truckers from my constituency tell me that the U.S. Customs officials say {{they are not going to}} put up with the mud that is coming across on the trucks. There is also concerns about grain seeds and weeds coming across in the mud on truck tires.'...Highway Minister Maynard Sonntag said. 'Highway No. 6 has a much higher traffic count, many more trucks in and out from the States than Highway No. 35 would have.’' [...] " [...] "The projects on Highways 39 and 6 will help to improve traffic flow through these Canada/U.S. ports. 'Highways 6 and 39 are very important to Saskatchewan – serving as tourism links and major north-south trade corridors to the U.S.,' Sonntag said. [...] "Highway 35 from Wadena South is always an adventure. I have found my driving skills have improved immensely especially when it comes to emergency braking and swerving to avoid the many areas of broken pavement. This past spring the Dept. of Highways could have saved thousands in signage costs <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>only</b> had put up warning signs where the road was smooth and unbroken."
