Since this is an identity of symmetric polynomials (homogeneous) of degree k, its validity for any number of variables follows from its validity for k variables.

The k-th Newton identity in n>k variables contains more terms {{on both sides of the}} equation than the one in k variables, but its validity will be assured if the coefficients of any monomial match. Because no individual monomial <b>involves</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> k of the variables, the monomial will survive the substitution of zero for some set of n−k (other) variables, after which the equality of coefficients is one that arises in the k-th Newton identity in k (suitably chosen) variables.|$|E
