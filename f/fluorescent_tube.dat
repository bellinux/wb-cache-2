Other changes include a display which uses LED backlights (replacing the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> backlights {{used in the}} previous model) and arsenic-free glass, a new Mini DisplayPort (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button, {{and the removal of}} the FireWire 400 port (thus it doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system repairs without booting the system).|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent light {{fixtures}} cannot {{be connected to}} dimmer switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy thermionic emission of electrons into the arc stream. CFLs are available that work {{in conjunction with a}} suitable dimmer.|$|E
25|$|Compared with an {{incandescent}} lamp, a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> {{is a more}} diffuse {{and physically}} larger light source. In suitably designed lamps, light can be more evenly distributed without point source of glare such as seen from an undiffused incandescent filament; the lamp is large compared to the typical distance between lamp and illuminated surfaces.|$|E

50|$|Argon was {{the first}} gas used in <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> and is still {{frequently}} used due to its low cost, high efficiency, and very low striking voltage. In <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> it is used in combination with mercury. It was also used in early rectifier tubes; first thyratrons were derived from such argon-filled tubes.|$|R
25|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL), also called {{compact fluorescent}} light, energy-saving light, and compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube,</b> is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs. The lamps use a tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into the}} space of an incandescent bulb, and a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp.|$|E
25|$|A {{fluorescent}} lamp, or <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube,</b> is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp {{that uses}} fluorescence to produce visible light. An electric current {{in the gas}} excites mercury vapor, which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating {{on the inside of}} the lamp to glow. A fluorescent lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.|$|E
25|$|If a {{fluorescent}} lamp is broken, {{a very small}} amount of mercury can contaminate the surrounding environment. About 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor, especially on lamps that are {{near the end of}} their life. The broken glass is usually considered a greater hazard than the small amount of spilled mercury. The EPA recommends airing out the location of a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> break and using wet paper towels to help pick up the broken glass and fine particles. Any glass and used towels should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag. Vacuum cleaners can cause the particles to become airborne, and should not be used.|$|E
50|$|LEDs {{are much}} more {{expensive}} but last up to 10 times longer, and like <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes,</b> can be cycled on and off frequently as they require no startup or cool down period. While they can not produce the same spectrum as mercury vapor or <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes,</b> photoinitiators can be formulated {{to work with them}} easily.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of various commercial lamps and residual oxygen on discoloration and oxidation of cured boiled sausage. The wavelength dependence of different spectral bands on sausage color and oxygen absorption was investigated. A model packaging system, simulating a gastight package was used to compare the influence of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes,</b> metal halide lamps, color optimized <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> and LEDs. Sausages exposed to daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> showed significantly (p < 0. 005) higher rates of oxygen absorption and discoloration in comparison to metal halide lamps and color optimized <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> for meat products after 24 h of storage time at 6 ± 1 °C. To investigate the effect of light and residual oxygen in the headspace of the packaging, oxygen concentrations of 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 0 % were tested with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes</b> in regard of oxygen absorption and discoloration of the sausages. Higher residual oxygen concentrations showed higher discoloration and also higher rates of oxygen absorption of the sausage. Low initial oxygen contents in the headspace of packaged sausage in conjunction with optimized illumination can prolong the shelf life of cured sausages in retail shelves...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "solid state" [...] refers {{commonly}} {{to light}} emitted by solid-state electroluminescence, {{as opposed to}} incandescent bulbs (which use thermal radiation) or <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes.</b> Compared to incandescent lighting, SSL creates visible light with reduced heat generation and less energy dissipation. Most common [...] "white" [...] LEDs convert blue light from a solid-state device to an (approximate) white light spectrum using photoluminescence, the same principle used in conventional <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation. For a given <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube,</b> a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the {{efficacy of}} a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.|$|E
25|$|Non-integrated CFLs {{have the}} ballast {{permanently}} {{installed in the}} luminaire, and usually only the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they don't {{need to be replaced}} when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a bi-pin tube designed for conventional ballast, and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A bi-pin tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.|$|E

A {{report from the}} BBC's in-house publication Ariel: [...] "From reusable water bottles filled from tanks of tap water to double-sided scripts, Mongrels is aiming {{to be the most}} sustainable production at the BBC." [...] The production team also use reusable or compostable cutlery in their canteen, reducing any future merchandise packaging to just a barcode, and replacing conventional lighting with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> lights. This last move reduced the electricity bill for the second series by a third, saving £500 a week.|$|E
50|$|LED tube is {{a modern}} source of light used in {{fluorescent}} lamp luminaires with G5 and G13 bases in place of traditional <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes.</b> As compared to <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tubes,</b> the most important advantages of LED tubes are energy efficiency and long service life. LED tubes are sometimes {{also referred to as}} ‘LED fluorescent tubes’, but since the light actually comes from LED components and the <b>tubes</b> contain no <b>fluorescent</b> substance, ‘LED tube’ is more correct.|$|R

500|$|The video {{starts with}} [...] "Let Me Talk to You" [...] as the {{background}} is surrounded by faulty fluorescent lighting, turning on and off in a programmed pattern. It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting [...] "hey" [...] to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing {{to the beat of}} the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with [...] "My Love" [...] playing; the first verse of the song, [...] "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube.</b> Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for [...] "If I wrote you a symphony / Just to say how much you mean to me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, [...] "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing [...] "This ring here represents my heart" [...] with a ring swirling into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins rapping his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance {{to the end of the}} song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{noble gas}} {{used in the}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> (commonly argon) must be ionized before the arc can [...] "strike" [...] within the tube. For small lamps, {{it does not take}} much voltage to strike the arc and {{starting}} the lamp presents no problem, but larger tubes require a substantial voltage (in the range of a thousand volts).|$|E
2500|$|A {{dimmable}} ballast is {{very similar}} to a rapid start ballast, but usually has a capacitor incorporated to give a power factor nearer to unity than a standard rapid start ballast. [...] A quadrac type light dimmer can be used with a dimming ballast, which maintains the heating current while allowing lamp current to be controlled. [...] A resistor of about 10kΩ is required to be connected in parallel with the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> to allow reliable firing of the quadrac at low light levels.|$|E

2500|$|The colour-light {{equivalent}} of a splitting signal is the junction indicator, colloquially known as a [...] "lunar indicator", [...] "feather", or [...] "horn" [...] in Scotland. Mounted above a colour-light signal, they consist of a row of white lights (originally a single, long, u-shaped <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> in an open-fronted case), nowadays five but traditionally three, angled {{to the left or}} right depending on the direction of the divergance. When the highest-speed route is set, the indicator is not illuminated (unless all routes are of a similar speed, in which case there is an indication for each route). When a diverging route is set, the respective junction indicator is illuminated. These can be used where there is a maximum of six routes as well as the 'straight' route, and where a maximum of three routes are {{to one side of the}} 'straight' route.|$|E
2500|$|Performers such as [...] "Dr. Resisto", [...] "The Human Dynamo", [...] "Electrice", [...] "The Great Volta", and [...] "Madamoiselle Electra" [...] {{would have}} their body {{connected}} to the high voltage terminal of a hidden Tesla coil, causing sparks to shoot from their fingertips {{and other parts of}} their body, and neon lights and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>tube</b> lamps to light up when brought near them. They could also light candles or cigarettes with their fingers. Although they didn't usually cause electric shocks, RF arc discharges from the bare skin could cause painful burns; to prevent them performers sometimes wore metal thimbles on their fingertips (Rev. Moon, center image above, is using them). These acts were extremely dangerous and could kill the performer if the Tesla coil was misadjusted. In carny lingo this was called an [...] "electric chair act" [...] because it often included a spark-laced [...] "electrocution" [...] of the performer in an electric chair, exploiting public fascination with this exotic new method of capital punishment, which had become the United States' dominant method of execution around 1900. Today entertainers still perform high voltage acts with Tesla coils, but modern bioelectromagnetics has brought a new awareness of the hazards of Tesla coil currents, and allowing them to pass through the body is today considered extremely dangerous.|$|E
