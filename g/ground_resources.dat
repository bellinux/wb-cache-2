50|$|Sex-biased dispersal, or the {{tendency}} of one sex to disperse between populations more frequently than the other, is a common behavior studied by researchers. Three major hypotheses currently exist to help explain sex-biased dispersal. The resource-competition hypothesis infers that the more philopatric sex (the sex more likely to remain at its natal grounds) benefits during reproduction simply by having familiarity with natal <b>ground</b> <b>resources.</b> A second proposal for sex-biased dispersal is the local mate competition hypothesis, which introduces the idea that individuals encounter less mate competition with relatives the farther from their natal grounds they disperse.

40|$|ABSTRACT The rapid {{population}} growth in Tangerang area is the main factor contributed to the land use changes from agriculture tonon agriculture such as industry, commercial, housing and residential made availability of environment become decreas. The trend of encreasing population, with this various fungtion causing the more pressure {{to the use of}} <b>ground</b> water <b>resources.</b> Land use development causing amount of water that can be infiltrate into the ground as ground water become less dan exploitation of ground water made quality dan quantity of ground water decreased. Actually this fenomena {{can be seen in the}} area of Kecamatan Teluknaga, Mauk, Kosambi, which difficult to get fresh water from ground water. Considering to this condition, the aim of this research is to read the hook of space use development specially land use development in order to availability of <b>ground</b> water <b>resources.</b> In this research, we made to read the pattern the change of land use development, calculation to the potency and caracteristic <b>ground</b> water <b>resources,</b> the use and the need of water with deskriptif eksplanatif method. The criteria we used is including condition of climate and its hydrology areas, the change of land use, as well as the basic need of activity of household, industrial, and agriculture. The availability of <b>ground</b> water <b>resources</b> condition in identified by making the analysis of supply and demand of <b>ground</b> water <b>resources</b> balance. The results of this research, until year 2005 there will be still available 9. 061. 290 m 3 of ground water, which isn't used, but up to year 2015 Kabupaten Tangerang will be defisit of <b>ground</b> water <b>resources</b> 200. 291. 780 m 3.

50|$|Its {{existence}} {{in a field}} significantly reduces crop yield, both {{because it is a}} tough competitor for <b>ground</b> <b>resources,</b> and because it is allelopathic, the roots releasing substances harmful to other plants. Similarly, it also has a bad effect on ornamental gardening. The difficulty to control it is a result of its intensive system of underground tubers, and its resistance to most herbicides. It {{is also one of the}} few weeds that cannot be stopped with plastic mulch. See picture.Weed pulling in gardens usually results in breakage of roots, leaving tubers in the ground from which new plants emerge quickly. Ploughing distributes the tubers in the field, worsening the infestation; even if the plough cuts up the tubers to pieces, new plants can still grow from them. In addition, the tubers can survive harsh conditions, further contributing to the difficulty to eradicate the plant. Hoeing in traditional agriculture of South East Asia does not remove the plant but leads to rapid regrowth.|$|E

40|$|More than {{one-half}} of the world's population is dependent on ground water for everyday uses such as drink-ing, cooking, and hygiene. In fact, {{it is the most}} extracted natural resource in the world. As a result of growing populations and expanding economies, many aquifers today are being depleted while others are being contami-nated. Notwithstanding the world's considerable reliance on this <b>resource,</b> <b>ground</b> water <b>resources</b> have long received only secondary attention as compared to surface water, especially among legislatures and policymakers. Today, while there are hundreds of treaties governing transboundary rivers and lakes, there is only one interna-tional agreement that directly addresses a transboundary aquifer. Given that many of the aquifers on which humanity so heavily relies cross international borders, there is a considerable gap in the sound management, allo-cation, and protection of such resources. In order to prevent future disputes over transboundary aquifers and to maximize the beneficial use of this resource, international law must be clarified as it applies to transboundary <b>ground</b> water <b>resources.</b> Moreover, it must be defined with a firm basis in sound scientific understanding. In this paper we offer six conceptual models is which <b>ground</b> water <b>resources</b> can have transboudary consequences.

The Topsail Island site, placed in operation in March 1947, incorporated rigid structures that were designed and built for specific uses related to the assembly, firing, monitoring and perfecting of experimental ramjet missiles.

Tower #3 was also converted into a house, but the addition was destroyed by Hurricane Fran in 1996. Tower #6 was converted into a restaurant and fishing pier, but the pier was also destroyed by Fran, and the addition was demolished later. Tower #8 is the only tower that no longer stands, having been demolished in 1989. The concrete launch pad serves as the patio of the Jolly Roger Motel in Topsail Beach.|$|E
