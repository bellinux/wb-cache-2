40|$|This {{analysis}} aims at studying joblessness and {{the effect}} of the economic crisis at the household rather than the individual level. With respect to the main European countries, in Italy the <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> rate is lower because of the larger household size (the more adults present the lower the risk of joblessness) and the greater propensity to link household formation to employment status. The effects of the economic crisis on the labour market have led to an increase in the <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> rate. However this increase has been lower than expected, thus suggesting that Italian households have partly absorbed the negative shocks in the labour market. Within households, the job losses mostly related to young people still living with their parents, reflecting an employment protection system that is segmented on a generational basis. <b>jobless</b> <b>household,</b> distribution of work...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{persistence}} over time {{of living in}} a <b>jobless</b> <b>household,</b> aiming to disentangle the roles of state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, the potential heterogeneity of state dependence is examined through estimation of interaction terms with the lagged household joblessness variable. Finally, the robustness of results is explored through the use of alternative definitions of household joblessness each based on different variables available in our data. Using the two definitions that are most different, we find substantial state dependence which is larger for women than for men under both definitions. That is, being in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> in the previous year increases the probability of currently living in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> by 7. 7 to 17. 2 percentage points for men and 12. 7 to 25. 1 percentage points for women. Although state dependence clearly is an important factor, as are a number of observed characteristics, unobserved heterogeneity also plays an importantrole for men and women: 32 to 40 per cent of the unexplained variance can be attributed to unobserved heterogeneity for men, and for women this is 42 to 46 per cent. A few characteristics (age, disability, student status, living outside of major cities, having a university degree, presence of preschool children) seem to affect the level of state dependence to some extent. However, aside from the age effect, which can increase state dependence by up to 50 per cent for men aged 60 to 64, the level of state dependence seems fairly homogenous amongst men and amongst women.

Hence it is important to ascertain whether intergenerational class effects (continue to) exist. Using SILC 2005 data, we consider their impact on a relevant selection of social risks: unemployment, ill-health, living in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household,</b> single parenthood, temporary employment, and low-paid employment.

40|$|Individual and {{household}} based aggregate measures of joblessness offer conflicting signals about labour market performance. This paper shows that while individual based measures of joblessness have remained fairly stable {{over the last}} 10 years or so and have fallen after highs in the early 1980 s, household measures of joblessness have risen. Joblessness among the working age population has become more concentrated within certain households. In the past Australia’s non-working population (of working age) were supported in households where others worked whereas they are now primarily supported by welfare payments from the state. What is perhaps most striking is how many children now are living in households with no earned income. The incidence of <b>jobless</b> <b>households</b> falls disproportionately on households headed {{by those who are}} young or approaching retirement age, with little or no qualifications or born overseas.

40|$|Child {{disadvantage}} is {{an important}} issue in Australia today {{and is one of the}} key policy target areas of the Federal government. Child disadvantage not only affects child wellbeing in the present time but can also inhibit their future achievements. As well as individual- and family-level effects, there is growing evidence that child wellbeing and achievement is highly affected by the environment in which children grow up, and what resources and role models are available to them in their surrounding areas. In this paper, we examine the spatial clustering of children in <b>jobless</b> <b>households</b> through the computation of the Global and Local Moran’s statistics, for the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan regions, and observe how these clusters have changed between the 2001 and 2006 census years.

40|$|Adolescents {{and young}} adults with disabilities are at {{heightened}} risk of social exclusion. Exclusion leads to poor outcomes in adulthood which in turn affects individuals’ health and wellbeing and that of their families and society through loss of productive engagement in their communities. Australia’s Social Inclusion Indicators Framework provides indices in domains of participation, resources and multiple and entrenched disadvantage to monitor and report on social inclusion. The Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey provides data over time on households in Australia. Using these tools we report here {{on the extent of}} social inclusion/exclusion of young disabled Australians over the past decade. Relative to their non-disabled peers, young disabled Australians are significantly less likely to do well on participation indicators. They are less likely to: -Be employed -Be fully engaged in education or work -Have attained a year 12 or equivalent education -They are more likely to: -Live in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> -Experience long-term unemployment -Relative to their non-disabled peers, young disabled Australians are significantly less likely to do well on resources indicators. They are less likely to: -Feel they have someone to turn to in time of crisis -Experience autonomy -Have a voice in the community -They are more likely to: -Have low economic resources -Experience financial stress/ material deprivation -Have mental illness -Have fair or poor health -Have a lower subjective quality of life -Feel unsafe in their local community -Report being a victim of crime The standout finding is that over this decade young disabled Australians were significantly more likely than their non-disabled peers - to the extent of five times more likely - each and every year to suffer multiple disadvantage and entrenched disadvantage (the same measure over 2 consecutive years). Despite social policy interventions the aspiration for young disabled Australians to become more socially included appears even further out of reach than previously, with a widening of the gap between the life conditions of disabled and non-disabled young Australians on five critical areas: living in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household,</b> being fully engaged in work or education, low economic resources and financial stress and, most worryingly, multiple disadvantage and entrenched multiple disadvantage.

40|$|Disabled Australian {{adolescents}} and young adults are more likely to experience social exclusion than their non-disabled peers. The gap between the two actually widened between 2001 and 2011. Social exclusion in adolescence leads to poor outcomes, such as lower educational achievement and unemployment, in adulthood. It affects not only the health and wellbeing of the individual; it also impacts on their family and the wider community. The inability of people with disabilities to participate socially and economically is a loss to the whole of society. This report maps the extent of social inclusion or exclusion of young disabled Australians, aged between 15 and 29, over the years 2001 to 2011.

40|$|Working-age {{households}} where no-one is in {{work have}} become an increasing focus of policy concern even before the economic crisis, and the EU has included household joblessness in its new poverty reduction target for 2020. This paper focuses on the variation across EU countries in the prevalence of household joblessness {{and its impact on}} income poverty and deprivation, and on the implications for the new EU poverty reduction target. It brings out ﬁ rst that there are some divergences across key data sources in the extent of joblessness. The prevalence of household joblessness varies substantially across EU countries, but there is little evidence of a consistent pattern among groupings of countries often categorised together in terms of welfare regime or geographically. In aggregate there is little association between the overall extent of household joblessness in a country and the percentage in relative income poverty or above a material deprivation threshold. At micro level, being in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> has a substantial impact on the likelihood of being in relative income poverty or deprived, but the scale of these impacts is shown to be very much greater in some countries than in others, and to vary between single-adult and multiple-adult households. In most EU countries little more than half the working age adults in jobless households are either income poor or deprived, so including joblessness in the poverty reduction target does make a difference, without a clearly-articulated rationale. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOriginating {{in rural}} areas, the popular {{uprising}} {{that led to}} the Tunisian revolution of 14 January 2011 has shed light on the growing social and regional disparities that have characterized development dynamics in Tunisia. While favouring the reallocation of resources to coastal areas to the detriment of interior and agricultural regions, liberalization processes since the late 1980 s also fostered export-oriented agricultural development strategies, based on the promotion of large-scale agricultural enterprises and irrigated farming. As a result, imports of grains and animal feed have come to represent a growing source of commercial balance deficit and of financial pressure on public budgets, particularly since the food crisis of 2008. On the other hand, decreasing farm subsidies, higher production costs, growing farmers' indebtedness, have importantly reduced the reproduction capacity of a large fraction of farms, particularly in the rain-fed agriculture sector. As rural outmigration and non-farm employment opportunities have been declining, small farms have become survival spaces for <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> members, increasing the pressure on family resources and exacerbating social frustrations. While rising food prices were not the only cause of recent uprisings in Tunisia, processes of agricultural restructuring during the past 20 years contributed importantly to fuel the revolutionary dynamics, thus giving a political dimension to food issues. As demonstrated by the rise of farmers' protest movement (land occupations, contestation of farmers unions, refusal to pay for irrigation water), structural change allowing for an increased control of economic resources by local farm producers is needed, but will fundamentally depend on the effectiveness of current process of 'democratic' transition in Tunisia...|$|E

This study evaluated the early effects of Commmunities for Children (CfC) on {{children and their families}} and whether the effectiveness differed for more disadvantaged families. Methods: A quasi-experimental cohort study in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in Australia. Mothers of children aged 2 - 3 years participated at wave 1; 1488 children in CfC communities and 714 children in comparison communities. Outcome measures included child health and development, family functioning and parenting, and services and community. Results: After controlling for background factors, there were beneficial effects associated with CfC. At wave 3, in CfC areas children had higher receptive vocabulary (mean difference (MD) 0. 25, 95 % CI - 0. 02 to 0. 51; p= 0. 07), parents showed less harsh parenting (MD - 0. 14, 95 % CI - 0. 30 to 0. 02; p= 0. 08) and higher parenting self-efficacy (MD 0. 11, 95 % CI 0. 00 to 0. 21; p= 0. 04). Fewer children living in CfC sites were living in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> (OR 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 0. 95; p= 0. 03) but children’s physical functioning (MD - 0. 26, 95 % CI - 0. 53 to 0. 00; p= 0. 05) was worse in CfC sites. For children living in households with mothers with low education there were reduced child injuries requiring medical treatment (MD - 0. 61, 95 % CI - 0. 07 to - 1. 13; p= 0. 03) and increased receptive vocabulary (MD 0. 57, 95 % CI 0. 06 to 1. 08; p= 0. 03).

40|$|Executive summary This {{technical}} report details the processes undertaken {{to estimate the}} prevalence of parents with intellectual disability in the Australian population, their characteristics and living circumstance based on analysis of data available from Australian national surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Method The Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC 2009) {{was used to determine}} prevalence and socio-demographic characteristics for parents with intellectual disability in comparison to parents with other disabilities and non-disabled parents. The General Social Survey (GSS 2010) was used to examine the living circumstances of parents with intellectual disability on selected social indicators – employment, material resources, social and emotional wellbeing and health – compared to parents with other disabilities and non-disabled parents. Findings Analysis of SDAC 2009 data identified an estimated 0. 41 % of Australian parents had intellectual disability. This equates to an estimated 17, 000 parents with intellectual disability residing in private dwellings in Australia. 	People with intellectual disability were about four times less likely to be parents compared with non-disabled people. 	People with intellectual disability were about three times less likely to be parents compared with people with other disabilities. 	Parents with intellectual disability were more likely than non-disabled parents to reside outside capital cities and to have only one child. 	There {{were no significant differences between}} parents with intellectual disability and non-disabled parents in relation to sex or age distribution, lone parenthood or the number of resident children. 	There were no significant differences between parents with intellectual disability and parents with other disabilities on any of the demographic variables examined. Analysis of GSS 2010 data revealed that, compared with non-disabled parents and also compared with parents with other disabilities, parents with intellectual disability were significantly more likely to: 	be in a <b>jobless</b> <b>household</b> 	be in households in the lowest three deciles of equivalised weekly income 	be on government pensions as the main source of personal income 	have ever been without a permanent place to live Technical Report 1 Estimated prevalence and living circumstances of parents with intellectual disability in Australia from selected national surveys 2 	have ever stayed in a shelter, squatted in an abandoned building and/or slept rough 	have less frequent contact with family and friends 	have negative or mixed feelings about life 	have poorer self-assessed health. Parents with intellectual disability were also more likely to be unemployed or not in the labour force compared to non-disabled parents. Summary Compared to other Australian parents (non-disabled parents and parents with other disabilities), parents with intellectual disability are significantly disadvantaged in employment, income, housing, social relationships and health and wellbeing.

40|$|International audienceParents' {{labour market}} status {{is a strong}} {{determinant}} of children's economic well-being, and children living in <b>jobless</b> <b>households</b> are particularly vulnerable. However, previous research has not focused on the association between children and household worklessness. In this paper, I used ECHP data from nine European countries to analyse {{the effects of the}} number and age of children on the probability that neither partner of a couple works. Results from random-effects regressions show that children increase the risk of dual worklessness in five of the countries. The effects were particularly strong in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and more generally, stronger in countries with little institutional support for working mothers, low levels of employment protection, and unexpectedly, where benefits {{were less likely to be}} means-tested. The risk of dual joblessness diminished with the age of the youngest child in Belgium, Finland, France and the United Kingdom and more generally, slower in countries with a strict employment protection regime and a high level of means-testing of social benefits. Having children can thus affect the labour market position of households, and influence their economic well-being.

40|$|Expansion of the {{standard}} employment contract along with the growth in female labour participation {{has given rise to}} a range of employment arrangements amongst households in terms of hours worked and mix of employment contracts. Greater distinctions can now be made between working and <b>jobless</b> <b>households</b> and also according to the presence of permanent and non permanent employment within a household. Changes in labour markets have occurred alongside many significant shifts within the housing market, including declining affordability in both purchased and rental accommodation. Together these trends raise concerns about the capacity to maintain housing costs, not only amongst households who become unemployed, but also amongst those relying solely on a non permanent or variable income. The paper uses the first three waves of HILDA data to model the connections between more insecure forms of employment, household conditions and housing insecurity, placing particular emphasis on the employment composition of the household. A static logistic regression model with random effects is initially applied to a measure of housing insecurity for both renters and purchasers. This is followed by dynamic models of the factors associated with transitions into and out of purchased housing.

Changes in household structure, in the economy, and in the employment patterns {{of men and women}} have contributed to these trends, which present new challenges to social policy makers concerned about {{the costs and benefits of}} various models of welfare provision and labour market regulation. Drawing on the international literature and on a newly developed household database from the New Zealand Household Labour Force Survey, we contrast New Zealand’s household employment patterns with those of the United States and the United Kingdom. In particular, we consider whether New Zealand’s relatively high level of household joblessness (or “work poverty”) would, in the United States policy context, be translated instead into high levels of working poverty. A high and growing proportion of New Zealand’s <b>jobless</b> <b>households</b> are child-rearing households, and increasingly include two-parent households. These trends reinforce the importance of contrasting the costs of household joblessness with the benefits not of employment per se, but of employment that generates sufficient income to support the individuals and families living within these households. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of waves available form the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) now makes comparative research of poverty dynamics in EU countries possible. In this paper, we use the first five waves of ECHP to examine the structure of spells, their average duration and the determinants of duration. We do so using ordered logit and hazard rate models. The paper seeks to evaluate how well the different welfare states of Europe perform in terms of preventing recurrent and persistent income poverty and what household and individual characteristics influence poverty duration. Because we use cross-national data on longitudinal poverty {{we are able to}} increase our understanding of the effect of the institutional context within which poverty occurs. We show that the country welfare regimes strongly influence long run poverty. In particular, countries in the social democratic tradition are found {{to do a better job}} of preventing poverty and long-term poverty. Countries in the liberal tradition and southern European countries display much higher rates of poverty and longer durations of poverty spells. We provide evidence on the efficiency of labour market mechanisms in terms reducing the risk of long-term poverty, and on the effect of the (changing) household context on the poverty risk. <b>Jobless</b> <b>households</b> are not only mor...|$|R
40|$|Structurally similar economies {{sharing the}} same wage-setting {{institutions}} tend to grow at the same rate, thus preserving their differences in levels of output per capita and employment rate, if {{the value of the}} workers’ outside options is rigid and equal across economies. In this case, i) multiple balanced growth paths can be possible, ii) the sustainable rate of growth is higher in economies with competitive wage determination than it is in unionized economies, and iii) this growth differential becomes larger in the presence of an integrated capital market. As the workers’ outside option depends on fiscal transfers responding to changes in levels of output and employment, there is convergence in levels across structurally and institutionally similar economies. In this case, i) economies with competitive wage setting converge at higher levels of output per capita and employment rate than do unionized economies, ii) economies with the same wage-setting institutions converge at higher levels if the tax rate and the fiscal transfers in favour of the jobless are reduced, and iii) the steady-state (“natural”) rate of employment characterizing a regional economy is higher—other things being equal—the lower is the steady-state rate of employment of the other region, when a central government pays equal benefits to all <b>jobless</b> <b>households</b> living in this two-region economy...|$|R
30|$|While {{there are}} reasons to be quite optimistic about the ability of policy to {{alleviate}} poverty based on the Swedish case (although we are not able to isolate any causal effects), some challenges can be pointed out. Firstly, due to the construction and coverage of the insurance systems, some groups face high risks of poverty because of their low labour market attachment. This goes particularly for young people, newly arrived immigrants, and single parents (Jonsson et al. 2010; Mood 2011; Gustafsson 2013). The first two groups have had shorter time to qualify for unemployment benefits, so they often have to rely on other social benefits for their incomes in times of joblessness. Secondly, with a gradual decrease of the real value of such benefits, many fall below the relative poverty line. Indeed, in 2010, no less than 90  % of children in <b>jobless</b> <b>households,</b> who have to rely on benefits, were classified as poor according to EU’s income poverty definition (Mood and Jonsson 2015). Thirdly, our analyses indicate that there is a core of poor people in the magnitude of around 2  % of the working-age population that are unaffected by business cycles and stay poor over a long time. Half of this group stands outside the labour market and will hence be hard to reach with labour market policy, but further study of its composition may be able to identify possible specific policy programmes to lift them out of poverty.|$|R
40|$|Total and {{per child}} {{spending}} on child income supports {{are at high}} levels, and so are child poverty {{and the proportion of}} children being reared in <b>jobless</b> <b>households.</b> While the role of child income supports in alleviating child poverty should not be exaggerated, it can be improved. Most of the per child support received by low income families now takes the form of universal payments. These create no employment disincentive but, by giving almost one euro to families in {{the top half of the}} income distribution for each euro going to the bottom half, effectively accord child poverty a low priority. There has been a long interest in a new form of targeting that would enable priority be given families on the basis of low income alone, create no employment disincentive and be slowly withdrawn as family income rises. The principal difficulties in paying what would, in effect, be a supplement to Child Benefit but received only by low income families are administrative. Identifying 2 ̆ 7 family income` and delivering support to parents in work and those reliant on social welfare smoothly and equitably will entail significant innovations in the public administrative system. The requisite steps are identified in this paper. It should also be appreciated that achieving the necessary retooling of data and delivery systems would allow the new form of targeting to be applied to other supports as well (e. g., childcare subventions) ...|$|R
40|$|While more {{mothers have}} been {{participating}} in the paid workforce over recent years, the employment rate of lone mothers remains {{lower than that of}} couple mothers. Concerns about the wellbeing of adults and children living in <b>jobless</b> <b>households</b> contribute to continuing interest in explaining the relatively low employment rate of lone mothers. This paper provides new insights into possible reasons for the different rates of employment of lone and couple mothers by examining how their employment transitions vary. A focus on transitions enables us to examine whether the lower employment rate of lone mothers is due to their being less likely to enter employment, more likely to exit employment once employed, or a combination of both. Monthly calendar data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey are used to identify and compare the rate at which lone and couple mothers move into and out of employment over a seven-year period. These data show that in any one-month period, lone mothers {{are less likely to be}} employed than couple mothers. Of those employed in a one-month period, lone mothers are more likely to transition out of employment than couple mothers; however, not-employed lone and couple mothers are no different in their likelihood of transition into employment. The analyses also consider the extent to which a selection of factors other than lone parenthood differentiate mothers in their employment transition rates. These analyses show that educational attainment, work history and age of youngest child may influence, in part, the different employment transition rates of lone and couple mothers.
