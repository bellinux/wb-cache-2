40|$|Abstract: In {{computer}} systems, {{there is}} an urgent need for accurate authentication techniques to prevent unauthorized access. Authentication {{is the process of}} confirming the correctness of the claimed identity. Many computers that store critical information are vulnerable to unauthorized access because of weak authentication. In some cases, the safety of the public can be at risk, such {{as in the case of}} a multi-billion dollar passengerscreening system defenceless against terrorists with <b>forged</b> <b>security</b> badges. Traditional authentication techniques such as the ubiquitous username / password method are inadequate for personal identity since they can only provide proof of possession and/or proof of knowledge. Only biometrics, the authentication of individuals using biological identifiers, can offer true proof of identity. Current research suggests that multimodal biometric systems, those that use more than one biological identifier, can improve the accuracy of biometric systems. This improvement in accuracy depends on critical factors in design, implementation and security. This paper explains each of these critical factors so the increase in accuracy observed in current research can be achieved in real-world applications...|$|R

40|$|Despite sharing many {{strategic}} interests, Indonesia and Australia {{have often}} struggled to <b>forge</b> effective <b>security</b> cooperation. In this article, the authors evaluate the ‘Bandung divide’ {{as a potential}} explanation for this difficulty. The ‘Bandung divide’ refers to the legacies of the 1955 Asian-African Conference, which saw Indonesia and Australia adopt different normative orientations towards the liberal international order, and divergent security strategies for South-East Asia. Having sketched {{the contours of the}} ‘Bandung divide’ and established its heuristic utility as a shorthand for the two countries’ divergent approaches to international order and regional security, the authors then evaluate its contemporary significance as a barrier to bilateral security cooperation in relation to two key challenges: Chinese revisionism in the South China Sea and transnational jihadist terrorism. Indonesia and Australia’s divergent approaches to regional security—themselves partially legacies of the ‘Bandung divide’—have prevented meaningful bilateral collaboration in engaging the South China Sea dispute. By contrast, the two countries have built an effective and heavily institutionalised counterterrorism partnership, proving that the ‘Bandung divide’ is not an insuperable barrier to cooperation. The highly restrictive circumstances that made this success possible nevertheless caution against unduly optimistic assumptions that the two countries will be able to forge a more comprehensive security partnership in the foreseeable future...|$|R
50|$|A {{biometric}} passport, {{also known}} as an e-passport, ePassport or a digital passport, is a combined paper and electronic passport that contains biometric {{information that can be}} used to authenticate the identity of travelers. It uses contactless smart card technology, including a microprocessor chip (computer chip) and antenna (for both power to the chip and communication) embedded in the front or back cover, or center page, of the passport. The passport's critical information is both printed on the data page of the passport and stored in the chip. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip making it expensive and difficult to <b>forge</b> when all <b>security</b> mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented.

Still from a systemic perspective, we suggest that the efforts to <b>forge</b> a common <b>security</b> and defense policy originated not from within the EU, but from the outside – namely the Transatlantic relationship. This approach has traditionally led Realists to refine the concept of balance of power. Contrary to this view, in this chapter we discuss the potential of bandwagoning as an explanatory concept. Put it differently, our argument is that European states resorted to CSDP in order to contribute to, not to counter, the Transatlantic relationship – i. e., the European states have bandwagoned with the USA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the links that continue to be <b>forged</b> between <b>security</b> pricing and accounting, building on recent findings that firms tend to be asymmetrically conservative in the timeliness of earnings recognition. The evidence is that firms in the European Union tend to recognise unrealised losses more quickly in their earnings than unrealised gains (Giner and Rees, 2001; Raonic et al., forthcoming), and {{there is evidence of}} even greater accounting conservatism in the USA (Basu, 1997; Ball et al., 2000; Givoly and Hayn, 2000). This paper investigates whether the Czech market exhibits conformity with the behaviour that has been documented elsewhere by examining the earnings/returns relationship, focusing to begin with on the impact of losses on earnings response coefficients and then considering the asymmetric timeliness of income recognition in the Czech market. The findings indicate that the Czech market is similar to more developed markets, at least in one respect: there is statistically significant evidence of different market effects of profits and losses, in that profits are more persistent than losses. However, contrary to the findings in more developed markets, there is no statistically significant evidence of earnings conservatism in the Czech market. These results are most probably due to the continuing influence of restrictive tax regulations that mitigate any tendency towards conservatism, as well as the transitional nature of the economy. A further reason is likely to be that the regulatory environment in the Czech Republic is close to the kind of stakeholder corporatism that is described by Ball et al. (2000), who show that conservatism tends to be less pronounced in such regimes where there are fewer managerial incentives to bias current earnings. In conclusion, if changes in market prices signal good news and bad news about future risky outcomes, {{there is no evidence of}} asymmetry in the Czech market in accounting for such risks. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{large-scale}} sensor networks, due to {{the energy}} and communication constraints of each sensor, it is infeasible to collect event information from each individual sensor and process it at the sink. In this paper, we propose an efficient data-collection scheme {{that can be used}} for event monitoring and network-wide diagnosis. Our scheme relies on the well-known representation of data [...] contour maps, which trade off accuracy with the number of samples. To build the contour maps, we propose three novel algorithms: a distributed spatial and temporal data suppression algorithm, a reconstruction algorithm at the sink using interpolation and smoothing, and an efficient algorithm to convey routing information for extending data suppression over multiple hops. The error in data representation accuracy is bounded by a simple design parameter of our choice. By reducing the number of transmissions required to convey relevant information to the sink, the contour mapping strategy conserves power at sensor nodes and improves network lifetime. We also present novel and scalable security mechanisms to defend against the injection of <b>forged</b> reports. Our <b>security</b> mechanism uses location-based keys and is much more secure than existing schemes using node-based keys...|$|R
40|$|The {{assassination}} of the King of Yugoslavia, Alexander Ist by Croatian terrorists during a state visit to Marseilles on 9 October 1934 is commemorated by a modest plaque on the Canebière and a little known monument outside the Préfecture. Although the histories of the period cite the event in passing, it is treated as a footnote in the political history of France and has been all but erased from {{the memory of the}} city. While there are good reasons for forgetting the episode – regicide does no favours for the reputation of a host nation or city and the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou was accidentally shot by the French police – the double killing had multiple ramifications for France's interior and foreign affairs during the rise of fascism in Europe. It advanced the career of future Vichy Prime Minister Pierre Laval, who replaced Barthou as Foreign Minister, while French efforts to contain the threat of German expansionism by forging alliances with the Central European powers died with Barthou; King Alexander Ist's successor moved Yugoslavia into the camp of the Axis powers. Geopolitically, the system of collective <b>security</b> <b>forged</b> at Versailles collapsed in the wake the assassination. The incident in Marseilles highlights political tensions in France in the troubled inter-war years leading up to the emergence of the Front Populaire. It reveals the memorial agencies of core and periphery engaged in a struggle over the rights to remembrance. Above all, it poses the problem of the preservation of peripheral and traumatic episodes in collective memory and suggests that political violence constitutes a social periphery of its own, contributing to Marseille's "mauvaise réputation" as the French capital's negative, meridional 'other'...|$|R
40|$|This Article explores how {{concerns}} regarding the United Nations 2 ̆ 7 {{authority to make}} political, strategic, and operational decisions that comprise the right to command and control UN forces might be reconciled {{within the framework of}} the United Nations Charter to create a contemporary and more enduring regime for the command and control of United Nations forces. As Part II demonstrates, command and control issues are not new to the United Nations; indeed, in 1945 the signatories to the United Nations Charter created a model for the command and control of United Nations forces. While the cold war ensured that this model was never used, it remains the necessary point of departure for any current discussion of United Nations command and control. As discussed in Part III, this Charter model was originally replaced by systems of command and control which evolved to meet the needs of two quite distinct United Nations missions: large-scale enforcement and peacekeeping. The end of the cold war, however, has blurred the once clear distinction between the enforcement and peacekeeping missions. As described in Part IV, a new mission has emerged with characteristics of both enforcement and peacekeeping. This new 2 ̆ 2 peace enforcement 2 ̆ 2 mission requires that United Nations forces attempt to maintain neutrality between disputants much as they would in a peacekeeping operation, but that they also be prepared to use force against any disputant who breaches the peace, much as they would in an enforcement action. Part V begins by examining recent efforts within the United Nations Secretariat to improve the United Nations 2 ̆ 7 s ability to oversee operations conducted in its name, as well as the Clinton Administration 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to fashion a new policy toward the United Nations. While many of the changes currently in progress are positive as far as they go, they do not address the complex issues underlying the current debate over command and control. Moreover, the current proposals have been initiated with little reference to the original Charter model for command and control. Part V evaluates this development, and suggests that both the United Nations and its member states might benefit from a return to a more structured, Charter-based model for command and control: a contemporary model that incorporates the strengths of the system envisioned in 1945 without ignoring the experiences of intervening years. Part V offers suggestions for creating such a 2 ̆ 2 neo-Charter 2 ̆ 2 model, and proposes that it might serve as the necessary confidence-building mechanism through which the United Nations, the United States, and other key member states might work to <b>forge</b> a <b>security</b> partnership adequate for the changed political and military demands of the post-cold war world...|$|R
40|$|As the Second World War {{came to an}} end in 1945, Ireland and the United States were in {{antipodal}} political positions. Ireland was a {{small country}} and relatively insignificant in international affairs. The Irish of the Twenty-Six Counties had followed a course of formal military neutrality during the war, and that policy left the tiny state diplomatically isolated when hostilities ceased. The United States by contrast, emerged from the conflict victorious and powerful, destined to play {{a leading role in the}} construction of the postwar world order. 2 ̆ 2 Dublin 2 ̆ 7 s American Policy 2 ̆ 2 uses the methods of the diplomatic historian to examine how the relationship between these two very dissimilar nations, during the seven years immediately following World War II, affected the subsequent history of the smaller country. More specifically, the dissertation suggests ways in which Dublin 2 ̆ 7 s policies towards the United States have affected the partition of Ireland into two separate political entities. Thus, the study relies on diplomatic records from Irish, American and British archives to treat such topics as the American role in moving the Twenty-Six Counties to apply for United Nations membership in 1946;. the ineffectual Irish anti-partition campaign of 1948 - 51 in the United States; Irish participation in the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan); Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of the American invitation to become an original signatory to the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949; and Irish attempts to <b>forge</b> a bilateral <b>security</b> arrangement with the United States in the early 1950 s. In its handling of all these facets of Irish-American relations, the Dublin government was hamstrung by domestic political considerations. Most notably, during the period 1948 - 51, electoral pressures in the Twenty-Six Counties moved the Irish coalition ministry of those years to follow a policy of virulent but counterproductive antipartitionism. In its American dimension, this policy led the Dublin government to pursue the chimerical goal of convincing the United States to pressure the British government into uniting Ireland. Given the importance of the United States 2 ̆ 7 alliance with Britain to the American Cold War strategy of containing Communism, this Irish policy was unrealistic in the extreme. Consequently, it failed to further Irish national interests...|$|R
