50|$|<b>Fluroxene</b> (INN, USAN; {{brand name}} Fluoromar), or 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl vinyl ether, is a volatile, inhalational anesthetic, {{and was the}} first {{halogenated}} hydrocarbon anesthetic to be introduced. It was synthesized in 1951, and was introduced for clinical use in 1954, but was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1974 due to its potential flammability and accumulating evidence that it could cause organ toxicity. In any case, prior to being discontinued, it had largely been superseded by halothane.|$|E
40|$|A {{review on}} {{metabolism}} and toxicity of the fluorinated anesthetic agent, <b>fluroxene,</b> is presented. <b>Fluroxene</b> anesthesia is nontoxic to man but fatal to many experimental animals. The <b>fluroxene</b> molecule (2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl vinyl ether) {{is composed of}} two moieties; both are toxic {{as a result of}} their metabolism: the vinyl moiety destroys heme of cytochrome P- 450 while being metabolized to the final product, CO 2. The trifluoroethyl moiety is oxidized to trifluoroethanol (TFE) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA), and the acute toxicity of <b>fluroxene</b> is related to this pathway. The ratio of metabolites (TFAA to TFE) excreted by different species exposed to <b>fluroxene</b> varies; whenever highly toxic TFE is the major metabolite, <b>fluroxene</b> toxicity is high (rodents, dogs, phenobarbital pretreated monkeys), whenever TFAA is the major metabolite (man, monkey) <b>fluroxene</b> is not toxic. Toxicity in different species also correlates with the extent of glutathione depletion following <b>fluroxene</b> exposure. <b>Fluroxene</b> metabolism and toxicity are modified by drugs metabolized by or affecting the activity of the microsomal cytochrome P- 450 -system or enzymes involved in ethanol metabolism. The susceptibility of <b>fluroxene</b> to two enzymatic systems which are modified by environmental and genetic factors may explain the large differences in <b>fluroxene</b> toxicity to various species. The fate of one-third of <b>fluroxene</b> administered to man remains unknown...|$|E
40|$|Acute <b>fluroxene</b> {{treatment}} of male Wistar rats decreases {{the amounts of}} hepatic microsomal cytochrome P- 450 and haem, increases the activities of hepatic δ-aminolaevulinate synthase and haem oxygenase, and increases the amounts of haem precursors (δ-aminolaevulinate and porphobilinogen) in the urine. All of the above effects of <b>fluroxene</b> are enhanced by pre{{treatment of}} the experimental animals with 3 -methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital. The amounts of porphyrins in the urine and faeces were generally unaffected by acute <b>fluroxene</b> treatment of uninduced or 3 -methylcholanthrene- or phenobarbital-induced Wistar rats. 2, 2, 2 -Trifluoroethyl ethyl ether, the saturated analogue of <b>fluroxene,</b> {{did not affect the}} amounts of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and haem, the amounts of any of the haem precursors in the urine or faeces, or the activity of hepatic haem oxygenase in phenobarbital-induced male Wistar rats. The amounts of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and haem and of the haem precursors in urine and faeces, and the activity of δ-aminolaevulinate synthase, were generally not altered by acute <b>fluroxene</b> treatment of uninduced male Long–Evans rats. Chronic treatment of Wistar rats with <b>fluroxene</b> resulted in small increases in the amounts of δ-aminolaevulinate and porphyrins in urine. The amounts of porphobilinogen in urine were elevated up to 2000 %, whereas the amounts of the porphyrins in faeces were generally unaffected. After chronic <b>fluroxene</b> treatment, the activity of δ-aminolaevulinate synthase was increased, whereas the activity of uroporphyrinogen synthase was decreased. It is concluded that acute <b>fluroxene</b> treatment may affect haem biosynthesis and degradation by a mechanism similar to allylisopropylacetamide, namely by stimulating an atypical cytochrome P- 450 -dependent pathway for haem degradation. The effects of chronic <b>fluroxene</b> treatment on haem biosynthesis may be a consequence of this mechanism or a result of the inhibition by <b>fluroxene</b> of uroporphyrinogen synthase. Chronic <b>fluroxene</b> treatment of male rats affects the haem biosynthetic pathway {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in human genetic acute intermittent porphyria...|$|E
40|$|A sex {{difference}} in postanaesthetic mortality after <b>fluroxene</b> anaesthesia {{was found in}} Swiss Webster mice. More males succumbed than females. This toxicity was biotransformation-dependent and could be reversed by pretreatment with "opposite " sex hormones. The toxicity of the <b>fluroxene</b> metabolite trifluoroethanol also was more marked in male mice, but was only partially influenced by microsomal enzyme inhibitors or stimulators, or by sex hormones. <b>Fluroxene</b> (Fluoromar) {{has been shown to}} cause de-layed death in mice (Cascorbi and Singh-Amaranath, 1972). It has been demonstrated that if anaesthesia with approximately 4. 5 % <b>fluroxene</b> exceeds 1 h, the animals recover apparently unharmed. However, many die within the subsequent 30 h. The number of deaths after <b>fluroxene</b> anaesthesia increases with in-creasing duration of anaesthesia and may be altered by pretreatment with either enzyme-inducing or enzyme-suppressing drugs.

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{responses to}} the addition of 66 or 70 per cent nitrous oxide or nitrogen to steady-state fluroxene-oxygen anaesthesia, end-tidal concentration 5 or 9 per cent, was investigated in young healthy subjects. The reduction of oxygen concentration, on its own, increased heart rate and cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Although these changes were noted only with 9 per cent <b>fluroxene,</b> nitrous oxide produced an alpha-adrenergic sympathomimetic response with 5 per cent <b>fluroxene,</b> but at 9 per cent a mixed alpha and beta response was obtained. Adding nitrous oxide and subtracting an equivalent amount of <b>fluroxene</b> produced a response similar to that seen when nitrous oxide was simply added to 5 per cent <b>fluroxene.</b> Comparing the response of nitrous oxide substituted for nitrogen eliminated {{some of the differences}} between the responses at light and deep levels. Since the response to adding nitrous oxide to <b>fluroxene</b> differed considerably from that seen with halothane or ether we can draw no conclusions concerning the circulatory action of nitrous oxide, and it would appear that we have observed an interaction between nitrous oxide and <b>fluroxene.</b> Nitrous oxide, when added to halothane-oxygen or ether-oxygen anaesthesia, produces vasoconstriction and other signs of sympathetic activation (Smith et al., 1970; Gregory et al., 1971). Although the response with the two agents was similar, we still cannot say whether this response is an independent action of nitrous oxide or whether it results from an interaction with the primary agent. Since nitrous oxide is frequently used with <b>fluroxene,</b> we elected to study the combination. The response to nitrous oxide with halothane or ether was concentration-dependent. Therefore, we investigated the response to nitrous oxide at end-tidal concentrations of <b>fluroxene</b> of 5 % and 9 %. The response to addition of nitrous oxide to <b>fluroxene</b> was indeed different from the other primary agents: at the higher concentration of <b>fluroxene</b> both an alpha- and a beta-adrenergic response occurred, whereas previously only an alpha-adrenergic effect had been observed (Smith et al. ...|$|E

Each of the anaesthetic agents interacts with the type P- 450 cytochromes of hepatic microsomes in vitro resulting in the appearance of a type I difference spectrum, enhancement of NADPH oxidation and production of potentially toxic metabolites, 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol (TFE) (from <b>fluroxene</b> and TFEE) and free fluoride ion (from methoxyflurane and enflurane) ...|$|E
40|$|The intxacranial {{pressure}} was studied in nine patients with space-occupying lesions {{before and after}} addition of 4 % <b>fluroxene</b> to a nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture at normo-capnia and hypocapnia. At normocapnia (Paooa 38 mm Hg) <b>fluroxene</b> produced a 16 mm Hg (range 1 - 59 mm Hg) increase in intracranial pressure leading to a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure, in three cases to critically low values. Hypocapnia (Paco 3 28 mm Hg) resulted in all cases in a rapid fall in intracranial pressure to near normal values and restoration of satisfactory cerebral perfusion pressure. It is concluded that <b>fluroxene</b> {{can be used in}} neuroanaesthesia, provided hyperventilation is applied and non-flammable concentrations are used. Any significant increase in intracranial pressure may be damaging to patients with intracranial disorders because of resulting decrease of regional cerebral blood flow to diseased areas (Paulson, 1972). Also intracranial pressure gradients may develop with sub-sequent distortion and compression of the brain ste...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic microsomal {{cytochrome}} P- 450 {{has previously}} been postulated {{to be an important}} factor in determining the rates of hepatic haem biosynthesis and biodegradation. The basis for this proposal is that the haem moiety of cytochrome P- 450 appears to be in equilibrium between binding to apocytochrome P- 450 and existing in some form in the central hepatic pool of haem concerned with the regulation of the haem metabolic pathways. Consequently, any change in the levels of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 would be anticipated to affect the pathways of hepatic haem biosynthesis and biodegradation. At the onset of this project, relatively few chemical agents were known to destroy cytochrome P- 450 (either by degradation of the haem moiety of, or dissociation of the haem moiety from hepatic microsomal cytochrome P- 450) and to affect hepatic haem biosynthesis and/or haem biodegradation (e. g. AIA, Cs₂ and various metals). We thus attempted to further establish the relationship between the ability of compounds to affect hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and to affect hepatic haem metabolism in vivo, using the three anaesthetic agents, <b>fluroxene,</b> halothane and trichloroethylene. During the preparation of this thesis, several other chemicals have been found which destroy cytochrome P- 450 and affect hepatic haem metabolism (e. g. norethisterone, morphine). In addition to the above, it has been attempted to clarify the roles of the degradation of different forms of cytochrome P- 450 and of the different mechanisms of destruction of cytochrome P- 450 in the control of hepatic haem metabolism. The three anaesthetic agents, <b>fluroxene,</b> halothane and trichloroethylene were chosen for study since they destroy cytochrome P- 450 by apparently different mechanisms. Both <b>fluroxene</b> and trichloroethylene specifically degrade the haem moiety of different forms of cytochrome P- 450, but <b>fluroxene</b> converts the haem moiety of cytochrome P- 450 to an N-substituted porphyrin, while TCE apparently degrades the haem into uncoloured products. In contrast, halothane appears to degrade the haem of cytochrome P- 450 to uncoloured products as well as to facilitate the dissociation of haem from intact cytochrome P- 450...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} mutagenicity of <b>fluroxene</b> {{was investigated}} by the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test using lymphocytes in peripheral blood from patients before and after anaesthesia. Twenty-five female patients, aged 21 - 77 yr (median 36. 5 yr) were anaesthetized for gynaecological operations with <b>fluroxene</b> in nitrous oxide for 60 - 220 nun (median 110 min). The number of SCE per cell was the same before and immediately after anaesthesia. In 10 patients, SCE were examined 3 days later and no increase was observed. In rune of the other patients, SCE rates were identical before and after anaesthesia and 1 and 5 days later. It was {{concluded that there was}} no indication, from this test, of a mutagenic effect of short-term exposure to anaesthetic concentrations of <b>fluroxene</b> in nitrous oxide The possibility of a health hazard from anaesthetic agents has been discussed extensively for the last decade (reviews by Spence and Knill-Jones, 1978; Cohen, 1980; Vessey and Nunn, 1980). Experimen-tal and epidemiological studies have indicated indi-rectly that working in an environment contaminated by waste anaesthetic gases may be a health hazard, but a casual relationship has never been established. Recently, laboratory tests on mutagenicity have been used in investigations of inhalation anaesthe-tics (Baden et al., 1977; White et al., 1979; Baden and Simmon, 1980; Basler and Rohrborn, 1981). The sister chromatid exchange test is based on examination of the exchange of DNA material be-tween the two chromatids in the chromosomes in mammalian cells. An increased number of such sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) reflects the influ-ence of mutagens (Perry and Evans, 1975; Latt et al., 1979). Previous in vitro studies of inhalation anaesthetics by this test showed only the vinyl-containing compounds <b>fluroxene,</b> ethyl-vinyl ether and divjnyl ether increased SCE, suggesting that the vinyl moiety might be important in this capacity (White etal., 1979). The SCE test may also be useful for evaluation of exposure to potential mutagens in vivo (Latt et al. ...|$|E
40|$|The lethal {{effects of}} the {{fluorinated}} ether anesthetic, <b>fluroxene,</b> in rats are a consequence ofits metabolism, which is catalyzed by cytochrome P- 450 to the toxic metabolite 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol (TFE). The anesthetic or TFE (0. 2 1 dkg) caused decreased white blood cell counts, necrosis of bone marrow and lymphocytes, and decreased small intestine dry weight and was associated with septicemia. To elucidate the mechanism of TFE toxicity in rats we undertook histopathologic, ultrastructural and bacteriologic studies. TFE produced severe edema of intestinal lamina propria and submucosae, dilatation of crypts, loss of surface epithelium, vacuolation and necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the edematous lamina propria. Intestinal epithelial villi lost their cellular tissue integrity. Coccobacillary organisms were numerous in the ulcerated intestine. Hemolytic E. coli were isolated from intestinal tissue at a two-log increase in concentration relative to controls. Hemograms from TFE-treated rats exhibited marked leukopenia and morphologic differences. The platelets lost their discoid shape, extended pseudopods, and centralizing granules. Hemoglobin precipitation as Heinz bodies and crystalloid structures was observed in TFE-treated rats. Together the data suggest that TFE-induced enteropathy was most probably due to E. coli precipitated from TFE-mediated alterations in the population of small intestinal microbes.
