50|$|All {{except the}} 430 and 1000 series cars could be, and often were, run {{together}} {{in two or}} three car trains, including combinations of both the 800 and newer 700 series cars. Across the years, equipment modifications were made by the Fairview Allentown shops. The 700 series steel cars were converted from center-entrance two-man crew to one-man cars. Coach 812 was a classic arch window large <b>interurban</b> <b>coach</b> typical of 1912 construction. It was built in the LVT shops as a private car and later converted to regular passenger service. It operated to the last day of rail operation in 1951. The LVT color scheme was an all red body with silver roof until the lightweight 1000 series cars arrived in 1939. Some of the older fleet was then retired and the rest repainted white with red trim and silver roof. Restored LVT car 801 is located in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as part of a growing trolley and interurban collection.|$|E
50|$|Two Hall-Scott <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> {{from the}} former Sacramento Northern Railroad (serial numbers 1019 and 1020) are at the Western Railway Museum at Rio Vista, California. The 1020 is {{restored}} to its original coach/trailer configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Passenger {{operations}} were conducted using {{a group of}} five <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> and three combines ordered from Niles Car and Manufacturing Company in 1907. Freight trains were initially hauled by steam locomotives but in 1913 the Y&OR ordered electric locomotives to replace them. These [...] "steeplecabs" [...] were responsible for hauling the significant number of coal trains which traversed the Y&OR.|$|R
50|$|Three years later, in 1891, it was {{converted}} to steam {{and as the}} capital expanded, business to the suburbs was so good that a new branch to Campo de Mayo was inaugurated in 1904 using electric power supply, and the whole section between Federico Lacroze and San Martín was electrified in 1908. Electricity came from the Lacroze tramways of Buenos Aires and overhead wires delivered 600 volt DC current to a fleet of wooden US-style <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> from Brill.|$|R
50|$|By 1951 it was {{completely}} rebuilt, new substations were set up, new modern cantilever roofed stations made of reinforced concrete were built and 28 used 1700 series <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches,</b> manufactured by Pacific Electric Railway between 1925 and 1928, were bought. One interesting fact is that in 1959, General Urquiza Railway acquired 30 PCC coaches, built by the St. Louis Car Company in 1940. These were modified at the ends to operate in two, three or four-sectioned articulated formations like most modern LRVs. They were all retired by the mid-1960s, {{because they were too}} lightly built to handle the heavy passenger loads.|$|R
5000|$|MAN Truck & Bus AG (formerly MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, [...] ) is {{the largest}} {{subsidiary}} of the MAN SE corporation, {{and one of the}} leading international providers of commercial vehicles. Headquartered in Munich, Germany, MAN Truck & Bus produces vans in the range from 3.0 to 5.5 t gvw, trucks in the range from 7.49 to 44 t gvw, heavy goods vehicles up to 250 t road train gvw, bus-chassis, <b>coaches,</b> <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches,</b> and city buses. MAN Truck & Bus also produces diesel and natural-gas engines. The MAN acronym originally stood for Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG pronounced ˈʔaʊ̯ksbʊʁk ˈnʏʁnbɛʁk or -faˈbʁɪk-), formerly MAN AG.|$|R
5000|$|W. L. Holman Car Company was a {{streetcar}} {{and cable}} car manufacturer based in San Francisco, California. It mainly built equipment for rail operation, including San Francisco Municipal Railway's first publicly owned streetcar, {{and some of}} the cable cars still operating on San Francisco's California Street line. Holman also constructed heavy <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> and combines (combined passenger and freight-express cars) that ran on inland California electric railroads including Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad, Sacramento Northern Railway, and Central California Traction Company, as well as the Sierra Railroad, a Common Carrier line which operated out of Jamestown, California.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925, GM {{purchased}} a controlling interest in Yellow Coach, a bus manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois {{which was founded}} by John D. Hertz. After purchasing the remaining portion in 1943, GM renamed it GM Truck and Coach Division. The Division manufactured <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> until 1980. Transit bus production ended in May 1987. The Canadian plant (in London, Ontario) produced buses from 1962 until July 1987. GM withdrew from the bus and coach market because of increased competition in the late 1970s and 1980s. Rights to the RTS model were sold to Transportation Manufacturing Corporation, while Motor Coach Industries of Canada purchased the Classic design. In 1998, GMC's official branding on vehicles was shortened from [...] "GMC Truck" [...] to simply [...] "GMC".|$|R

25|$|Gray Coach Lines was a {{suburban}} and regional intercity bus operator founded in 1927 by the TTC. Gray <b>Coach</b> used <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> to link Toronto to points throughout southern Ontario. In addition, Gray Coach operated tour buses in association with Gray Line Tours. The main terminal was the Metropolitan Toronto Bus Terminal on Elizabeth Street north of Dundas Street, downtown. In 1954, Gray Coach expanded further when it acquired suburban routes from independent bus operators not merged with the TTC as it expanded to cover Metro Toronto. By the 1980s, Gray Coach faced fierce competition in the interurban service in the GTA. The TTC sold Gray Coach Lines in 1990 to Stagecoach Holdings, which split the operation between Greyhound Canada {{and the government of}} Ontario three years later.|$|R
40|$|In January 2013 the {{interurban}} {{passenger transport}} market in Germany was liberalized and several coach carriers emerged offering {{an alternative to}} the Deutsche Bahn, a state owned rail monopoly. The coach carriers have attempted to position themselves not just through lower prices but also through product differentiation, for example marketing their services as the most ecological way to travel. Hence, {{it is important to consider}} attitudes and perceptions when analyzing this market. One year after liberalization we conducted a stated-choice experiment among students and employees at the Technical University of Berlin, where participants had to choose between different interurban public transport alternatives (regional and intercity trains or <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches).</b> Additionally, the experiment gathered perception and attitudinal indicators used to construct latent variables. Our results show that attitudes and perceptions indeed affect the way individuals choose between different transport modes and, therefore, they must be taken into account when analyzing the interurban passenger market in Germany...|$|R
50|$|The J. G. Brill Company {{manufactured}} streetcars, <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches,</b> {{and buses}} in the United States for almost ninety years. The company {{was founded by}} John George Brill in 1868 as a horsecar manufacturing firm in Philadelphia. Over the years, it absorbed numerous other trolley-interurban manufacturers such as Kuhlman in Cleveland and Jewett in Indiana. With business diminishing, in 1944 it merged with the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) to become ACF-Brill. It ceased trolley and bus production in 1954, though some of their interurbans served the Philadelphia area till the 1980s. Brill was the longest lasting of the nation's trolley and interurban manufacturers. It manufactured over 45,000 streetcars, trams (also known as trolleys or trolley cars in the U.S.), motor buses, trolleybuses and railroad cars. At its height, {{it was the largest}} manufacturer of streetcars and interurbans in the U.S. and produced more streetcars and interurbans and gas electrics than any other manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1925 by Giovanni De Simon, who started {{assembling}} wooden-body buses for the local public transport. Later, under the management of his son Ilvo, the company introduced steel for <b>interurban</b> and touristic <b>coaches,</b> using Fiat, OM, Lancia or Alfa chassis.|$|R
50|$|In 1905, {{the assets}} of the new Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley Traction Company were {{acquired}} by a new corporate entity: the Lehigh Valley Transit Company. The owners started an extensive rebuilding of the Allentown to Philadelphia route. Much side of road track (the line was always a single track) was replaced by track running in open country, however considerable older side-of-road trackage remained, particularly south of Quakertown. Heavy wood arch windowed <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> were purchased for high speed operation. This upgrading program culminated in a high capacity interurban line running from Allentown to Norristown. It existed until 1951. Multiple car Interurbans operated from Allentown to Philadelphia's 69th Street terminal using the Philadelphia and Western Railroad south of Norristown starting in December 1912. Service on the former Inland Traction route running from North Wales (Junction) to Chestnut Hill continued until 1926, and the route between central Quakertown and Richlandtown ran until 1929, both replaced by bus. The LVT and P&W both reorganized during the next twenty years (LVT twice), but trolleys continued to operate and compete with the nearly paralleling Reading Railroad Bethlehem to Philadelphia line due to lower cost to riders, particularly during the Depression, and then again vitally during the gasoline rationing of World War II.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interurban}} Los Angeles to Long Beach {{passenger rail}} line served the longest, from July 4, 1903, until April 9, 1961. It was both {{the first and}} last interurban passenger line of the former PE. It still had long stretches of open country running on private right-of-way. With this closure the final rail link was replaced by the <b>interurban</b> Motor <b>Coach</b> 36f ("F" [...] representing Freeway Flyer) route. This former PE route {{was the first of the}} new MTA light rail lines, rebuilt as the dual track Metro Blue Line.|$|R
50|$|In 1926, {{the former}} Cincinnati and Dayton Traction Company was reorganised {{under the new}} name Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton. The C&DTC {{right-of-way}} {{was part of the}} former Ohio Electric Railway's line between Dayton and Cincinnati. This new interurban company (which had no relationship with the steam railroad of the same name which eventually was absorbed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) was headed by a former Univ of Penn Wharton School professor of finance, Dr. Thomas Conway, Jr., who had already been successful in reviving the interurban Chicago, Aurora, and Elgin Railroad. He ordered badly needed all steel <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> , box-motor express cars and freight cars, and spent heavily to improve track and right-of-way, although the original 1900s rails laid within the brick streets of the cities and towns such as Dayton remained a maintenance problem and were a source of constant arguments with township administrations. Not only were the towns unhappy about who was to pay for street repairs and snow removal, they complained about the 30 ST 50 ft long and heavy interurban cars mixing in with growing 1920s automobile traffic. Conway did well at building up the CH&D freight business utilizing his new interurban freight equipment which often was operated at night, and by virtue of his wide contacts in the railroad industry was more than ordinarily successful in establishing through rates for LCL (less-than-boxcar load freight) with some steam railroads, not an easy thing to accomplish for an interurban. Conway believed that there was still a place for the interurban in medium distance passenger traffic and longer distance LCL freight, and thus conceived the idea of the CH&D.|$|R
2500|$|In its startup {{years just}} before the {{beginning}} of the unexpected Great Depression, the Indiana Railroad obtained funds for improving its physical plant and purchasing new <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> and freight equipment. These funds were obtained by selling corporate stock and bonds. Interest was to be paid on the bonds semi-annually from operating income along with paying normal rail operating and business expenses, but the company's operating income declined and eventually became inadequate to repay the bond interest. This forced an eventual [...] declaration of bankruptcy. The public's desire to travel by interurban diminished as the Depression deepened, plus more roads were being paved with more cars driven on them. On July 28, 1933, IR went into bankruptcy but continued to operate. Control was placed by bankruptcy court into the hands of receiver Bowman Elder. Elder was able to keep the system virtually intact for four more years with increasing income from freight. The IR was operating about [...] of interurban lines throughout Indiana during this period. [...] In 1936, IR actually showed an operating profit: the only time in its history that it did so. [...] In that year, the IR found it necessary in order to maintain an essential freight business to Dayton, brought under its control the Dayton and Western, which it leased for two years. This continued its valuable freight link to the very active Cincinnati and Lake Erie Ohio interurban which ran from Cincinnati through Dayton to Toledo and east to Cleveland using the Lake Shore Electric interurban. The IR and the C moved much freight at the time to Cleveland. When the Lakeshore Electric was abandoned, severing the ability to ship to Cleveland, the C soon stopped running too. The Dayton and Western provided a connection from the IR to the C Eventually, the IR did not have the funds to continue to lease the D The lease was dropped, the D shut down, and the important freight connection was lost.|$|R
5000|$|The LVT {{distinguished}} {{itself in}} the transit industry with its remarkable 1938-1940 rehabilitation program and {{the stars of the}} modernization were the thirteen ex-Cincinnati and Lake Erie high speed former [...] "Red Devils." [...] They were extensively modified by the LVT and were renumbered the 1000 and the 1020 series. This acquisition and rehabilitation probably saved LVT from an earlier abandonment. These well designed interurbans dramatically improved passenger comfort with quick acceleration and high speed capability even with poor track, which improved schedules and service, and they used less electric power than their predecessors. LVT ridership increased, and then with the start of World War II, gasoline and tire rationing required more non-automobile transportation in the Philadelphia region and ridership increased dramatically leading to an exhausting use of LVT equipment. The Red Devils had been the result of one successful Ohio interurban combining with two financially distressed Ohio lines in 1930 to become the 257 mi Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad. C&LE management knew that passenger and freight service had to be improved if the new line was to be profitable. For passenger service, C&LE engineers worked with the Cincinnati Car Company staff in 1929 to design and construct twenty <b>interurban</b> <b>coaches</b> with improved passenger comfort and appeal. Better performance in terms of ride, speed, and reduced power consumption was obtained through improved aerodynamics, reduced car weight, and improved truck design. Significant use of aluminum reduced weight, and the Red Devils provided passengers with comfortable leather bucket seats with headrests. One drawback was that Red Devils had a smaller passenger capacity than provided by the older and longer wood Ohio interurbans, but C&LE planned to increase scheduled service to make up for this. The Red Devils were 43 ft long, 11 ft high and weighed 24 ST. A typical 1920s large steel interurban was around 56 ft long, 14 ft high, and weighed 60 ST.|$|R
50|$|The bus {{terminal}} is strategically located, {{in the middle}} of what was formerly the City of North York, at Allen Road {{on the south side of}} Highway 401, the main transportation artery across the Greater Toronto Area. This is ideal for providing GO Transit commuter bus services to points east and west of the city and long-distance intercity coach connections by Ontario Northland and Greyhound. When it opened on October 12, 1979, it was a hub for Gray <b>Coach</b> <b>interurban</b> bus service and, until 2000, for the Toronto Airport Express bus service originally operated by Gray Coach and, after 1993, by Pacific Western Transportation.|$|R
5000|$|North America and the UK {{were the}} only areas {{in the world in}} the 1960s and 1970s where a {{passenger}} was unlikely to find a Worldmaster. Israel was the largest market with more than 5,000 in service, most of them had locally built bodies. More than 3,600 chassis were built at the Leyland Ashdod plant in Israel. They served as <b>interurban,</b> urban, <b>coaches</b> and even as trucks. Many were re-bodied during the 1980s. In India, Portugal and Spain examples even had double-deck bodies fitted. Almost all markets produced their own styles and makes of coachwork, for example Casaro of Italy produced a Ghia-styled coach on LERT2 with a flamboyant grille, ribbed anodised-aluminium skirt panels and large tail fins. This was reproduced as Matchbox Toys number 40, [...] "Leyland Royal Tiger Coach". Ayats in Spain produced an LERT1 whose frontal aspect resembled the Edsel car, and many other coachbuilders made pan-continental names bodying the Worldmaster, DAB in particular, able to respond in 1959 to a short-notice order from Poland's state tourism authority, became favoured by and eventually taken over by Leyland. Other globally notable coachbuilders to body Worldmasters include Ha'argaz and Merkavim in Israel, Jonckheere, Van Hool, Marcopolo, Custom Coaches and NZMB.|$|R
40|$|A {{certain number}} of studies are {{currently}} {{carried out in the}} European countries to evaluate the increase of the traffic passenger volume which would result if coaches and buses transport were to become fully accessible to disabled people. In the last decade there has been a progressive increase in the social awareness regard the needs of disabled people, throughout Europe and {{in other parts of the}} world. The dissertation fits in the field of COST Action 349, titled “Accessibility of Coaches and Long Distance Buses for People with Reduced Mobility”: the main purpose of the action is to provide a series of guidance on the construction and design of <b>interurban</b> and international <b>coaches</b> and buses, in respect of the need of people with reduced mobility. The aim is to assist operators, passengers and authorities when developing plans for accessible and high quality transport system. The paper deal about a special device to allow a wheelchair user to get on a high floor bus and about the vehicle design solutions aimed to increase accessibility for all the people with reduced mobility. The designed solutions are checked with the recommendation of the COST Action 349, presented in the final seminar held on 25 October 2005, with the purpose to check out both the design and the recommendations...|$|R
40|$|A stated {{preference}} (SP) experiment for <b>interurban</b> trips by <b>coach</b> or {{train was}} designed and programmed on portable computers {{with the aid of}} specialized software. Trip characteristics and socio-economic information about each individual were also gathered. Four variables were considered: travel time, fare, comfort and reliability. Data for 112 individuals were collected, 14 of which always preferred train; this behaviour was attributed to safety and comfort reasons and therefore the latter were treated separately because of their peculiarity. The data for the remaining 98 cases had ten choices available for each individual; thus we had a final sample of 980 observations for the calibration stage. The next phase of the project was to add revealed preference (RP) data which came from two sources: that collected during the SP experiment (i. e. 98 individuals) and another sample taken as part of a previous research project conducted by the Universidad de Chile (407 individuals). The complete data set was used to examine several issues in the mixed estimation of RP/SP models, such as: appropriate model structure, structural variations between the estimation and forecasting stages (including the role of mode specific constants and inertia-like variables), and influence of the relative proportions of RP and SP data in the modelling results. Our findings, particularly in terms of subjective values of time, are compared with previous studies both in Chile and elsewhere. ...|$|R
