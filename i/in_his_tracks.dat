5|$|American {{involvement}} in the Everglades began during the Second Seminole War (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30million and $40million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged {{with the task of}} finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Norris' conviction, the British media drew comparisons with Harold Shipman, Britain's most prolific serial killer who killed more than 250 patients by lethal injections. Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Gregg, {{who worked on the}} Shipman case and led the Norris investigation, was convinced that Colin Norris would have gone on to kill considerably more people if he had not been not stopped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E

The Globe and Mail ran an editorial commenting they were [...] "striving (against the wicked odds that only Toronto can provide) {{to view the}} situation with proper seriousness.

[...] The paper suggested that Robinson's insights [...] "doubtless would have stopped Michelangelo <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> and branded him {{as nothing more than}} a dirty chisler." ...|$|E

500|$|Atlanta Constitution {{sporting}} editor A. W. Lynn wrote: [...] "The general surprises {{are numerous}} enough, but the largest particular {{one was the}} Commodore–Indian contest, when Vanderbilt took off the greatest honors ever falling to the lot of a southern football team in the hardest battle ever fought on a southern gridiron. John Heisman wrote: [...] "Manier bucked the Indians' line. Costen handled the ball surely and well downed Mt. Pleasant <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> on most of Blake's punts...I am still convinced that outside Yale and Princeton, the Commodores would have an even break with any other team in the country."

2500|$|One of Atwater's career {{highlights}} {{happened on}} September 17, 1990, during a Monday Night Football telecast from Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado. As Kansas City Chiefs massive 260 lbs. running back Christian Okoye, came {{through a hole}} in the line of scrimmage, he was met by Atwater. The resulting collision stopped Okoye <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks,</b> with Atwater standing over him, taunting the proclaimed [...] "Nigerian Nightmare", while he lay on the ground stunned. His coach Mike Shanahan stated [...] "That's the hit people will remember him for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Hispanic eyes, Atlantis {{had a more}} {{intimate}} interpretation. The land had been a colonial power which, although it had brought civilization to ancient Europe, had also enslaved its peoples. Its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it, but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world. This {{was the point of}} view of Jacint Verdaguer’s vast mythological epic L’Atlantida (1877). [...] After the sinking of the former continent, Hercules travels east across the Atlantic to found the city of Barcelona and then departs westward again to the Hesperides. The story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner, who is inspired to follow <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> and so “call the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old”. This mariner, of course, was Christopher Columbus.|$|E

2500|$|Bailey {{was known}} to walk {{to work as a}} daily routine, and to stop for breakfast at a McDonald's {{fast-food}} restaurant at 14th Street and Jackson Street, about a half-block from where he was killed in the 200 block of 14th Street. After being followed from the vicinity of his apartment, the assassin spotted Bailey leaving the McDonald's restaurant, he then got out of the van, parked on Alice Street. Wearing a mask and dark clothing, he approached Bailey with the shotgun. [...] A witness claims he recognized Bailey, and that he was in trouble, but stopped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> when he saw the shotgun. [...] Witnesses said the single gunman wearing dark clothing and a ski mask approached Bailey and fired at least three rounds from a shotgun, hitting Bailey at least once in the chest, before fleeing on foot to the waiting getaway van. [...] Police Chief Wayne Tucker described the killing as [...] "unusual" [...] because it occurred downtown and in broad daylight.|$|E
2500|$|The Scream 3 {{score was}} again helmed by Marco Beltrami who {{employed}} seven orchestrators and experimented with {{the recording of}} instruments in unusual circumstances such as physically and electronically altering the traditional sound of a piano while continuing to include a heavy vocal orchestra <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> There was consideration that Beltrami was forced to hire multiple orchestrators to complete the score to meet the film's deadline. Like previous scores in the series, the Scream 3 score was released by Varèse Sarabande on February 29, 2000 with a total length of 33 minutes of music, though the album was again found to be missing certain sections of the score utilized within the film. Beltrami took inspiration from other composers for the score, again incorporating excerpts of the score to Broken Arrow by Hans Zimmer in the track [...] "Sid Wears a Dress". Music guide Allmusic awarded the Scream 3 score 2.5 out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|After a 2-yard {{run from}} Ryan, Reese ran {{in for a}} {{touchdown}} behind guard Tuck Kelly. Hek Wakefield missed the field goal for the extra point, but an offside penalty from the Bulldogs awarded the Commodores the point. [...] Punts were exchanged by both teams {{in the next few}} possessions. Then Gil Reese returned a punt for 63 yards and the touchdown. Reese started the return by running wide to the right; seven Georgia players were in hot pursuit. Reese stopped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks,</b> causing two Georgia defenders to go past him. Running down the sideline and weaving {{through the rest of the}} defenders' missed tackles, eventually Reese was beyond them all and ran in for the score. Morgan Blake says this score was what broke the Bulldogs' will. He further lamented,"when you say that Mr. Reese is a combination of a greyhound, rabbit, antelope, and greased pig you only mildly do this young gentleman justice." [...] Wakefield kicked goal. [...] The first half ended with Vanderbilt up 14 to 0. The Bulldogs had not yet managed a single first down.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie and Rachel {{are taken}} home; Darlene and Richard, who have arrived home, console the girls. As Darlene goes upstairs to run Jamie a bath, she is {{suddenly}} attacked by Jamie, {{who has had}} the evil passed on to her by Michael. Loomis hears Darlene's screams and races halfway up the stairs before he stops dead <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks.</b> He sees the horrific sight of Jamie, still in her clown costume (similar to what Michael wore when he killed his sister) standing {{at the top of}} the stairs, wearing a clown mask, holding a pair of scissors in her hand and stained with blood. Loomis then starts screaming, [...] "No!" [...] over and over again, backing against the wall and raising his gun to shoot her. Sheriff Meeker stops Loomis and disarms him, taking the gun into his own hands before he, Mr. Carruthers, and Rachel also see the horror that Loomis saw. Loomis slowly sinks to the floor, sobbing as Rachel, Richard, and Sheriff Meeker stare in horror. Jamie is now consumed by Michael's rage.|$|E
2500|$|Sybil Fawlty, {{played by}} Prunella Scales, is Basil's wife. Energetic and petite, she prefers a working {{wardrobe}} of tight skirt-suits in shiny fabrics and sports {{a tower of}} permed hair augmented with hairpieces and wigs and necessitating the use of overnight curlers. She often is a more effective manager of the hotel, making sure Basil gets certain jobs done or stays {{out of the way}} when she is handling difficult guests. Typically when Basil {{is on the verge of}} meltdown due to a crisis (usually of his own making), it is Sybil who steps in to clear up the mess and bring some sense to the situation. [...] Despite this, she rarely participates directly in the running of the hotel. During busy check-in sessions or meal times, while everyone else is busy working, Sybil frequently is talking on the phone to one of her friends with her phrase [...] "Oohhh, I knoooooooow" [...] or chatting to customers. She has a distinctive conversational tone and braying laugh, which Basil compares to [...] "someone machine-gunning a seal." [...] Being his wife, she is the only regular character who refers to Basil by his first name. When she barks his name at him, he flinchingly freezes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2014, Khan {{stated that}} he was in talks to fight either Devon Alexander or Robert Guerrero, {{possibly}} in the UK {{by the end of the}} year. On 21 October, one year after pulling out of the fight, it was announced that Khan would fight former two-weight world champion Alexander (26-2, 14 KOs). The fight took place on 13 December at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Showtime in the US and Sky Sports in the United Kingdom. In front of 7,768 in attendance, Khan produced a dominant performance to secure a unanimous points victory over Alexander. All three judges scored heavily in Khan's favour, 119–109, 118–110 and 120–108 ESPN's Dan Rafael scored it a 120-108 shutout for Khan. [...] Alexander followed Khan around the ring throughout but was unable to land more than one punch at a time as Khan met him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> with hard combinations. After his victory Khan reiterated his desire to fight American Floyd Mayweather. Promoter Oscar De La Hoya said, [...] "So now I know why Mayweather doesn't want to fight him. He was brilliant. I wouldn't have fought him. He is hitting his peak just now. He looked incredible." [...] Khan outlanded Alexander 243 to 91, according to CompuBox, and connected on 43 percentage of his shots, compared to just 20 percent for Alexander. Khan earned $950,000 and Alexander was paid $600,000 for the fight.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{focuses on}} the {{exploits}} and misadventures of short-fused hotelier Basil Fawlty and his acerbic wife Sybil, {{as well as their}} employees: porter and waiter Manuel, maid Polly, and, in the second series, chef Terry. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in [...] "raising the tone" [...] of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as [...] "that golfing puff adder", [...] "my little piranha fish" [...] and [...] "my little nest of vipers". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>tracks</b> at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of [...] "Basil!" [...] At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance. Basil occasionally longs for a touch of class, sometimes by playing recordings of classical music. In one episode he is playing music by Brahms when Sybil remarks, after pestering him asking to do different tasks: [...] "You could have them both done by now if you hadn't spend the whole morning skulking in there listening to that racket." [...] Basil replies, with exasperation, [...] "Racket?? That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!" ...|$|E
