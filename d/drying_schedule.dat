40|$|The {{quality of}} dried {{softwood}} timber depends of {{course on the}} drying process performance and in batch kilns especially on the <b>drying</b> <b>schedule.</b> In the Nordic countries the <b>drying</b> <b>schedule</b> is almost always a time based schedule, i. e. the target climate {{is defined as a}} function of drying time. The basic idea is that the average properties of each batch (same wood species and board dimension) are almost constant and when a suitable <b>drying</b> <b>schedule</b> has been found, then it can be used repeatedly without changes. In continental Europe the target climate is very often defined {{as a function of the}} actual average MC of the batch. The basic idea here is to adapt the schedule according to the real properties of each batch. This is a correct approach, but the problem is to measure the average MC accurately during the process. This is normally done by pairs of electrodes driven into a limited number of boards for electric resistance measurements. Each board has however individual properties and the measured MC differs normally from the average MC of the batch. In addition the MC value based on the electric resistance is not fully reliable. This introduces a stochastic element in the performance of the kiln control system. The aim of this paper is to analyse the accuracy of the MC based schedule control and compare it to the time based schedule approach. The analysis is performed using a simulation program for the drying process. Virtual boards with different properties (initial MC, heartwood content, density and ‘dryability’) are generated using a random number generator. It has been taken into account that the properties mentioned are not statistically independent. In this way a batch of timber is generated and the drying of each board is simulated in order to get the individual final MC and further the MC standard deviation for the whole batch. The MC based <b>drying</b> <b>schedule</b> is applied according to the calculated MC of a few randomly selected boards. The influence on the final MC variation, by the number of boards selected for MC estimation, can thus be determined, as well as the influence of some other features. The results are then compared to the corresponding results for a similar kiln using a time based <b>drying</b> <b>schedule...</b>|$|E

Acacia mangium is an {{important}} specie planted in Costa Rica.

It was considered climatic conditions where tree growth, height of the tree, grain pattern, drying schedules, distance from pith and sapwood or heartwood presence.

40|$|Wood drying – {{important}} part of woodworking process, performed in economical and technological directions. A number of factors are encountered when drying the wood that influence the quality of dried material. High-quality dried wood is expensive and {{it is easier to}} process than wet wood. Wood drying schedules selection is a very {{important part}} of production cycle. A variety of wood drying schedules are tested and their efficiency verified, according to the drying time and final distribution of moisture content in dried wood. The wide variation of moisture content in wood after drying, cause a lot of trouble to process wood further. Main goal of this scientific work – identify the influence of place in the drying kiln and <b>drying</b> <b>schedule</b> on moisture content distribution in wood. The study of wood drying is carried out in a convection drying chamber with electronic humidity and temperature sensors and computer controls (RGK 170, CSA Electronic, Germany).

40|$|During drying, {{stresses}} and deformations develop in a wood board due to shrinkage fields which result from moisture content and temperature field variations. In spite of numerous works done in wood drying modelling {{in the last}} decades, wood drying optimisation based on modelling and simulation remains far from initial expectations. Two main reasons can explain this assessment: the huge variability of wood and the variations in drying conditions throughout the board stack in a dryer. To address these two key problems, we used a dual scale numerical tool able to compute simultaneously the stress and deformation of hundreds of boards in the stack during drying.
