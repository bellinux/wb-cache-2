Materials and methods: Eighteen patients with severe stroke were measured with the <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Movement</b> Measuring Instrument. <b>Respiratory</b> frequencies, <b>movements,</b> regularity of amplitude and frequency were compared with individuals with no neurological disease. Results: The demographics and physical performance were comparable for 8 left and 10 right hemispheric stroke. Deep <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> were significantly decreased (p< 0. 001) and frequency significantly increased (p< 0. 03 for quiet and p = 0. 002 for deep breathing), for the group (n = 18) compared with reference values.

40|$|Objective Because fetal <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> {{increase}} {{left ventricular}} compliance, {{we hypothesized that}} the left atrial shortening fraction increases during fetal respiratory motions. Methods A group of 26 normal fetuses with gestational ages between 28 and 38 weeks were assessed in a prospective cross-sectional study. Left atrial telesystolic and presystolic diameters were measured during apnea and after five consecutive <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements.</b> Left atrial shortening fraction was obtained by the ratio: [maximal left atrium diameter (telesystolic) – minimal left atrium diameter (presystolic) ]/maximal left atrium diameter (telesystolic). The mean of three measurements were considered. Two-tailed Student’s t-test was used. Results Mean gestational age was (mean SD) 30. 7 2. 8 weeks. Mean left atrial telesystolic diameter in apnea was 10. 6 0. 7 mm and during <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> it was 10. 5 1. 1 mm (p= 0. 98). Presystolic left atrial diameter was 5. 2 0. 1 mm in apnea and 4. 4 1. 3 mm during <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> (p< 0. 001). Left atrial shortening fraction was 0. 50 0. 05 in apnea and 0. 58 0. 13 during <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> (p< 0. 001). Conclusion Left atrial shortening fraction is higher during <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> {{as a result of}} increased left ventricular compliance and consequent optimization of left atrial functional status.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate lung function, <b>respiratory</b> <b>movement</b> and physical fitness together with the patient’s satisfaction with the look of the chest one year following modified Nuss procedure. Methods: In this prospective cohort follow-up study eighteen boys and young men who underwent modified Nuss procedure participated. Measurements of lung volumes using spirometry, <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> using <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Movement</b> Measuring Instrument, and physical fitness using Aastrand ergometer bicycle test were performed pre- and one year post-operatively. Assessment of participants’ opinion of the looks of their chest was made at the same point in time. Results: Participants mean age was 16 ± 3 years, their mean BMI was 20. 8 ± 3. 5 kg/m 2 and mean Haller Index was 3. 9 ± 0. 7.

A recently developed instrument for measuring <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> is introduced. PURPOSE: To compare chest and abdominal wall movements in AS patients with those of controls using a newly developed instrument. STUDY DESIGN: A comparative study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fourteen male AS patients were invited to the study. All subjects answered a standardized questionnaire concerning general health. OUTCOME MEASURES: Body height and weight and <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements.</b> METHODS: Upper and lower chest wall and abdominal motion was measured bilaterally for a period of 1 minute during deep breathing by using a new instrument based on a laser technique, The <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Movement</b> Measuring Instrument (ReMo, Reykjavík, Iceland). Results were compared to healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 47 +/- 9. 5 years, and they had a history of AS for 13 +/- 6 years. Their mean BMI was 27 +/- 3. 6. The <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> of the upper thoracic level were significantly lower than in the reference group (right p=. 01, left p=. 05).

Objective: To {{counteract}} the organ motion caused by <b>respiratory</b> <b>movement</b> through controlling the positioning bed’s synchronous motion with the organ with the breathing sensor in body gamma knife treatment. Methods: The displacement curve of relationship between lung volume and organs in the lung {{was obtained by}} acquiring respiratory signals with the piezoelectric film respiratory sensor. Used single chip microcomputer to control stepper motor which spurts the positioning bed through the transmitter to make it move simultaneously in real time {{according to the law}} of organ motion, so as to {{counteract the}} organ motion caused by <b>respiratory</b> <b>movement</b> and thus to improve the precision of radiotherapy.

40|$|Caddis larvae which bear cases {{ventilate}} their gills by undulatory {{movements of}} the abdomen. These <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> produce a stream of water flowing out through the posterior opening of the case. In well-aerated water the movements are intermittent, periods of undulation alternating with pauses. In poorly aerated water the pauses become shorter. The only study of the environmental control of these <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> by caddis larvae is that of van Dam (1938). This worker studied the larvae oiPhryganea grandis L. which {{had been removed from}} their cases and confined in celluloid tubes open at each end. He found that raising the temperature shortened and finally abolished the pauses between bursts of undulation. The same result was obtained when the oxygen content of the outside water was lowered by bubbling nitrogen through it. When aerated water was passed directly through the celluloid tubes, <b>respiratory</b> <b>movements</b> ceased. Carbon dioxide caused no acceleration in the move-ments.

Purpose: To compare <b>respiratory</b> <b>movement</b> patterns in patients with acute hemispheric stroke to healthy individuals and compare <b>respiratory</b> <b>movement</b> patterns in patients with a left- versus right-sided stroke. Material and Methods: Acute hemispheric stroke patients admitted to Landspitali University Hospital who had suffered a sequele so severe that they needed assistance from {{at least one person}} to perform activities of daily living were asked to participate. Exclusion criteria were: pulmonary diseases, congestive heart failure, severe aphasia, severe dementia, diseases other than stroke affecting mobility and former history of stroke of the contralateral side. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>movement</b> patterns were measured with <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Movement</b> Measuring Instrument (RMMI), measuring movements of thorax and abdomen. Their physical performance was assessed using the MAS-scale, their neglect was assessed using a lettercancellation- test. Results: Subjects were 18, 10 left hemiparesis (mean age 62. 2 ± 14. 2 years) and 8 had right hemiparesis (mean age 651 ± 8. 9 years). The differences in age, BMI, number of days from insult to measurement and median score on MAS were not significant. Respiratory rate in quiet breathing was regular, only one patient with right sided hemiplegia had irregular rate. During deep breathing the rate became irregular, particularly among those with left hemiparesis. Six patients had irregular range of respiratory motion in quiet breathing, four of them had Cheyne-Stokes breathing. During deep breathing the range of respiratory motion was more irregular, particularly among those with left hemiparesis. The study group had significantly (p= 0. 003) more irregular range of respiratory motion during deep breathing than a control group of AS patients, but the irregularity in frequency of respiratory motion was not significant (p= 0. 058). The mean respiratory rate among stroke patients was significantly higher than among healthy people both during quiet (p< 0. 03) and deep breathing (p= 0. 002). The stroke patients had also significantly (p< 0. 001) reduced range of motion during deep breathing. No {{significant differences were found between}} stroke groups (right and left sided hemiparesis) in respiratory rate, regularity/irregularity in frequency and range. Magnitude of range of respiratory motion was not compared between stroke groups due to the small sample size. Conclusion: Many stroke patients in this study showed irregularity in frequency and range of respiratory motion, especially right hemispheric stroke. The mean respiratory rate was higher and the breathing shallower than among healthy controls, especially in deep breathing. This is the first indication of disturbed <b>respiratory</b> <b>movement</b> patterns after hemispheric stroke and a possible difference in the effects of right versus left hemispheric stroke on those patterns.
