25|$|<b>I</b> <b>trust</b> {{that there}} will never again be such an unseemly and {{unnecessary}} intrusion of armed soldiers in the halls and about the entrances of American Courts of Justice. They are intrusions that can only tend to bring this court into contempt, and make doubtful the boasts of that liberty that is the keynote of American Government.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} Democratic Party still described itself as, “the White Man’s Party”, {{and still}} promoted thinking that could criticize African American voting rights, as an “insane policy of investing an ignorant and inferior race with the sacred {{rights of the}} ballot.” Nevertheless, now twenty years after the Civil War, the first stirrings of tolerance were heard. Stockley, on his retirement, noted that “Our colored citizens are improving their advantages by laudable efforts to acquire homes for themselves and education for their children. The prejudice against their enfranchisement is fast disappearing, and <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> will soon pass away forever.|$|E
25|$|I {{thank you}} heartily for the pamphlet, {{and for the}} {{authorities}} you give me for the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since: I know not how long, they have been my creed: I believe, before even my happiness in your acquaintance and friendship, tho' they have certainly been strengthen'd and confirm'd by your conversation and instruction—in support of these principles <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> I shall ever act, and I shall continue to attempt their general propagation;—whether by the best means, is matter of speculation: but by the best, according to my judgement—nothing can make me a disciple of Paine or Priestley, nor any thing induce me to proclaim, that I am not so, but in the mode I myself think the best to resist their mischief—private conversation and private insinuation may best suit the extent of my abilities, the turn of my temper, {{and the nature of}} my character...|$|E

500|$|Hard as the Americans {{worked to}} {{incorporate}} {{themselves into the}} Grand Fleet, they had yet to shake a belief among the veteran British that they were amateurs merely playing at war. In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while we were out, and did well, and will do better next time.

500|$|Because McClellan {{failed to}} pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered {{that he be}} removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ...

500|$|In 1873, the {{cornerstone}} of Sage Hall was laid. This new hall was to house the Sage College for Women and thus to concretely establish Cornell University's coeducational status. Ezra Cornell wrote a letter for posterity—dated May 15, 1873—and sealed it into {{the cornerstone}}. No copies of the letter were made, and Cornell kept its contents a secret. However, he hinted at {{the theme of the}} letter during his speech at the dedication of Sage Hall, stating that [...] "the letter deposited in the cornerstone addressed to the future man and woman, of which I have kept no copy, will relate to future generations the cause of the failure of this experiment, if it ever does fail, as <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> in God it never will." ...|$|E
500|$|If Bell Nicholls {{was a poor}} unknown curate in England – in Banagher he was {{a member}} of a respectable family. In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Charlotte wrote: [...] "My dear husband, too, appears in a new light in his own country. More than once I have had deep {{pleasure}} in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; for that I have got one of the best gentlemen in the country .... <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; and I pray to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by popular reality television shows, most notably Survivor. The [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> Jim..." [...] line was a direct reference to the show and was a [...] "last-second addition" [...] according to Daniels. In addition, Randall Einhorn, the camera man for the episode, was a camera man for Survivor. When the episode was being written, many of {{the cast and crew}} feared that it would bear too many stylistic resemblances to Curb Your Enthusiasm. Daniels later defended the show, saying that the show was different because of [...] "the fact that they are on TV and they know they are being filmed. [...] on camera." [...] During the writing of the episode, Daniels made the writers spend actual time on the set, most notably in Michael's office. Mindy Kaling later noted that she [...] "hated it." ...|$|E

500|$|Mars {{says that}} the trust that he, Levine and Lawrence have built in seven years of working {{together}} is essential. He added [...] "I may say, 'Yo, I like this song,' but if Ari or Phil say it's the corniest shit they've ever heard, <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> them. And the other way around. We all know when we're onto something...We also know when something's not jelling. And that's the thing you pray you will always have. You can't believe that everything you do is hot." [...] Nevertheless, Levine points to the musical influences {{the three of them}} share completing his idea [...] "It's about finding ways to mix the classic we all love with modern songs. That's why people connect to the music on multiple levels: It's familiar-sounding but new-classic songwriting and instrumentation with a little twist".|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} Leveson Gower withdrew his {{invitation}} for Crawford {{to appear at}} the Scarborough Festival; Leveson Gower also prevented Crawford's selection for the MCC winter tour of South Africa. Crawford's father wrote to the Surrey committee {{in support of his}} son. By the beginning of August 1909, two weeks after the match against the Australians, the Surrey committee severed their connection with Crawford; Leveson Gower felt that he had shown the [...] "deepest ingratitude". Wisden reported: [...] "The committee were much incensed and passed a resolution that Crawford be not again asked to play for the county." [...] Informed of his expulsion by letter, Crawford replied to the committee a final time: [...] "I fail to see why I should practically be branded as a criminal because, as acting captain, I declined the responsibility of skippering a team which did not include three essential players, an independence which <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> will remain in spite of the awful example made of me to every amateur in the United Kingdom." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Road to Rhode Island" [...] was {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire and was written by Gary Janetti. It featured guest appearances from Victoria Principal as Dr. Amanda Rebecca, Danny Smith and Wally Wingert as various characters. This was the first episode directed by Povenmire. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom for directing episodes. Povenmire said that MacFarlane would tell him, [...] "We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. <b>I</b> <b>trust</b> you." [...] Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him have fun. Several years after the episode was written, in DVD commentary for the eighth and ninth season of the show, Gary Janetti, the writer of the episode, recalled that the original title of the episode {{was intended to be}} simply [...] "Brian & Stewie", but was changed by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who wanted there to be a [...] "Road to" [...] episode each season. The name of the episode was then changed to [...] "Road to Rhode Island", with the original name later being used for the landmark 150th episode of the show, also entitled [...] "Brian & Stewie", and written by Janetti.|$|E
