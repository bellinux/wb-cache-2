40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} of {{integrate}} simulation for the kinematics and dynamics analysis of complex mechanical system {{is presented in}} this paper. This platform of the method is based on Visual Studio 2005, MD ADAMS (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical System) R 3 and Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4. 0. The experimental model is built with Pro/E, and then some functions of Pro/Toolkit are used to <b>export</b> <b>file</b> of parasolid format and coordinates of some specified Datum Points. Finally, the coordinates of these Datum Points are written into a CMD file (Commands file of ADAMS). A slider-crank mechanism {{is used as a}} numerical example to demonstrate the application of the method. It is shown that this approach is a much easier, faster than usual manual method especially for complex mechanical system which has a lot of Marker Points and constraints...|$|E
40|$|PurposeC++ written module for dose {{distribution}} (DD) optimization {{based on}} data exchange with Theraplan Plus (TPP) is presented. MethodAn CT based radiotherapy treatment plan is prepared using the TPP system. Patient data (contours, densities) and beams geometry are exported to the TPP <b>Export</b> <b>File.</b> The compensators for each beam are designed using TPP <b>Export</b> <b>File.</b> The dose Dn at n–th point is given by total primary dose: Dn=∑J Wj•Ijn •isqjn• exp(-μ(dr,jn-dr,max)), where J is {{the total number of}} beams, Wj is the weight of the j-th beam, Ijn is the relative energy fluence (REF) of jn-th pencil beam, isq is the inverse square factor, dr,jn, dr,max are radiological depths of n-th point and max dose respectively. The Probability of Uncomplicated Control (Pun) function is used as an objective function: Pun=TCP•IIL (1 vI•NCTPI) where L is the number of critical organs in question, VI is the relative gravity of the injury. In the course of iteration the changes of REF values are performed sequentially for all beams. For one beam the value of Pun function for each ray is calculated separately and compared to the previous one. The new REF gives the max value of Pun. After the calculations for one beam are completed, the dose distribution for this beam is calculated with the new values of REF and process is continued for next beam until the objective function reaches its minimum. ResultsThe program was tested for a number of real H&N cases with a U-shaped target, the spinal cord being the critical organ. It has been assumed that for an ideal DD the Pun values is 0. 5. After optimization, the Pun values was never less than 0. 46. Obtaining the optimal DD required usually 15 to 30 iterations and took about 5 minutes. ConclusionsTheraplan Plus is an ideal tool for the user who wishes to designe his own algorithms of the DD optimization. A rapid raytracing approach developed and implemented by the authors allows for an effective optimization of the DD...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Today’s {{scientific}} applications demand computational {{resources that}} can be provided only by parallel clusters of computers. Storage subsystems {{have responded to the}} increased demand for high-throughput disk access by moving to network attached storage. Emerging Cyberinfrastructure strategies are leading to geographically distributed computing resources such as the National Science Foundation’s TeraGrid. One feature of the TeraGrid is a dedicated national network with WAN bandwidth on the same scale as machine room bandwidth. A natural next step for storage is to <b>export</b> <b>file</b> systems across wide area networks to be available on diverse resources. In this paper we detail our testing with the Lustre file system across the TeraGrid network. On a single 10 Gbps WAN link we achieved single host performance approaching 700 MB/s for single file writes and 1 GB/s for two simultaneous file writes with minimal tuning.

RTPrimerDB includes records with user submitted assays that {{are linked to}} genome information from reference databases and quality controlled using an in silico assay evaluation system. The primer evaluation tools intended to assess the specificity and to detect features that could negatively affect the amplification efficiency are combined into a pipeline to test custom-designed primer and probe sequences. An improved user feedback system guides users and submitters to enter practical remarks and details about experimental evaluation analyses. The database is linked with reference databases to allow the submission of assays for all genes and organisms officially registered in Entrez Gene and RefSeq. Records in RTPrimerDB are assigned unique and stable identifiers. The content is provided via an interactive web-based search system and is available for download in the recently developed RDML format and as bulk <b>export</b> <b>file.</b> RTPrimerDB is a one-stop portal for high-quality and highly annotated real-time PCR assays...|$|E
