5|$|Many of the cottages {{were now}} burning, {{obscuring}} the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and driving the defenders {{out of their}} positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard {{sent a message to}} Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{typically}} had {{a tripod}} foremast with a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they {{were similar to}} the larger s that immediately preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} methods {{had been}} {{tested by the}} Australians in a local counter-attack at the Battle of Hamel on 4 July. The German defenders of Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a very wide <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the Battle of the Somme. The Australians had used surprise rather than weight at Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only {{at the moment the}} infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis came to power, {{the design}} was given priority. Despite initial {{competition}} from the Henschel Hs 123, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, the German aviation ministry) turned to the designs of Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, the double vertical stabilizers were introduced to give the rear gunner a better <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> The main, and {{what was to be}} the most distinctive, feature of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.|$|E
5|$|Re-rated as a 42-gun frigate in February 1817, Aigle {{underwent}} {{repairs and}} alterations at Woolwich from March 1817. In accordance with Surveyor of the Navy, Robert Seppings' designs, in January 1820, Aigle had her square transom removed and a circular stern fitted. This gave her improved {{protection in the}} rear and allowed a better <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> She was subsequently laid up then repaired and cut down to a 24-gun corvette between March and July 1831. Recommissioned in August 1841 under Lord Clarence Paget, she {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{position}} at Borodino {{consisted of a}} series of disconnected earthworks running in an arc from the Moskva River on the right, along its tributary, the Kolocha (whose steep banks added to the defense), and towards the village of Utitsa on the left. Thick woods interspersed along the Russian left and center (on the French side of the Kolocha) made the deployment and control of French forces difficult, aiding the defenders. The Russian center was defended by the Raevsky Redoubt, a massive open-backed earthwork mounting nineteen 12-pounder cannons which had a clear <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> {{all the way to the}} banks of the Kolocha stream.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
5|$|The first dreadnoughts {{tended to}} have a very light {{secondary}} armament intended to protect them from torpedo boats. Dreadnought carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack. The South Carolinas and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped. At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, {{there was no need to}} armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} had outrun {{the supporting}} artillery {{and the initial}} force of more than 500 tanks that played {{a large role in}} the Allied success was reduced to six tanks fit for battle within four days. The Germans on Chipilly Spur commanded a wide <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> to the south of the Somme, and their flanking fire held up the left units of the Australian Corps until late on 9 August, when a small Australian party slipped across the river and captured the village of Chipilly itself, together with a renewed attack by III Corps. On the Canadian front, congested roads and communication problems prevented the British 32nd Division being pushed forward rapidly enough to maintain the momentum of the advance.|$|E
5|$|Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, the {{commander}} of the Kriegsmarine, proposed on 13 November that Tirpitz be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a fleet in being to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of Bismarck, agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5cm guns on the superstructure next to the catapult were moved outboard to increase their <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> The two quadruple 53.3cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit. The ship's commander, Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Karl Topp, pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942. The following day, Tirpitz left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.|$|E
5|$|In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) {{was formed}} to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a {{proposal}} was made to the War Office {{for the formation of}} a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigade—a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions. Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries. In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry. They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads and from the flanks of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.|$|E

5|$|On 25 March, the Belgo-Congolese {{battalion}} and the {{two companies}} of the 2/6 KAR occupied Gambela. Exhausted by their journey from the Congo and suffering from dysentery {{and a lack of}} artillery, the 1,000 Belgians and Congolese could undertake no further offensive action. Instead they made moves to contain the Italian forces around Saïo from the west, while British troops under General Alan Cunningham conducted operations in Somalia and eastern Ethiopia. The Arbegnoch also threatened the Italian positions. In April, Italian forces burned the elephant grass along the Saïo Plateau to ensure an unobstructed <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> That same month the troops of the 2/6th KAR were withdrawn to the Dabus River to link up with the rest of their unit to contain the Italian garrison in Mendi.|$|E
5|$|On the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish {{forces were}} desperately {{fighting}} the numerically superior {{forces of the}} Elector and Marsin. The Prince of Anhalt-Dessau led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned {{on the edge of}} the village enjoyed a good <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in enfilade on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.|$|E
5|$|The Bismarcks' use of four twin turrets (the 4 × 2 configuration) was {{a design}} {{practice}} that hearkened {{back to the}} First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while {{reducing the number of}} turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the Bismarcks, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and a more effective sequence of salvoes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on {{the fire}} {{development}} model for the whole process <b>of</b> localized <b>fires</b> in large-space buildings and assisted by the technology of FDS large eddy simulation, the temperature <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> smoke <b>of</b> localized <b>fires</b> in large spaces were investigated with different building heights, building areas and fire powers. It {{has been found that}} for large-space buildings with a height greater than 6 m and a building area more than 1500 m 2, factors like building height and building area can slightly affect the curve trend <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> smoke, while such factor like fire power has more significant influence on the curve trend <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> smoke. Through the analysis of temperature rise curves <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> smoke in various fire scenarios, the paper proposed a whole-process prediction model for the temperature <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> smoke <b>of</b> localized <b>fires</b> in large-space buildings. As long as the model uses the appropriate shape coefficient, the prediction model can accurately predict the temperature <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> smoke <b>of</b> localized <b>fires</b> in large-space buildings...|$|R
5|$|The {{secondary}} armament of dreadnoughts was, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A {{hit from}} a light gun {{could not be}} relied on to stop a destroyer. Heavier guns could not be relied on to hit a destroyer, as experience at the Battle of Jutland showed. The casemate mountings of heavier guns proved problematic; being low in the hull, they proved liable to flooding, and on several classes, some were removed and plated over. The only sure way to protect a dreadnought from destroyer or torpedo boat attack {{was to provide a}} destroyer squadron as an escort. After World War I the secondary armament tended to be mounted in turrets on the upper deck and around the superstructure. This allowed a wide <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and good protection without the negative points of casemates. Increasingly through the 1920s and 1930s, the secondary guns were seen as {{a major part of the}} anti-aircraft battery, with high-angle, dual-purpose guns increasingly adopted.|$|E
5|$|Canopus and Glasgow {{returned}} to Stanley, arriving there on 8 November 1914; they immediately proceeded {{to join the}} British warships concentrating off the River Plate. Canopus was ordered {{to return to the}} Falklands and place herself in Stanley to guard the port on 9 November. She arrived three days later, and began to make preparations for the defence of the harbour. At Stanley, Canopuss crew set up defences against an attack by Graf Spee. Canopus herself was beached in the mudflats in a position that allowed her to cover the entrance to the harbour and have a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> landward to the southeast; to reduce her visibility, her topmasts were struck and she was camouflaged. An observation post was established ashore on high ground and connected to the ship by telephone, allowing Canopus to use indirect fire against approaching ships. Some of her 12-pounder guns and a detachment of seventy Royal Marines were put ashore to defend Stanley and its environs. On 25 November, Canopus intercepted a radio message that indicated that Spee's squadron had rounded Cape Horn, though the message was erroneous; Spee actually made the passage on the night of 1–2 December. By 4 December, Canopuss crew had completed their preparations.|$|E
5|$|The 52nd (Lowland) Division {{was to make}} a preparatory attack {{near the}} coast to open the way for the attack on Junction Station the next day. They were to attack north of the Nahr Sukhereir between the villages of Burqa and Yazur with the Yeomanry Mounted Division acting as flank guard. Their {{objective}} was an important Ottoman rearguard position which ran from the village of Burqa to Brown Hill. While the village was easily taken it was necessary to make an extremely difficult attack on the steep sided Brown Hill. The hill was topped by a large cairn and commanded a long <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> over the plain southwards across the Nahr Sukhereir. By the time a battalion of the 156th Brigade, covered by two batteries of the 264th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and the South African Field Artillery Brigade of 75th Division, captured the crest it had been reduced to a handful of men. But just 20minutes after taking Brown Hill the remnants of the Scots battalion (now down to just one officer and about 100 men) was unable to withstand an Ottoman counterattack and was driven off after a fierce struggle at close quarters.|$|E
