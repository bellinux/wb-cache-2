5|$|The AWS has {{a mind of}} its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
25|$|In his works, Hamilton {{frequently}} {{incorporated the}} materials of consumer society. <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing? (1956) used American magazines, {{brought back from}} the United States by John McHale and Magda Cordell.|$|E

25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> it {{that makes}} today's homes so different, so appealing? {{was created in}} 1956 for the {{catalogue}} of the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, England {{in which it was}} reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} courts {{from the}} provinces and territories are courts of inherent jurisdiction, {{which means that}} the jurisdiction of the superior courts is more than <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> conferred by statute. Following the principles of English common law, because the superior courts derive their authority from the Constitution, they can hear any matter unless there is a federal or provincial statute that says otherwise or that gives exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The doctrine of inherent jurisdiction gives superior courts greater freedom than statutory courts to be flexible and creative in the delivering of legal remedies and relief.|$|E
500|$|The God of War comic series {{received}} mixed reviews. Mike Murphy of Platform Nation {{stated that}} although the comic series serves as a good prequel to the video game series, [...] "the story is bogged down by horrible art... muddy, confusing, and consistently pulls {{you out of the}} story as you try to figure out <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on from panel to panel." [...] Rating it 5 out of 10, Murphy said that he [...] "can’t give this one a pass, even to the hardcore God of War fans" [...] who should [...] "skip it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, Richard Hamilton was {{commissioned}} by the BBC to recreate his famous art piece, <b>Just</b> <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> It That Makes Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing? but only this time, as to what he felt the average household would be like during the 1990s. [...] Instead of the male body builder, he used an accountant working at a desk. [...] Instead of the female icon, he used a world class female body builder.|$|E
2500|$|Richard [...] William Hamilton CH (24 February 1922 [...] 13 September 2011) was an English {{painter and}} collage artist. His 1955 {{exhibition}} Man, Machine and Motion (Hatton Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne) and his 1956 collage <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?, produced for the This Is Tomorrow {{exhibition of the}} Independent Group in London, are considered by critics and historians {{to be among the}} earliest works of pop art. A major retrospective of his work was at Tate Modern until May 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Claims that BSL is unconstitutionally vague {{have brought}} dog owners mixed success. Procedural due process {{requires}} that laws provide {{the public with}} sufficient notice of the activity or conduct being regulated or banned. Here owners of pit bulls or other banned breeds argue that the breed ban laws do not adequately define <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "pit bull" [...] (or other banned breed) for purposes of the ban. Another argument is that the laws are too vague to help the dog-owning public or the BSL enforcement agency—such as animal control or police—to {{be able to identify}} whether a dog falls under the BSL if the dog was adopted with an unknown origin or is a mixed breed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{post at the}} ICA also afforded Hamilton {{the time}} to further his {{research}} on Duchamp, {{which resulted in the}} 1960 publication of a typographic version of Duchamp's Green Box, which comprised Duchamp's original notes for the design and construction of his famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Hamilton's 1955 exhibition of paintings at the Hanover Gallery were all in some form a homage to Duchamp. In the same year Hamilton organized the exhibition Man Machine Motion at the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle. Designed to look more like an advertising display than a conventional art exhibition the show prefigured Hamilton's contribution to the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, at the Whitechapel Gallery the following year. <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of This Is Tomorrow, where it was reproduced in black and white and also used in posters for the exhibit. The collage depicts a muscle-man provocatively holding a Tootsie Pop and a woman with large, bare breasts wearing a lampshade hat, surrounded by emblems of 1950s affluence from a vacuum cleaner to a large canned ham. <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? is widely acknowledged {{as one of the first}} pieces of Pop Art. Hamilton's written definition of what [...] "pop" [...] is laid the ground for the whole international movement. Hamilton's definition of Pop Art from a letter to Alison and Peter Smithson dated 16 January 1957 was: [...] "Pop Art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business", stressing its everyday, commonplace values. He thus created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.|$|E
2500|$|Gillian Brock asks [...] "Do {{we have an}} {{obligation}} to ensure people have their basic needs met and can otherwise lead “decent” lives, or should we be more concerned with global socio-economic equality?". [...] 1.1 billion people [...] 18% of humanity [...] live below the World Bank's $2/day. Is this distribution of wealth and other goods <b>just?</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> the root cause of poverty, and are there systemic injustices in the world economy? John Rawls has said that [...] international obligations are between states as long as [...] "states meet a minimal condition of decency" [...] where as Thomas Nagel argues that obligations to the others are on an individual level and that moral reasons for restraint do not need to be satisfied for an individual to deserve equal treatment internationally. [...] Peter Singer argues in Famine, Affluence, and Morality that the rich have a moral obligation to give their money away to those who need it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Jonathan Romney {{discussed}} Kubrick's {{perfectionism and}} dispelled others' initial arguments {{that the film}} lacked complexity: [...] "The final scene alone demonstrates what {{a rich source of}} perplexity The Shining offers [...] look beyond the simplicity and the Overlook reveals itself as a palace of paradox". Romney further explains:The dominating presence of the Overlook Hotel – designed by Roy Walker as a composite of American hotels visited in the course of research – is an extraordinary vindication of the value of mise en scène. It's a real, complex space that we don't just see but come to virtually inhabit. The confinement is palpable: horror cinema is an art of claustrophobia, making us loath to stay in the cinema but unable to leave. Yet it's combined with a sort of agoraphobia – we are as frightened of the hotel's cavernous vastness as of its corridors' enclosure. ... The film sets up a complex dynamic between simple domesticity and magnificent grandeur, between the supernatural and the mundane in which the viewer is disoriented by the combination of spaciousness and confinement, and an uncertainty as to <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> real or not.|$|E
