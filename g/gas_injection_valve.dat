40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The HIT-SI {{device is}} a unique {{experiment}} which uses inductive helicity injectors to form and sustain a spheromak plasma. The n = 1 symmetry of the injectors enables stable spheromak sustainment by imposed-dynamo current drive (IDCD). The experiment is diagnosed with spectroscopy, interferometry, imaging, and internal and surface magnetic probes. Two methods of density reduction and control are presented. A helicon preionization source enables plasma breakdown and operations at densities {{an order of magnitude}} lower than previously possible. The system is critical for all operations at injector frequencies greater than 14. 5 kHz and single-injector operations. Additionally, a high-speed piezoelectric <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> <b>valve</b> was developed to enable dynamic injector fueling adjustable on a timescale of ~ 0. 5 ms. The focus of this work is on results from an ion Doppler spectrometer (IDS) which was upgraded to multi-chord capability. Two coherent, linear fiber optic cables with small, wide-angle lenses simultaneously collect light from 30 - 40 chords. Additionally, biorthogonal decomposition is used as a novel filtering method for raw data. Impurity radiation measurements of high power plasmas show no toroidal flow associated with toroidal current and temperature evolution which rises during toroidal current ramp-up and falls during current sustainment. Coherent velocity fluctuations show rigid, oscillatory motion of the spheromak plasma driven by the helicity injectors. The coherent motion combined with a lack of magnetic instabilities indicates that the spheromak is stable. Comparisons with NIMROD and PSI-TET simulations show similar chord-averaged velocity oscillations but fail to show the observed coherent, rigid motion of the spheromak. Additionally, strong flows and reconnection events in simulations which are not observed in the experiment indicate that agreement may improve with higher viscosity. The measured C III temperatures lie between the two codes' estimates. Line-radiation from high-frequency operations (53. 5 and 68. 5 kHz) was too weak for the camera so an image intensifier had to be used, yielding a sparse data set. Composite measurements from multiple discharges show higher ion temperatures and lower intensity fluctuations than at 14. 5 kHz. Negligible toroidal flow is measured at 68. 5 kHz, supporting the conclusion that an outward Shafranov shift is due to pressure confinement rather than rotation. Measured beta values assuming T_i = T_e and n_i = n_e are in agreement with Grad-Shafranov fitting to magnetic equilibria supporting the claim that high-beta pressure confinement was achieved in high frequency operations...|$|E

The boundary conditions of large gravitational bodies, namely accretion disks, are replicated and allowed to influence a plasma over short timescales. Observation of the plasma is enabled through use of a variety of fast diagnostics, including an unequal path length, heterodyne, quadrature phase differential interferometer, {{the development and implementation of}} which is described in detail. The LabJet gun, a triple-electrode planar plasma gun featuring azimuthally symmetric <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> achieves a new, long-duration, highly-stabilized, jet plasma formation. The line-integrated density in this new LabJet formation is found to be (nL) = (6 +/- 3) x 10 ^ 2 [m^- 2]. By observing the axial expansion rate of the jet over multiple chord locations (all perpendicular to the propagation axis), the interferometer provides an Alfvén velocity measurement of v_A = 41. 3 +/- 5. 4 [km/s], which at the jet density observed indicates an axial magnetic field strength of B_z = 0. 15 +/- 0. 04 [T].

40|$|Abstract: Three aspects, {{such as the}} {{optimization}} of {{calculation model}} for the minimum <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> rate, the effect of elevation on the minimum <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> rate, the effect of air humidity on the minimum <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> rate, have been reviewed in this paper. Considering the influence of altitude and air humidity, correction factor for <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> rate is calculated. The value of <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> for altitude correction factor generally increases {{with the increase in}} altitude, especially when conducting air drilling in high altitude areas of western China the correction factor of Qinghai oilfield can be calculated as high as 1. 5. When the air humidity increases, the <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> humidity correction factor also increases; especially before raining in summer, the air humidity correction factor can be close to 1. 1, under the condition of relatively high air humidity and temperature. In the light of the calculation result and example analysis, it can be found that combining with this article’s altitude and air humidity correction, the result of the amended minimum kinetic energy standard using Boyun Guo’s correlation is the closest to the actual one, which can be used for the calculation of the minimum <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> rate in industry practice while other methods have relatively larger errors...|$|R

Consequences of {{disruptions}} are (i) {{high heat}} loads on plasma-facing components, (ii) large forces on the vacuum vessel, and (iii) the generation of runaway electron beams.

Massive <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> using fast <b>valves</b> is a concept for disruption mitigation which is presently being explored in many tokamaks. Fast disruption mitigation valves based on an electromagnetic eddy current drive have been developed in Jülich since the 1990 s and models of various sizes have been built and are in operation in the TEXTOR, MAST, and JET tokamaks.

40|$|Nowadays, the non-hydrocarbon gases are {{the main}} sources for <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> {{projects}} in different countries. The main advantages of the flue <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> are low cost, readily available sources (which consists mainly of N 2 and CO 2) and low compressibility in comparison with other gases like CO 2 or CH 4 (for a given volume at the same conditions). In addition, it occupies more space in the reservoir {{and it is an}} appropriate way for CO 2 sequestering and consequently reducing greenhouse gases. In the aforementioned method, N 2 and/or CO 2 is injected into the oil reservoir for miscible and/or immiscible displacement of remaining oil.

The conventional two-phaseflow (visco-capillary flow) theory, which regards the capillary pressure as the only controlling factor in gasmigration processes, is commonly adopted to describe the gas flow in geo-materials. However, formaterialswith lowpermeability, the conventional two-phase flow theory cannot properly describe the gasmigration. In this work, hydro-mechanical coupled <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> tests were conducted. The volumetric variation of theliquid for applying the confining pressure in the specimen cell and the gas flow rate were monitored. Testresults indicate that gas migration {{is influenced by the}} capillary pressure and the mechanical stress simultaneously. The two key parameters of the gas entry pressure Pentry and the gas induced-dilatancy pressurePdilatancy are introduced for description of gas migration with respect to the capillary pressure and the mechanicalstress effects, respectively. When the <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> pressure is smaller than the Pentry and thePdilatancy, the balance between the <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> pressure and the confining pressure will lead to an intermittentgas flow. Sudden increase of gas flow rate could be observed once the <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> pressure approachesthe Pentry or the Pdilatancy. For higher <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> pressures, the mechanical stress effects on gas migrationcould not be neglected. The sudden increase of gas flux under high <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> pressures could be causedby the mechanical induced-dilatancy of channels, capillary pressure induced-continuous flow pathways, aswell as the failure of sealing-efficiency. The failure of sealing-efficiency is closely related to the differencebetween the <b>gas</b> <b>injection</b> pressure and the confining pressure rather than the properties of the materialtested. Monitoring the volume of liquid for applying confining pressure is helpful for detecting the failureof sealing efficiency and the mechanism of gas breakthrough...|$|R
