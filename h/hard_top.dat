50|$|There are novelty billiard tables, {{often for}} pool, {{that come in}} various shapes {{including}} zig-zag, circular, and hexagonal. For the home market, many manufacturers have produced billiard tables (in the broad sense) that double as dining tables or as table tennis or other gaming tables, with removable <b>hard</b> <b>tops.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} versions, the 997 Targa {{was only}} available as 4 wheel drive. Targa 4 models are slightly {{slower than the}} <b>hard</b> <b>top</b> Carrera models because of the heavier roof and all-wheel-drive transmission.|$|E
25|$|The Düsseldorf plant {{produced}} 171,008 Auto Union 1000s {{during the}} six year model run. The pretty 1000 Sp sports version continued in production {{for another two}} years, until 1965, notching up sales of approximately 5,000 for the <b>hard</b> <b>top</b> version and 1,640 for the cabriolet.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally {{over the}} past 250 years the use of {{crosscut}} saws in the many forests of the United States lacked the use of safety clothing and equipment. However, safety training in contemporary usage in the United States dictates the mandatory use of gloves, eye protectors, chainsaw boots with <b>hard</b> <b>tops</b> and high-top ankle protectors, Kevlar chaps, and long sleeved shirts.|$|R
25|$|A {{bit less}} well known were the Classic series of 1:25 scale {{vehicles}} offered by Jo-Han. These were cars of the 1930s like the 1931 Cadillac in Town Brougham, Phaeton or Cabriolet, the 1934 Mercedes-Benz 540K in cabriolet or <b>hard</b> <b>top</b> limousine. Though as detailed as any classic model line from any manufacturer, the Classic line did not endure long and was limited to only a few offerings.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{model year}} {{marked the first}} time the S2000 was offered in more than one trim level in the United States. In {{addition}} to the base model, Honda offered a more track-oriented version of the S2000, distinguished by reduced weight, fewer amenities, and an increase in performance. The S2000 Club Racer made its world debut at the New York International Auto Show on 4 April 2007. Changes for the CR included a lower ratio steering rack, revised exhaust system, black lug nuts, darker colored wheels, clear side markers, stiffer suspension and new Bridgestone Potenza RE070 tires that were wider at the rear; 245/40R-17 to 255/40R-17. A revised body kit, composed of a redesigned front lip, and a large spoiler, were wind-tunnel tested and claimed to reduce the overall coefficient of lift by 70–80%. The power folding soft top was removed and replaced with additional chassis bracing topped off with a tonneau cover, while the <b>hard</b> <b>top,</b> optional on other models, became a standard feature on the CR. Honda also revised the shift knob over the base with an exclusive spherical aluminum shift knob that rests 12.6mm lower for a 6 percent reduction in shift stroke compared to the conventional S2000 cylindrical shift knob (aluminum/leather wrapped). Conversely, the shift load effort increased by 10 percent with the new design.|$|E
500|$|Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{appears on}} Larry King Live. During his {{appearance}} on the program, a breaking story interrupts his interview with show host Larry King—it is being reported that the Asian stocks are falling. Larry King asks Tracy's opinion on this story, which results in Tracy giving chaos-inducting views, including, [...] "New York {{as we know it}} will no longer exist tomorrow" [...] and he calls for panic, sending the people of New York into madness. At the NBC studios, the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), try looking for money that Tracy has hidden in the building after revealing this on Larry King Live. Pete calls the program asking Tracy where he stores the money. Tracy reveals that the safest place he has it hidden has [...] "a <b>hard</b> <b>top</b> and soft bottom, no matter where it moves, the cash stays in the same place." [...] This clue is of no help to Pete, Frank, Toofer, and Lutz.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982 {{the last}} Kitten {{rolled off the}} {{production}} line as the new reliant four-wheeler replacement, [...] "The all new Reliant Fox" [...] was now in production.

5000|$|The Opel Tigra {{name has}} been applied to two {{different}} cars engineered and produced by the German automaker Opel, both based on different iterations of the Corsa supermini, the first built in Spain, the second in France. The first Tigra was a small 2+2 coupé, produced from 1994 to 2001. The later compact <b>hard</b> <b>topped</b> convertible roadster model was introduced in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|The CCV was {{initially}} {{developed in the}} mid-1990s, and earmarked for production, beginning with a joint venture operation in China. However, logistical problems with the injection molding process combined with the rationalization that occurred following Chrysler's 1998 takeover by Daimler-Benz to effectively kill the project. Techniques developed to manufacture CCV bodyshells were ultimately utilized {{in the production of}} plastic <b>hard</b> <b>tops</b> for the Jeep Wrangler.|$|R
2500|$|According to Car and Driver, Lexus {{is working}} on a [...] "clean sheet" [...] {{replacement}} for the SC and the convertible theme will be retained, with a soft top instead of the <b>hard</b> <b>top</b> setup currently being used.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the events}} of the 1955 ‘24 Heures du Mans’ , the French {{government}} moved to prohibit sports car rallying in that country, rallies then little more than long distance road races. In response, Triumph competition manager Ken Richardson had steel <b>hard</b> <b>tops</b> bolted to 100 TR3’s, homologating the new sports car as a [...] "grand touring" [...] coupe, the GT class still permitted to race on French public roadways. A ‘grand touring kit’ was made available to customers as an optional extra (part No. 554313).|$|R
2500|$|... 1974 saw the {{introduction}} of the rare, factory request, Spider-Targa.

2500|$|Detail {{improvements}} {{continued to}} be made throughout {{the life of the}} Mark IV, and included reclining seats with [...] "chequered brushed nylon centre panels" [...] and head restraints, introduced for domestic market cars early in 1977 along with a new set of column stalk operated minor controls (as fitted already in the TR7) replacing the old dashboard mounted knobs and switches. [...] Also added for the model's final years were a wood dash, hazard flashers and an electric screen washer, in place of the previous manual pump operated ones. Options such as the <b>hard</b> <b>top,</b> tonneau cover, map light and overdrive {{continued to be}} popular, but wire wheels ceased to be available.|$|E

In this paper, indium tin oxide coating on PET film is discussed. The coating was deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering in a roll-to-roll vacuum coater.

The influence of coating thickness to delamination process (important factor for adhesion) and load/penetration depth curves is established and different phenomenon are discovered...|$|R
5000|$|All of the 1940 designs had {{commercial}} type closed cabs {{with minor}} modifications. Variants had an open passenger roof so a ring for a [...]50 caliber machine gun could be mounted, during World War II approximately {{one in four}} trucks had a ring. In 1942, to simplify production and reduce shipping height, all manufacturers began to use military style open cabs. Studebaker returned to closed cabs. The post-war M35 and M135 were designed with open cabs and half-doors. All military cabs could mount a machine gun ring. The M35 and M135 had removable <b>hard</b> <b>tops</b> available.|$|R
2500|$|In 1994 Land Rover {{created the}} Defender XD (XD= extra duty) to replace and {{complement}} these vehicles. Powered by 300Tdi engines, the XD {{has a much}} stronger chassis, with fibre webbing around the welded joints in the chassis and around stress points to massively increase load capacity. The XD was available both in Defender 90 and 110 forms and is known to the British Army as the Land Rover Wolf. Usually [...] soft or hard tops, they are used for patrol, communications and supply duties. 90XDs are less common, but are generally ordered as soft top or <b>hard</b> <b>top</b> vehicles for light liaison and communications. Short-wheelbase vehicles lack the load capacity needed by modern armies, and the increased power of heavy-lift helicopters has made the larger 110s easily air-transportable- a historic advantage of the smaller, lighter 90.|$|E
2500|$|The various grade {{configurations}} {{included the}} traditional [...] "SSS" [...] (SSS / twincam SSS / twincam SSS-X).

The Mark III was the fastest Spitfire yet, achieving [...] in 13.4 seconds, and reaching a top speed of [...] Average fuel consumption was improved slightly at 33mpg.
