40|$|Abstract Background We {{describe}} {{a method for}} 3 -/ 4 D reconstruction of tissue Doppler data from three standard apical planes, post processing to derived data of strain rate / strain and parametric colour imaging of the data. The data can be displayed as M-mode arrays from all six walls, Bull's eye projection and a 3 D surface figure that can be scrolled and rotated. Numerical data and waveforms can be re-extracted. Methods Feasibility was tested by Strain Rate Imaging in 6 normal subjects and 6 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Reverberation artefacts and dyssynergy was identified by colour images. End systolic strain, peak systolic and mid systolic strain rate were measured. Results Infarcts were visualised in all patients by colour imaging of mid systolic strain rate, end systolic strain and post systolic shortening by strain rate. Reverberation artefacts were visible in 3 of 6 normals, and 2 of 6 patients, and were identified both on bull's eye and M-mode display, but influenced quantitative measurement. Peak systolic strain rate was in controls minimum - 1. 11, maximum - 0. 89 and in patients minimum - 1. 66, maximum 0. 02 (p = 0. 04). Mid systolic strain rate and end systolic strain did not separate the groups significantly. Conclusion 3 -/ 4 D reconstruction and colour display is feasible, allowing quick visual identification of infarcts and artefacts, as well as <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> area <b>of</b> <b>post</b> systolic shortening.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel independent component analysis (ICA) {{approach to the}} separation of nonlinear convolutive mixtures. The proposed model is an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the well-known <b>post</b> nonlinear (PNL) mixing model and consists of the convolutive mixing of PNL mixtures. Theoretical proof of existence and uniqueness of the solution under proper assumptions is provided. Feedforward and recurrent demixing architectures based on spline neurons are introduced and compared. Source separation is performed by minimizing the mutual information of the output signals {{with respect to the}} network parameters. More specifically, the proposed architectures perform on-line nonlinear compensation and score function estimation by proper use of flexible spline nonlinearities, yielding a significant performance improvement in terms of source pdf matching and algorithm speed of convergence. Experimental tests on different signals are described to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of marginal cost based spot pricing techniques to the short run coordination of decentralised, and potentially competitive, electricity markets. A Dispatch Based Pricing philosophy is proposed which requires that the dispatcher of a power system determine spot prices which are consistent with both the observed power system dispatch and the offers and bids issued by market participants. Whereas previous research has involved determining prices corresponding to an optimised power system dispatch, Dispatch Based Pricing is more flexible, requiring no such optimality assumption while generating incentives which encourage efficient dispatch. Pricing relationships are formed, and the resulting incentives analysed, by applying duality theory to mathematical programming formulations of the dispatch problem. A detailed theoretical description of a dispatch based pricing model, based on an Optimal Power Flow formulation, is presented. This model is an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the ex <b>post</b> pricing model <b>of</b> Hogan (1991). As well as presenting a more general representation of dispatch variable relationships, we demonstrate the underlying mathematical relationships which drive the economic interpretation of this model. In addition, we explore the behaviour of transmission flow constraints in cyclic networks, and describe the modifications needed to price for security requirements consistent with current operational practices in New Zealand. We explore the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> Dispatch Based Pricing to situations {{beyond the scope of}} the Optimal Power Flow problem, and even to situations which are strictly incompatible with a pure marginal cost based analysis. We develop a "best compromise" pricing approach which, for (seemingly) economically inconsistent dispatches, minimises the side payments required to account for the difference between the market clearing spot prices and the offers and bids of the market participants. We develop and discuss methods for determining dispatch based prices which are consistent with primal inter-temporal constraints, uncertainty, and integer variables...|$|R
