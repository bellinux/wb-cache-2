25|$|Ethel {{has been}} storing her {{morphine}} tablets for many weeks {{and it is}} her plan to take an overdose before the pain becomes too unbearable. However, before being able to execute her plan, she becomes too weak and is unable to administer the drugs without Dot's assistance. Dot is devastated and initially refuses to help Ethel, as to help another take their own life goes completely against her strict Christian principles. Dot spends many agonising weeks wrestling with her conscience, but she eventually agrees to grant her old friend's final wish. On the night of her 85th birthday (it was actually her 86th, but she'd always lied about her age), after a celebratory party at The Vic, Ethel decides that {{this was to be}} <b>her</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> After blowing out the candles of her birthday cake and bidding Dot an emotional farewell, Ethel takes the pills, aided by Dot, and dies peacefully in her sleep.|$|E
25|$|Frank, {{furious at}} Luke, demands he marry Frank's daughter, Jennifer, (then Lisa Marie). To {{get out of}} this marriage, Luke orders Laura to tell Scotty he raped her. She refuses and gets jealous when she observes Luke flirting with Jennifer. Scotty tells Laura she has to quit her job at the disco. On <b>her</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> she shares a romantic kiss with Luke. Horrified, she slaps him. Later she accidentally gets locked in his office, overhearing Luke and Frank {{discussing}} mob business. When Frank discovers her, he forces her to continue to work at the disco. She tells Luke not to marry Jennifer. He traps Laura on a sailboat and forces her to admit she loves him. Again he orders her to turn him in for raping her. She refuses. He realizes he is in too deep with the mob to ever be with Laura. She writes him a letter expressing her feelings, which Scotty finds on the day of Luke and Jennifer's wedding. Scotty interrupts the ceremony on Frank's yacht and knocks Luke overboard, leading everyone to believe he was dead.|$|E
25|$|As a result, all Brenda's friends {{apologized for}} their {{behavior}} towards her. During the fourth season, Brenda {{is interested in}} the drama department but it also led to problems: she spoiled her first audition and then went to the director of the play to try again and convince him. She then got the role, but a student made a rumor saying that she had slept to have the role. Unfortunately, this student was the girlfriend of Steve Sanders and the latter believed the rumors, others refusing more or less to believe the denials of Brenda. Steve understood his mistake when the student asked him to attack Brenda to make her miss rehearsals. A little later, Steve's friend tried to commit suicide, but Brenda and Steve joined forces to save her and Steve was finally compensated by following Brenda's debut on stage. The director's praise led her to accept the latter at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in London for a year. After Kelly and Dylan last broke up, Brenda finally learned that a relationship was possible between Kelly and Brandon and expressed her blessing. She later spent <b>her</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> with Dylan, telling her she would not be gone forever. The couple will reconcile briefly in the final scene of the fourth season, though (because of Shannen Doherty's departure) Brenda's character was removed from the script and she never returned to Beverly Hills.|$|E

500|$|Peter is a {{contestant}} on Wheel of Fortune, {{advances to}} the bonus round, and wins, despite choosing Z, 4, three Qs, and the Batman symbol for his consonants and vowel, {{and taking a}} self-described [...] "shot in the dark" [...] with his answer, [...] "Alex Karras in Webster", managing to get the correct answer on his first try, to Pat's absolute shock. He chooses, among several other prizes, one week of free maid service. When his maid Joan arrives, Peter has her pull items out of his belly button (including, among other things, a ColecoVision set and a carton of Parliament Cigarettes to the shock of Peter, who says he hasn't smoked in ten years), and rides on her back, like a horse, to the store. Peter decides to over-work Joan on <b>her</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> by giving Meg a watermelon filled with chocolate pudding and firecrackers, which explodes in her face. After being introduced to her by Peter, Quagmire {{falls in love with}} her. After dating Joan, Quagmire proposes marriage to her, which she accepts and the couple prepare their marriage ceremony. Lois, Peter and their neighbors visit Quagmire's house, finding that he has changed his personality significantly. Peter still believes this to be a prank and shows Quagmire porn magazines in an attempt to change him back to his former ways. Meanwhile, Lois begins to question whether she should keep breastfeeding Stewie, as he's hurting her when feeding.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Crimsworth's {{entrance}} diverted {{my thoughts}} for a moment. She looked well, dressed in white, {{her face and}} her attire shining in morning and bridal freshness. I addressed her with the degree of ease <b>her</b> <b>last</b> <b>night's</b> careless gaiety seemed to warrant, but she replied with coolness and restraint: her husband had tutored her; she {{was not to be}} too familiar with his clerk.|$|R
