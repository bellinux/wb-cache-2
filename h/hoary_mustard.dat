50|$|At least 80 {{different}} kinds of greens are used, depending on the area and season, including black mustard, dandelion, wild sorrel, chicory, fennel, chard, kale, mallow, black nightshade, lambâ€™s quarters, wild leeks, <b>hoary</b> <b>mustard,</b> charlock, smooth sow thistle and even the fresh leaves of the caper plant.|$|E
50|$|Hirschfeldia incana (formerly Brassica geniculata) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mustard family known by many common names, including shortpod mustard, buchanweed, <b>hoary</b> <b>mustard</b> and Mediterranean mustard. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Hirschfeldia, which {{is closely related to}} Brassica. The species is native to the Mediterranean Basin but it can be found {{in many parts of the}} world as an introduced species and often a very abundant noxious weed. This mustard is very similar in appearance to black mustard, but is generally shorter. It forms a wide basal rosette of lobed leaves which lie flat on the ground, and it keeps its leaves while flowering. Its stem and foliage have soft white hairs. Unlike black mustard, H. incana is a perennial plant.|$|E
40|$|Increased selfing and {{inbreeding}} and, consequently, depauperate genetic diversities {{are commonly}} expected for alien colonies. We compared RAPDs data for native (southern Europe) and alien (British Isles) populations of <b>hoary</b> <b>mustard</b> (Hirschfeldia incana). This species is normally out-breeding, {{but it is}} capable of self- fertilization. Contrary to the common expectations, genetic diversities in native and alien populations were similar, without any strong evidence of decreased levels of genetic diversities in alien populations. A variety of factors may have contributed to this observation, including high variation in founding groups, founders originating from multiple H. incana source populations, and high rates of past and/or current gene flow. A review of other studies showed that this pattern of similar genetic diversities in native and alien populations was not unusual but has been regularly observed in other invasive plant species...|$|E
