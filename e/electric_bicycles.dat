This thesis {{is focused on}} the type of motor that used on the <b>electric</b> <b>bicycle,</b> the type of motor that were used on the <b>electric</b> <b>bicycle</b> is Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.

By the way, the characteristic of BLDC motor make it majorly being used around the world, this is because it has high efficiency, long life duration and more durable compared to other motor. The BLDC motor were widely been used on most type of the <b>electric</b> <b>bicycle</b> which is most compatible with it. The used of BLDC motor on the bicycle give the bicycle maximum performances and can travel longer with certain level. Analysis that was done to this type of motor is to determine either this motor suitable for the <b>electric</b> <b>bicycle</b> or vice versa.

25|$|Bicycles can be {{categorized}} in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain bicycles, racing bicycles, touring bicycles, hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes. Less common are tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes, recumbents and <b>electric</b> <b>bicycles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} effects of motorized bicycles varies according to the power source. Most <b>electric</b> <b>bicycles</b> are considered {{by some to be}} zero-emissions vehicles, as they emit no combustion byproducts. However, the {{environmental effects}} of electricity generation and power distribution from plants generating power from fossil fuels, as well as manufacturing and disposing of (limited life) high storage density batteries containing toxic materials must also be taken into account. Older two stroke engines, commonly use in motorized bicycles powered by internal combustion engines often emitted more pollution than automobiles due to partial combustion of oil included in the fuel, {{but this is not the}} case with four-stroke or newer 2 stroke motor designs.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{federal law}} exempts {{low-speed}} <b>electric</b> <b>bicycles</b> from Dept. of Transportation and NHTSA motor vehicle regulations, {{and they are}} regulated under federal law {{in the same manner}} as ordinary bicycles. The Consumer Product Safety Act defines the term low speed electric bicycle as a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (1 horsepower), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20mph (15 U.S.C. 2085(b)). At the present time, neither the DOT nor the NHTSA restrict the assembly of e-bikes for use on public roads, although commercially manufactured e-bikes capable of speeds greater than 20mph are considered motor vehicles and thus subject to DOT and NHTSA safety requirements. Consequently, the laws of the individual state and/or local jurisdiction govern the type, motor wattage, and speed capability of e-bikes used on public roadways (see Electric bicycle laws). As long as the bicycle is capable of pedal propulsion, most U.S. states currently do not distinguish between designs that may be self-propelled by the electric motor versus pedal assist designs in which the electric motor assists pedal propulsion by the rider.|$|E

This had a number of significant advantages from Sinclair's point of view. Such a vehicle would be exempt from insurance and vehicle tax, and the user would not need a driving licence or a helmet, all of which were required for mopeds. The legislation, which was passed in August 1983, was prompted by a lobbying campaign by manufacturers such as Raleigh who wanted to sell <b>electric</b> <b>bicycles.</b>|$|E

A few true solar bicycles were built, either with a large solar roof, a small rear panel, or a trailer with a solar panel. Later more practical solar bicycles were built with foldable panels {{to be set up}} only during parking.

2500|$|Beijing {{has long}} been well known {{for the number of}} {{bicycles}} on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Large numbers of cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of <b>electric</b> <b>bicycles</b> and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, {{but it is not clear}} whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale. Recently, cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo.|$|E

Considered the sector of the transport as the air pollution contributor and the impact of air pollution towards the health and the global warming and climate exchange, then pollution of air was one of the problems of the environment at this time. In the marketing field, the problem of the environment not only became the marketer's responsibility, but also all the consumer. Rumours of the environment could become the competitive superiority criterion that influenced the behaviour of the purchase of the consumer. The increase in the quality of the environment could be controlled by the consumer's individual by carrying out the change chose and consumed the certain thing that was friendly to the environment. The consumer who had the high awareness towards the environment will choose environment-friendly products although his price was relative more expensive. The <b>electric</b> <b>bicycle</b> became transport means that were environment-friendly because of not dismissing gas emissions discarded so as to be classed as the vehicle without emissions.
