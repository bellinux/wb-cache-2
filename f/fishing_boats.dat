5|$|June 27, 1933 - A minimal {{hurricane}} {{moves through}} northeastern Venezuela. The hurricane destroys several houses, businesses, and <b>fishing</b> <b>boats.</b> Powerful winds cut telephonic and telegraphic communications for several days. The hurricane killed several people, and caused over $200,000 in damage (1933USD, $3.3million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|At least 116 {{people were}} killed, most being {{children}} sleeping in their beds, {{with more than}} 68 missing and over 13,500 left homeless in Nicaragua. At least 1,300 houses and 185 <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> were destroyed along {{the west coast of}} Nicaragua. Total damage in Nicaragua was estimated at between 20 and 30 million U.S. dollars.|$|E
5|$|Attractions in Nouakchott {{include the}} National Museum of Mauritania, the National Library and the National Archives. The city hosts several markets {{including}} the Nouakchott Silver Market, and the beaches. One beach {{is devoted to}} <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> where fish can be bought fresh.

50|$|Norfolkline's vessel for {{the route}} was the MV Scottish Viking (which, despite the name, is {{registered}} in Italy.) On 5 August 2010 the vessel {{collided with a}} small <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> {{off the coast of}} Scotland, resulting in the loss of the <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> and the death of one of the two men aboard the <b>fishing</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2005, small <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> “Shinsei-maru No. 3 ” was {{discovered}} at the off Cape Nosappu under the capsized condition, without being rescued until that time. From this accident, seven crew were lost. According {{to the official}} report of the Marine Accident Inquiry Agency, the <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> was returning to her home port Hanasaki, and met the container ship that was cruising from North America to Pusan and Hong-Kong. The collision was caused as the followings. The <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> was under crossing condition {{in front of the}} container ship from {{the left side of the}} container ship, but did not alter the course. Meanwhile, the container ship did not sound the warning signal to the <b>fishing</b> <b>boat.</b> Then, the <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> collided at the port-side bow of the container ship, and then capsized. In this paper, the physical mechanism that caused the capsizing of the <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> is investigated based upon the experimental model tests and manoeuvring simulations. Also, the investigation about the ship handling of the container ship is done for the prevention of such capsizing...|$|R

5|$|Significant {{agricultural}} {{damage was}} reported, especially in Quảng Bình Province. More than 3,000square kilometres (1,200sq mi) of crops, mostly rice, were damaged or washed {{away by the}} floodwaters. There were also reports of heavy losses of poultry and livestock, and nearly 13km² (5sq mi) of aquaculture and 786 <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> were lost.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong Observatory {{issued a}} warning signal #3 {{due to the}} storm's threat to the {{territory}} on October24. Beaches closed during the storms, and <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> were forced to remain at port. Several airports in Taiwan were closed. Two Russian ships were forced to ride out the storm in Xiamen.|$|E
5|$|The Sa'iqa company {{achieved}} the only discernible {{success of the}} attack. It managed to land four kilometers east of the fort without facing any aerial resistance (as the company was sailing in civilian <b>fishing</b> <b>boats).</b> The company managed to prevent Israeli reinforcements from reaching the fort, destroying a number of tanks and vehicles. It also captured six Israeli soldiers.|$|E
25|$|During the feudal period, it {{was only}} the big farmers who had a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat.</b> The first person in the Faroes, who did not own any land, and got his own <b>fishing</b> <b>boat,</b> came from Sørvág. His name was Gamli Dávur.|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel is a renewable, clean, {{alternative}} energy source with advantages such as excellent lubricity, superior biodegradability and high combustion efficiency. Biodiesel is considered for mixing with <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> fuels to adjust their fuel characteristics so that toxic pollutants and greenhouse-effect gas emissions from such shipping might be reduced. The effects of blending <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> fuels A and B with various weight proportions of biodiesel are experimentally investigated in this study. The results show that biodiesel blending can significantly improve the inferior fuel properties of both <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> fuels and particularly fuel B. The flash points of both of these fuels increases significantly {{with the addition of}} biodiesel and thus enhances the safety of transporting and storing these blended fuels. The flash point of <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> fuel B even increases by 16 % with 25 wt% biodiesel blending. The blending of biodiesel with no sulfur content is found {{to be one of the}} most effective ways to reduce the high sulfur content of <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> fuel, resulting in a reduction in the emission of sulfur oxides. The addition of only 25 wt% biodiesel decreased the sulfur content of the <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> fuel by 37 %. The high kinematic viscosity of <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> fuel B was also observed to be reduced by 63 % with the blending of just 25 wt% biodiesel. However, biodiesel blending caused a slight decrease in heating value around 1 % to 4. 5 %...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} grew {{slowly in the}} 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675. The {{population grew}} in the summers {{with the arrival of}} migratory fishermen. In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore <b>fishing</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is {{a yearly}} 45-day ban on fishery with motorboats in the region. The fishing ban {{for the year}} 2012 was {{effective}} during the months of April–May. The jetty at Rameswaram is the largest landing centre for <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> {{in the region and}} it usually comes alive after the ban, with the arrival of fishermen, boat captains, shore workers and others from their native places.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 38houses in Japan were destroyed, 110were damaged, {{and more than}} 2,000were flooded. Landslides were {{observed}} at 56 locations. Power was lost to 160,000families. A total of 165flights were cancelled, delaying 15,000 passengers. A total of 160 trains were cancelled. Two bullet train lines experienced delays in Kyushu; ferry and air service were also delayed there. Offshore, ten <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> sunk, including one Japanese cargo ship. An additional 12ships were rendered as missing. Ninety-five other boats took refuge in North Korea, though 59left on September2 to return to Japan.|$|E
5000|$|Advocate Steve Myers (Billy Connolly) is a disillusioned {{lawyer who}} becomes fed-up with the {{perceived}} corruption within the judicial system. He quits the law business and buys a small <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> and takes up fishing for a living. His <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> {{is struck by}} lightning and explodes into pieces, burns and sinks. He informs his insurance company, which reviews and then subsequently declines his claim {{on the grounds that}} it is not liable as his <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> was destroyed due to an [...] "Act of God".|$|R

5|$|Before Zeb {{brushed the}} east coast of Taiwan, a typhoon warning was issued, causing schools, {{government}} buildings, and financial markets to close. Airports and ferry travel were also disrupted. 183residents evacuated to storm shelters, including 50 from a nursing home. Hundreds of Chinese <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> rode out the storm in Taiwan harbors. Similarly to Taiwan, Zeb delayed ferry service in Japan, and caused 271domestic flights to be canceled. Train service was canceled on Kyushu during the storm.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Étretat, Monet {{completed}} three paintings of <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> one of a rural road, and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133). Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The Magpie is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes, the largest in its class. The exact location of the snow scene depicted in The Magpie is unknown. Ralph T. Coe proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in Honfleur.|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} {{remained}} new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism. During the summer season in the 1860s and 1870s five thousand inhabitants of Lewis {{could be found in}} Wick on the mainland of Scotland, employed on the <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> and at the quaysides. Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. By 2001 the population of North Uist was only 1,271.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, {{the crews}} of two Cuban <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> were kidnapped by Florida-based {{dissident}} group Alpha 66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes. In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering {{the arrest of}} dissident poet Heberto Padilla; Padilla was freed, but the government established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.|$|E
5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an infrequent bycatch of longlines {{and bottom}} trawls. It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used {{to seal the}} hulls of wooden <b>fishing</b> <b>boats.</b> Like other deepwater sharks, this species {{is thought to be}} highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no information available on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|E
