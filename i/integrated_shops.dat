Moreover, the optimal transfer payment has a strong positive relativity with the complementary of the online-offline shopping and VMI scale economic effect, whereas negative relativity with the substitutability of the online-offline shopping and VMI holding cost.

30|$|The {{concept of}} co-creating value stands for {{assisting}} consumers in co-constructing {{and engaging in}} superior experiences (Karpen et al., 2012). The managerial and theoretical concept of value co-creation is oriented to a service–dominant (hereafter S-D) logic (Vargo and Lusch, 2004, 2006, 2008) where the superior value co-creation and the focus on intangible resources and relationships are {{at the core of}} competitive advantage in a business. When consumers are viewed {{as an integral part of}} value creation, the role of business becomes that of a facilitator, supporter, and co-constructor of value rather than a supplier of value (Firat and Dholakia, 2006; Vargo and Lusch, 2008). The flexibility and fluidity inherent in the SoLoMo environment enables smart consumers to transfer resources from one channel to another. Facebook fans often transfer the trust established through their social relationships with the brand and other fans, and formulate a positive attitude toward the brand’s online website, where the actual transactions occur. In retailing, these social channel conversions and resource transfers develop a complex multi-channel platform. Recent reports of consumers’ increased multi-channel shopping suggest a new paradigm of integrated retailing has emerged. For example in a survey of consumer expectations regarding <b>integrated</b> <b>shopping,</b> 82 percent of respondents would shop again at a retailer who accepted in-store returns for online purchase, 73 percent were more likely to become a repeat customer if a store offered in-store pickup of online orders, and 59 percent indicated ease of website navigation was the most important factor for following through with an online purchase ([URL] In fact, consumers are changing their purchasing behaviors by <b>integrating</b> online <b>shopping</b> activities with visits to a retailer’s physical, brick and mortar storefront. This <b>integrated</b> <b>shopping</b> experience is referred to as omni-channel retailing (Lewis, 2014).|$|R

The way Esprit Project 5478 SHOP-CONTROL, which received considerable attention from end-users in the automotive supplier industry, has addressed these requirements is then presented, as well as some results from its pilot installation...|$|R
40|$|The current wave of {{digitalization}} {{has important}} implications for manufacturing companies. In this article, we suggest applying the theoretical lens of value co-creation as a comprehensive approach to explore the potential of digitalization trends. We use it to identify the potential of better <b>integrating</b> <b>shop</b> floor workers in the shaping of digital solutions and managerial actions. Insights from two case examples show how improved consideration of cognitive needs and the provision of opportunities for social connection to a community of workers makes them feel more valued, confident, empowered and integrated. This can balance other forms of frustrations and negative emotions, leading to a better perception of the overall relationship experience at the shop floor...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integer programming formulation for the manufacturing shop design problem, which integrates decisions concerning {{the layout of}} the resource groups on the shop floor with the design of the material handling system. The model reflects critical practical design concerns including the capacity of the flow network and of the transporters, and the tradeoff between fixed (construction and acquisition) and variable (operational) costs. For realistic industrial cases, the size of the problem prevents the solution through explicit or implicit enumeration schemes. The paper addresses this limitation by decomposing the global model into its natural components. The resulting submodels are shown to be standard problems of operations research. The decomposition approach provides ways to solve the <b>integrated</b> <b>shop</b> design problem in an effective manner...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the design of material handling flow paths in a discrete parts manufacturing facility. A fixed-charge capacitated network design model is presented and two efficient heuristics are proposed to determine near-optimal solutions to the resulting NP- hard problem. The heuristics are tested against an implicit enumeration scheme used to obtain optimal solutions for small examples. For more realistic cases, the solutions of the heuristics are compared to lower bounds obtained by either the linear programming relaxation of the mixed integer program, or an iterative dual ascent algorithm. The results obtained indicate that the heuristics provide good solutions in reasonable time on the average. The proposed methodology is applied to design the flow paths of an existing manufacturing facility. The role of the flow path network problem in the <b>integrated</b> <b>shop</b> design is also discussed...|$|R

There are estimated to be over 2, 000 retail warehouses in the UK. The number of retail parks, planned clusterings of stores, increased from one in 1982 to 90 six years later.
