500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, Plunkett {{struggled}} with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. In October 2012, Plunkett signed {{to play for}} Yorkshire. He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, I believe that a fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me reach my goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (born Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, who {{was already}} a Muslim convert, heavily {{influenced}} his spirituality. [...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. This is the house where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I could feel {{it was going to happen}} sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.|$|E
2500|$|A year later, when I {{began to}} worry about a thesis topic, Neyman <b>just</b> shrugged and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to wrap the two ...|$|R
60|$|EILEEN. I did <b>just</b> what you'd <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you did--stuffed {{the pillows}} under the clothes so the {{watchman}} would think I was there.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I fear {{you need}} have no hopes of Miss Worsley. I know her views on life. She has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> them to <b>me.</b> [A pause.] ...|$|R

60|$|MISS GILPIN (hurriedly). How do you do, Mr. Murray. Doctor Stanton <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{you were}} here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to believe," [...] said Gilmore. [...] "Have you heard that the Marquis is in the town? Greenthorne <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so." ...|$|E
6000|$|Don. Clara. No, no; <b>just</b> now you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not {{to tease}} you--"Who do you want, good signor?" [...] "Not you, not you!" [...] Oh you blind wretch! but swear {{never to be}} jealous again, and I'll forgive you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never saw it afore to-day," [...] {{said the}} Tinker, with another yawn, [...] "and don't care if I {{never see it}} again. There was a man here <b>just</b> now, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what it was called. If {{you want to see}} Tom himself, you must go in at that gate." [...] He faintly {{indicated}} with his chin a little mean ruin of a wooden gate {{at the side of the}} house.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{believes}} you," [...] she continued, [...] "to be harmless {{enough at}} a wholesome period of our country's history. <b>Just</b> now, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yesterday, {{that he considered}} it was within your power to bring something very much like ruin upon the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Cis, Cis, Cis, how delightful! How glad I am {{that you}} have come! They only <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me!</b> And how do you do, Mr. Morton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were quite}} right, Mr. Cuthbert," [...] she answered. [...] "I suppose {{this is the}} reason why Mr. Davenant has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the whole miserable story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mullins has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Captain Tremayne {{has been}} ordered under arrest for--for killing Count Samoval. Is it true? Is it true?" [...] she demanded wildly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Monsieur Philip, {{you must}} {{tell me all}} about it. I am tired of hearing {{consultations}} about roads and Catholic forces. I want to hear a full account of your adventures, <b>just</b> as you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the tale of your journey to Nerac." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{checked her}} too briefly, {{and there was}} indeed {{something}} of my own it brought straight back. [...] "I thought that <b>just</b> what you <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> this morning or yesterday, was that you had never known {{a case of the}} conversion of an idiot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About Jane Fairfax. Did {{you ever}} hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> himself. I met him <b>just</b> now. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{it was to be}} a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of {{mentioning}} it to any body but you, but he said you knew it." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. My dear Arthur, what a {{piece of}} good luck meeting you on the doorstep! Your servant had <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you were not at home. How extraordinary! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes, m'm. Mr. Tipman has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so in his letter. He {{is going}} to be married to Mrs. Petherwin. It is to be quite a private wedding.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't laugh, sir! There's {{nothing to}} be amused at in what you have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> You didn't go into his room last night? Oh, what made you do that!" ...|$|E
60|$|Eliz. How? Oh, my fortune {{rises to}} full flood: I met a friend <b>just</b> now, who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> truths Wholesome and stern, of my {{deceitful}} heart-- Would God I had known them earlier!--and enforced Her lesson so, as I shall ne'er forget it In body or in mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know <b>just</b> {{what you}} <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> That letter there {{is from the}} lady with the Italian name. She has more {{mischief}} even than you have, I believe." [...] At hearing this Sir Francis only laughed. [...] "If you don't take care she'll make you marry her, and then where will you be?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} {{when a young}} man, wishful {{to conform to the}} rules of good society, I bought a book of etiquette for gentlemen. Its fault was <b>just</b> this. It <b>told</b> <b>me</b> through many pages what not to do. Beyond that it seemed to have no idea. I made a list of things it said a gentleman should never do: it was a lengthy list.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then go, my son, {{and tell}} the king what you have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and he will cut your head off," [...] replied the dame {{in a tone of}} sarcasm.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's like this, Ruthven," [...] he said. [...] "I'm awfully sorry, but the Old Man's <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{to search}} the studies in case any of the fellows have got baccy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind the step, {{we shall}} have more light on deck. There is a friend there who has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he met you on the Cocos-Keeling Island, Nigel Roy;--you start, Winnie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Meantime Wilmet and Alda found {{themselves}} before a large, florid, much-dressed lady, with a most good-natured face, who greeted them with 'Good morning, my dears! <b>Just</b> as Marilda <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> so much alike {{as to be}} quite romantic. Well, no doubt it is a pity to separate between you, but my Marilda will be a true sister. She has spoken of nothing else. Are you willing, either of you, my dears?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} up yonder," [...] he said, [...] "following your spoor backwards. I have seen the snow-bridge and the stones, and the nicks which the dwarf cut in the ice. All is <b>just</b> as you <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and it only remains for me to congratulate you upon having escaped from the strangest series of dangers that ever I heard of"; and {{he held out his}} hand, which both Leonard and Juanna shook warmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that is one}} of {{the matters}} in which old bachelors are wiser than married men, because they have time for more general contemplation. Your fine critic of woman must never shackle his {{judgment}} by calling one woman his own. But, as an example of what I was saying, that pretty Methodist preacher I mentioned <b>just</b> now <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that she had preached to the roughest miners and had never been treated with anything but the utmost respect and kindness by them. The reason is--though she doesn't know it--that there's so much tenderness, refinement, and purity about her. Such a woman as that brings with her 'airs from heaven' that the coarsest fellow is not insensible to." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{can only}} say [...] What's not the news. The courier has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> [...] He'd nothing from the Empress at Vienna [...] To bring his Majesty. She writes no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{and nobody}} around there has {{seen him since}} he went off with you. I thought he was with you, until Dora <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he started to return about midnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear Lady Windermere,' {{cried the}} Marchioness of Jedburgh, 'do let Mr. Podgers stay {{here a little}} longer. He has <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I should go on the stage, and I am so interested.' ...|$|E
6000|$|ABSOLUTE 'Tis <b>just</b> as Fag <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> indeed. Whimsical enough, faith! My father {{wants to}} {{force me to}} marry the very girl I am {{plotting}} to run away with! He must not know of my connection with her yet awhile. He has too summary a method of proceeding in these matters. However, I'll read my recantation instantly. My conversion is something sudden, indeed--but I can assure him it is very sincere. So, so--here he comes. He looks plaguy gruff. [Steps aside.] ...|$|R
6000|$|Then he stopped, and chuckled in {{his usual}} dry manner. [...] "I {{was going to make}} Jordan the proposition--only I got to {{thinking}} and my nerve failed me. Guess I made my money hard in the free sealing days when we had trouble with everybody all the time, but I felt I'd sooner not offend Mrs. Jordan, and I might do it if I didn't fix things <b>just</b> as she <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> She's a clever woman--but I don't want to have her on my trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|We are {{now running}} down to Penang with the {{thermometer}} 87° in the cabins, and anything you please on deck. We have exhausted all our literature, drunk two hundred lemon squashes; played forty different games of cards (Patience mostly), organised a lottery {{on the run}} (had it been a thousand rupees instead of ten I should not have won it), and slept seventeen hours out of the twenty-four. It is perfectly impossible to write, but you may be morally the better for {{the story of the}} Bad People of Iquique which, [...] "as you have not before heard, I will now proceed to relate." [...] It has <b>just</b> been <b>told</b> <b>me</b> by a German orchid-hunter, fresh from nearly losing his head in the Lushai hills, who has been over most of the world.|$|R
