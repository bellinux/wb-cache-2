30|$|According to the {{theoretical}} calculations, as the working <b>face</b> <b>advances,</b> {{the scope of}} the WSZ experiences a successive process from a sharp increase, a slow increase, and a slow decline to a sharp decline during the periodic weighting stage. Due to the controlling influences on the TCOED during the whole process, {{the scope of the}} SPZ experiences a successive process from a sharp increase to a slow decline to a sharp decline. As the working <b>face</b> <b>advances,</b> the ratio of the scope of the WSZ to the SPZ stabilizes at 2. During the periodic weighting stage, the scope of the SPZ in front of the working face has remained smaller than the scope of the WSZ.|$|R
30|$|In the {{non-periodical}} {{ground pressure}} period, {{the depth of}} coal wall spalling increased with the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed at {{the upper part of}} the face, and eventually maintained at a certain depth range. When the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed reached 3.05  m/d, the coal wall spalling length and depth reached their maximum values of 35  m and 0.6  m respectively, and the maximum spalling ratio was 66.67  %. The relationship between spalling length, depth, ratio and the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed displayed a significant range. But generally, the values tended to increase with the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed.|$|E
30|$|The <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed also {{significantly}} affected wall spalling. The observations at the No. 8105 coal face demonstrated {{that with the}} increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed, there was a reduction of damage area around the coal wall, and a reduction of wall horizontal displacement. In other words, the spalling of coal wall was suppressed. It is therefore suggested that the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed should be rationally increased to reduce the exposure time and spalling of coal wall. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of controlling coal wall spalling was limited through the increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed. With a large amount of observations on site, the effect of increasing <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed on coal wall spalling was found. If the advance speed is too high, the coal spalling might increase.|$|E
30|$|During the {{non-periodical}} pressure period, at {{the lower}} part of the face, the relationship between coal wall spalling and <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed showed a certain degree of randomness. When the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed reached 2.4, 3.05, 5, 5.5 and 5.75  m/d, there was no spalling occurring. In general, the depth of coal wall spalling showed less variation with <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed {{at the lower}} part of the face, the average spalling depth concentrated within 0.3 – 0.4  m. With the increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed, the spalling length and ratio showed a trend of decrease early, to increase at a later time.|$|E

30|$|The change {{pattern of}} dynamic {{subsidence}} of roof as the working <b>face</b> <b>advances</b> {{can be divided}} into three stages: the small deformation stage (0 – 35  m away from the working face), the deformation stage (30 – 75  m away from the working panel) and the stable deformation stage (75  m away from the working panel).|$|R
30|$|Longwall mining by {{speeding}} <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> rate. In some of {{the coal}} mines in the Shendong mining area, the height of water conducting fissure zones can be reduced through increasing <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> rate (Ma et al. 2008, 2014).|$|E
30|$|During {{the period}} of {{periodical}} ground pressure, the average coal wall spalling depth at {{the lower part of}} the face decreased with the increase of the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed. Before the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed reached 4.5  m/d, there was no distinct decrease of spalling depth, and the slope of the trend line was almost zero. When the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed exceeded 4.5  m/d, there was a distinct decrease of spalling depth, thus the slope of the trend line increased.|$|E
40|$|Seismic hazard was {{depicted}} {{by means of}} seismic activity. The rate of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> {{was defined as the}} output-energy ratio (J/kg) and as the distance in meters, which the face overcomes in a given time (for example six months). Seismic activity was analyzed in relation to such the rates of <b>face</b> <b>advance.</b> The analyses were performed for two mining districts (G- 7 and G- 8) of Lubin copper ore mine. The period of 2008 - 2009 years was taken into account. In both mining districts the outputenergy ratio did not show any strict connection between the rate of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> and seismic activity. Whilst seismic hazard increased with increasing rate of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> defined as the distance between two sequential positions of face in most panels of the two mining districts...|$|E

40|$|Background: Lesbian, gay, {{bisexual}} and/or trans (LGBT) {{people have}} {{higher risk of}} certain life-limiting illnesses and unmet needs in advanced illness and bereavement. ACCESSCare is the first national study to examine in depth the experiences of LGBT people <b>facing</b> <b>advanced</b> illness. Aim: To explore health-care experiences of LGBT people <b>facing</b> <b>advanced</b> illness to elicit views regarding sharing identity (sexual orientation/gender history), accessing services, discrimination/exclusion and best-practice examples. Design: Semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews analysed using thematic analysis. Setting/participants: In total, 40 LGBT people from across the United Kingdom <b>facing</b> <b>advanced</b> illness: cancer (n = 21), non-cancer (n = 16) and both a cancer and a non-cancer conditions (n = 3). Results: In total, five main themes emerged: (1) person-centred care needs that may require additional/different consideration for LGBT people (including different social support structures and additional legal concerns), (2) service level or interactional (created in the consultation) barriers/stressors (including heteronormative assumptions and homophobic/transphobic behaviours), (3) invisible barriers/stressors (including the historical context of pathology/criminalisation, fears and experiences of discrimination) and (4) service level or interactional facilitators (including acknowledging and including partners in critical discussions). These all shape (5) individuals’ preferences for disclosing identity. Prior experiences of discrimination or violence, in response to disclosure, were carried into future care interactions and heightened with the frailty of advanced illness. Conclusion: Despite recent legislative change, experiences of discrimination and exclusion in health care persist for LGBT people. Ten recommendations, for health-care professionals and services/institutions, are made from the data. These are simple, low cost and offer potential gains in access to, and outcomes of, care for LGBT people...|$|R
30|$|During the {{non-periodical}} pressure period, being {{similar to}} the coal wall spalling at {{the upper part of}} the face, the depth of coal wall spalling decreased with the increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed in the middle part of the face, the spalling ratio showed a trend of non-linear decrease with the increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed.|$|E
30|$|During {{the period}} of ground pressure, the {{spalling}} depth, spalling length and spalling ratio at {{the upper part of}} the face had a similar variation trendency with the increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed, i.e., increase early and decrease later. When the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed reached 5.50  m/d, the spalling ratio was the largest at {{the upper part of the}} face at 63.33  %.|$|E
30|$|During {{the period}} of {{periodical}} ground pressure, the spalling depth presented a trend of decrease early on, and increasing later {{with the increase of}} <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed. The spalling length and ratio presented a trend of gradual reduction with the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed. In the middle part of the face, the spalling depth was 0.6  m, maximum spalling ratio was 49.15  % and maximum spalling length was 50.75  %.|$|E
30|$|The {{internal}} stress of backfill material changes over three stages as the working <b>face</b> <b>advances.</b> They are respectively the initial stress zone (0 – 35  m {{away from the}} working panel), the stress increasing zone (30 – 75  m away from the working panel) and the stable stress zone (75  m away from the working panel). And the change pattern of the {{internal stress}} of backfill material {{is consistent with the}} roof subsidence variation.|$|R

30|$|With the {{analysis}} {{on the characteristics of}} coal wall spalling at the LLTCC face under different conditions, including mining height, <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed, distance from support tip to coal wall, ground pressure, and different positions at the coal face, the authors have developed a comprehensive spalling control technology of controlling the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed, increasing initial support power, and improving the support capacity for wall protection. The technology developed has been tested and applied at the No. 8105 coal face.|$|E
30|$|During the {{non-periodical}} {{ground pressure}} period, {{the relationship between}} the coal wall spalling ratio and <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed presented randomness. However, in general, the spalling ratio reduced with the increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed. There were some differences in the spalling ratio at different face positions. The statistical analysis of the spalling ratio showed: the spalling ratio in the middle part of the face > the spalling ratio at {{the upper part of the}} face > the spalling ratio at the lower part of the face.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{developing}} rules {{of the range of}} the WSZ, during the periodic weighting, as the mining <b>face</b> <b>advances,</b> the theoretical calculations of the range of the WSZ should undergo an increase-stable-decrease process. However, the real observation results turn out to be an increase-decrease slightly-increase-decrease towards the original point process. The main reason for this difference is the limited observatory location. Despite the slight differences between the theoretical calculations and real observation results, the overall developing trends are consistent.|$|R
60|$|Some {{time had}} passed thus, when the sound of {{approaching}} footsteps attracted my attention.
