40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new circuit to {{implement}} a Mamdani-type interval type- 2 neural <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chip</b> with on-chip incremental learning ability (IT 2 NFC-OL) for applications in changing environments. Traditional interval type- 2 fuzzy systems use an iterative procedure to find the system outputs, which is computationally expensive, especially for hardware implementation. To address this problem, the IT 2 NFC-OL uses a simplified type reduction operation to reduce the hardware implementation cost without degrading the learning performance. The software-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL is characterized by online structure learning and parameter learning using a gradient descent algorithm. The learned fuzzy model is then implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. The FPGA-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL performs not only fuzzy inference but also online consequent parameter learning for applications in changing environments. Novel circuits for the computation of system outputs and the update of interval consequent values are proposed. The learning performance of the software-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL and the on-chip learning ability are verified with applications to time-varying data sequence prediction and system control problems and by comparisons with different software-implemented type- 1 and type- 2 neural fuzzy systems and interval type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chips...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the architecture of}} two VLSI <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>chips</b> designed to run at very high speed: 50 Mega Fuzzy Inference per Second (MFIPS) at least. The two projects differ {{in the number of}} inputs; one processes 2 - 4 seven bit inputs while the other one 8 - 16 seven bit inputs. The two chips have been designed for applications in High Energy Physics Experiments (HEPE) where the apparatus, called trigger device, needs to discriminate different nuclear events in few microseconds. So far most of the fuzzy logic applica-tions do not require high speed because not required by the industrial applications, therefore they have been done by implementing the fuzzy system on microprocessors, DSPs, or on commercial <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chips</b> which do not have very high speed performances like those necessary for HEPE. In the first phase of our research 1. 0 ym VLSI <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chip</b> [11, [2] prototype with four 7 bit inputs and one output running at 50 MFIPS was designed and constructed whose processing rate depends upon the number of rules of the fuzzy system. To further increase the speed we have faced the problem of processing, when possible, only the active fuzzy rules which are a few percent of the total ones. The research carried out on this prototype allowed us to extract some general conclu-sions:- for applications with no more than 4 inputs only the active rules are processed. Our design has a processing rate of 320 ns for 4 inputs, whichever is the fuzzy system. The process-ing rate is higher if less than 4 inputs are processed and reaches 100 ns for two inputs. - for applications which need 8 - 16 inputs an Active Rule Selector (ARS) has been designed to increase the process-ing speed which is 20 ns times the number of processed rules. The ARS is able to reject most of the non active rules.

40|$|Edge {{detection}} algorithms {{have been}} developed to partition an image field into subfields representing regions with different properties. Edges are defined by rela-tively notable and distinguishable image changes. Among advanced theories, fuzzy logic (FL) is highly suited to detect such edges. High-resolution electron micrographs (HREM) of crystalline specimens reveal the nature of crystals. For studying interdiffusion phenomena in layered structures of II I-V compounds, image variations, described by the term similarity, are in-terpreted. Contrary to natural images, a periodic array of subunits (crystal cells) dominates the image patterns in HREM applications. The crystallograhic cells are represented by values of similarity, related to known templates of a III-V com-pounds by a difference measure of similarity. The idea of this fuzzy edge detection algorithm is to analyze the transition tak-ing place between the two neighboring sides of the edge.
