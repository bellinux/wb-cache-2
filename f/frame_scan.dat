40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for fully automatic and convenient extrinsic calibration of a 3 D LiDAR and a panoramic camera with a normally printed chessboard. The proposed method {{is based on}} the 3 D corner estimation of the chessboard from the sparse point cloud generated by one <b>frame</b> <b>scan</b> of the LiDAR. To estimate the corners, we formulate a full-scale model of the chessboard and fit it to the segmented 3 D points of the chessboard. The model is fitted by optimizing the cost function under constraints of correlation between the reflectance intensity of laser and the color of the chessboard's patterns. Powell's method is introduced for resolving the discontinuity problem in optimization. The corners of the fitted model are considered as the 3 D corners of the chessboard. Once the corners of the chessboard in the 3 D point cloud are estimated, the extrinsic calibration of the two sensors is converted to a 3 D- 2 D matching problem. The corresponding 3 D- 2 D points are used to calculate the absolute pose of the two sensors with Unified Perspective-n-Point (UPnP). Further, the calculated parameters are regarded as initial values and are refined using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The performance of the proposed corner detection method from the 3 D point cloud is evaluated using simulations. The results of experiments, conducted on a Velodyne HDL- 32 e LiDAR and a Ladybug 3 camera under the proposed re-projection error metric, qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the final extrinsic calibration parameters.

40|$|At {{the present}} stage of {{technological}} development {{there are more}} problems associated with micro- and nanotechnology. Among such problems occupy an important place task analysis of dynamic processes and several dynamic microobjects (MO) parameters simultaneously {{in view of the}} microscope in different fields (medicine, microbiology, ecology, microelectronics etc.). Identification number of dynamic parameters (for example, mobility) of some living cells and their components occurs mainly by using optical microscopy methods. To determine the mobility is most often used in two ways: 1) the method of fluorescence microphotographs analysis; 2) the method of quantitative fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy. Using these methods were quantitatively and qualitatively describes the process of intracellular transport, particularly cytoplasm-nuclear, kinetic accumulation in the nucleus of cells of different types of proteins, localization of drugs aimed at developing ways to intracellular delivery of anticancer drugs. To solve these and many such important tasks in the fields of medicine and microbiology can be successfully used television scanning optical microscope (TSOM) based on cathode ray tubes ultrahigh resolution, as provided in this scan resolution up to 0. 1 [...] . 0. 2 micron. This article contains analysis of the capabilities of this microscope {{in the case of the}} simultaneous study of several MO, which are move randomly - with variable speed and direction of motion. The basic principles of TSOM work in determining the dynamic parameters of separate MO and averaged parameters of several MO are submitted. Track each individual MO occurs by the use of scan mode of miniraster, the center of which the current frame is formed with coordinates that correspond to coordinates of the center of the MO in the previous <b>frame</b> <b>scan.</b> Interval of definition of coordinate position of each MO in sight of TSOM corresponds to the duration of one frame scanning at a constant speed scanning. Dimensions of the scanning raster should be reduced to the values 1 [...] . 10 % of the full-scale raster, while receiving miniraster. However, a scan should be used for MO of proportionate size with minimal scanning spot that move randomly at high speed. Among the MO for which the use of the scanning mode is not appropriate, you can select one or several MO simultaneously with large size (5 [...] . 40 % of the full-scale raster in the plane of study). For such MO should be used only scanning with a full-scale square raster. Based on these considerations, we construct a mathematical model of the scanning process and analyze the significance of dynamic parameters which can be determined by TSOM using scan mode with a full-scale raster and tracking eachMO by miniraster.

However, {{in terms of the}} characteristic of spectral data excessiveness and transience in the dynamic spectral detection system, the linear charge-coupled device (CCD) used in the system should have real-time-output and match the high-speed data storage equipment.

Through the field of programming gate array, the system provides an accurate driving clock for CCD and generates the control signals for analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, storage, and transmission.
