40|$|The {{correlations}} of {{primary and secondary}} structures were analyzed using proteins with known structure from Protein Data Bank. The correlation values of amino acid type and the eight secondary structure types at distant position were calculated for distances between - 25 and 25. Shapes of the diagrams indicate that amino acids polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distances. Clear preference {{of most of the}} amino acids towards certain secondary structure type classifies amino acids into four groups: alpha-helix admirers, strand admirers, turn and bend admirers and the others. Group four consists of His and Cis, the amino acids that do not show clear preference for any secondary structure. Amino acids from a group have similar physicochemical properties, and the same structural characteristics. The results suggest that amino acid preference for secondary structure type is based on the structural characteristics at Cb and Cg atoms of amino acid. alpha-helix admirers do not have polar heteroatoms <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> and Cg atoms, nor branching or aromatic group <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> atom. Amino acids that have aromatic groups or branching <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> atom are strand admirers.

50|$|Many freeband {{operators}} use amateur radios {{modified to}} transmit out of band, which is illegal in some countries. Older amateur radios may require component changes; for instance, the 1970s Yaesu FT-101 was modified for CB by replacing a set of crystals used to tune portions of the 10-meter band, although some variants of the FT-101 were sold with the US FCC channels standard and were capable of transmitting {{above and below the}} legal 40 channels by another 10 or more channels.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a novel and {{efficient}} method of promoting the dispersing uniformity of carbon black (CB) in epoxy polymer substrate of PCB (printed circuit board) by chemical grafting. The reported method shows the promising capability {{in the application}} of advanced printable resistor ink. By taking advantage of the functionalized CB surfaces, the grafting reaction of epoxy polymer <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> particles was investigated with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). FT-IR spectra evidenced the polymerization of epoxy resin with coupling agent and TEM investigation directly confirmed the polymerization occurred <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> surface. The polymerization occurred on the limited part of the CB surfaces to form a network-structure polymer to reside <b>on</b> the <b>CB</b> particles and hence greatly improved CB dispersion in ink as evidenced in ink-droplet spreading verification on glass and PCB resin substrates. On the other hand, the polymer grafting has limited effect on the increasing of the as-cured ink filled with the grafted CBs. Finally, the cross-section observation also confirmed the dispersion improvement and sheet resistance uniformity due to epoxy polymer grafting on PCB substrate, indicating the prospective candidate as embedded resistors for PCB.

Here, we investigate PSNCBAM- 1 actions <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor-stimulated [35 S]GTPγS binding in cerebellar membranes and <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> 1 ligand modulation of presynaptic CB 1 receptors at inhibitory interneurone-Purkinje cell (IN-PC) synapses in the cerebellum using whole-cell electrophysiology. PSNCBAM- 1 caused non-competitive antagonism in [35 S]GTPγS binding studies, with higher potency against the CB receptor agonist CP 55940 than for WIN 55, 212 - 2 (WIN 55). In electrophysiological studies, WIN 55 and CP 55940 reduced miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) frequency, but not amplitude. PSNCBAM- 1 application alone had no effect on mIPSCs; however, PSNCBAM- 1 pre-treatment revealed agonist-dependent functional antagonism, abolishing CP 55940 -induced reductions in mIPSC frequency, but having no clear effect on WIN 55 actions. The CB 1 antagonist/inverse agonist AM 251 increased mIPSC frequency beyond control, this effect was reversed by PSNCBAM- 1. PSNCBAM- 1 pre-treatment also attenuated AM 251 effects. Thus, PSNCBAM- 1 reduced CB 1 receptor ligand functional efficacy in the cerebellum. The differential effect of PSNCBAM- 1 on CP 55940 versus WIN 55 actions in [35 S]GTPγS binding and electrophysiological studies and the attenuation of AM 251 effects are consistent with the ligand-dependency associated with allosteric modulation. These data provide the first description of functional PSNCBAM- 1 allosteric antagonist effects on neuronal excitability in the mammalian CNS. PSNCBAM- 1 allosteric antagonism may provide viable therapeutic alternatives to orthosteric CB 1 antagonists/inverse agonists in the treatment of CNS disease...|$|R

Mature CB DCs expressed reduced CCR 7, but increased CXCR 4. This was associated with reduced migratory efficiency toward both CCR 7 ligand CCL 19 and CXCR 4 ligand CXCL 12. LPS induced higher extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in CB than in AB DCs.

TaOx particles <b>on</b> carbon black (<b>CB),</b> electrodeposited at a constant potential of - 0. 5 V Ag/AgCl for 10 s and then heat-treated by pure H 2 flow at 523 K for 1 h, showed excellent catalytic activity with an onset potential of 0. 93 VRHE (for 2 μA cm- 2) for the ORR. Surface characterizations of the catalysts were performed by {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

The chemical identity and modified surface structure for the deposited TaOx catalysts before and after H 2 heat treatment were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
