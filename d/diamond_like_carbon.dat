Neutral atoms entering the mass-spectrometry instrument have to be ionized to be able to guide them using electric and magnetic fields with intent to determine energy and velocity of the atoms and finally their mass. For low energy neutral atoms, the ionization process can be realized by implementing a charge state conversion surface, where-on the atoms are scattered in an angle of grazing incidence and getting ionized. The objective of this work is the characterization and analysis of two diamond-like carbon surface samples by measuring and determining ionization efficiencies and scattering properties and therefore their functionality as charge state conversion surfaces. First, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond sample is investigated. Furthermore the CVD diamond is compared to another <b>diamond</b> [...] <b>like</b> <b>carbon</b> surface manufactured by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. All measurements have been accomplished at the ILENA (Imager for Low Energy Neutral Atoms) facility at the Physics Institute, University of Bern in the Department of Space Research and Planetary Sciences. It is discovered that the CVD surface gets electrostatically charged upon scattering of atomic ions. Though this charging effects, a qualitative characterization of the surface can be made. It is shown that the ionization efficiencies of the CVD and the PLD diamond surface are of comparable quality, where on the contrary the scattering properties of the CVD diamond charge state conversion surface are much better. It still has to be investigated in future experiments, if this brilliant scattering properties are due to charging effects or can be assigned to the very smooth surface of the CVD diamond surface.

40|$|Scale {{formation}} in domestic appliances {{is a widespread}} problem in the UK. This project has focussed on calcium carbonate scale {{formation in}} electric showers. A literature survey identified that CaCO; deposition on heated surfaces could be controlled by chemical or non chemical methods, each with various degrees of effectiveness. One {{of the most effective}} control methods was the addition of chemicals, although {{this may not be the}} most suitable option for the domestic environment. So here the chemical inhibitors tested were used for a benchmark for all the other studies. Two laboratory tests were involved t allow u to study CaCO; precipitation and scale formation. The effect of chemical additives on CaCO; precipitation was investigated using a jar tester. The longest delay to precipitation was obtained by polyacrylic acid dosing, closely followed by zinc. To study CaCO; formation on a heated surface, a rapid scaling test was developed. This test was conducted at 42 °C and 70 °C to examine and compare a range of treatment options, including chemical dosing, electrolytic, magnetic and electronic water conditioning and low fouling surfaces. From the options examined, the most successful was electrolytic dosing of zinc/copper media with over 95 % reduction in scaling at both temperatures. Further, the use of low fouling surfaces, such as <b>Diamond</b> - <b>like</b> <b>carbon</b> coating could also potentially be used in electric showers. Reduction in scaling achieved on this surface was on average 68 %. Surface properties of the materials were analysed using an atomic force microscope and their relationship with the scaling behaviour of the surfaces examined. The scaling rates at both temperatures typically increased with increasing adhesion force but no clear relationship was found between the roughness of the surfaces and their scaling behaviour. The relationship between CaCO 3 precipitation and scale formation in synthetic solution and natural hard water was also explored here. The induction period in natural hard water was 55 minutes longer and the scaling rate 40 % lower than i synthetic hard solution of similar composition. In addition, two shower test rigs, one based at Cranfield University and the other in Attleborough were used in this study. These were used primarily to enable the compilation of background data on scale formation in electric showers, where it was found that the design of the unit has a significant influence on the scale formation. The test rig was also used t test the strategies identified during the laboratory phase of the work.
