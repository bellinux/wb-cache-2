DBD plasma reactors {{have been used for}} various applications due to their ease of production, process control, operation at different conditions. The applications of DBD plasma reactors include <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases.</b> Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas formed as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion. Use of DBD non-thermal plasma reactor can be a promising technology for carbon dioxide mitigation due to its operation at low temperatures, lack of need for catalysts, and flexibility in controlling the products generated. In this study, a tubular DBD non-thermal plasma reactor was modeled with different electrode materials separated by different dielectric materials. The aim was to provide guidelines for the design and material selection for optimizing DBD plasma reactors for CO 2 discharge. A parametric set of simulations was performed using a finite element solver to investigate how electrode and dielectric materials affect the <b>discharge</b> volume <b>of</b> CO 2 and power requirement of the non-thermal plasma <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> CO 2. The results showed that electrode material did not affect the discharge or the power requirement.

This enables correlation of the data and analyzing trigger mechanisms and regulating criteria <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> activity. Three periods <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> emission activity were observed: (a) short activity phases of few hours lasting several months, (b) alternating activity and inactivity of up to several day-long phases each, and (c) a period of several weeks of permanent activity.
