Urea-formaldehyde (UF) and melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) adhesives were used to produce homogeneous as well as three-layered <b>insulating</b> <b>boards</b> with three densities of 0. 3, 0. 4, and 0. 5 g/cm 3. The sound absorption coefficient of experimental was measured at five frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Results have indicated that the sound absorption coefficient increases as the frequency is increased up to 2000 Hz; further increase in the frequency resulted in decrease in the coefficient. Two type of resins UF and MUF didn't show significant difference in sound absorption.

40|$|Typically, {{shareholders}} are {{not sure}} whether boards act in their interest, or have been captured by management. They are also less well informed than boards about firm investment opportunities and operating conditions. We develop a model, consistent with these observations, in which discretionary compensation payments to managers might increase firm value or might simply enrich managers {{at the expense of}} shareholders. After observing the board’s compensation and investment policies, shareholders update the probability that the board is captured using Bayes rule. Shareholders are “outraged” if this updated probability is sufficiently large. Outrage is costly for the board. Shareholder democracy, by enabling outrage to constrain board actions, typically lowers firm value relative either to governance regimes that <b>insulate</b> <b>boards</b> from shareholder outrage, or regimes that ban discretionary compensation altogether...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the problem of attics conservation or dismantling from historic buildings. The attic, unconsciously inherited and planned with the traditional building techniques, constitutes a precious architectural heritage {{in the field of}} historic housing in the whole European patrimony. In many cases, the peculiarities of the type of techniques and the use of traditional local materials are the reasons why attics constitute an evidence of an active culture of know-how that has to be preserved. Furthermore, the attic-mediated heat transfer between indoor and outdoor environments, contributes to the saving of building heat loss. Nevertheless, the practice of eliminating attics is particularly diffused, and building owner or architects, preferring to dismantle their structure, compensate this loss by using <b>insulating</b> <b>boards</b> to constitute the final roofing section...|$|R

40|$|Many U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{facilities}} are undergoing decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) activities.

40|$|The {{precipitation}} {{of magnesium}} hydroxy-carbonate hydrates {{has been suggested}} as a route to sequester CO 2 into solids.

Precipitation conditions are adjusted to optimize the formation of nesquehonite and the crystalline solid can readily be washed free of chloride. Products can be prepared to achieve self-cementation following two routes: (i) thermal activation of the nesquehonite then rehydration of the precursor or (ii) direct curing of a slurry of nesquehonite.

40|$|International audienceFoaming {{constitutes}} one of {{the most}} important industrial activities in polymer engineering to produce efficient thermal insulating materials. In particular, rigid <b>insulating</b> <b>boards</b> are produced worldwide on a large scale using blowing agents which eventually are released in the environment where they adversely impact the natural friendly stratospheric ozone layer. Concomitantly, the chemicals used as blowing agents contribute to the creation of the unfriendly tropospheric ozone layer generating the disastrous green house effect around our planet. The traditional foaming intermediates currently named freons, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) currently used as blowing agents as well as the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) often considered as alternative blowing agents, must be banned from industrial processes and new (friendly) foaming agents have to be suggested and evaluated in terms of both easy engineering and environmental neutrality. Undoubtedly thermodynamics plays a major role in assessing the effective capability of those chemicals. Some CFC's still accepted and other possible simple gases like carbon dioxide and nitrogen have been considered. The in-depth thermodynamic investigation has been made possible thanks to new experimental developments to determine gas solubility in polymers and associated swelling as well as the thermodynamic properties of (gas + polymer) systems, including the thermophysical properties of polymers under gas sorption.

Our interest was to identify the genetic relatedness of the seized samples and to separate drug and hemp type plants. Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs) were employed for analysis based on single plant material (SET 1) and bulked samples of them (SET 2). Data was analysed via cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).

50|$|Wollastonite has {{industrial}} importance worldwide. It {{is used in}} many industries, {{mostly by}} tile factories which have incorporated it into the manufacturing of ceramic to improve many performance parameters, and {{this is due to}} its fluxing properties, freedom from volatile constituents, whiteness, and acicular particle shape. In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing, increases green and fired strength, maintains brightness during firing, permits fast firing, and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and to protect the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel. As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves its resistance to weathering, reduces gloss, reduces pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and suspending agent. In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between the wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, <b>insulating</b> <b>board</b> and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, inert, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength. In some industries, it is used in different percentages of impurities, such as its use as a fabricator of mineral wool insulation, or as an ornamental building material.|$|E
