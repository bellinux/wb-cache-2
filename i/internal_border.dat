25|$|Although {{travellers}} {{within the}} Schengen Area {{are no longer}} required to show documents at an <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> (although {{there have been some}} controversial instances when they have, and it is fairly common at major land border crossings with Switzerland), the laws of most countries still require them to carry identity documents. Thus, foreigners with a valid residence permit in a Schengen State and carrying valid documents can travel within the territory and do not need any special permission to do so. It is the obligation of everyone travelling within the area to be able to show a fully valid form of personal identification approved by other Schengen states.|$|E

25|$|On 23 November 2006, {{large numbers}} of Defense Ministry and FSB troops, without the {{participation}} of Chechen police, supported by helicopters and artillery barrages, {{were reported to have}} surrounded Umarov and his forces in a forest near the village of Yandi-Katar in the Achkhoy-Martanovsky District, on the <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> between Ingushetia and Chechnya. According to Kommersant, Umarov was wounded in the operation but managed to escape the pursuit. He spent the winter months traveling across the mountains to the nearby republic of Kabardino-Balkaria to meet with local jamaats fighting Russian authorities in the region and consolidate the Caucasian Front, the pan-Caucasian Islamic militant network set up by Sadulayev. In April 2007, a group of fighters that might have been personally led by Umarov shot down a desant helicopter with the Spetsnaz GRU troops near Shatoy, killing at least 18 Russian soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The border {{controls}} enacted beginning in September 2015 {{led to an}} estimated decline in trade volumes of €70 billion per year. Based on this figure, reinstating controls at all borders would lead to an decline of €221 billion per year, corresponding to a decrease in aggregate real GDP of 0.31%. For the period of 2016 to 2025, a calculation based on the reduced growth due to increased labor costs estimated that permanent reinstatement of <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> controls {{would lead to the}} loss of at least €470 billion, and possibly up to €1.4 trillion. Due to economic interdependence, the effects would reduce economic growth outside of Europe as well. For each 1% increase in the price of imports, the United States and China would lose €91 and €95 billion respectively for the period 2016-2025. Other countries such as Russia and Turkey would also be affected.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, West Germany did {{not accept}} the {{legitimacy}} of the East German state, and for many years regarded the East German government as an illegal organisation intent on depriving Germans of their constitutional rights. It had not been freely or fairly elected, and the creation of East Germany itself was a fait accompli by the East German Communists and their Soviet allies. This had important consequences for the inner German border. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as unitary, applying equally to East and West German citizens alike. An East German who escaped or was released to the West automatically entered into full enjoyment of those rights, including West German citizenship and social benefits. A would-be immigrant from another country who could get to East Germany could not be barred from entering West Germany across the <b>internal</b> <b>border,</b> which had great significance in later decades. West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East; violations of human rights in East Germany could be prosecuted in the West. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive to move to the West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
40|$|The {{borders of}} Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) today {{are the result}} of a complex process {{conducted}} decades after the fall of communist regimes in this part of Europe. With the opening towards the west, with the change of political and economic regimes came the implementation of democratic reforms of CEE societies and this led to the beginning of a complex integration process. The latter is undoubtedly associated with profound changes in the form and role of borders between states and the new Western partners. The old barriers open, the borders become increasingly soft. Old movement restrictions are removed. The main idea of the integration process is not to settle barriers, but to attenuate them. From this perspective, <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> become more and more inclusive and less visible. Security and border traffic control are transferred to external borders that become more and more exclusive, more restrictive if we respect the logic above. Such a theory is valid up to a point. <b>Internal</b> <b>borders</b> do not simply become more open, more inclusive; there is an integration process taking place in steps. The EU external border greatly expanded eastward, and in this context the old borders have become simple <b>internal</b> <b>borders.</b> Associated to an integration process, we find a process of dilution to the disappearance of <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> with the Schengen space integration (old borders remain expressions of sovereignty, the national limits no longer serve to separate people, goods and capital). ...|$|R
40|$|Through {{examination}} {{of the dynamics of}} the U. S. -Mexico border in the anti-immigration discourse as compared with those found in ethnographies on immigrants' experiences in the United States, the author found that an understanding of the symbol of the border and its implications is key to comprehending the conflicting relationships between the ideologies of anti-immigration movements and those of immigrants. Throughout the history of the United States, anti-immigration movements have constructed <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> which define outsiders and insiders, or those who belong and are accepted in the• country and those who are not. Nevertheless, as the composition of the immigrant population has changed throughout the years, so have the <b>internal</b> <b>borders.</b> They are constantly adjusted to include some groups and to keep out others. However, anti-immigration groups set up constructions of the border as absolute, unchanging, and fixed. This vision of the physical border as absolute contributes to the strict <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> that are constructed by the anti-immigration movement. An analysis of this movement's discourse is essential to understanding how the border is made to appear natural and fixed...|$|R

2500|$|In the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, 26 European {{countries}} (22 of the 28 European Union member states, plus four European Free Trade Association states) {{joined together}} to form an area where border checks on internal Schengen borders (i.e. between member states) are abolished, and instead checks are restricted to the external Schengen borders and countries with external borders are obligated to enforce border control regulations.

2500|$|The Schengen Agreement (...) is {{a treaty}} {{which led to}} the {{creation}} of Europe's Schengen Area, in which <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> checks have largely been abolished. It was signed on 14 June 1985, near the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, by five of the ten member states of the then European Economic Community. It proposed measures intended to gradually abolish border checks at the signatories' common borders, including reduced speed vehicle checks which allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping, allowing residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints, and the harmonisation of visa policies.|$|E
60|$|These {{results are}} all inevitable. It {{is obvious that}} the first attacks must {{necessarily}} be made upon the east and south coasts, and that the inland districts and the west must only slowly be conquered afterward. Especially was it easy to found Teutonic kingdoms in the four isolated regions of Lincolnshire, East Anglia, Kent, and Sussex, each of which was cut {{off from the rest of}} England in early times by impassable fens, marshes, forests, or rivers. It was easy here to kill off the Welsh fighting population, to drive the remnants into the Fen Country or the Weald, to enslave the captives, the women, and the children, and to secure the Teutonic colony by a mark or border of woodland, swamp, or hill. On the other hand, Wessex, Northumbria, and Mercia, with a vague and ill-defined <b>internal</b> <b>border,</b> had harder work to fight their way in against a united Welsh resistance; and it was only very slowly that they pushed across the central watershed, to dismember the unconquered remnant of the Britons at last into the three isolated bodies of Damnonia (Cornwall and Devon), Wales Proper, and Strathclyde. This is probably why the earliest settlements were made in these isolated coast regions, and why the inward progress of the other colonies was so relatively slow.|$|E

60|$|Section 16. The uro-genital {{organs of}} the frog, and {{especially}} those of the male, correspond with embryonic stages of the rabbit. In this sex the testes (T., Sheet 13) lie in the body cavity, and are white bodies usually dappled with black pigment. Vasa efferentia (v.e.) run to the <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> of the anterior part of the kidney, which answers, therefore, to the rabbit's epididymis. The hinder part of the kidney is the predominant renal organ. There is a common uro-genital duct, into which a seminal vesicle, which is especially large in early spring, opens. This is the permanent condition of the frog. In the rabbit, for urogenital duct, we have ureter and vas deferens; the testes and that anterior part of the primitive kidney, the epididymis, shift back into the scrotal sacs, and the ureters shift round the rectum and establish a direct connection with the bladder, carrying the genital ducts looped over them. The oviducts of the female do not fuse distally to form a median vagina {{as they do in}} the rabbit. In front of the genital organ in both sexes is a corpus adiposum (c.ad.), which acts as a fat store, and is peculiar to the frogs and toads. The distal end of the oviduct of the female is in the breeding season (early March) enormously distended with ova, and the ovaries become then the mere vestiges of their former selves. The distal end of the oviduct is, therefore, not unfrequently styled the uterus. There is no penis in the male, fertilisation of the ova occurring as they are squeezed out of the female by the embracing fore limbs of the male. The male has a pad, black in winter, shown in Figure 1, which is closely pressed against the ventral surface of the female in copulation, and which serves as a ready means of distinguishing the sex.|$|E
