40|$|In 2005, the United States {{signed a}} treaty that, if ratified, {{would be the}} United States 2 ̆ 7 first-ever {{international}} agreement on judgment enforcement. The treaty provides that (a) where two commercial parties elect to resolve disputes between them in a particular forum, and (b) a judgment issues from that forum, then (c) all member states must enforce the judgment. It is a document driven by party autonomy; absent a choice of court agreement (in U. S. parlance, a choice of forum clause), the treaty has no meaning or applicability. The treaty 2 ̆ 7 s signing {{was the end of}} a rigorous journey. The United States has been a party to a treaty on arbitration enforcement, and other nations have been parties to regional agreements on court judgments, but until now the twain have not met: there has been no agreement involving both the United States and court judgments. The new treaty, called the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (the 2 ̆ 2 Convention 2 ̆ 2), is a much scaled-down version of the original U. S. plan. Hoping to build a skyscraper, the United States has succeeded in constructing, at most, a low hut. The goal was to create a treaty that would, with limited exception, allow successful U. S. litigants to collect money by enforcing U. S. judgments against their opponents 2 ̆ 7 foreign assets. The new agreement fulfills this goal, allowing businesses that select a particular forum in their contract and win judgment in that forum to seek to collect on that judgment in the territory of another signatory to the new agreement. All others [...] non-commercial parties, consumers, human rights advocates, and even those businesses that obtain a court judgment from a forum other than one selected in their contract [...] remain excluded by any <b>enforcement</b> <b>treaty.</b> The Convention is, in some sense, a great leap forward for the protected few, and in another sense, an admission of failure for a larger international initiative...|$|E
40|$|Why, {{despite all}} of the inspiring rhetoric in support of human rights, do {{flagrant}} violations endure? <b>Enforcement,</b> <b>treaty</b> ratification, geopolitics, and economic concerns are all very important pieces of this puzzle that have been addressed by others. In this project, though, I look at the historical formation of the modern international human rights concept itself to better understand how its own constitution has affected its application. I approach the issue from a unique perspective; namely, I travel back to its “moments of origin” and explore the multiple forces of social resistance that materialized against {{the formation of the}} International Bill of Human Rights between 1944 and 1966 —a period considered by scholars to be most formative in the establishment of the contemporary human rights regime. Though human rights today might seem like the only appropriate response to the Holocaust and World War II, at the time the concept was anything but self-evident—this empirical analysis reveals a multitude of serious reservations that are often overlooked by human rights scholars. Because the human rights concept promised (or threatened) to create new categories of rights holders, imperial powers such as Great Britain and influential professional organizations such as the American Bar Association and the American Medical Association had serious reservations about the emergent universal human rights concept. In this project I ask, what impact, if any, did these strands of resistance have on the International Bill of Human Rights? To study this question, I construct a series of parallel narratives—each corresponding to an important category of resistance. I create a sociological framework that views the process of human rights formation as a series of struggles over competing social relationships. I argue that the modern human rights concept has been shaped by both positive support and (paradoxically) its opposition. Following World War II, the human rights concept fostered a vital consensus-building process by absorbing oppositional elements into its unitary frame. Thus from its inception, the concept has been encumbered by a series of “internal contradictions” that have created enduring structures that today enable rhetorical praise for human rights, while constraining their enforcement...|$|E
40|$|If {{a foreign}} {{government}} enacts {{a law that}} would be unconstitutional if passed in the United States, can a foreign judgment based on that law be enforced in an American court? For example, can an American court enforce an English judgment based on English defamation law, which is more pro-plaintiff than the First Amendment permits American law to be? The same issue was presented by recent litigation involving Yahoo!, where a federal district court considered whether it could enforce a French judgment based on a French law that regulated hate speech more broadly than the First American allows American polities to regulate. American courts to date uniformly have concluded that enforcing such foreign judgments would be unconstitutional. This Article argues that these courts 2 ̆ 7 analysis is mistaken: While such a foreign judgment may well be un-American insofar as it comes from a non-American polity and reflects political values that diverge from American constitutional law, neither the foreign judgment itself, nor its enforcement by an American court, is unconstitutional. The Article shows that the American courts 2 ̆ 7 analyses are based on a misunderstanding of post-Shelley v. Kraemer jurisprudence. The Article also explains why a legal requirement that foreign judgments be enforced does not qualify as a generally applicable legal rule that would trigger constitutional scrutiny. The American courts 2 ̆ 7 mistaken constitutional analysis has begotten pernicious consequences. The illusion of unconstitutionality has obscured the fact that whether un-American judgments are to be enforced must be decided on the basis of policy. The courts 2 ̆ 7 constitutional confusion also has hidden the fact that the more political branches of government are best institutionally suited on purely functional grounds to making such value-laden judgments. As a doctrinal matter, the courts 2 ̆ 7 erroneous analysis threatens to wrongly narrow the scope of the President 2 ̆ 7 s power to pursue an executive agreement or to negotiate an <b>enforcement</b> <b>treaty</b> with other countries, thereby depriving the President and Congress of powers in respect of foreign affairs that are constitutionally theirs to exercise. Finally, the courts 2 ̆ 7 faulty constitutional conclusion has led to a wholly American-centered analysis that categorically disregards a range of considerations that, on virtually any normative theory, are relevant to deciding whether un-American judgments should be enforced. (A companion piece explores in detail the policy considerations that appropriately determine whether un-American judgments should be enforced, see Should Un-American Foreign Judgments be Enforced?, 88 Minnesota Law Review 783 (2004)). This is a particularly opportune time to correct the constitutional misperceptions concerning un-American judgments because the United States {{is in the process of}} negotiating an international treaty dealing with the enforcement of foreign judgments. It is important that American negotiators not be constrained by illusions of constitutional limitations when they attend to their task of forging a multilateral treaty...|$|E
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} use of capital {{punishment}} for drug trafficking and related crimes from a comparative perspective.

40|$|Two cases {{currently}} pending {{before the}} Supreme Court present {{an opportunity for}} the Court to resolve a conflict between two competing models of treaty adjudication: the Marshall model and the Bork model. The Marshall model applies a presumption in favor of judicial remedies for violations of individual treaty rights. The Bork model applies a presumption against private <b>enforcement</b> of <b>treaties</b> in U. S. courts. During the first fifty years of U. S. constitutional history, the Supreme Court consistently applied the Marshallian presumption in favor of judicial remedies. As a judge on the D. C. Circuit in 1984, Robert Bork created the Borkian presumption against judicial <b>enforcement</b> of <b>treaties</b> when he published a concurring opinion in Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic. Since 1984, many state and federal courts have applied the Bork model to deny judicial remedies for individuals whose treaty rights were violated. The Supreme Court has never endorsed the Bork model. The Bork model is contrary to the Framers’ original understanding of the judicial role in <b>treaty</b> <b>enforcement.</b> Adoption of the Borkian presumption by lower courts was a radical departure from two centuries of consistent Supreme Court jurisprudence. When courts apply the Bork model, they countenance treaty violations by state governments, they abdicate their constitutional responsibility to restrain illegal executive action, and they damage the United States’ international reputation...|$|R
