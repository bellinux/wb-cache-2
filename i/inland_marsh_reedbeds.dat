50|$|Opened in 2005, the 35 mile long Wherryman's Way {{follows the}} route of the {{historic}} Broads trading wherries between Norwich and Great Yarmouth. It winds through existing footpaths, open <b>marshes,</b> <b>reedbeds,</b> grazing meadows and riverside villages {{along the banks of the}} River Yare. The path passes numerous information panels, sculptures and audio posts which seek to bring to life the characters and history of the route.|$|R
50|$|The <b>marshes</b> and <b>reedbeds</b> of the Wash and Humber {{are some}} of the most {{important}} areas for wading birds in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The Portage/Ogden Dunes {{station is}} close to the <b>Inland</b> <b>Marsh</b> and West Beach units of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.|$|R
5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area <b>inland,</b> to <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|R
50|$|It frequents <b>marshes</b> and <b>reedbeds.</b> Like other munias form large flocks during rice harvest but {{spread out}} in pairs during {{breeding}} season. General behaviour similar to other munias.|$|R
50|$|The {{state is}} located in western Brazil, in a region mostly {{occupied}} by the <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> of the Pantanal. The highest elevation is the 1,065 m high Morro Grande.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{found in}} <b>marshes</b> or <b>reedbeds</b> and hunts over open grasslands and {{cultivation}} near wetlands. Found from sea level up to 3000 metres, in east Africa it predominantly occurs above 1500 metres.|$|R
5|$|Essex {{has one of}} {{the longest}} coastlines of any English county, with saltmarshes, lagoons, mudflats, grazing <b>marshes,</b> <b>reedbeds</b> and shingle. Its ancient forests were {{formerly}} important to the local economy, with wood being used for fuel, construction and bark in the tanning industry. Coppicing is being re-introduced by the EWT to encourage woodland grasses, flowers, invertebrates and birds. A few grasslands on the heavy clays of south- and mid-Essex are still grazed according to traditional methods, supporting a mixture of pasture and fen. Some brownfield sites, often on contaminated soil, have populations of nationally scarce species, particularly invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|Its {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} <b>marshes</b> and <b>reedbeds</b> across {{eastern and southern}} Africa from Ethiopia to South Africa. Many birds are permanent residents, but some undertake seasonal movements {{in response to the}} availability of wetland.|$|R
50|$|The {{lake and}} the town are both named after {{surveyor}} Robert Austin, {{who was the first}} European to explore and chart the area. Austin initially named the lake the Great <b>Inland</b> <b>Marsh</b> but the name was later changed to Lake Austin. The townsite was gazetted in 1895.|$|R
50|$|Across {{from the}} {{freshwater}} <b>inland</b> <b>marsh,</b> are the coastal headlands which represent {{one of the}} most unique habitats of the Acadian Forest Region, and are in danger of disappearing due to the development of coastal areas. Plants growing in this area have little to no soil, and are exposed to salt spray from the Atlantic Ocean. From the oval lawn which divides the coastal headlands and freshwater <b>inland</b> <b>marsh,</b> an herbaceous bank can be admired which is decorated with native plants that provide colorful blossoms through the spring, summer and fall seasons. These plants are a great representation of plants that can be integrated into home gardens to provide native pollinators a good source of nectar and habitat. Examples of such plants include Turtlehead (Chelone glabra), Joe-Pye Weed (Eupatorium maculatum), and Brown Eyed-Susans (Rudbeckia hirta).|$|R
50|$|Miller Woods {{is home to}} 18 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians, giving {{it one of the}} most diverse herpetofauna in the Indiana Dunes. These include the Fowler's toad, the six-lined racerunner and the state-endangered Blanding's turtle. In addition, the slender glass lizard inhabits the <b>Inland</b> <b>Marsh</b> area in the neighborhood's southeast.|$|R
5000|$|Spartina {{gracilis}} is {{a species}} of grass known by the common name alkali cordgrass. It is native to western North America from northwestern Canada through the western United States and eastern California, and into central Mexico. It grows in moist alkaline habitat, such as evaporating streams and shorelines, alkali flats, and <b>inland</b> <b>marshes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{this area}} of the garden, {{visitors}} can admire a man-made pond which is host to many of the native species of plants including cattails, water-lilies, and arrowheads. Freshwater <b>Inland</b> <b>Marshes</b> are important ecosystems for water fowl. If lucky, visitors may see a pair of migratory mallard ducks who come to the pond each spring.|$|R
5000|$|Palustrine {{wetlands}} {{include any}} inland wetland that lacks flowing water, contains ocean-derived salts in concentrations {{of less than}} 0.5 parts per thousand, and is non-tidal. [...] The word palustrine comes from the Latin word palus or marsh. Wetlands within this category include <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> and swamps as well as bogs, fens, tundra and floodplains.|$|R
50|$|As typical {{to other}} alkali lake {{beds in the}} western United States, minimal aquatic life is found in Harney Lake. A species of inland brine shrimp is the only form of life in Harney Lake. Despite its limited food supply, the lake {{is part of an}} {{important}} <b>inland</b> <b>marsh</b> ecosystem for migratory birds in the arid southeast Oregon desert.|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{degradation}} of wetland ecosystems, principally through large-scale drainage and conversion to arable farmland, have {{been implicated in}} the widespread, dramatic declines of breeding waders across Europe. Managing the remaining wetlands to reverse these declines will require a detailed understanding of their habitat requirements. In the UK, grazing marshes are key components of the remaining wetlands in both coastal and inland sites, {{and the structure of}} grazing marsh habitat can differ between these locations. Redshank Tringa totanus is a declining wader species that breeds in both marsh types. We quantified the habitat features that influence redshank selection of breeding and nest site locations, across coastal and <b>inland</b> <b>marshes,</b> in eastern England. On both marsh types, breeding location and breeding densities within fields were positively related to the lengths of pool edge and all wet features, respectively. Nest site location was principally influenced by vegetation characteristics, with soil penetrability also important on inland sites but proximity to wet features and vegetation type at the nest important on coastal sites. Hatching probability was higher when the surrounding soils were more penetrable. Synthesis and applications. The wet features of critical importance for breeding redshank are common on coastal marshes and can be deliberately established on <b>inland</b> sites. Coastal <b>marshes</b> are often rare and frequently threatened by dynamic coastal processes, whereas <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> are more abundant but largely unsuitable for breeding waders at present. These analyses highlight the scope for improving the management of <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> for breeding redshank. As habitat suitable for breeding redshank frequently supports a range of other wader species, this information can also direct management efforts to improve breeding wader populations in the wider countryside...|$|R
50|$|This former {{clay brick}} quarry has pits which have filled with water, {{and it has}} diverse {{habitats}} of grassland, woodland, scrub, pools, <b>marshes</b> and <b>reedbeds.</b> Mammals includes water voles, water shrews, and there are birds such as sedge warblers, tawny owls, woodcocks, great spotted woodpeckers and reed buntings.|$|R
50|$|The Marshlands unit {{is located}} in the <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> of {{southern}} Jefferson County, and is only accessible by boat. The park does rent canoes and kayaks so that these areas of the park may be explored by visitors. Many species of migratory birds stop in or pass through the park, and the Marshlands unit provides observation blinds for bird watchers.|$|R
50|$|Because dams have sharply {{reduced the}} {{freshwater}} inflow to the lakes and <b>marshes,</b> the <b>reedbeds,</b> sedges, and other fresh-water plant {{species have been}} replaced with salt-loving plants. These changes have produced a sharp reduction in the migratory bird populations, which depend on the mix of plants that used to exist.|$|R
40|$|Lesser snow geese graze intensively on graminoid {{vegetation}} of intertidal and non-tidal salt marshes at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba. The {{replacement of}} defoliated plant tissue {{is limited by}} the supply of nitrogen. Nitrogen in goose faeces may become available for plant uptake through hydrolysis of urea and through nitrification. In recent years, heavy grazing and grubbing by the growing goose population have damaged the vegetation at some sites. Soils beneath damaged swards become hypersaline and grubbed soils exhibit low rates of net nitrogen mineralization and low ammonium concentrations. We measured effects of temperature and salinity on the rate of urea hydrolysis and on the nitrification potential of soils. Rates of urea hydrolysis increased with rising temperatures (1 degrees C - 30 degrees C) but declined with increasing salinity. Rates of urea hydrolysis were low in soils where the vegetation had been removed by grubbing but high in the more organic soils of the non-tidal <b>inland</b> <b>marsh.</b> Rates of nitrification were consistently low, particularly in soils from the <b>inland</b> <b>marsh.</b> The nitrification rate increased with temperature, and was higher at the salinity of sea water than at lower or higher salinities. Watering turves with river water for six weeks before measuring. rates of nitrification did not significantly change the results in soils from either the intertidal <b>marsh</b> or the <b>inland</b> <b>marsh.</b> It is probable that most mineral nitrogen available to plants growing in these soils {{is in the form of}} ammonium. Low soil temperatures and hypersaline conditions limit rates of urea hydrolysis, and Likely restrict available nitrogen for the growth of forage plants...|$|R

50|$|Blue-winged teal inhabit {{shoreline}} {{more often}} than open water and prefer calm water or sluggish currents to fast water. They inhabit <b>inland</b> <b>marshes,</b> lakes, ponds, pools, and shallow streams with dense emergent vegetation. In coastal areas, breeding occurs in salt-marsh meadows with adjoining ponds or creeks. Blue-winged teal use rocks protruding above water, muskrat houses, trunks or limbs of fallen trees, bare stretches of shoreline, or mud flats for resting sites.|$|R
50|$|It breeds semi-colonially on <b>inland</b> <b>marshes</b> in Iraq, Iran and {{southern}} Russia. Four eggs are laid in a ground nest. The Iraqi and Iranian breeders are mainly residents, but Russian birds migrate south in winter to the Indian Subcontinent, the Middle East and north east Africa. It {{is a very}} rare vagrant in western Europe, the first example in Britain being found at Packington, Warwickshire on 12 July 1975.|$|R

5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use <b>inland</b> locations. The <b>marsh</b> terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in <b>inland</b> <b>marshes.</b> The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|R
