Leishmaniasis (Oriental sore) was another disease, which Behçet worked on, beginning in 1923. He wrote about it in many articles and succeeded in its treatment with diathermic. He first described [...] "the nail sign" [...] appearing by {{the removal of the}} crust of an oriental sore. A part of his published work was concerned with parasitosis. In 1923, he described the etiologic agents of [...] "gale cereal" [...] in Turkey. Behçet dealt with superficial and <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> and their treatments. Due to his observations, he described the dermatitis of fig in 1933. In 1935, at the Dermatology Congress in Budapest, he was honoured for his studies on mycosis. He was also in the publishing vanguard to improve Turkish medicine and he was responsible for the first dermato-venerology journal of Turkey called ’’Turkish Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology’’ in 1924. In 1939, he was elected as a correspondent member to the German scientific journals ’’Dermatologische Wochenschrift’’ and ’’Medizinische Wochenschrift’’. The same year, he has been promoted to ordinary professor. The most important work that Behçet brought to Turkish medicine was the monograph published in 1940 called ’’Clinical and Practical Syphilis, Diagnosis and Related Dermatoses’’. Every page of this book contains an aspect of syphilis and the footnotes, provides a wealth of detailed information about the differential diagnosis of other skin diseases. As a result, scientists had the chance to learn about syphilis and dermatology at the same time. This book, despite its outdated style, still retains its value and spirit in medicine as being the only example in its field. Behçet continued as the Head of the Department of Dermatology and Venereal Diseases until 1947.|$|E

The microconidia of Histoplasma species may be inhaled by mammalian hosts, and {{is followed by}} a rapid conversion to yeast that can persist in host tissues causing histoplasmosis, a <b>deep</b> pulmonary/systemic <b>mycosis.</b> Histoplasma capsulatum sensu lato is a complex of at least eight clades geographically distributed as follows: Australia, Netherlands, Eurasia, North American classes 1 and 2 (NAm 1 and NAm 2), Latin American groups A and B (LAm A and LAm B) and Africa. With the exception of the Eurasian cluster, those clades are considered phylogenetic species. Increased Histoplasma sampling (n = 234) resulted in the revision of the phylogenetic distribution and population structure using 1, 563 aligned nucleotides from four protein-coding regions. The LAm B clade appears to be divided into at least two highly supported clades, which are geographically restricted to either Colombia/Argentina or Brazil respectively. Moreover, a complex population genetic structure was identified within LAm A clade supporting multiple monophylogenetic species, which could be driven by rapid host or environmental adaptation (~ 0. 5 MYA). We found two divergent clades, which include Latin American isolates (newly named as LAm A 1 and LAm A 2), harboring a cryptic cluster in association with bats. At least six new phylogenetic species are proposed in the Histoplasma species complex supported by different phylogenetic and population genetics methods, comprising LAm A 1, LAm A 2, LAm B 1, LAm B 2, RJ and BAC- 1 phylogenetic species. The genetic isolation of Histoplasma could be a result of differential dispersion potential of naturally infected bats and other mammals.

40|$|Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a <b>deep</b> {{systemic}} <b>mycosis</b> {{caused by}} human fungal pathogens of the Paracoccidioides genus. The disease is geographically restricted to subtropical areas of Latin America (from south of Mexico to north of Argentina) {{with a high}} prevalence in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Argentina [1]. The annual incidence rate in Brazil is 10 – 30 infections per million inhabitants, and the mean mortality rate is 1. 4 per million inhabitants per year, making this disease the highest cause of mortality among systemic mycoses [2]. PCM is endemic in rural populations and mainly affects individuals engaged in agricultural activities, who inhale aerosols containing fungal material during manipulation of the soil. Molecular evolutionary studies place the genus Paracoccidioides in the thermodimorphic fungal pathogen clade related to the family Ajellomycetaceae (Ascomycetes), which includes the Blastomyces, Histoplasma, and Emmonsia genera, and with which it shares a common ancestor, Lacazia loboi. PCM {{can be caused by}} two species Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and P. lutzii [3]. P. brasiliensis has been considered a single species since its discovery, although several studies including molecular and morphological data support the split of P. brasiliensis into two species [3, 4]. P. lutzii is composed of a single monophyletic and recombining population so far found in central, southwest, and north Brazil and Ecuador [3 – 5]. On the other hand, P. brasiliensis contains a complex of at least four different cryptic species (S 1, PS 2, PS 3 and PS 4; Figure 1 A [6]). P. brasiliensis S 1 represents a monophyletic and recombining population widely distributed in South America and has been associated with the majority of cases of PCM detected up until the present time. Strains belonging to P. brasiliensis S 1 have previously been recovered from armadillos, soil, and penguin feces [6]. P. brasiliensis PS 2 is a paraphyletic and recombining population identified so far only in Brazil and Venezuela [6]. P. brasiliensis PS 3 is comprised of a monophyletic and clonal population that has been recovered in humans and armadillos in endemic regions of Colombia [6]. P. brasiliensis PS 4 was recently identified and is composed of a monophyletic population of clinical isolates from Venezuela [5, 7]. Besides the typical bicorn cocked hat– and barrel-shaped conidia produced by both species, P. lutzii frequently produces elongated rod-shaped conidia, a characteristic feature that may be used for species identification [3]. Because of the difficulties of conidia production in the laboratory and slight morphological differences among species, molecular identification of Paracoccidioides species has become the most common tool of choice. Several molecular markers have already been applied in population studies of the Pararacoccidioides genus, and for multilocus sequencing typing, gp 43, arf, b-tub, and hsp 70 loci are the best choices for species delineation [4, 6]...|$|R

BackgroundRecently, invasive fungal infections have increased significantly {{because of the}} growing number of immunocompromised hosts. The measurement of plasma (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan has been proposed as a useful diagnostic tool for <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis.</b> In this study, we analyzed the alteration of the plasma (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan concentration by using different kinds of hemodialysis (HD) membranes in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and estimated its half-life. MethodsTwenty-seven patients with ESRD without known fungal infections (with a median age of 66 years old) were enrolled in this study. Cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane, cellulose (Cu) membrane, and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) membrane were used in three consecutive initiations of HD and plasma (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan concentration was measured before and after each HD session. ResultsThe level did not change between before and after HD when CTA and PMMA membranes were used. In contrast, the plasma (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan level increased greatly after HD using the Cu membrane (from 9. 4 to 332 pg/mL in median). Hypothesizing that the plasma (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan level declines exponentially, its median half-life is estimated at 20 hours, which is not affected by hepatic or renal function. ConclusionsBecause the plasma (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan level increases dramatically after HD using the Cu membrane, dialyzers with Cu membrane should be avoided for HD in patients with suspected <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis.</b> The measurement of plasma (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan is also useful for the patients with hepatic or renal failure...|$|E

Sheep red blood cells sensitized with purified gp 43 were more endocytized than SF:BC alone, and this process was also inhibited by anti-gp 43 F(ab) fragments. Inhibition tests indicated the involvement of fucose and mannose residues in the phagocytosis of the fungus and of SRBC-gp 43 by macrophages.

40|$|SummaryHistoplasmosis is a <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> {{caused by}} Histoplasma capsulatum, which is endemic {{in many areas}} of the world but is {{relatively}} rare in China. Although the majority of cases present as a mild to moderate flu-like disease requiring only supportive therapy, approximately 1 % of patients experience more serious pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, which can be life-threatening if diagnosis is delayed or the treatment is not initiated rapidly. Definitive diagnosis is usually made by a combination of culture, detection of the organism in tissues, measurement of antibodies, and detection of antigen. We present the case of a 51 -year-old patient who presented with histoplasmosis only, with several ulcerated lesions in the oral cavity and without HIV infection, who did not show any detectable signs and symptoms of systemic disease or extra-oral manifestations. Histopathological analysis indicated a chronic inflammatory process with granulomas with yeast-like organisms. Isolation of H. capsulatum and molecular identification provided the definitive diagnosis. Treatment with oral itraconazole led to remission of the oral lesions.

40|$|Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a facultative, {{intracellular}} pathogen {{causing the}} most important <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> in Latin America. As the production of IFN-gamma and induction of cell-mediated immunity to P. brasiliensis is of critical importance in host defense, the immunotherapeutic effect of exogenous IL- 12 administration was studied in a murine model of susceptibility to pulmonary infection. rIL- 12 treatment led to a less disseminated disease, as confirmed by decreased fungal loads in liver and spleen. Administration of rIL- 12 did not affect fungal growth in the lungs, although it did induce an augmented pulmonary mononuclear cell inflammation. IL- 12 treatment induced an early (week 1) increase in pulmonary IFN-gamma, but decreased cytokine and specific antibody (IgG 1 and IgG 3) production at week 8 after infection. These results show that IL- 12 administration induces a less severe infection, but the high inflammatory response detected in the lungs precludes its possible use as a new therapeutic tool for severe paracoccidioidomycosis.

Our results demonstrated that, during the infection, peritoneal macrophages show an increased phagocytic capacity and H 2 O 2 production, but also a reduced ability to produce NO. Moreover, F. pedrosoi stimulated H 2 O 2 production in vitro but not the synthesis of NO. The incubation of IFNc and LPS-stimulated macrophages with melanin, obtained from the fungus, inhibited NO production. Examination of the liver and spleen of infected animals, at day 30 or 60 following inoculation, showed a progressive increase in the number and size of granulomas, indicating that macrophages are properly mobilized and activated. Our data suggest that the inability of the host to clear F. pedrosoi, leading to a chronic disease, is due, at least in part, to the inhibition of NO synthesis by macrophages by fungus-produced melanin...|$|E

All the symptoms and abnormalities in laboratory findings disappeared within 25 days only by the discontinuance of ubenimex and itracon- azole. This is the first reported case of pseudoaldosteronism caused by combination treatment with itraconazole and ubenimex. <b>Deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> is commonly associated with immuno- suppresive situations such as leukemia. It is, therefore, supposed {{that there is a}} relatively high possibility of the simultaneous administration of itraconazole and ubenimex. The case reported here, however, gives notice that the development of pseudoaldosteronism needs to be taken into consideration in patients treated with a combination of itraconazole and ubenimex...|$|E
40|$|Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a {{systemic}} mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a thermally dimorphic fungus known to produce disease, primarily in individuals whose profession {{is characterized by}} intense and continuous contact with the soil. PCM presents a high incidence in Brazil, especially in the southeastern, southern and center-western regions of the country. On reporting the first two cases, in 1908, Adolpho Lutz presented the clinical picture and histopathological findings – tubercles with giant epithelioid cells and fungal specimens with exosporulation – of the infection. He cultured the fungus at different temperatures, demonstrating its mycelial and yeast phases, and reproduced the disease in guinea pigs (1). Few researchers in that era were so comprehensive when reporting a new disease and its etiological agent. This <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> prevails among men aged between 30 and 59 years, comprising their most productive working phase, with a gender ratio of 10 : 1 (2). Analysis of 3, 181 death certificates that reported PCM during the 16 -year period from 1980 to 1995 revealed a mortality rate of 1. 487 per one million inhabitants, indicating its considerable magnitude but low visibility (3). PCM was the eighth greatest cause of death from predominantly chronic or repetitive types of infectious and parasitic diseases in Brazil, surpassed only by AIDS, Chagas ’ disease, tuberculosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, syphilis and Hansen’s disease. Behind PCM, in decreasing order of mortality, were ascariasis, other parasitoses, leishmaniasis, cysticercosis, other infectious diseases, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, candidiasis, other mycoses, pneumocystis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, and lobomycosis...|$|E

It isa <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> and severe and may present associated with other diseases such as tuberculosis, AIDS and cancer. Thepresent study analyzed the clinical and pathological aspects of patients diagnosed with PCM in the Service of PathologyAnatomy (SAP) of Araújo Jorge Hospital, Goiânia-Goiás, in the period 2000 to 2006. The cases analyzed werecollected from the registration books of the SAP and the clinical and pathological data obtained from their medicalrecords. We diagnosed 77 cases of PCM, of which 94. 8 % were male patients and 5. 2 % female. The age of highestincidence is identified between 40 and 60 years of age. As for {{the location of the}} lesions, the highest percentages ofcases were found in the oral cavity (25. 97 %), larynx (12. 98 %), lymphnodes (10. 38 %), tongue (7. 79 %), the skin (6. 49 %) and the lip (5. 19 %). Regarding the distribution annual the largest number of cases (18) was detected in 2000. The PCMis not subject to routine surveillance, and cases diagnosed at the Hospital Araújo Jorge are not properly informed, fornot having preventive tool and preferably be specialized in cancer treatment. In Brazil, has records of more than 50 cases of PCM associated with AIDS infection which puts this as another indicator of the syndrome. 100 years after its description, paracoccidioidomycosis is still a disease that requires consideration, continuous interest andmultidisciplinary approach...|$|E

40|$|Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the causative {{agent of}} paracoccidioidomycosis, the most {{prevalent}} <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> in Latin America. Production of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, during fungal infections is theorized to {{play a critical role}} on fungal survival and/or growth as well as on host immune response modulation. Host cells are one source of these mediators; however another potential source may be the fungus itself. The purpose of our study was to assess whether P. brasiliensis strains with different degree of virulence (Pb 18, Pb 265, PbBT 79, Pb 192) produce both, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)). Moreover, we asked if P. brasiliensis can use exogenous sources of arachidonic acid (AA), as well as metabolic pathways dependent on cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (5 -LO) enzymes, for PGE(2) and LTB(4) production, respectively. Finally, a possible association between these eicosanoids and fungus viability was assessed. We demonstrated, using ELISA assays, that all P. brasiliensis strains, independently of their virulence, produce high PGE(2) and LTB(4) levels after a 4 -hour culture, which were reduced after 8 hours. However, in both culture times, higher eicosanoids levels were detected when culture medium was supplemented with exogenous AA. Differently, treatment with indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, or MK 886, a 5 -LO inhibitor, induces a reduction on PGE(2) and LTB(4) levels, respectively, as well as in fungus viability. The data provide evidence that P. brasiliensis is able to metabolize either endogenous or exogenous AA by pathways that depend on COX and 5 -LO enzymes for producing, respectively, PGE(2) and LTB(4) that are critical for its viability...|$|E
40|$|Pneumocystis carinii {{pneumonia}} (PcP) remains {{among the}} most prevalent opportunistic infections among AIDS patients. Currently, drugs used clinically for <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> act by binding ergosterol or disrupting its biosynthesis. Although classified as a fungus, P. carinii lacks ergosterol. Instead, the pathogen synthesizes a number of distinct Δ 7, 24 -alkylsterols, despite the abundance of cholesterol, which it can scavenge from the lung alveolus. Thus, the pathogen-specific sterols appear vital for organism survival and proliferation. In the present study, high concentrations of a C 32 sterol were found in human-derived P. carinii hominis. The definitive structural identities of two C- 24 alkylated lanosterol compounds, previously not reported for rat-derived P. carinii carinii, were determined by using GLC, MS, and NMR spectroscopy together with the chemical syntheses of authentic standards. The C 31 and C 32 sterols were identified as euphorbol (24 -methylenelanost- 8 -en- 3 β-ol) and pneumocysterol [(24 Z) -ethylidenelanost- 8 -en- 3 β-ol], respectively. The identification {{of these and other}} 24 -alkylsterols in P. carinii hominis suggests that (i) sterol C- 24 methyltransferase activities are extraordinarily high in this organism, (ii) 24 -alkylsterols are important components of the pathogen’s membranes, because the addition of these side groups onto the sterol side chain requires substantial ATP equivalents, and (iii) the inefficacy of azole drugs against P. carinii {{can be explained by the}} ability of this organism to form 24 -alkysterols before demethylation of the lanosterol nucleus. Because mammals cannot form 24 -alkylsterols, their biosyntheses in P. carinii are attractive targets for the development of chemotherapeutic strategies against this opportunistic infection...|$|E

Ga- 67 scintigraphy is a good tool to identify active disease; bone scintigraphy is useful in the evaluation of mutilation and 99 mTc-DTPA is good to evaluate kidney function. Paracoccidioidomycosis is a <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis</b> that affects nearly all organs. The following scintigraphic exams are useful to evaluate such patients: Ga- 67, bone scintigraphy, liver / spleen / bone marrow scintigraphy, 99 mTc-DISIDA scintigraphy, lymphoscintigraphy. Mycetoma is bone and soft tissue mycosis and gallim- 67 and bone studies are very useful for the detectio of active disease. Tuberculosis is the most well studied tropical disease and dozens of radiopharmaceuticals and techniques were described to evaluate such patients. Jorge Lobo's disease is a rare mycosis that affects mainly indians from the Amazon region and gallium- 67 was shown to accumulate in active disease. Neurocysticercosis is spread worldwide and brain SPECT (99 mTc-ECD or 99 mTc-HMPAO) is a very good tool for the functional evaluation of the disease. Patients suffering from Cutaneous and mucous leishmaniosis may benefit from Gallium- 67 scintigraphy. Chagas' disease may affect the heart and/or the digestive tract and several scintigraphic exams may be helpful in the evaluation of such cases (gated blood pool, heart perfusion tests, pharyngeal transit tests, gastric emptying tests, intestinal transit tests, hepato-billiary scintigraphy, among others). Scintigraphy should be more largely used in the functional evaluation of organs and systems of patients affected by topical diseases...|$|E
40|$|Background: In an endemic area, {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis (CL) is largely diagnosed by its clinical appearance. Diagnostic challenge arises when the lesions appear in nonendemic area, when clinical picture is distorted, or any atypical variant is seen even in endemic regious. In developing countries like ours, the laboratory aid is not widely available and dermatologists mostly {{have to rely}} on clinical experience. Aim: The study was aimed to see the correlation of clinical, histological, and microbiological findings in clinically diagnosed cases of CL. Methods: It was an observational and descriptive study and was conducted over a period of 2 years in two dermatology centers in the country. Seventy-seven patients with clinically suspicious lesions of CL were screened and 60 of these were diagnosed as true clinical cases on the basis of criteria for clinical diagnosis. These cases were then subjected to slit skin smear and histopathological examination. Parasitologically positive and suggestive cases were recorded and descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the findings. Results: Out of 60 registered cases, 36 (60 &#x 0025;) were smear-positive and 30 (50 &#x 0025;) demonstrated Leishman Donovan (LD) bodies in histological sections. Twenty-six of the remaining (parasite-negative) cases showed one of the recognizable histological patterns seen in CL, 3 did not reveal any suggestive histology but responded to antimonial compound, and 1 {{turned out to be a}} case of <b>deep</b> <b>mycosis.</b> Conclusion: Considering the magnitude of the problem and limited resources of a developing country like ours, clinical diagnosis alone may be reliable enough in endemic areas...|$|E
