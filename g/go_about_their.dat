In the meantime, air force planes continued to set off flares to show their alertness, and rocket launchers and more weapons were deployed around Tan Son Nhut. Three battalions of paratroopers were brought in to patrol the airfield's perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become indifferent to the yōkais presence, and fail to see them as they <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|E
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E

5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} {{had special}} {{praise for the}} game's sound design {{and how it was}} used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension of disbelief was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach the heights of the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability for breaking the balance of the game. TouchArcade thought that the game played better on the tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{creation}} of these paintings {{was turned into a}} kind of performance art—an event in 1960, for example, had an audience dressed in formal evening wear watching the models <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> task while an instrumental ensemble played Klein's 1949 The Monotone Symphony (a single 20-minute sustained chord followed by a 20-minute silence).|$|E

The next day, however, the soldiers seized a shipment of goods arriving from Raqqa and began looting the town.

25|$|After the {{procedure}} is complete, the patient is typically asked to lie flat for 5–10 minutes to provide pressure over {{the procedure}} site. After that, assuming no bleeding is observed, the patient can get up and <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> normal activities. Paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics {{can be used to}} ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after the procedure. Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication. Patients are also advised to avoid washing the procedure site for at least 24 hours after {{the procedure is}} completed.|$|E

For example, the Jackal (The Day of the Jackal) does not simply attempt to shoot Charles de Gaulle. He prepares meticulously by researching his quarry at the British Museum library; he obtains papers for his various false identities; he travels around Paris to find a good location for a sniper's nest; he buys and tests his weapons; and so on.|$|E
25|$|EastEnders is {{a long-running}} British soap opera created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland {{which has been}} {{broadcast}} on BBC One since 1985. Set in the East End of London in the fictional Borough of Walford, the programme follows the stories of local residents and their families as they <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> daily lives in Albert Square. The series was initially screened as two 30-minute episodes per week; however, since 2001, episodes have been broadcast every day apart from Wednesdays and weekends. Same-day repeats of the series were previously shown on BBC Three and omnibus editions were shown on BBC Two, however, since 2016 these have been broadcast on UK-based TV channel W.|$|E

25|$|The {{anterior}} approach uses {{an interval}} between the sartorius muscle and tensor fasciae latae. Dr. Joel Matta and Dr. Bert Thomas have adapted this approach, which was commonly used for pelvic fracture repair surgery, for use when performing hip replacement. When used with older hip implant systems {{that had a}} small diameter head, dislocation rates were reduced compared to surgery performed through a posterior approach. With modern implant designs, dislocation rates are lower because supporting muscle tissue, including the iliotibial tract, receives very little damage during the surgery. There is a 10% rate of numbness in the thigh following this approach, due to injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The anterior approach results in a quicker and less painful recovery. Immediately following surgery patients are instructed to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> normal hip function, including weight bearing activity and bending their hip freely.|$|E
25|$|Sacrifice {{had great}} {{importance}} {{in the social and}} religious aspects of Mesoamerican culture. First, it showed death transformed into the divine. Death is the consequence of a human sacrifice, {{but it is not the}} end; it is but the continuation of the cosmic cycle. Death creates life – divine energy is liberated through death and returns to the gods, who are then able to create more life. Secondly, it justifies war, since the most valuable sacrifices are obtained through conflict. The death of the warrior is the greatest sacrifice and gives the gods the energy to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> daily activities, such as the bringing of rain. Warfare and capturing prisoners became a method of social advancement and a religious cause. Finally, it justifies the control of power by the two ruling classes, the priests and the warriors. The priests controlled the religious ideology, and the warriors supplied the sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|York may {{explore the}} Greenvale on foot, by car, or {{by using a}} special item {{obtained}} by completing a sidequest. Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair. York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing non-player characters; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty. Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at the proper time {{to make use of}} their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as they <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> business. It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affects the responses of the non-player characters. If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards. In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in mini-games, such as darts, racing through checkpoints, and fishing, and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes.|$|E

25|$|The Acorn Archimedes version, ArcElite (1991), {{written by}} Warren Burch & Clive Gringras and {{regarded}} by Stuff magazine {{as the best}} conversion of the original game, added intelligent opponents who engage in their own private battles and police who take an active interest in protecting the law. As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using polygon mesh graphics {{in place of the}} wire-frames. The game world no longer seems to be centred around the player; freighter fleets with escorts <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> own business, pirate formations patrol lawless systems looking for cargo to loot and mining ships can often be found breaking up asteroids for their mineral content. Unlike the mythical Generation Ships of the original, rare occurrences of other non-pirate entities mentioned in the manual really {{can be found in the}} Archimedes version: geometric formations of space beacons; hermits living among the asteroids; abandoned ships towed by police (although Dredgers and Generation Ships are confirmed not to exist in Archimedes Elite). The Archimedes version of Elite was originally written to be a space trading game called Trojan - however the obvious similarities eventually meant that to avoid a potential lawsuit Trojan had to become an official Elite conversion. ArcElite was one of a number of games released for free by The Icon Bar website in 2006.|$|E

500|$|However, {{in another}} study, {{following}} chronic exposure to field-realistic {{levels of the}} neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam, colony weight gain was not affected, nor were the number or mass of sexuals produced. Low levels of neonicotinoids can {{reduce the number of}} bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55%, and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees' brains. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function [...] "particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> daily tasks." [...] A study on B. terrestris had results that suggests that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate. Bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with neonicotinoid. Although the bees affected by the pesticide were able to collect more pollen, they took a longer amount of time doing so.|$|E

500|$|On {{instructions}} from Gibbs, Putterill ordered all military personnel {{to remain at}} their posts and <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> normal duties. These instructions were followed but Gibbs's forbidding of any army or police servicemen to [...] "assist the illegal régime ... in its rebellion against the Crown" [...] was roundly ignored. Although the declaration had clearly stated that Rhodesia's loyalty to the monarchy was unaffected, the sympathy of Rhodesian soldiers and officers was quickly revealed to lie firmly with country, not Queen: when Rhodesian officers training in Britain were given an ultimatum to this effect, all but one returned home. Smith predicted confidently that despite the sabre-rattling of Kaunda and the UK's politicians, the British armed forces would never agree to engage in what he said would be a [...] "fratricidal war" [...] against Rhodesia. Nevertheless the Rhodesian Security Forces prepared Operation Wizard, a secret contingency plan to counter an invasion by British or UN forces. Smith was proven correct when a British Ministry of Defence council, headed by Denis Healey, determined such intervention [...] "impossible", leading Wilson {{to rule out the}} use of military force.|$|E
500|$|Numeraries, {{the second}} largest type of the {{faithful}} of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership. Numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in [...] "full availability" [...] (plena disponibilitas) for the official undertakings of the Prelature. [...] This includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the regional directors, and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the Prelate. [...] Because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever {{needs to be done}} for the undertakings of the Prelature, numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs. [...] "" [...] is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. Therefore in order to maintain a family atmosphere in the centers (rather than an institutional one), it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and [...] "get-togethers" [...] in which they converse and share news. [...] Both men and women may become numeraries in Opus Dei, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated. Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time and many modify the way that they <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. They devote the bulk of their income to the organization.|$|E
