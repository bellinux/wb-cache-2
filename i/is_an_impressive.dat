5|$|The {{eastern end}} of Yarralumla is home {{to many of the}} {{diplomatic}} missions in Canberra, many of which are built in a traditional style reflecting that of their respective home countries. Examples of regionally styled chanceries include the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Thailand, and the High Commissions of India and Papua New Guinea. The United States embassy was the first embassy built in Canberra, with the foundation stone laid on the Fourth of July, 1942. The embassy <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> compound of buildings built in a Georgian style, inspired by several buildings designed by Christopher Wren for Virginia {{at the beginning of the}} 18th century. The French embassy includes the French-Australian War Memorial opened in 1961, which has a sculpture by André Bizette-Lindet called Winged Victory. Canberra tourist drive six takes tourists on a car-based tour past many of Canberra's embassies including those located in Yarralumla. It zig-zags through the eastern side of Yarralumla past many of the missions.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> doublestoried structure. Its {{construction}} is credited to Sher Shah Suri's reign from 1540–1545 (though the fort {{walls of the}} Suri period have not been seen to extend to this gate). It was built largely with grey stone but red stones were also used in the frames of its windows.|$|E
25|$|St Kilda Town Hall <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> {{building}} by William Pitt {{but it was}} burnt down in the 1980s and the interior has been extensively redesigned mb. Directly opposite is the St Kilda Public Library built between 1971–1973 at 150 Carlisle Street. It is a notable brutalist design by architect Enrico Taglietti, uniquely designed to open like a book.

25|$|The {{composer}} Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875–1912) {{lived at}} 30 Dagnall Park, Selhurst, until his death. He {{grew up in}} Croydon and sang in the church choir at St George's and taught at the Crystal Palace School of Music and many other schools of music.

25|$|The Abasto {{shopping}} mall <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> {{building that was}} the city's wholesale produce market until the late 1980s; its history is {{closely associated with the}} life and career of tango singer Carlos Gardel. The area around the market used to contain produce warehouses and low-rent housing for the laborers; with its conversion to a high-end mall, the area experienced a gentrification process from the mid-1990s that was slowed by the 2001 economic crisis; but has resumed at a record pace, since.|$|E
25|$|Kuala Kangsar, just 48km {{north of}} Ipoh on the Perak River, is the royal town. It is {{dominated}} by three buildings: Istana Iskandariah, Istana Kenangan and the Ubudiah Mosque. The Istana Iskandariah, located on a hill overlooking the river, is the palace of the Sultan of Perak. Istana Kenangan, which was constructed as a temporary residence during the Iskandariah's construction {{is known for its}} beautiful architecture. The Ubudiah Mosque <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> structure topped with a constellation of bright golden domes.|$|E

25|$|Seven Chimneys is a {{house with}} the {{described}} seven chimneys, located on Ridgewood Road atop a small hill. George Washington {{is said to have}} stayed at the house during the Revolutionary War. Seven Chimneys, the oldest house in the township, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> example of eighteenth-century, regional, domestic architecture and is an important remnant of the community's early settlement period. The house is listed on the State Register and National Register of Historic Places. On November 3, 1968, the Bergen County Historical Society placed a historic-site marker on the property.|$|E
25|$|The Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, known widely as the Upper Basilica, was {{the second}} of the churches to be completed, consecrated in 1876. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive,</b> {{elaborate}} building in Gothic style, designed by architect Hyppolyte Durand, and on one side seems to emerge directly from the rock of Massabielle (the sanctuary is directly above the Grotto). The walls are lined with ex voto plaques, and banners from official National Pilgrimages of the past. It has a series of stained-glass windows depicting various events in the story of Lourdes; the clerestory windows depict Mary as the Second Eve.|$|E
25|$|The Krasiński Palace {{built in}} Warsaw {{in the second}} half of the 17th century by Tylman van Gameren <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> monumental structure. Afterwards, however, {{residential}} forms more convenient and intimate, while still preserving much of the former grandeur, were given preference. The Wilanów Palace of King John III is an early representative of this trend. The Rococo style was triumphant under the Wettin rulers and the present Saxon Palace in Warsaw was rebuilt by Augustus II in that manner. Numerous magnate residencies, in Warsaw and throughout the country, where the former fortifications were replaced with parks and pavilions, followed the trend.|$|E

25|$|Qishlah Fortress <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> sight {{located in}} the center of Ha'il. The current {{building}} was built in the 1940s while prince Abdul-Aziz bin Musa'ad Al Saud held office in Ha'il province. It is the largest traditional mud-brick fortress in Ha'il and is very well restored and preserved both outside and inside. It was used mostly as a barracks. Its two floors are 142.8x141.2 meters high, its walls are 8.5m high, and it has eight large watch-towers along with the wall with two main gates, eastern and western, and has a large inner courtyard with old military items on exhibition.|$|E
25|$|The Book of the Eparch, {{which dates}} to the 10th century, gives a {{detailed}} picture of the city's commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> testament {{to the strength of}} tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the City of Springfield was on {{the brink}} of {{financial}} default, and thus taken over by a Commonwealth-appointed Finance Control Board until 2009. Disbanded in June of that year, the Control Board made great strides stabilizing Springfield's finances. While Springfield has achieved balanced budgets since 2009, the city has not enlarged its tax-base, and thus many of its public works projects— which have been in the pipeline for years, some even decades— remain unfinished, (e.g., repairs to Springfield's landmark Campanile.). Springfield is being considered for a $800million development project; MGM Springfield. To many this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> feat given the natural disasters and continuous cuts to state aide during the Great Recession.|$|E

25|$|Wansdyke {{consists}} of two sections, 14 and 19kilometres (9 and 12mi) long with some gaps in between. East Wansdyke <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> linear earthwork, consisting of a ditch and bank running approximately east-west, between Savernake Forest and Morgan's Hill. West Wansdyke is also a linear earthwork, running from Monkton Combe south of Bath to Maes Knoll south of Bristol, but less impressive than its eastern counterpart. The middle section, 22kilometres (14mi) long, is {{sometimes referred to as}} 'Mid Wansdyke', but is formed by the remains of the London to Bath Roman road. It used to be thought that these sections were all part of one continuous undertaking, especially during the Middle Ages when the pagan name Wansdyke was applied to all three parts. However, it is not now considered certain that this is so.|$|E
25|$|The objects {{produced}} by the main centres of the Carolingian Renaissance, which represent a transformation {{from that of the}} earlier period, have survived in far greater quantity. The arts were lavishly funded and encouraged by Charlemagne, using imported artists where necessary, and Carolingian developments were decisive for the future course of Western art. Carolingian illuminated manuscripts and ivory plaques, which have survived in reasonable numbers, approached those of Constantinople in quality. The main surviving monument of Carolingian architecture is the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> and confident adaptation of San Vitale, Ravenna — from where some of the pillars were brought. Many other important buildings existed, such as the monasteries of Centula or St Gall, or the old Cologne Cathedral, since rebuilt. These large structures and complexes made frequent use of towers.|$|E
25|$|The Romanesque House <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>impressive</b> {{piece of}} {{evidence}} of a former grange of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in Halle, Naumburg, Jena and Erfurt. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As {{a result of its}} aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the margraviates of Meissen and Lower Lusatia – and thus to Silesia – without being charged taxes or dues.|$|E
