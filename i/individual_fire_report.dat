Six high volume pumps were used to extract 25000 L of water per minute417 L per secondfrom a reservoir 1.5 mi from the fire, with six more high volume pumps deployed at various locations to serve as boosters. Thirty-two thousand litres (7,039 imp gal) of fire fighting foam per minute were directed against the fire for just over four hours, after which the pumping rate was reduced.

Fire and {{resource}} managers implemented the first prescribed fire within the Zion boundary within the ponderosa pine type in 1992 (US Department of the Interior National Park Service 1995 unpublished memo, on file at Zion National Park, Spring-dale, Utah, USA). Subsequently, the Fire Effects Monitoring Program at Zion was formally established in 1995 and still exists today. Fire managers delineated prescribed fire burn units within fire-adapted ecosystems affected by fire exclusion in Zion, including the ponderosa pine type. Burn units were then treated with prescribed fire {{to replicate the}} natural disturbance regime; fire monitoring plots within each unit were considered burned at that time even if the spatial pattern of the fire precluded a plot from actual burning. Personnel implemented prescribed fire treatments from March through June and from August through November, depending upon weather prescription elements described in the <b>individual</b> prescribed <b>fire</b> burn plan and vegetation type description sheet. While <b>individual</b> prescribed <b>fire</b> <b>reports</b> were not available for each fire included here, an example of burn unit size and weather conditions for a fall burn and a spring burn are included in Appendix A.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{history of}} fire between 1850 and 1977 in {{a portion of}} the Willamette National Forest in-the central Western Cascades of Oregon was {{documented}} using historical sources. Three types of records were available: (1) records and writings not primarily concerned with fire but yielding information about fire in context with human activities, (2) descriptive accounts of fires prior to 1910, and (3) statistical reports generated by the U. S. Forest Service from 1910 to the present. Corresponding to each type of record, this study was divided into three time periods: pre- 1850, 1850 - 1909, and 1910 - 1977. Information about the pre- 1850 period was drawn from reconstructions of aboriginal forest use by anthropologists, archaeologists, and enthnographers. Although four groups of aboriginal people inhabited areas within or adjacent to the study area, evidence is lacking for intentional Indian burning in the central Western Cascades. Unintentional burning from untended or abandoned campfires is probable. Coupled with naturally occurring lightning-caused fires, these fires were ample ignition to maintain an age class of 125 years or older in the forests of the central Western Cascades. Information about fires occurring between 1850 and 1909 came from a variety of historic sources. All chronicled fires were attributed to man. Many man-caused fires were related to specific human activities, including road building, sheep grazing, and camping. As human use increased, the numbers of fires increased. Conflicts in use occurred because of the threat of fire. Some activities, such as mining and railroading, were not causes of fire in the central Western Cascades. Lightning was not regarded as a cause of forest fires until after 1900. Fire records for the period from 1910 to 1977 were generated by the U. S. Forest Service. These records exist in various forms including fire maps, summary tables, and <b>individual</b> <b>fire</b> <b>reports.</b> Almost 60 percent of all recorded fires from 1910 to 1977 were lightning caused. While lightning ignited more fires, they were usually small and occurred in mid-summer. Man-caused fires although fewer, were larger and occurred throughout the fire season. An {{increase in the number of}} fires is paralleled by an increase in forest use. Two maps were constructed to illustrate the spatial distribution of man-caused and lightning-caused fires. Lightning-caused fires appear to be unevenly distributed over the landscape. Three areas exhibit a low incidence of lightning-caused fires. Lightning fires occur at higher elevations, where fuel accumulations are less, and tend to remain small. Man-caused fires exhibit a definite pattern corresponding with land-use. These fires tend to follow major transportation routes which are generally at lower elevations. Man-caused fires, ignited at lower elevations, have more chance to spread and become large fires...|$|R

30|$|The Smoke and Emissions Model Intercomparison Project (SEMIP) (N. Larkin. {{unpublished}} data) {{was designed}} to create an open standard for comparing smoke and emissions models against each other and against realworld observations. In this study, we apply the SEMIP intercomparison methods and framework to the 2006 Tripod Fire Complex, a large fire event that occurred in Washington state, USA (N. Larkin, unpublished data). We intercompare five <b>fire</b> <b>reporting</b> systems, seven fuel loading maps, and two fuel consumption models, which, when combined into a modeling pathway, lead to estimates of fire emissions. The results of each step in the modeling chain (Figure 1) are examined and, where possible, compared to observations. The goal of our study was to evaluate uncertainties in emissions estimates by quantifying the variability in results produced by various modeling pathways at each modeling step. The Tripod Fire Complex event provides a single large fire case study and illustrates how the variability at each modeling step can be quantified for <b>individual</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fire is an {{integral}} part of California ecosystems; for without fire, few of the state’s native ecosystems, habitats, or even species, would persist as we know them today. Fire’s dynamic nature and great complexity are amplified by the state’s diverse topography, climate, and vegetation. For millennia, California ecosystems have developed in tandem with fire. Long-term alterations of fire patterns have occurred with climatic changes and with interactions with humans. In the past two centuries, the pace of human-induced alteration has accelerated, resulting in a number of changes in species and ecosystems. Many of these species and ecosystem changes occurred previously, some are currently occurring, and others are yet to manifest themselves. To understand the importance of the changing ecological role of fire, it is necessary to understand fire as an ecosystem process. Fire can be viewed within two distinct time frames: <b>individual</b> <b>fires</b> and repeated patterns of fire occurrence. When an <b>individual</b> <b>fire</b> is seen as a discrete event, its physical characteristics are important to understanding how fire functions as an ecosystem process. <b>Individual</b> <b>fires</b> range from simple to extremely complex in their behavior, size, pattern of burning, and ecosystem effects. <b>Individual</b> <b>fires</b> in a limited area affect fuel dynamics, the physical attributes of the ecosystem, and the biological systems at the individual, species, population, and community levels. These direct influences are discussed in detail in subsequent chapters in Part I of this text. Landscapes have repeated patterns of fire occurrence, fire magnitude, and fire type that vary over space and time. When fire is considered over centuries or millennia and on large landscapes, this repeated pattern of fire occurrence and its properties affect ecosystem function. Compounding the influences of <b>individual</b> <b>fires,</b> existing patterns greatly influence the dynamics of species composition, vegetation structure, and subsequent fire patterns.

30|$|Hardcopy <b>fire</b> <b>reports</b> from 1942 to {{the present}} contain {{narratives}} recorded by firefighters or the local park ranger (often the same individual) {{at the time of}} the fire, or shortly thereafter.

All <b>fire</b> <b>reports</b> for lightning-caused <b>fires</b> were read and those with detailed narratives were identified. This subset was evaluated for use as case studies. To insure that the sample fires spanned the range of management policies, at least one fire per decade from the 1940 s to the 1980 s with a duration greater than 4.5 days was selected. <b>Fire</b> <b>reporting</b> and management changes (e.g., narratives with little or no description of the vegetation; indirect fire line construction) in the 1980 s made it difficult to discern fire behavior characteristics useful for case studies from this decade.|$|R
