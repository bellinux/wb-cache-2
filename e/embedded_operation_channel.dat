40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are going}} to learn about the {{minimization}} of distortion in steganography. For this purpose we use a general nonbinary <b>embedding</b> <b>operation</b> and discuss various system requirements. We assume every possible value of stego element by assigning a scalar which expresses the distortion of a embedding change done by replacing the cover element by this value. The total distortion is assumed to be a sum of per-element distortions. Both the payload-limited sender (minimizing the total distortion while embedding a fixed payload) and the distortion-limited sender (maximizing the payload while introducing a fixed total distortion) are considered. Nonbinary case is decomposed into several binary cases by replacing individual bits in cover elements, but there is no loss of performance. Using a novel syndrome-coding scheme, the binary case is approached and these are based on dual convolution codes equipped with the Viterbi algorithm. This fast and very versatile solution achieves state-of-the-art results in steganographic applications while having linear time and space complexity with respect to the number of cover elements. Practical merit of this approach is validated by constructing and testing adaptive embedding schemes for digital images. In this paper what we’ve obtained is to implement steganography by using general non-binary <b>embedding</b> <b>operation.</b> This gives the new technique to implement steganography effectively and easily...|$|R
