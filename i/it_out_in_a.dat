5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine {{on the brink of}} seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E

Another knee injury mid-season left Hart with a choice: more major surgery or retirement. He chose the latter and was appointed a skills coach with Richmond.|$|E

25|$|Federer {{opened his}} US Open Series at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, where he {{finished}} in the quarterfinals last year. Federer first faced Alex Bogomolov, Jr. of Russia, and found little trouble in his first match, dropping only five games {{en route to a}} win in one hour. In the third round Federer faced Australian Bernard Tomic, defeating the 19-year-old while only dropping six games. Federer next faced American Mardy Fish in a rematch of the 2010 Cincinnati final. His quarterfinal against Fish was a high quality match with Federer closing <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second set tiebreaker. His semifinal match was an all Swiss affair as he faced friend and doubles partner Stan Wawrinka. Wawrinka pressed Federer to a tiebreaker but ultimately succumbed to the world number 1 in straight sets. With his victory over Wawrinka, Federer secured the number ranking going into the US Open. He faced world number 2 Novak Djokovic in the final, and started the match strong, winning six straight games to open with a one-set lead in 20 minutes. He then played a tight second set with Djokovic, and won the set and the match in a tiebreaker. With his win, Federer won his record fifth title at Cincinnati and did so without losing a serve or dropping a set for the entire tournament.|$|E

500|$|Due to time constraints, {{a lot of}} {{the initial}} ideas were dropped from {{the final version of the}} game, such as {{atmospheric}} battles, and new weapons types like a [...] "subspace missile artillery strike". The team made major improvements to the same FreeSpace engine from the first game. By revamping the core of the graphical engine, and adding 32-bit support, they sped up the interface screens and graphic processing. Hardware acceleration for the graphics was also decided to be a requirement to target the high-end machines of 1999. This allowed for a greater number of ships visibly active on the battlefield, satisfying the team's penchant of having great numbers of fighters and capitals ships duking <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> big battlefield, instead of [...] "multiple small-ass" [...] battles. The shifting of their target focus to higher end machines also fulfilled their top priority of having capital ships many times larger than fighter crafts. The team also followed real world concepts for some of their designs. The Pegasus stealth fighter was modeled on the stealth technology of the 1990s for people to relate to it easily. The game was restrained from becoming too realistic by the team's recognition that most gamers only want believable worlds to have a blast flying around in and blowing things up.|$|E

2500|$|... 1987 saw {{the return}} of the Cup to Pretoria. Under the {{coaching}} of John Williams and captaincy of Naas Botha (returning at the end of 1984 after his stint in America) they defeated Transvaal in the final with a legendary performance by the captain, who scored all 24 points with 4 penalties and 4 drop goals. In the 1988 final they defied all odds by beating Western Province and drew with Province again in 1989 at Newlands. This was the one finals victory that has always eluded the team and to this day The Bulls have never managed to win a final at Newlands against their greatest rivals. They were runners-up to the Sharks in the 1990 final at Loftus but won the cup back in 1991 by defeating Transvaal. Northerns, Province and Free State ended tied second after Transvaal on the 1991 Currie Cup log. Due to points difference, Province and Northerns had to slug <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> first semi-final on a Tuesday afternoon and managed to do so by winning 34-21. On the Saturday they had to play Free State in the second semi-final and after trailing at one stage 11-0 {{in the first half and}} with about 20 minutes to go by 20-9, they managed to turn around the match and run out victors 27-23 - fullback (and old Grey College learner) Gerbrand Grobler being the hero with 6 penalties and a conversion! The following Saturday Northern easily won the final 27-15. They also managed to win the Lion Cup (for a second time) with a record victory of 62-6 over The Sharks.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnets 153 and 154 use Greek mythology {{to portray}} the roles that the {{individuals}} have within the love triangle. Both sonnets involve Cupid, the god of love, and Diana, the virgin goddess of hunt. In sonnet 153, Cupid falls asleep, a virgin nymph takes the torch from cupid and tries to extinguish the fire but [...] "she only succeeds in turning the water into a boiling fountain". In Sonnet 154, Cupid falls asleep and the torch is taken by the most beautiful nymph who tries to put <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby well but does not succeed. Drawing from both effects of these actions performed by both nymphs, both sonnets arrive at same conclusion: [...] "Water cannot quench love". In connecting the sonnets to the love triangle, {{there is a sense}} of determination in satisfying ones urges for love for the torch is the phallic symbol according to Levin. No matter how hard these three troubled lovers try to satisfy their urges,their need for love grows stronger. Cupid is the god of love and is in the midst of love just as the young man is in the midst of the love triangle between the poet and the Dark Lady. In sonnet 153, a virgin nymph takes the torch which corresponds to the young man getting engaged to the virgin which [...] "briefly interrupts the cycle of passion and betrayals in the love triangle that the sonnet cycle has traced". The torch still turns the fountain into a boiling fountain and for Levin this portrays the young man's drive to [...] "heat the desire of others". The love triangle will be severed for a certain time and will form again due to the young man's sexual tendencies. In sonnet 154, the most beautiful nymph takes the torch and tries to extinguish the torch in the well and also fails. In sonnet 154,The beautiful nymph is the virgin that will now marry the young man for now [...] "seeing that she can have for herself [...] "that fire" [...] (154.5) that previously she had to share with [...] "many Legions of true hearts" [...] (154.6), seizes [...] "advantage" [...] (153.2) by picking up the young man's brand and quenching it in [...] "the could vallie-fountain of that ground"—that is, in her virgin vagina”. There is still a small possibility that the young man will commit adultery but Levin states that this is also related to Hymen, the God of love. The act of setting the torch in the well indicates that the young man will settle with virgins propositions that is [...] "suggested by her vow, which was to [...] "keep" [...] not maidenhood but [...] "chast life" [...] (154.3)".|$|E

50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{diminishing}} use of Westphalian is the rigorous enforcement of German-only policies in traditionally Low German-speaking areas during the 18th century.
