40|$|INTRODUCTION: The current {{standard}} for arrhythmic risk stratification is electrophysiologic (<b>EP)</b> <b>testing,</b> which, {{due to its}} invasive nature, is limited to patients already known to be at high risk. A number of noninvasive tests, such as determination of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or heart rate variability, have been evaluated as additional risk stratifiers. Microvolt T wave alternans (TWA) is a promising new risk marker. Prospective evaluation of noninvasive risk markers in low- or moderate-risk populations requires studies involving very large numbers of patients, and in such studies, documentation of the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias is difficult. In the present study, we identified a high-risk population, recipients of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and prospectively compared microvolt TWA with invasive <b>EP</b> <b>testing</b> and other risk markers {{with respect to their}} ability to predict recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias as documented by ICD electrograms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety-five patients with a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias undergoing implantation of an ICD underwent <b>EP</b> <b>testing,</b> assessment of TWA, as well as determination of LVEF, baroreflex sensitivity, signal-averaged ECG, analysis of 24 -hour Holter monitoring, and QT dispersion from the 12 -lead surface ECG. The endpoint of the study was first appropriate ICD therapy for electrogram-documented ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia during follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that TWA (P < 0. 006) and LVEF (P < 0. 04) were the only significant univariate risk stratifiers. <b>EP</b> <b>testing</b> was not statistically significant (P < 0. 2). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that TWA was the only statistically significant independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of microvolt TWA compared favorably with both invasive <b>EP</b> <b>testing</b> and other currently used noninvasive risk assessment methods in predicting recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in ICD recipients. This study suggests that TWA might also be a powerful tool for risk stratification in low- or moderate-risk patients, and needs to be prospectively evaluated in such populations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the incidence and prognostic significance of inducible ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and unexplained syncope. BACKGROUNDCurrent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines recommend implantation of internal cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in patients with unexplained syncope in whom either ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF is inducible during electrophysiologic (<b>EP)</b> <b>testing.</b> Although the prognostic significance of inducible monomorphic VT is known, the significance of inducible VF remains undefined. METHODSWe evaluated 118 consecutive patients with CAD and unexplained syncope who underwent <b>EP</b> <b>testing.</b> Sustained monomorphic VT was inducible in 53 (45 %) patients; in 20 (17 %) patients, VF was the only inducible arrhythmia; and no sustained ventricular arrhythmia was inducible in the remaining 45 (38 %) patients. The latter two groups of 65 (55 %) patients make up the study population. RESULTSThere were 16 deaths among the study population during a follow-up period of 25. 3 ± 19. 6 months. The overall one- and two-year survival in these patients was 89 % and 81 %, respectively. No significant difference in survival was observed between patients with and without inducible VF (80 % power to detect a fourfold survival difference). CONCLUSIONSIn 17 % of patients with CAD and unexplained syncope, VF is the only inducible ventricular arrhythmia. Within the limits of this pilot study, long-term follow-up of patients with and without inducible VF demonstrates no difference in survival between the two groups. Therefore, the practice of ICD implantation in patients with CAD, unexplained syncope and inducible VF, especially with triple ventricular extrastimuli, may merit reconsideration...|$|R

40|$|Correct risk {{assessment}} of disease recurrence {{in patients with}} early breast cancer is critically important to detect patients who may be spared adjuvant chemotherapy. In clinical practice this is increasingly done {{based on the results}} of gene expression assays. In the present study we compared the concordance of the 70 -gene signature MammaPrint (MP) with the 12 gene assay EndoPredict (EP). Representative tissue of 48 primary tumours was analysed with the MP during routine diagnostic purposes. Corresponding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was thereafter analysed by the <b>EP</b> <b>test.</b> Risk categories of both tests were compared. 41 of 48 tumours could be directly compared by both tests. Of the 17 MP low risk cases, only 9 were considered low risk by EP (53 % agreement) and of the 24 MP high risk cases, 18 were high risk by EP (75 % agreement). Discrepancies occurred in 14 of 41 cases (34. 1 %). There was only a weak and non-significant correlation between the MP and <b>EP</b> <b>test</b> with an overall concordance of only 66 %. The original therapeutic recommendation was based on the MP and would have been changed in 38 % of the patients following <b>EP</b> <b>test</b> results. 4 patients developed distant metastases. The respective tumours of these patients were all classified as high risk by the EP, but only 3 were classified as high risk by the MP.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the cost {{implications}} of two investigation strategies in patients with unexplained syncope. BackgroundEstablishing a diagnosis in patients with unexplained syncope is complicated by infrequent and unpredictable events. The cost-effectiveness of immediate, prolonged monitoring {{as an alternative to}} conventional diagnostic strategies has not been studied. MethodsSixty patients (age 66 ± 14 years; 33 males) with unexplained syncope and LV ejection fraction > 35 % were randomized to conventional testing with an external loop recorder, tilt and electrophysiologic (<b>EP)</b> <b>testing,</b> or prolonged monitoring with an implantable loop recorder with one-year monitoring. If patients remained undiagnosed after their assigned strategy, they were offered a crossover to the alternate strategy. Cost analysis of the two testing strategies was performed. ResultsFourteen of 30 patients who were being monitored were diagnosed at a cost of $ 2, 731 ± $ 285 per patient and $ 5, 852 ± $ 610 per diagnosis. In contrast, only six of 30 conventional patients were diagnosed (20 % vs. 47 %, p = 0. 029), at a cost of $ 1, 683 ± $ 505 per patient (p < 0. 0001) and $ 8, 414 ± $ 2, 527 per diagnosis (p < 0. 0001). After crossover, a diagnosis was obtained in 1 of 5 patients undergoing conventional testing, compared with 8 of 21 patients who completed monitoring (20 % vs. 38 %, p = 0. 44). Overall, a strategy of monitoring followed by tilt and <b>EP</b> <b>testing</b> was associated with a diagnostic yield of 50 %, at a cost of $ 2, 937 ± $ 579 per patient and $ 5, 875 ± $ 1, 159 per diagnosis.

40|$|AIMS: Patients with {{isolated}} {{left ventricular}} non-compaction (IVNC) {{are at high}} risk for developing ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, no analysis of invasive electrophysiological (EP) findings in these patients has yet been performed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of EP findings in 24 patients with IVNC. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were inducible in nine patients; of these, two patients had sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and two patients had ventricular fibrillation. No specific electrocardiographic or echocardiographic finding was predictive of VT inducibility. Three of the 9 patients with inducible VT experienced ventricular tachyarrhythmias during the follow-up of 61. 4 +/- 50 months, whereas no tachyarrhythmias or sudden deaths were noted in 12 patients without inducible VT during the follow-up of 30 +/- 19 months (3 patients in the latter group were lost to follow-up). Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were inducible in seven patients. CONCLUSION: Our present study provides the first comprehensive analysis of EP findings in patients with IVNC. Ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias can readily be induced in these patients, whereas the inducibility of a sustained monomorphic VT is relatively low.

40|$|American {{psychologist}} Carroll (1981) defined language aptitude as {{an individual}} ability of learning a task when the learner is motivated and has the opportunity of doing so. The teacher can motivate all learners if the lesson is adjusted to every learner’s abilities. In the 50 ies Carroll and Sapon developed the first language aptitude test for learning modern languages (MLAT – Modern Language Aptitude Test) which was used for identifying language learners who learn additional languages faster and more easily than others. In 1967 the same authors adapted the test and developed a new one for the use in primary schools (MLAT-E – Elementary). Until now the instrument MLAT-E has only been adapted for Hungarian, Spanish and Catalonian students, for adaptations to other languages there are no available data. Therefore, the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Education formed a team consisting of three students and three university teachers, who adapted the test and developed a Slovenian version namely The elementary version of the Modern Language Aptitude Test (Slovene: Test za merjenje splošne jezikovne učljivosti za moderne jezike na razredni stopnji abbreviated as SloMLAT-E). The basic purpose of the research was access {{the reliability of the}} adapted test and the behaviour of each test item as well as parts of the test. In the research study 309 students of Year 5 were tested, 158 boys and 151 girls. They all did the SloMLAT-E and the English language proficiency (<b>EP)</b> <b>test</b> while 209 students also performed the test of the backward digit span. The analysis of the learners’ results at the SloMLAT-E show that the Slovenian version of the test is reliable as well as its individual parts. Although it would be necessary to change 22 test items based on the calculations of the indexes of difficulty and indexes of discrimination: nine in the first, two in the second and eleven in the third part of the test. The results show that the level of the language aptitude of the Year 5 students varies. The results also show that there is a strong significant agreement between the learners’ results at the SloMLAT-E and their results at the <b>EP</b> <b>test.</b> The same correlation was found between the learners’ results in the both tests, SloMLAT-E and the <b>EP</b> <b>test,</b> and the grade awarded in English as a school subject. In addition, it was discovered that the girls outperformed the boys on the overall score on the SloMLAT-E. Furthermore, the results show that there is a moderate significant agreement between the learners’ results at the SloMLAT-E and their results at the backward digit span, which indicates that the students who gain more points at the SloMLAT-E have also better memory ability...|$|E

The stockpiles were not hazardous materials as determined by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) extraction procedure (<b>EP)</b> toxicity <b>test.</b> Radium- 226 concentration was 28. 7 pCi/g in slag and 2. 1 pCi/g in background material. Radium- 226 was not leached from the slag. Fluoride concentration was 3. 87 pct in slag, 0. 18 pct in subsurface material under slag, and 0. 08 pct in the background. Slag material permeability was 1. 65 x 10 - 3 cm/s, and subsurface material permeability was 3. 24 x 10 - 6 cm/s. Rain water, trapped in a depression {{on top of the}} east slag stockpile, became seepage water {{at the base of the}} stockpile. Concentrations of EPA toxic elements in seepage water were much less than concentrations from an EPA <b>EP</b> toxicity <b>test</b> on the slag. Twelve elements-Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Cd, AI, and P-had higher concentrations in seepage water than in rain water on top of the slag stockpiles, or in creek water adjacent to stockpile bases, indicating that they were leached from slag stockpiles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background EndoPredict (EP) is a {{clinically}} validated multianalyte gene expression test to predict distant metastasis in ER-positive, HER 2 -negative breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy alone. The test {{is based on}} the combined analysis of 12 genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Recently, it was shown that EP is feasible for reliable decentralized assessment of gene expression. The aim of this study was the analytical validation of the performance characteristics of the assay and its verification in a molecular-pathological routine laboratory. Methods Gene expression values to calculate the EP score were assayed by one-step RT-qPCR using RNA from FFPE tumor tissue. Limit of blank, limit of detection, linear range, and PCR efficiency were assessed for each of the 12 PCR assays using serial samples dilutions. Different breast cancer samples were used to evaluate RNA input range, precision and inter-laboratory variability. Results PCR assays were linear up to C q values between 35. 1 and 37. 2. Amplification efficiencies ranged from 75 % to 101 %. The RNA input range without considerable change of the EP score was between 0. 16 and 18. 5 ng/μl. Analysis of precision (variation of day, day time, instrument, operator, reagent lots) resulted in a total noise (standard deviation) of 0. 16 EP score units on a scale from 0 to 15. The major part of the total noise (SD 0. 14) was caused by the replicate-to-replicate noise of the PCR assays (repeatability) and was not associated with different operating conditions (reproducibility). Performance characteristics established in the manufacturer’s laboratory were verified in a routine molecular pathology laboratory. Comparison of 10 tumor samples analyzed in two different laboratories showed a Pearson coefficient of 0. 995 and a mean deviation of 0. 15 score units. Conclusions The <b>EP</b> <b>test</b> showed reproducible performance characteristics with good precision and negligible laboratory-to-laboratory variation. This study provides further evidence that the <b>EP</b> <b>test</b> is suitable for decentralized testing in specialized molecular pathological laboratories instead of a reference laboratory. This is a unique feature and a technical advance in comparison with existing RNA-based prognostic multigene expression tests. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aspirin {{intolerance}} {{in patients}} with chronic sinusitis is often a cause of early recurrence of symptoms after surgical treatment. This study assesses 84 patients who were tested for acetylsalicylic acid intolerance after presenting with symptoms like chronic rhinosinusitis, sometimes bronchial asthma, coexisting allergies or a history of aspirin sensitivity. Nasal polyposis {{was found in a}} majority of cases, often recurrent after previous surgery. The levels of eicosanoids such as peptido-leukotrienes and prostaglandin E- 2 were analyzed in isolated blood cells and compared with a healthy control group. Aspirin-intolerant patients showed elevated basal levels of peptido-leukotrienes and reduced basal levels of prostaglandin <b>EP</b> <b>Test</b> results were graded in a system ranging from positive (68 %), signifying aspirin intolerance, to borderline (18 %) and negative results (14 %). After screening patients with clinical findings indicating a possible aspirin intolerance, the results of this investigation reveal a strong correlation between the clinical symptomatology and the in vitro parameters of eicosanoid levels in isolated blood cells, indicating the need to induce aspirin tolerance {{to reduce the risk of}} recurrent rhinosinusitis...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} 2011 DLR {{operates}} the High Vacuum Plume Test Facility Göttingen – Electric Thrusters (STG-ET). This electric propulsion (<b>EP)</b> <b>test</b> facility has now accumulated approximately three years of EP-thruster testing experience. Several special features tailored to electric space propulsion testing like a large vacuum chamber mounted on a low vibration foundation, a beam dump target with low sputtering, and a performant pumping system characterize this facility. The vacuum chamber is 12 m long and has a diameter of 5 m. With respect to thruster tests, the design focus is on accurate thrust measurement, plume diagnostics, and plume interaction with spacecraft components. Electric propulsion thrusters have to run for thousands of hours, and with this the facility is prepared for long-term experiments. The present paper gives {{an overview of the}} facility, and describes the vacuum chamber, pumping system, diagnostics, and experiences with these components. After commissioning of STG-ET, the main focus was put on the testing of gridded ion thrusters of radiofrequency ion thruster (RIT) type...|$|E
40|$|The small {{satellite}} "Galileo Galilei" (GG) {{has been}} designed to test the equivalence principle (EP) to 10 (- 17) with a total mass at launch of 250 kg. The key instrument is a di. fferential accelerometer made up of weakly coupled coaxial, concentric test cylinders rapidly spinning around the symmetry axis and sensitive in the plane perpendicular to it, lying at a small inclination from the orbit plane. The whole spacecraft spins around the same symmetry axis so as to be passively stabilized. The test masses are large (10 kg each, to reduce thermal noise), their coupling is very weak (for high sensitivity to differential effects), and rotation is fast (for high frequency modulation of the signal). A 1 g version of the accelerometer ("Galileo Galilei on the Ground"-GGG) has been built to the full scale-except for coupling, which cannot be as weak as in the absence of weight, and a motor to maintain rotation (not needed in space due to angular momentum conservation). GGG has proved: (i) high Q; (ii) auto-centering and long term stability; (iii) a sensitivity to <b>EP</b> <b>testing</b> which is close to the target sensitivity of the GG experiment provided that the physical properties of the experiment in space are going to be fully exploited...|$|R
40|$|The maze {{procedure}} is a surgical alternative for treating drug refractory atrial fibrillation. Although post-maze atrial fibrillation has been noted, slow intraatrial tachycardias {{have not been}} reported. Of 31 maze patients with a mean follow-up of 22 ± 9 months, 6 underwent electro physiologic (<b>EP)</b> <b>testing</b> (9 ± 6 months post-op) for symptoms suggestive of recurrent arrhythmia. ResultsConduction was significantly prolonged through the right compared to the left atrium (167 ± 44 vs 57 ± 10 ms, p < 0. 01). However, right atrial effective refractory periods were normal (237 ± 29 ms). Programmed atrial stimulation induced sustained slow intraatrial reentry in two patients (cycle lengths of 420 and 520 ms) and atrial flutter (cycle length 190 ms) in one patient. The slow reentrant tachycardias were successfully ablated with radiofrequency energy in both patients. Neither patient has experienced a clinical recurrence after 14 and 9 months. Electrograms at successful ablation sites were markedly fragmented during sinus rhythm, with an apparent reversal of near/far-field activation during tachycardia (see figure). ConclusionsSlow intraatrial tachycardias may be observed in symptomatic post-maze patients. Our {{findings are consistent with}} slow conduction and reentry along a line of conduction block. Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be curative for these tachycardias...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of testing the equivalence principle (EP) in the gravitational field of the Earth from the orbits of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites, which are very accurately tracked from ground by laser ranging. The orbital elements that are affected by an EP violation {{and can be used}} to measure the corresponding dimensionless parameter eta are semimajor axis and argument of pericenter. We show that the best result is obtained from the semimajor axis, and it is limited-with all available ranging data to LAGEOS and LAGEOS II-to eta similar or equal to 2 x 10 (- 9), more than 3 orders of magnitude worse than experimental results provided by torsion balances. The experiment is limited because of the non uniformity of the gravitational field of the Earth and the error in the measurement of semimajor axis, precisely {{in the same way as}} they limit the measurement of the product GM of the Earth. A better use of the pericenter of LAGEOS II can be made if the data are analyzed searching for a new Yukawa-like interaction with a distance scale of one Earth radius. It is found that the pericenter of LAGEOS II is 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive to a composition dependent new interaction with this particular scale than it is to a composition dependent effect expressed by the eta parameter only. Nevertheless, the result is still a factor 500 worse than <b>EP</b> <b>tests</b> with torsion balances in the gravitational field of the Earth (i. e. at comparable distance), though a detailed data analysis has yet to be performed. While <b>EP</b> <b>tests</b> with satellite laser ranging are not competitive, laser ranging to the Moon has been able to provide a <b>test</b> of the <b>EP</b> almost 1 order of magnitude better than torsion balances. We show that this is due to the much greater distance of the test masses (the Earth and the Moon) from the primary body (the Sun) and the correspondingly smaller gradients of its gravity field. We therefore consider a similar new experiment involving the orbit of LAGEOS: testing LAGEOS and the Earth for an EP violation in the gravitational field of the Sun. We show that this test may be of interest, though it is a factor 300 less sensitive than in the case of the Moon due to the fact that LAGEOS is closer to the Earth than the Moon and consequently its orbit is less affected by the Sun. The limitations we have pointed out for laser ranging can be overcome by flying in low Earth orbit a spacecraft carrying concentric test masses of different composition with the capability, already demonstrated in ground laboratories, to accurately sense in situ any differential effects between them...|$|R
