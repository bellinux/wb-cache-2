40|$|We {{propose a}} hybrid spin-filter device {{based on a}} silicene nanoribbon. A {{ferroelectric}} polymer grown {{on top of the}} nanoribbon splits spin-up and spin-down electron bands and gives rise to spin polarisation of the conductance. In particular, we study the effects of a random distribution of vacancies on the performance of this spin-filter device. Disorder induces Anderson localisation of electrons and we find that the localisation length strongly depends on the electron spin. By adjusting the Fermi level of the source contact, only electrons with one spin orientation can reach the drain contact because their localisation length is larger than the length of the device. Electrons with opposite spin are largely back-reflected. Electric conductance then becomes spin polarised and the device behaves as a quasi-half-metal. We conclude that a moderate concentration of vacancies has little impact on the spin-filter capabilities of the <b>device,</b> <b>opening</b> the possibility to using it as a tuneable source of polarized electrons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Artificial muscles {{based on}} {{conducting}} polymers, fullerene derivatives, carbon nanotubes, graphenes or other carbon derivative molecular structures are electrochemomechanical actuators. Electrochemical reactions drive {{most of the}} volume variation and the concomitant actuation. So under flow of a constant current, any working or surrounding variable influencing the reaction rate will be sensed by the muscle potential, or by the consumed energy, evolution during actuation. Experimental results and full theoretical description will be presented. The muscle potential is a well defined function of: driving current, volume variation (external pressure or hanged masses), temperature and electrolyte concentration. While working artificial muscles detect any change of whatever of those variables by changing either its potential or its consumed energy evolution. Experimental changes fit those predicted by the theoretical description. Only two connecting wires contain, simultaneously, actuating (current) and sensing (potential) signals.
