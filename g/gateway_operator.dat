50|$|In ENUM {{the number}} holder {{operator}} will typically be the <b>gateway</b> <b>operator</b> or, alternatively, {{will have an}} arrangement with a <b>gateway</b> <b>operator,</b> to whom he will transit the calls.|$|E
50|$|Hence, if the {{registrant}} {{wishes to}} change his initial number holder operator (that might also coincide being his <b>gateway</b> <b>operator)</b> {{there have to be}} provisions for the ENUM number to be ported from the initial operator to other number holder operators.|$|E
50|$|There are 10 {{international}} Internet <b>gateway</b> <b>operators</b> in Thailand.|$|R

50|$|On 16 May 2013 BTRC {{asked the}} {{international}} internet <b>gateway</b> <b>operators</b> {{to reduce the}} upload bandwidth of ISPs by 75% {{in an effort to}} prevent illegal VoIP. There is speculation that the bandwidth reduction is actually an effort to make it difficult for people to upload ‘problematic’ videos, images, TV talk show clips, etc. in the social media.|$|R
50|$|The company {{developed}} an SMS gateway system, called SMSgateway. It was an android application that ran on Android phones and connect a country's local SMS network to the internet. By relaying messages between the SMSwallets and the 37coins server, <b>gateway</b> <b>operators</b> earned a small commission from each transaction that passed through their gateway. There were gateways in over 18 countries.|$|R
40|$|The IRIDIUM {{system is}} a global {{personal}} communications system supported by a constellation of 66 low earth orbit (LEO) satellites {{and a collection of}} earth-based 'gateway' switching installations. Like traditional wireless cellular systems, coverage is achieved by a grid of cells in which bandwidth is reused for spectral efficiency. Unlike any cellular system ever built, the moving cells can be shared by multiple switching facilities. Noteworthy features of the IRIDIUM system include inter-satellite links, a GSM-based telephony architecture, and a geographically controlled system access process. These features, working in concert, permit flexible and reliable administration of the worldwide service area by <b>gateway</b> <b>operators.</b> This paper will explore this unique concept...|$|R
50|$|SmartPTT Radioserver {{provides}} an interface between radio network subscribers and dispatch consoles, and also implements some functionality of the system: interface to radio network via base stations or via IP-connection {{to the radio}} repeaters, telephone interconnect, email <b>gateway,</b> configurable <b>operator</b> profiles to limit their access to the system.|$|R
50|$|The cabinet under Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha, {{the junta}} leader and prime minister, on 30 June 2015 gave {{a green light}} to Thailand's Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) and {{relevant}} agencies {{to move forward with}} plans to implement a Thai single gateway internet {{before the end of the}} 2015 fiscal budget. The plan to reduce internet gateways was initially proposed by Pol Gen Somyot Poompanmoung, the chief of the Royal Thai Police, as a single gateway system makes it easier for state authorities to monitor, filter, delete, and intercept information on the internet that the authorities deem inappropriate. Currently (2015), there are about 10 international internet <b>gateway</b> <b>operators</b> in Thailand. The MICT has been ordered to report the progress on the plan to the cabinet before the end of September 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{numbers were}} created (by design) solely for {{internal}} use by telco operators. These are dialable from the operator console but, absent {{a breach of}} security (such as the blue box cracks of the 1960s and 1970s), are not directly reachable by subscribers. These typically included international <b>gateways,</b> inward <b>operators</b> in distant cities and test or information numbers intended for internal telco use.|$|R
50|$|KAONMEDIA (or KAON Media Co Ltd) is a South Korean {{technology}} company which specialises {{in the development}} and manufacturing of digital connectivity devices (including set-top boxes) and residential <b>gateways</b> for pay-TV <b>operator,</b> broadband operators and telcos. It provides digital broadcasting services to more than 120 operators in 80 countries. The company is based in Sungnam city, South Korea and was founded in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|When someone {{places a}} call to a mobile phone, they dial the {{telephone}} number (also called a MSISDN) associated with the phone user and the call is routed to the mobile phone <b>operator's</b> <b>Gateway</b> Mobile Switching Centre. The Gateway MSC, as the name suggests, acts as the [...] "entrance" [...] from exterior portions of the Public Switched Telephone Network onto the provider's network.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA), in California, {{installed}} {{the first stop}} sign cameras in the United States. The five cameras are located in state parks such as Franklin Canyon Park and Temescal <b>Gateway</b> Park. The <b>operator,</b> Redflex Traffic Systems Inc., is paid $20 per ticket. The fine listed on the citation is $100. In 2010, a class action lawsuit was filed against MRCA.|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of the control system for the ALICE {{experiment}} much emphasis has been put on cyber security. The control system operates on a dedicated network isolated from the campus network and remote access is only granted via a set of Windows Server 2003 machines configured as application <b>gateways.</b> The <b>operator</b> consoles are also separated from the control system by means of a cluster of terminal servers. Computer virtualization techniques are deployed to grant time-restricted access for sensitive tasks such as control system modifications. This paper will describe the global access control architecture, the policy and the operational rules defined. The role-based authorization schema will also be described as well as the tools implemented to achieve this task. The authentication based on smartcard certificates will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|A way {{to merge}} cloud {{computing}} infrastructures with traditional or legacy network deployments, leveraging {{the best in}} both worlds and enabling a logically centralized control. A solution is proposed to extend existing cloud computing software stacks so {{they are able to}} manage networks outside the cloud computing infrastructure, the fog, by extending the internal, virtualized network segments. This is useful in a variety of use cases such as incremental legacy to cloud network migration, hybrid virtual/traditional networking, centralized control of existing networks, bare metal provisioning, and even offloading of advanced services from typical home <b>gateways</b> into the <b>operator.</b> Any organization can develop different drivers' to support new, specific networking equipment, not necessarily tied to a protocol or vendor, and leverage the fog network. Our conceptual solution is prototyped on top of OpenStack, including changes to the API, command-line interface (CLI), and other mechanisms. Test results indicate that there are low penalties on latency and throughput, and provisioning times are reduced in comparison with similar maintenance operations on traditional computer networks.
