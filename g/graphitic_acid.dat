50|$|Graphite oxide, {{formerly}} called graphitic oxide or <b>graphitic</b> <b>acid,</b> is {{a compound}} of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in variable ratios, obtained by treating graphite with strong oxidizers. The maximally oxidized bulk product is a yellow solid with C:O ratio between 2.1 and 2.9, that retains the layer structure of graphite but with a much larger and irregular spacing.|$|E
40|$|Carbon microparticles were {{produced}} from organosolv lignin at 2000 °C under argon atmosphere following oxidative thermostabilisation at 250 °C. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, and electro-conductivity measurements {{revealed that the}} obtained particles were electrically conductive and were composed of large <b>graphitic</b> domains. Poly(lactic <b>acid)</b> filled with various amounts of lignin-derived microparticles showed higher tensile stiffness increasing with particle load, whereas strength and extensibility decreased.

40|$|The evident zoning of the Devonian {{limestone}} facies (e. g. Hladil 1992) in the Moravosilesian {{branch of}} the Lugosilesian oro-cline indicates a distinct polarization between both the paleonorth-ern stable foreland and the advanced accretionary wedge of ac-tive Variscan orogen since the Lower Devonian already. More-over, also Lower Devonian siliciclastic facies on the Brunovis-tulian foreland (continental Old Red-like sandstones and con-glomerates) differs {{from those in the}} Silesicum (littoral and sub-littoral mature marine sandstones, interfingering with mostly with <b>graphitic</b> shales and <b>acid</b> or intermediate volcanites). Along with the occurrences of Silurian rocks near the village of Stínava in the axial zone of the Moravosilesian flysh foredeep, these indi-cate the existence of a different, ”mobile ”, deeper-marine Dra-hany facies of the Devonian and of Rhenohercynian suture zone getting closed later, mainly during the Lower Carboniferous...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 {{adsorption}} {{has been}} measured {{in different types}} of <b>graphitic</b> nanostructures (MWCNTs, <b>acid</b> treated MWCNTs, graphene nanoribbons and pure graphene) in order to evaluate {{the effect of the}} different defective regions/conformations in the adsorption process, i. e., sp 3 hybridized carbon, curved regions, edge defects, etc. This analysis has been performed both in pure carbon and nitrogen-doped nanostructures in order to monitor the effect of surface functional groups on surface created after using different treatments (i. e., acid treatment and thermal expansion of the MWCNTs), and study their adsorption properties. Interestingly, the presence of exposed defective regions in the acid treated nanostructures (e. g., uncapped nanotubes) gives rise to an improvement in the amount of CO 2 adsorbed; the adsorption process being completely reversible. For N-doped nanostructures, the adsorption capacity is further enhanced when compared to the pure carbon nanotubes after the tubes were unzipped. The larger proportion of defect sites and curved regions together with the presence of stronger adsorbent–adsorbate interactions, through the nitrogen surface groups, explains their larger adsorption capacity.

40|$|The term ''interlamellar {{sorption}} " {{was proposed}} by the author in 1948 to designate the penetration of ions and neutral molecules between the layers of a lamellar structure, resulting in a reversible, one-dimensional swelling. The first system of this sort to be studied was <b>graphitic</b> <b>acid</b> (Hofmann et al. 1930), which reversibly takes up layers of water molecules. The phenomenon is mainly met with amongst natural and artificial inorganic substances—in the organic field, a commoner analogous phenomenon is the swelling of polymers by penetration of small molecules between large, chain-shaped mole-cules, although lamellar systems, in some respects analo-gous to the inorganic ones, are met with among proteins and soaps. The interest of the phenomenon {{is partly due to}} th...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Basal spacing {{data for}} neutral amine {{complexes}} with mont-morillonite and vermiculite are explained {{on the basis}} of two layers of fully extended amine molecules inclined at about 65 ~ to (001) with the NH 2 groups closely associated with pairs of silicate oxygen atoms. The molecular orientation is shown to be favourable for good intermolecular packing and for possible NH [...] O bonding, but the results do not constitute proof of such bonding. Pack-ing of the molecules on the silicate surfaces and with respect o each other may explain the formation of double layer complexes. The amine data are correlated with corresponding data for the low-temperature (or below melting point) series of alcohol-montmorillonite complexes and it is suggested that the molecular layers may have some solid-like characteristics. Primary neutral amines form long-spacing complexes with montmorillonite and with <b>graphitic</b> <b>acid</b> (Arag 6 n, Cano Ruiz & MacEwan, 1959) and with vermiculite (Sutherland & MacEwan, 1961; Sutherland, 1962) in which the separation of the sheets corresponds to two layers of molecules oriented more or less normally to the sorbate layers. For <b>graphitic</b> <b>acid</b> (and montmorillonite is said to give 'completely analogous results') the 'actual value of the layer separation is too low to accom-modate two fully extended molecules'. For vermiculite 'the slope of the graph of spacing against chain-length is similar to that found with montmorillonite (about 2. 3 A /C atom) suggesting that here also the orientation of the chains may be per-pendicular to the layers'. The present note shows that the increase of spacing by 2. 3 A /C atom and the overall spacings can be interpreted in terms of two layers fully extended molecules inclined at about 65 ~ to (001), and the resulting model is very similar to that obtained for alcohol-montmorillonite complexes by Brindley & Ray (1964) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{translational}} {{mobility of}} anisometric dissolved polyions {{depends on their}} orientation relative to the direction of motion. If such particles are oriented {{by means of the}} flow gradient in the gap of a Couette apparatus, for example, the electrical conductivity of the solution becomes anisotropic. Measurements in a suitable direction (perpendicular to the plane of flow) enable rod-shaped and disc-shaped particles to be distinguished from one another, merely by the arithmetical sign of the change in conductivity. The “apparent size” of particles can be calculated from the shape of the anisotropic curves plotted against the orienting forces. This is in general larger than the real size, but approaches it as the particle interaction vanishes. Determinations of shape and size are possible even when the particles undergo flow damage. The theory of conductivity anisotropy is tested on a disc-shaped model (<b>graphitic</b> <b>acid)</b> and a rod-shaped model (polyphosphate), and confirmed. Measurements on concentrated cetyl trimethylammonium bromide and sodium oleate sols indicate the presence of rod-shaped micelles...|$|E
40|$|The {{anisotropy}} {{effect of}} the electrical conductivity occurs in solutions of anisometric polyelectrolytes {{under the influence of}} the orienting forces of a velocity gradient. A Couette-type apparatus for the generation of velocity gradients up to 20, 000 sec. − 1 is described which permits measurements of the conductivity in three orthogonal directions. Evaluation of the curves obtained yields shape, size, and stability of the particles. A convenient method for the evaluation on the basis of Schwarz' theory (1, 2) is presented. Furthermore, the size of the particles may be calculated from the relaxation of the conductivity changes after the flow is stopped. The theory is extended to relaxation processes of nonuniform particles, and a method for the evaluation of the relaxation curves is developed which yields the average size and the size distribution of the particle assembly. The range of application of the flow method and the relaxation method is discussed; both methods may be applied to charged particles in the size range between 10 − 5 and 10 − 2 cm. The application is demonstrated on rod-shaped and disc-shaped polyelectrolytes (sodium thymonucleinate and <b>graphitic</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively), and the results are found to be in agreement with electron microscope determinations. The methods proved to be useful for the investigation of the micellar state of amphiphilic substances in solution...|$|E
