The study presents an analytical model that accounts both for the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction</b> in the clutch springs and for the oil squeeze effect between the impacting teeth of the meshing gears. This last dissipative term, generally neglected in the literature, has been modelled by the authors in order to consider its influence on the "gear rattle" phenomenon. The results provided by a wide numerical investigation are presented and enable a qualitative comparison between the effects due to the oil and those due to the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction</b> in the clutch on the rattle level...|$|E

40|$|Passive dampers {{are used}} {{recently}} in many mid and high-rise buildings. This trend is accelerated by the increased demand and desire for safer, more reliable {{and more comfortable}} buildings under uncertain external loading and environment. Viscous, visco-elastic, <b>hysteretic</b> and <b>friction</b> dampers are representatives of passive dampers. Such passive dampers also {{play a key role}} in the implementation of structural rehabilitation which is essential for the realization and promotion of sustainable buildings. The technique of structural health monitoring is inevitable for the reliable and effective installation of passive dampers during the structural rehabilitation or retrofit. The design earthquake ground motions change from time to time when a new class of ground motions (e. g. long-period ground motions due to surface waves) is observed or a new type of damage appears during severe earthquakes. The concept of critical excitation is useful in responding to this change together with the usage of passive dampers from the viewpoint of sustainable buildings and cities. In this paper, a historical review is made on the development of smart or optimal building structural control with passive dampers and some possibilities of structural rehabilitation by use of passive dampers are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, we model <b>hysteretic</b> and <b>friction</b> {{phenomena}} without introducing friction or hysteresis per se. We use {{a combination}} of masses, springs, and dashpots and the frictional phenomena emerge as the result of their interaction. By using physical elements, we can understand the physical mechanisms that lead to hysteretic energy dissipation and phenomena, such as stick-slip behavior and the Stribeck effect. Furthermore, we study the origins of butterfly hysteresis, which arises in optics and ferromagnetism. We define the multiplay model for hysteresis with nonlocal memory, which consists of N mass/spring/dashpot with deadzone elements. The advantage of this model is that its hysteresis map can be inverted analytically. Second, we investigate the origins of stick-slip friction by developing an asperitybased friction model involving the frictionless contact between a body and a row of rigid, rotating bristles. This model exhibits hysteresis and quasi-stick-slip <b>friction.</b> The <b>hysteretic</b> energy-dissipation mechanism is the sudden release of the pivoted bristles. The discontinuous rotating bristle model is an approximation of the rotating bristle model that exhibits exact stick-slip and hysteresis. We next develop an asperity-based friction model in which the vertical motion of the body leads to the Stribeck effect. The <b>friction</b> model is <b>hysteretic</b> and the energy-dissipation mechanism is the sudden release of the compressed bristles. We show that this bristle model is a generalization of the LuGre model. The final contribution of this dissertation is a framework for relating butterflyshaped hysteresis maps to simple hysteresis maps, which are typically easier to model and more amenable to control design. In particular, a unimodal mapping is used to transform simple loops to butterfly loops...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{investigated}} theoretically {{the influence of}} sliding speed and temperature on the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction</b> {{in case of a}} smooth, reciprocating steel ball sliding on smooth rubber plate by finite element method (FEM). Generalized Maxwell-models combined with Mooney-Rivlin model have been used to describe the material behaviour of the ethylenepropylene-diene-monomer (EPDM) rubber studied. Additionally, the effect of the technique applied at the parameter identification of the material model and the number of Maxwell elements on the coefficient of friction (COF) was also investigated. Finally, the open parameter of the Greenwood-Tabor analytical model has been determined from a fit to the FE results. By fitting, as usual, the Maxwell-model to the storage modulus master curve the predicted COF, in a broad frequency range, will be underestimated even in case of 40 -term Maxwell-model. To obtain more accurate numerical prediction or to provide an upper limit for the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction,</b> in the interesting frequency range, the Maxwell parameters should be determined, as proposed, from a fit to the measured loss factor master curve.

40|$|According to {{the most}} recent approaches, the {{friction}} coefficient arising between tyre rubber and road can be seen as constituted by three components: adhesion, deforming hysteresis and wear. This paper deals with the estimation of the <b>hysteretic</b> component of <b>friction.</b> This component is due to indentation phenomena regarding contact mechanics of deformable bodies sliding on the asperities of a rough substrate, which exert oscillating forces at the interface, leading to cyclic deformations of the rubber and then to energy "dissipation" via its internal damping. To evaluate this component, a physical model able to calculate energy dissipation of a rubber block indented by a rigid asperity in sliding contact has been built. To this aim the viscoelastic characteristics of the material have been taken into account. The road profile has been modelled as the sum of two sinusoidal waves characterizing the macro and the micro roughness scales. The results coming out from the physical model have been validated by means both of FEM models results and of experimental tests carried on a pin on disk tribometer...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of the internal friction and the Young’s modulus defect in single crystals of Cu-(1. 3 - 7. 6) at. % Ni have been performed for 7 - 300 K {{over a wide range}} of oscillatory strain amplitudes. Extensive data have been obtained at a frequency of vibrations around 100 kHz and compared with the results obtained for the same crystals at a frequency of ? 1 kHz. The strain amplitude dependence of the anelastic strain amplitude and the average friction stress acting on a dislocation due to solute atoms are also analyzed. Several stages in the strain amplitude dependence of the internal friction and the Young’s modulus defect are revealed for all of the alloy compositions, at different temperatures and in different frequency ranges. For the 100 kHz frequency, low temperatures and low strain amplitudes (? 10 - 7 - 10 - 5), the amplitude-dependent internal friction and the Young’s modulus defect are essentially temperature independent, and are ascribed to a purely <b>hysteretic</b> internal <b>friction</b> component. At higher strain amplitudes, a transition stage and a steep strain amplitude dependence of the internal friction and the Young’s modulus defect are observed, followed by saturation at the highest strain amplitudes employed. These stages are temperature and frequency dependent and are assumed to be due to thermally activated motion of dislocations. We suggest that the observed regularities in the entire strain amplitude, temperature and frequency ranges correspond to a motion of dislocations in a two-component system of obstacles: weak but long-range ones, due to the elastic interaction of dislocations with solute atoms distributed in the bulk of the crystal; and strong short-range ones, due to the interaction of dislocations with solute atoms distributed close to dislocation glide planes. Based on these assumptions, a qualitative explanation is given for the variety of experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|In {{recognition}} of the growing consideration of piezoelectric traveling-wave motors as suitable replacements for small-scale electromagnetic motors, the present work addresses two parallel objectives: (1) to develop an advanced modeling approach for the accurate prediction of steady-state performance of piezoelectric traveling-wave motors, and (2) to improve upon the typical piezoelectric traveling-wave motor configuration by investigating the novel implementation of two-sided operation. Firstly, a performance model of the piezoelectric traveling-wave motor has been developed that accounts for loss at the material level through the integration of complex material constants. In effect, all model parameters {{can be attributed to}} physically relevant properties, and, as demonstrated by the success of several experimental correlation studies, motor performance can be predicted independently of the measured characteristics of an existing device. Other key features of the model include a dynamic rotor model, a <b>hysteretic</b> stick-slip <b>friction</b> contact model, and generalization to accommodate non-ideal traveling-wave excitation. Critical to the cohesion of the model, a mixed-domain formulation combines the ease and accuracy of deriving the nonlinear contact forces in the time domain and the efficiency of equilibrating the modal forces in the frequency domain. (cont.) Secondly, a two-sided motor configuration has been developed that is theoretically capable of doubling the torque and power output of the typical configuration with little or no increase in size or mass. Controlled experimental testing has been performed concurrently on essentially identical one-sided and two-sided prototypes, and the results verify a dramatic performance improvement due to the implementation of two-sided operation. by Timothy Scott Glenn.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a friction model describing the tire-rubber/road interaction {{that takes into}} account the viscoelasticity of the tire rubber, the texture of the road surface and a water layer between the tire/road interface by introducing explicitly a computation of the water layer effect in the calculation process of the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction.</b> The geometry of the wetted portion of the interface model is simplified by transforming it into an equivalent hydrodynamic bearing. Utilizing the Reynolds equation, the bearing load capacity is calculated and the resulting forces are subtracted from the contact load when calculating the forces of the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction.</b> The mechanical behavior of the rubber is represented in the model by Kelvin-Voigt model. The frictional forces due to hysteresis are calculated at any given operating conditions (load, slip speed, etc.) from the contact geometry of rough surfaces caused by the viscoelastic behavior of rubber. To validate the model, a set of surfaces including real pavements and artificially textured slabs were selected covering a wide range of microtexture and macrotexture combinations and the computed and measured friction compared. To describe the contact geometry of rough surfaces using macrotexture and to measure actual friction the Circular Track Meter and the Dynamic Friction Tester devices were used respectively. The friction coefficients computed using the model were compared to the measured friction coefficients. The obtained results are presented in the paper and proved to provide high correlation between the measured and modeled friction. The model is capable to predict wet friction at low as well as high speeds on wet surfaces, thus proving to be capable to take adequately the wetting effect on the variation of friction with increasing speed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{frictional}} behaviour of a tyre tread elementary volume in sliding contact with road asperities. Friction {{is assumed to be}} composed of two main components: adhesion and deforming hysteresis. The target, which was fixed in collaboration with a motorsport racing team and with a tyre-manufacturing company, is to provide an estimation of local grip for online analyses and real-time simulations and to evaluate and predict adhesive and hysteretic frictional contributions arising at the interface between the tyre tread and the road. A way to approximate the asperities, based on rugosimetric analyses on a macroscale and a microscale, was introduced. The adhesive component of friction was estimated by means of a new approach based on two different models found in the literature, whose parameters were identified thanks to a wide experimental investigation previously carried out. The <b>hysteretic</b> component of <b>friction</b> was estimated by means of an energy balance taking into account the viscoelastic behaviour of rubber (which was characterized by means of appropriate dynamic mechanical analysis tests) and the internal stress–strain distribution (which was due to indentations of the road).

40|$|The {{surface texture}} of the {{pavement}} plays {{a very important role}} in driving the frictional properties at the tire rubber-pavement interface. Particularly, the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction</b> due to viscoelastic deformations of rubber depends mainly on the pavement surface texture. In the present paper, the effect of micromechanical pavement surface morphology on rubber block friction was brought in by comparing the friction results for three different asphalt mix morphological surfaces, named stone mastic asphalt (SMA), ultra-thin surfacing (UTS) and porous asphalt (PA). The asphalt surface morphologies of these mixes were captured by using an X-ray tomographer, from which the resulting images micromechanical finite element (FE) meshes for SMA, UTS and PA pavements were developed by means of the SimpleWare software. In the FE model, the rubber and asphalt binder were modeled as viscoelastic (VE) materials and the formulation was given in the large deformation framework. FE simulations were then carried out by using contact algorithm between rubber and the road surface. It was observed that the rubber friction inversely varies with the sliding speed and positively varies with the pressure for all the pavement morphological and stiffness conditions. Furthermore, it was observed that the highly porous pavement surface results in large dissipation of energy, hence, large rubber friction which shows that the mix characteristics of pavements {{have a significant effect on}} rubber friction. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} method is {{developed}} to treat the steady-state vibration of two axisymmetric structures—a base substructure and an attached dampersubstructure—that are driven by traveling wave excitation and that couplethrough a spatially distributed <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction</b> interface. The base substructure is representative of a rotating brake rotor or gear, and the damper is a ring affixed to the base under preload and intended to control vibration through friction along the interface. In the axisymmetric approximation, the equation of motion of each substructure is reduced in order {{to the number of}} nodal degrees of freedom {{through the use of a}} propagation constant phase shift. Despite nonlinearity and with contact occurring at an arbitrarily large number of nodal points, the response duringsticking, or during a combination of sticking and slipping motions, can be determined from a low-order set of computationally tractable nonlinear algebraic equations. The method is applicable to element types for longitudinal and bending vibration, and to an arbitrary number of nodal degrees of freedom in each substructure. In two examples, friction damping of the coupled base and damper is examined in the context of in-plane circumferential vibration (in which case the system is modeled as two unwrapped rods), and of out-of-plane vibration (alternatively, two unwrapped beams). The damper performs most effectively when its natural frequency is well below the base 2 ̆ 7 s natural frequency (in the absence of contact), and also when its natural frequency is well separated from the excitationfrequency...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} activity carried out with the aim to investigate on the adhesive behaviour of visco-elastic materials in sliding contact with road asperities are presented. Experiments are carried out using a prototype of pin on disk machine in which pin is constituted by a specimen of rubber coming from a commercial tire, while different disks are realized in glass, marble, steel and in abrasive paper of different roughness. Tests are performed in {{both dry and wet}} conditions. Roughness of the test surfaces is evaluated by a rugosimeter, while pressure is evaluated, off-line, analysing the extension of the contact patch left by the pin on a sheet of graph paper under known applied loads. Slide velocity is imposed by an inverter controlled motor driving the disk. Basing on well known theoretical hypotheses, adhesive component of friction coefficient is estimated making the specimens slide on surfaces characterized by low values of macro-roughness, in order to underline the differences in rubber behaviour respect to micro-roughness surface variations. The results confirmed adhesion dependence on pressure and sliding velocity in both cases of smooth surfaces, where the main friction mechanism is the adhesive one, and of rough surfaces, where the main friction mechanism is the hysteretic one. Analysing various surfaces roughness it is possible to notice a maximized adhesive contribution on flat surfaces; it reduces with increasing roughness, while <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction</b> comes over instead of it because of asperities penetration into rubber sliding surface. Moreover in the case of rough surfaces the separation between static and dynamic friction coefficient is evident and the static coefficient is greater than the dynamic one. On the other hand in case of smooth surface the absence of indentation phenomena doesn’t allow to recognize, in the measured force time history, the “classical” peak usually associated to the static friction coefficient. Dry and wet tests performed on different micro-roughness profiles highlighted that friction coefficient in dry conditions is greater on smoother surfaces, while an opposite tendency is shown in wet condition, when asperities are greater enough to break the thin water layer, providing a certain degree of indentation. A proposal for a methodology able to estimate the only adhesive friction component, developed thanks to wet contact tests, is expressed in the end of the paper...|$|E
40|$|Friction {{phenomenon}} for elastomeric materials {{has been}} widely studied: experiments show that friction coefficient is function of several parameters, such as sliding velocity, local pressure, contact surfaces roughness, material characteristics and temperature. Many theories hypothesize resistant forces arising at tyre/road interface as constituted by three components: deforming hysteresis, adhesion and wear. Neglecting wear, the other two components are connected and interact reciprocally, whenever basing themselves on different physical mechanisms and acting on different roughness scales; aim of the present work {{is to provide a}} procedure that allows to estimate <b>hysteretic</b> component of <b>friction</b> by means of an indentation model able to calculate stresses and deformations produced by an infinitely rigid sinusoidal indenter in sliding contact with a visco-elastic material. In order to take into account of the phenomena connected with asperities indentation inside tyre tread, it has been necessary to analyze road profiles and to model roughness by means of different magnitude scales; moreover, employing WLF law over these profiles has allowed to analyze rubber master curve both in temperature and frequency domains, providing the dependencies of storage modulus E’ and loss modulus E’’ from sliding velocity and temperature itself. Visco-elastic characteristics of SBR tyre compound, obtained thanks to Dynamic-Mechanical Analysis (DMA) testing machines and to Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) techniques, have been employed as an input for a three dimensional innovative adaptation of the equations provided by YE.

40|$|Good skid {{resistance}} of a pavement surface {{is essential for}} road safety. Loss of {{skid resistance}} can lead to property damage and loss of lives. Ever increasing need of driver safety poses challenges to the highway authorities to evaluate pavement conditions even more precisely under different conditions. Environmental variables like temperature, water, snow etc. can {{have a significant effect}} on the skid resistance apart from the vehicle and pavement related factors. The temperature increase in the tire-pavement contact region results in a complex relationship between the temperature and the friction and constitutes one of the main sources of uncertainty in interpreting the data of continuous field measurements. Likewise, very low friction coefficients can be observed between the tire and pavement surface under wet conditions. Nevertheless, the phenomena have not been adequately quantified yet within the skid resistance evaluation engineering community. The road agencies use correlation factors to estimate frictional characteristics of the road. These correlation factors are based on the experience and field test measurements which have a very limited scope in terms of reliability and transferability. It is the aim of this research is to study the effect of temperature and water on the frictional performance of the asphalt surface, when a pneumatic tire is traversing at given operating conditions. The tire operating temperature is a very important concern to the tire manufacturers, highway agencies and users due to its major influence on the traction performance of a tire. Tire rubber hysteresis is considered to play a major role in countering skidding of a vehicle travelling at high speed. Past studies showed that the contribution from the hysteresis component in comparison to adhesion has a larger influence on the friction measurements. This research aims to develop a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical model in the finite element (FE) framework to determine the progressive temperature development in a pneumatic tire rolling over a simulated asphalt pavement surface mesh and its eventual effect on the <b>hysteretic</b> <b>friction.</b> This research also studies the hysteretic frictional behavior of a test tire under different surrounding temperature conditions. In this methodology, first, the tire is tested under static loading conditions to obtain its overall deformation characteristics and in particular the relation tire load - inflation pressure – foot print. In the second step, rubber material tests are performed to determine the rheological characteristics of the tire tread rubber. The test results are used for the determination of rheological parameters of a tire rubber material in the form of Prony’s coefficients. The Prony’s coefficients are later utilized in the development of a 3 D FE test tire. In the third step, the tire is modelled in the FE framework, accounting for the different components of a tire like tread, side wall, carcass, belts, plies, inner liner, rim etc. The FE simulation results corresponding to the footprint and the deformation are compared with the measurements of static load deflection tests. The FE mesh of a given asphalt pavement surface is developed based on scanned asphalt surface data obtained by a Laser Profilometer and an X-ray tomographer. A dynamic analysis of a tire rolling at a definite slip ratio over a simulated asphalt pavement surface is performed. The results obtained from this analysis are used in the subsequent energy dissipation analysis to determine the heat fluxes. These heat fluxes are the input of a heat transfer analysis to determine the temperature development in the body of a tire. Many past experimental studies showed that the tire-pavement friction values are related to the tire surrounding conditions such as pavement temperature, ambient temperature, contained air temperature and surface characteristic of pavement. Therefore, in this research, the effect of pavement temperature, ambient temperature and contained air temperature on friction measurements is studied. By using the developed FE model, practical test conditions of fully and partially skidding tires traversing over different asphalt pavement surfaces, namely, Porous Asphalt, Ultra-Thin Surface and Stone Mastic Asphalt and AC- 10 are analysed. Emphasis is placed on the determination of tire tread temperature as a critical combination of pavement temperature and ambient temperature. An attempt has also been made to determine the time required for different regions of a rolling tire to reach an effective temperature equilibrated state. Such kind of analysis gives insight into the effect of thermal behaviour of different components of tire on the tire hysteresis which eventually decides its frictional performance. This research also deals with the cornering frictional behaviour of a pneumatic tire. By utilizing the developed FE model, the cornering friction was computed for inflation pressure, wheel load, vehicle speed, side-slip angle, surface texture and mix design. Good pavement macrotexture has a direct influence on the vehicle safety during wet weather conditions by improving its traction/braking ability. Apart from the macrotexture, there are several factors that affect the wet friction, such as, environmental, tire and pavement related characteristics. In recent years, development of powerful finite element tools made it possible to simulate complex wet tire-pavement interaction as close as possible to the actual field conditions. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, none of the past analytical/numerical studies were able to include the asphalt pavement surface texture in their analysis. In the next part of this thesis, the loss of friction under wet/flooded pavement conditions is studied. This research presents an FE approach to study the effect of surface morphology of asphalt pavements on the wet friction coefficient. The wet friction performance of different asphalt surface morphologies of open-graded mix to close-graded mix are studied by using the developed FE model. The tire-wet asphalt surface interaction FE model is duly calibrated with the field investigations conducted by using the state-of-art field equipment. The extreme loss of wet friction which ultimately leads to risk of hydroplaning is also studied. The FE simulations are performed on different water film thicknesses, tread pattern and different tire slip ratios and yaw angles. The results from the current study can be used as safety indicators of in-service asphalt pavements under wet/flooded conditions. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
