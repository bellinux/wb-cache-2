50|$|Braking {{is mainly}} done by <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> {{enabling}} recuperation of the braking energy {{back to the}} electrical grid. If {{there is no need}} of it, the braking energy is being used primarily for feeding the vehicle's auxiliary equipment with the rest depleted in the <b>brake</b> resistors. The <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> is able to automatically run even during grid's voltage failure. In case of failure, braking is automatically done by the system of friction disc brake, which will work until the vehicle comes to a complete halt. The friction disc brake is hydraulically controlled with an electric compression unit. Each bogies is also equipped with a pair of electromagnetic rail brakes with voltage of 24 V DC. The friction disc brake also ensures the parking brake function.|$|R

Mathematical and graphical relationships of <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> taking into account the requirements raised to braking systems in rail transport are presented.

Schematic diagrams of the locomotive braking and ways of controlling the braking force by varying electric circuit parameters are presented.

40|$|Mechanical cryocoolers {{represent}} a sigmficant enabling technology for precision space instruments by providing cryogenic temperatures for sensitive infrared, gamma-ray, and x-ray detectors. However, the vibration {{generated by the}} cryocooler's refrigeration compressor has long {{been identified as a}} critical integration issue. The key sensitivity {{is the extent to which}} the cooler's vibration harmonics excite spacecraft resonances and prevent on-board sensors from achieving their operational goals with respect to resolution and pointing accuracy. To reduce the cryocooler's vibration signature to acceptable levels, a variety of active vibration suppression technologies have been developed and imple-mented over the past 15 years. At this point, nearly all space cryocoolers have active vibration suppression systems built into their drive electronics that reduce the peak unbalanced forces to less than 1 % of their original levels. Typical systems of today individually control the vibration in each of the cryocoolers lowest drive harmonics, with some controlling as many as 16 harmonics. A second vibration issue associated with cryocoolers is surviving launch. Here the same pistons and coldfingers that generate vibration during operation are often the most critical elements in terms of surviving high input accelera-tion levels. Since electrical power is generally not available during launch, passive vibration suppression technologies have been developed. Common vibration damping techniques include <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>braking</b> via shorted motor coils and the use of particle dampers on sensitive cryogenic elements. This paper provides an overview of the vibration characteristics of typical linear-drive space cryocoolers, outlines the history of development and typical performance of the various active and passive vibration suppression systems being used...|$|E
