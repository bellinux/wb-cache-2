5|$|Ambulance Driver â€“ Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance.</b>|$|E

5|$|In game {{three of}} the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Horton {{suffered}} a devastating late hit by Vancouver Canucks defenseman Aaron Rome. Rome received a five-minute major for interference and a game misconduct. Horton was unresponsive as he was carried out on a stretcher and put into an ambulance. He was moving all his extremities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance.</b> He was later diagnosed with a severe concussion and missed {{the remainder of the}} 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. This was arguably the turning point in the series, as the Bruins would go on to win 4 of the next 5 games, and score 21 of the next 25 goals after the hit. Rome was suspended for 4 games. Although Horton missed the remainder of the finals, he was able to hoist the Stanley Cup in Vancouver on June 15 after the Bruins won game 7.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked {{cashmere}} sweater and tailored skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance,</b> but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E

Back at the church, Mulder realizes O'Connor was innocent all along, but Mackey summons snakes who promptly attack Mulder. Luckily, Scully is able to break down the door and save Mulder. Mackey, unfortunately, disappears to Connecticut, changes his name to Reverend Wells, and starts another church. The episode ends with a snake coming out of Mackey's mouth and eating a mouse.|$|E

Buffy calls Giles.

Giles arrives and Buffy tells him not to move the body, shocking herself by using that word.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{discovers that}} Ian's {{restaurant}} {{is on fire}} and goes inside to find Jane in a corridor on the floor struggling to breathe. A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance.</b> At the hospital Abi tells Steven {{he is going to}} be a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E
40|$|Two <b>ambulances</b> from <b>the</b> {{existing}} fleet <b>in</b> Brighton {{and one in}} Hove {{are equipped}} with portable defibrillator-oscilloscope units. Selected attendants have been trained not only to defibrillate patients but also to perform endotracheal intubation and administer intravenous atropine and lignocaine for carefully defined indications. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> two years up to December 1975 <b>the</b> <b>ambulances</b> responded to 2253 calls which were considered possible emergencies. Retrospective analysis showed that half of these had been for patients with myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, or angina. <b>The</b> <b>ambulances</b> took a median time of five minutes to reach a patient. Attempts at resuscitation were made in 207 patients with circulatory arrest, of whom 160 had ventricular fibrillation. Coordinated rhythm was restored at least transiently in 66 patients, and 27 of them survived to leave hospital. Sixteen of the survivors had been in ventricular fibrillation {{before the arrival of}} <b>the</b> <b>ambulance.</b> <b>The</b> delay before admission to hospital was reduced: over 50 % of patients carried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulances</b> were admitted within two hours of the onset of major symptoms. No extra ambulance staff have been employed for the scheme. The increased load on hospital services has been limited by encouraging a rational admission policy and also by early discharge...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to reduce the number}} of people who die from a cardiac arrest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Stockport area <b>ambulances</b> were {{equipped}} with automatic external defibrillator-pacemakers, and ambulance personnel were trained in their use. Over an 18 month period ambulance personnel attended 113 patients in cardiac arrest with these devices. One patient subsequently survived, and three patients survived for up to three days. The reasons for these poor initial results include the failure of bystanders to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a delay <b>in</b> calling for <b>the</b> <b>ambulance,</b> and too few defibrillators being available...|$|R
