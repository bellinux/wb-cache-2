5|$|Spindizzy is an {{isometric}} {{computer game}} released for several 8-bit home computer formats in 1986 by Electric Dreams Software. It features action and puzzle game elements. Players must navigate {{a series of}} screens to explore a landscape suspended in a dimensional space. Development was headed by Paul Shirley, who drew inspiration from Ultimate Play the Game games that feature an <b>isometric</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oblivion can {{be played}} in either a first-or third-person view, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in <b>isometric</b> <b>projection.</b> The player may change the level of {{difficulty}} at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by leveling up.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with the <b>isometric</b> <b>projection</b> game engine known as Filmation II, {{which was used}} previously in Ultimate's 1985 ZX Spectrum game Nightshade. The Filmation engine {{was created by the}} Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery. Filmation II used an image masking technique that drew and filled holes in the background, allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay, despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic Diagrams {{is known}} for using <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> or Z-diagrams to map web sites (Dodge, 1999; Kahn & Lenk, 2001; Kahn, Lenk, & Kaczmarek, 2001), for {{developing}} the software program MAPA (Durand & Kahn, 1998), and for publishing the Information Design Watch blog. The company's work appears in several books on information architecture and information design (see Further Reading).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{coupling}} between the <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> of two square matrices. These two matrices of dimensions m x m and n x n {{are restricted to}} a lower k-dimensional subspace under isometry constraints. We maximize the coupling between these <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> expressed as the trace of {{the product of the}} projected matrices. First we connect this problem to notions such as the generalized numerical range, the field of values, and the similarity matrix. We show that these concepts are particular cases of our problem for special choices of m, n, and k. The formulation used here applies to both real and complex matrices. We characterize the objective function, its critical points, and its optimal value for Hermitian and normal matrices, and, finally, give upper and lower bounds for the general case. An iterative algorithm based on the singular value decomposition is proposed to solve the optimization problem...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of maximizing the coupling between the <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> of two square matrices of dimensions m and n.

5|$|The {{game was}} written by Chris Stamper, and {{graphics}} were designed by Tim Stamper. Alien 8 uses the same image masking technique as Knight Lore, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered <b>isometric</b> <b>projection.</b> The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game's graphics and innovation, however minor criticism was directed at its similarities to Knight Lore.|$|E

500|$|Spindizzy was {{developed}} by Paul Shirley of British video game developer Electric Dreams Software. He was primarily inspired by Ultimate Play the Game games that feature an <b>isometric</b> <b>projection,</b> but was also influenced by the gameplay of the 1984 arcade game Marble Madness. Shirley created an interpreted script to generate the game's levels. The script allowed him to design {{a large number of}} stages using 11KB of storage. The game was originally released for the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC. It was later ported to Atari 8-bit, ZX Spectrum, and Apple II computers. Spindizzy cartridges were promoted as prizes in magazine contests upon its release. American video game company Activision published the game in the United States as part of its [...] "Electric Dreams" [...] series. John Sanderson programmed the Apple II version; Shirley was unaware of the port's existence until the mid-1990s. Spindizzy was later re-released as part of an Activision compilation. The company sold Spindizzys compilation rights not long after obtaining them, which reduced the amount of royalties to Shirley and Electric Dreams. Shirley eventually severed the contract with Activision, citing late royalty payments among other actions he disagreed with.|$|E
2500|$|The Sims is {{the first}} game in the series. Developed by Maxis and {{published}} by Electronic Arts, it was released for Microsoft Windows in February 2000. The game uses <b>isometric</b> <b>projection</b> and features open-ended simulation of the daily activities {{of one or more}} virtual persons ("Sims") in a suburban area near SimCity. Seven expansion packs and two bonafide deluxe editions with exclusive content have been released for this game. It was repackaged in several different formats, and different versions of it were released on several different platforms. By March 22, 2002, The Sims had sold more than 11.3 million copies worldwide, surpassing Myst as the best-selling PC game in history. [...] The original game, all seven expansion packs, and the two exclusive deluxe edition content packs constitute the first generation of the series on the PC. All PC releases in this generation were developed by Maxis.|$|E
50|$|Once common, <b>isometric</b> <b>projection</b> {{became less}} {{so with the}} advent of more {{powerful}} 3D graphics systems, and as games began to focus more on the action and on individual characters.

40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Langley Research Center Storm Hazards Program, 111 {{thunderstorm}} penetrations {{were made}} in 1981 with an F- 106 B airplane in order to record direct-strike lightning data and the associated flight conditions. Ground-based weather radar measurements in conjunction with these penetrations were made by NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma and by NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. In 1981, the airplane received 10 direct lightning strikes; in addition, lightning transient data were recorded from 22 nearby flashes. Following each flight, the airplane was thoroughly inspected for evidence of lightning attachment, and the individual lightning attachment points were plotted on <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> of the airplane to identify swept-flash patterns. This report shows the strike attachment patterns that were found, and tabulates the flight conditions {{at the time of}} each lightning event.

40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Langley Research Center Storm Hazards Program, 69 {{thunderstorm}} pentrations {{were made}} in 1980 with an F- 106 B airplane in order to record direct strike lightning data and the associated flight conditions. Ground based weather radar measurements in conjunction with these penetrations were made by NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma and by NASA Wallops Flight Center in Virginia. In 1980, the airplane received 10 direct lightning strikes; in addition, lightning transient data were recorded from 6 nearby flashes. Following each flight, the airplane was thoroughly inspected for evidence of lightning attachment, and the individual lightning attachment points were plotted on <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> of the airplane to identify swept flash patterns.

40|$|The direct {{lightning}} strike data and associated flight conditions recorded from 1980 to 1983 during 742 thunderstorm penetrations with a NASA F- 106 B in Oklahoma and Virginia are studied {{with an emphasis}} on aircraft protection design. The individual lightning attachment spots were plotted on <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> of the aircraft to identify lightning entry and exit points and swept flash patterns. The altitudes, ambient temperatures, turbulence, and precipitation at which the strikes occurred are summarized and discussed. It was noted that peak strike rates (0. 81 strikes/min and 3 strikes/penetration) occurred at altitudes between 11 km and 11. 6 km corresponding to ambient temperatures between - 40 C and - 45 C. The data confirmed that initial entry and exit points most frequently occur at aircraft extremities, in this case the nose boom, the wing tips, the vertical fin cap, and the afterburner. The swept-flash attachment paths and burn marks found in this program indicate that the mid-span areas of swept aircraft may be more susceptible to lightning than previously thought. It was also found that {{lightning strike}}s may attach to spots within the engine tail pipe...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{operates at}} the intersection of music and spatial design within the context of improvised digital drumming. We outline a creative design research project founded on a series of affordance experiments that explore {{the ways in which the}} tools of spatial design can inform understandings of &# 039;referent (Pressing 1987) &# 039; improvised patterns and phrases employed by experienced drummers. We outline the stages and process of development of a parametric computational framework using software from the spatial design industry to provide affordance (Gibson 1979) to understanding the complexities of drum improvisation. The &# 039;ImprovSpace&# 039; Grasshopper script, operating within Rhino 3 DTM enables the 3 D spatialization of digital drum-based improvisations wherein the parameters of drum notes, duration and velocity all can be flexibly manipulated. Drum phrases and patterns can be compared individually and clusters of repeated elements can be found within a larger corpus of improvisations. The framework enables insights into the specific attributes that constitute individual style including micro-timing, rubato and other elements of style. It is proposed that, by bringing these improvisations into visual and spatial domain in plan, elevation and <b>isometric</b> <b>projections,</b> a theoretic musico-perspectival hinge may be deconstructed that provides insights for visually and spatially dominant musicians within reflective, educational and other contexts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} project-based {{learning in}} a freshman engineering course entitled, Engineering Graphics and Design at Loyola Marymount University. The major course requirement is {{to design and}} build a solid model of a real-world product. The course has been recently modernized {{to meet the challenges}} of conceptual design using graphics tools. The course introduces the students through a hands-on design projects. The engineering graphics topics include orthographic views, <b>isometric</b> <b>projections,</b> sectional views and dimensioning. Computer-Aided Drafting tools such as AutoCAD, Inventor and SolidWorks are introduced for both 2 D and 3 D. The CAD tools are also used for geometric analysis (Cosmos/M) and building solid models by rapid prototyping. The projects are conducted in student teams. The students utilize both written and verbal communication skills when they complete their projects. The work is written-up in a final report, and their results are given in an oral team presentation. The goal of this paper is to describe and discuss the project-based learning in our freshman engineering graphics course. The evaluation of student learning will also be discussed. This paper will describe how projects and teams are selected, the team dynamics, project leadership and conflict resolution as they relate to each team. Several real-world projects such as design and prototyping of Boeing 737 aircraft, a functional flashlight will be described. This paper will also discuss the assessment tools for evaluating the team-based projects...|$|R

5000|$|The temple faces west, with slight {{deviation}} to {{the south}} that enables the setting sun's rays to fall on the main idol in the temple. The plinth measures 55.5 ft, about 9 ft above the bottom step (called the moon stone) of the shrine. In the nine squares layout, the Vishnu temple {{is in the middle}} square. Four stairways outside the platform provide access to the temple. However, as per excavation details, combined with the two small shrines with the central shrine seen now, the layout of the temple has been interpreted to represent a typical Panchayatana style of the temples of North India. The total height of the shrine based on <b>isometric</b> <b>projections</b> is about 45 ft. Provision of porches has not been corroborated but some analogous comparison with the Varaha temple (boar incarnation of Vishnu) in the fort precincts, which belonged to the same period, suggests the existence of porticoes even in the Vishnu temple. Further, a later date Kuriya Bira temple about 2 mi {{to the south}} of the Vishnu temple, has been cited to substantiate that this temple had a mandapa around a small shikara shrine. The Gupta temple was a [...] "shikara" [...] type of temple, built in a straight edged pyramid shape, but this cannot be fully established by existing evidence. However, the supporting features of copings and amalakas (a bulbous stone finial), support the theory that a shikara existed as part of the main shrine. It was finally concluded that the elegant and auspicious Deogarh temple tallied with the description provided for the Sarvatobhadra temple in the ancient treatise of Vishnudharmottara Purana. The Vishnu temple's uniqueness has been expressed succinctly by archaeologist Percy Brown, in these words: When complete, this building was unquestionably one of rare merit in the correct ordering of its parts, all alike serving the purpose of practical utility, yet imbued with supreme artistic feeling. Few monuments can show such a high level of workmanship, combined with a ripeness and rich refinement in its sculptural effect as the Gupta temple at Deogarh.|$|R
5000|$|Zaxxon, {{a shooter}} {{introduced}} by Sega in 1982, {{was the first}} game to use <b>isometric</b> axonometric <b>projection,</b> from which its name is derived. Though Zaxxon's playing field is semantically 3D, the game has many constraints which classify it as 2.5D: a fixed point of view, scene composition from sprites, and movements such as bullet shots restricted to straight lines along the axes. It {{was also one of}} the first video games to display shadows. The following year, Sega released the first pseudo-3D isometric platformer, Congo Bongo. Another early pseudo-3D platform game released that year was Konami's Antarctic Adventure, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. It was one of the earliest pseudo-3D games available on a computer, released for the MSX in 1983. That same year, Irem's Moon Patrol was a side-scrolling run & gun platform-shooter that introduced the use of layered parallax scrolling to give a pseudo-3D effect. In 1985, Space Harrier introduced Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them.|$|R
