500|$|The episode {{opened to}} laudatory reviews from the {{television}} critic community, with much praise reserved for John Slattery's direction and the acting work of Vincent Kartheiser. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, his highest grade for the season so far, calling it [...] "transfixing and incredible" [...] and [...] "season five's first instant classic". He praised {{the symbol of the}} dripping faucet as well as the editing choices that suggested [...] "the way that time passes, so that <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> as if you’ve lost yourself in the mists of your own life". Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, exalted Slattery's [...] "strong command of the comedic moments", and recognized that [...] "most of the carnage" [...] of the episode [...] "comes out of failed attempts by Pete, Lane and Ken to be more than they are by building bridges from one world to another." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps {{rated the}} episode an A-, finding it [...] "almost like an {{extension}} of the pilot". Phipps felt the scene featuring Mulder's kidnapping to be [...] "one of the scariest moments from the series' early days, as much for what it suggests as for what it shows". Writing for website Den of Geek, Matt Haigh reviewed the episode positively, praising its decision not to answer all of the questions that it asks. Haigh noted that [...] "the fact that we are left as clueless about what really happened as Mulder and Scully only enhances the viewing experience", finding such mystery to be [...] "a rare thing indeed" [...] on network television. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, finding it to be [...] "much more confident in its pacing and tone" [...] than the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was [...] "a skilfully scripted story of cover-up and paranoia", and noted that [...] "it sets up the overall themes of the show so well, <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> like a primer".|$|E
500|$|Fashion {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its direction, screenplay, cinematography, music and performances. Kriti Verma of Headlines India rated the film 4 out of 5, describing it as [...] "an outstanding film and a must watch {{for people who}} visit a theatre for something more than entertainment". Zee News gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5, called it [...] "a must watch" [...] and praised the sets, music, performances and storyline. Nikhat Kazmi rated the film 3.5 out of 5, describing it as [...] " [...] a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment". Taran Adarsh rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praised the cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, costumes and styling, and called Fashion a [...] "hard-hitting film that enlightens you, moves you, motivates and deflates you, even shocks and surprises you and of course, entertains you". Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director’s own film Page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity {{for the sake of}} exaggerated drama". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that [...] "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it’s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. Ditto for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> <b>seems</b> like an effortless delivery. It's...Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person. Kitu Gidwani, as the agency head who mentors our protagonist, Kitu strikes all the right notes, never once slipping out of character." ...|$|E
