He also did not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> {{location}} in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, {{the presence or absence of}} an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E

Monoclonal antibodies are those that were produced in identical cells, often artificially, and so share the same target object. They have {{a wide range of}} applications including medical uses.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continue}} their struggling {{investigation into the}} murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson. Bayliss wants to question an arabber who he maintains is the killer, but Pembleton believes that lead has already been exhausted. Pembleton instead pursues a theory posed by Felton (Daniel Baldwin) that Watson was killed one day earlier than they first believed, and rigor mortis was slowed because her body was stored in a cool place. Felton and Pembleton <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> possible suspect who lived near the murder scene, and learn his car was impounded shortly after her body was found. As they search impound lots for the car, the two detectives bicker {{with each other and}} Pembleton accuses Felton of racism.

The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases.

The nonspecific esterase stain is used to <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted that, while it had {{the appearance of a}} planetary nebula, the measured velocity of expansion was much too large to belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Jones and Mutt are {{captured}} by Mac and the Soviets {{and taken to}} their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who reveals that Mutt is Jones' son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit, to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones' trust, and Jones' team fights {{its way out of}} the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets to fall from a cliff, and they survive three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} the method was used nationally to <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> murder suspect. Detectives traced more than 1,000 vehicles and tested 5,000 drivers. On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping them with their inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that the suspect was English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police. He was subsequently identified as Stuart Morgan, a 36-year-old self-employed lorry driver, who on 21 February was remanded following an appearance at Redditch magistrates.|$|E
5|$|Preventing Aβ {{aggregation}} is {{a promising}} method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a literature review article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated {{the dynamics of}} Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales {{of the order of}} tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used {{the results of this study}} to <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E
