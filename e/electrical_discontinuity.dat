50|$|Transient Earth Voltages (TEVs) are {{induced voltage}} spikes {{on the surface}} of the {{surrounding}} metalwork. TEVs were first discovered in 1974 by Dr John Reeves of EA Technology. TEVs occur because the partial discharge creates current spikes in the conductor and hence also in the earthed metal surrounding the conductor. Dr John Reeves established that TEV signals are directly proportional to the condition of the insulation for all switchgear of the same type measured at the same point. TEV readings are measured in dBmV. TEV pulses are full of high frequency components and hence the earthed metalwork presents a considerable impedance to ground. Therefore, voltage spikes are generated. These will stay on the inner surface of surrounding metalwork (to a depth of approximately 0.5 µm in mild steel at 100 MHz) and loop around to the outer surface wherever there is an <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in the metalwork. There is a secondary effect whereby electromagnetic waves generated by the partial discharge also generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork - the surrounding metalwork acting like an antenna. TEVs are a very convenient phenomenon for measuring and detecting partial discharges as they can be detected without making an electrical connection or removing any panels. While this method may be useful to detect some issues in switchgear and surface tracking on internal components, the sensitivity is not likely to be sufficient to detect issues within solid dielectric cable systems.|$|E

It is found that, when phenomenon dimensions are small by comparison with the earth's radius, the earth may be approximated by a plane, horizontal half-space by which electromagnetic energy is reflected with nearly 100 % efficiency from the surface.

40|$|With the {{constant}} scaling of semiconductor devices, reliability {{of these devices}} is a huge concern. One of the biggest reliability issues is a phenomenon known as electromigration (EM) [1] [2]. Electromigration is the transport of material caused by the gradual movement of the ions in a conductor due to the momentum transfer between conducting electrons and diffusing metal atoms [27]. The damage induced by electromigration appears as the formation of voids and hillocks, resulting in <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> Based on previous Electromigration research [15], I have created a tool chain that identifies where electromigration is {{likely to occur in}} large-scale integrated circuits. Using this tool chain, it is possible to identify the mean-time to failure (MTTF) of several common and high priority circuits such as complex adders and memories. Furthermore, this tool chain allows designers to isolate weak-points in these circuits to improve the overall MTTF of the circuit. The result is that with a few simple changes, circuits can be redesigned to increase the MTTF, at minimal cost to the system...|$|E

Among the alternatives intensively investigated is the use of two-dimensional arrays of silicon nanocrystals embedded in thin SiO 2 layers as a distributed charge storage medium to replace the polycrystalline silicon floating gate in a conventional memory cell. Semiconductor nanocrystal memories offer important advantages related to the possibility to use thinner tunneling oxides, due to the <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> of the charge storage medium. These are: a) faster write-erase times, b) smaller degradation, c) better compatibility with ULSI scaling and d) lower operating voltages and lower power consumption.

40|$|Silver {{nanowire}} transparent electrodes {{have recently}} received much attention {{as a replacement}} for indium tin oxide (ITO) for use in various electronic devices such as touch panels, organic solar cells, and displays. The fabrication of silver nanowire electrodes on glass substrates with a sheet resistance as low as 9 Ω/□ and 90 % optical transparency at 550 nm is demonstrated. These resistance and transparency values match that of commercially available indium tin oxide and are superior to other alternatives such as carbon nanotube electrodes. The nanowire electrodes are low cost and easy to fabricate. Moreover, by depositing nanowire films on plastic substrates, mechanically flexible electrodes are obtained. The silver nanowire electrodes are integrated into several electronic devices: transparent heaters, organic solar cells, and switchable privacy glass. The concerns about the suitability of silver nanowire electrodes for use in commercial electronic devices are discussed. High surface roughness, one of the major concerns, is addressed by introducing a new method of embedding silver nanowires in a soft polymer. The instability of silver nanowire electrodes under current flow is also demonstrated for the first time. It is shown that silver nanowire electrodes fail under current flow after ass little as 2 days. This failure is caused by Joule heating which causes the nanowires to break up and thus create an <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in the nanowire film.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide insight into the time course of electrical, physical and mechanical changes in ablation catheters after use that may affect the safety and efficacy of the ablation procedure. Background. An increasing number of institutions are reusing deflectable ablation catheters. At present, there are no data concerning the safety of reusing ablation catheters. Methods. Over a period of 1 year, 69 Webster/Mansfield deflectable catheters used in 336 ablation procedures were prospectively studied. An additional 18 new catheters were tested after multiple sterilisations only. The catheters were evaluated for electrical and physical integrity and mechanical capabilities. These include deflection at room temperature and 37 °C, shaft compression and buckling during deflection, tip craters, torquing ability, glue separation and tip attachment using a stereoscope at x 30 magnification and electrical resistance for each electrode. After each use, the catheters were gas-sterilized with ethylene oxide. Results. The most common reasons for catheter rejection were tip electrode glue separation after 43 ± 4. 3 uses and loss of deflection after 5. 0 ± 3. 3 uses. <b>Electrical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> between the catheter handle and electrodes was observed after 10. 0 ± 3. 7 uses. There was no significant decrease in catheter torquing ability with repeated use. In this study the total estimated savings was $ 128, 133, which includes the cost of catheter reprocessing. The reuse of Webster/Mansfield ablation catheters has not resulted in any major catheter failure or any major adverse clinical complications. Conclusions. On the basis of these observations, we believe that the Webster/Mansfield catheter can be reused an average of five times. It is strongly recommended that after each use catheters be carefully examined under appropriate magnification (x 30) and that special attention be given to the ablation tip electrode. The catheters should also be tested for deflection and electrical integrity...|$|E
40|$|Interconnects are {{responsible}} for mechanical and electrical connection of electronic components, and they are essential {{in the operation of}} electronic components. Stress-induced substances can degrade interconnect properties and functions because they exert stress conditions such as chemical stress to interconnects. Chemical stress from moisture or contaminants causes corrosion to interconnects, and as a result interconnect failures occur in which the interconnects cannot conduct the intended functions. Since interconnect failure disturbs the connection between electronic components, it can cause ensuing failures such as electronic failures. Many approaches have been developed to detect interconnect degradation and prevent ensuing failures. In industrial fields, approaches to detect interconnect failure based on DC resistance have been widely used since DC resistance can capture <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> However, approaches based on DC resistance have a problem because they usually require additional sensing devices or circuitries. This study introduces a new approach to interconnect failure detection using digital signals. The proposed method using digital signals detects interconnect failures without additional sensing devices. Interconnect failure detection can be conducted by monitoring and analyzing the signal characteristics of the transmitted signal because digital signal is continuously generated and transmitted in electronics to control the electronic components and communicate between the components, and also because digital signal is in high-speed, the characteristics of the transmitted digital signal is deteriorated by physical damages on transmitted circuitries such as corrosion on interconnects. We designed accelerated life tests (ALT) of interconnects under chemical stress in order to demonstrate failure detection capability. While solder joints were exposed to chemical stress and corroded gradually, the digital signal characteristics were monitored with DC resistance simultaneously and analyzed by Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to determine the times-to-failure of the solder joints. The test results demonstrated that the proposed approach based on digital signal can detect interconnect failures earlier than the DC resistance, which means that the proposed approach can enable electronic components to detect interconnect failures by themselves. clos...|$|E
40|$|Soil cracks, whose {{formation}} {{are associated}} to natural climate phenomena such as swelling and shrinking, {{play an important}} role in water and gas transfers. Up to now, their 3 D structure was characterised either by serial sections (Cousin, 1996) which is a destructive technique or X-ray tomography (Macedo et al., 1998) which is applicable on limited size sample. Three-dimensional electrical resistivity prospecting enables now to monitor crack development and to characterise their geometry without any destruction of the medium under study. Three-dimensional electrical resistivity surveys are commonly gathered by a network of in-line survey arrays, such as Wenner, Schlummberg, or dipole-dipole (Xu and Noel, 1993; Zhou et al., 2002). As emphasized by Meheni et al. (1996) the resulting apparent resistivity maps are often different depending on the array orientation related to an <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> Chambers et al. (2002) underline that in heterogeneous medium 3 D electrical resistivity model resolution was sensitive to electrode configuration orientation. Indeed asymmetric bodies or anisotropic material exhibit different behaviours depending on whether the current passes through them in one direction or in another (Scollar et al., 1990). It would be all the more true for medium having very contrasted resistivities like cracking soil. In that case the electrical current does not encounter the same resistance when it passes perpendicular or parallel to the resistant bodies. Measurements of apparent resistivity depend then on the location and orientation of the current source relative to the body under study (Bibby, 1986). Studies conducted by Habberjam and Watkins (1967) emphasized that the square array provide a measurement of resistivity less orientationally dependent than that given by a in-line array investigation. Intending to lead a more 3 D accurate inversion, we have chosen to focus our attention on a 3 D electrical resistivity data acquisition. We present here a three-dimensional electrical survey carried out by a square array quadripole for characterising the soil cracks network developing during a desiccation period...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{construction}} of the 1. 54 GeV damping ring in KEK Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) is in progress. The purpose of the ring is to study the multi-bunch-beam operation with a low emittance to realize the future linear collider.

The kicker magnets are designed to operate with 60 nsec field rise time and with 4. 6 mrad kick angle [1, 2]. Ceramic chambers in kickers are used to avoid the shielding of a fast-changing magnetic field by a metallic beam pipe.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Corrosion {{of steel}} cables and {{reinforcing}} steel in concrete structures {{is a major}} cause of structural deterioration. The current methods for corrosion detection suffer from several significant drawbacks. In this paper, a nondestructive evaluation technique is developed that is capable of determining the location and severity of corrosion of embedded or encased steel rebar and cables. This technique utilizes time domain reflectometry (TDR), which has been traditionally used to detect <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuities</b> in transmission lines. By installing a sensor wire along side steel reinforcement, the reinforcement can be modeled as an asymmetric, twin-conductor transmission line. Physical defects of the reinforcement, such as abrupt pitting corrosion, general surface corrosion, and grouting voids, will change the electromagnetic properties of the line. They can be modeled analytically, and identified using TDR. TDR measurement results from several fabricated bridge cable sections with built-in defects are reported. Based on the initial results, the TDR corrosion detection method has proven to be more robust than the existing methods because it allows one to detect, locate and identify the extent of corrosion damage...|$|R
40|$|The {{developing}} use {{of carbon}} fibre composite(CFC) material in aerospace applications, {{due to its}} high specific strength and stiffness has brought an urgent need to revise engineering techniques that are based predominantly on metals. High performance structural adhesives are used to bond CFC panels together, though the performance characteristics of bonded joints in CFC panels differ considerably from those of bonded joints in metal and alloy panels, {{particularly with regard to}} the electrical characteristics. Poorly conducting bonded joints would seriously compromise the electromagnetic integrity of an airframe. The aim of this research project was to measure the electrical and mechanical properties of one such adhesive, Redux 319 A, used in the aircraft industry.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacture involves an electrolytic copper deposition stage for consolidation of conductive circuit paths. Miniaturisation trends requiring increased circuit densities and high aspect ratio through-holes are restricted by the phenomenon of non-uniform copper electrodeposit thickness which can affect electrical impedance properties of the circuitry, cause <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuity</b> between adjoining circuit layers and inhibit component-lead insertion. This thesis considers means of enhancing the electrodeposition process to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Following {{a comprehensive review of}} process technology, both a novel electrolyte agitation method utilising eductors and a Periodic Pulse Reverse (PPR) current technique were investigated experimentally within a pilot tank containing 350 litres of electrolyte. Eductor agitation was analysed/optimised using high-speed photography and a mass transport mapping technique. Data for agitation configurations were verified by statistical analysis of thickness distributions across high surface-area panels. PPR current was initially studied with a small-scale pulse unit and Assaf Cell throwing power test, followed by pilot tank trials using a full-size pulse rectifier in conjunction with eductor agitation and a proprietary electrolyte containing additives. Through-hole throwing power, deposit morphology and microstructure were investigated under various low-frequency pulse conditions and anodic-to-cathodic current density ratios. Eductor agitation and PPR current were compared against the more widely used air agitation and direct current techniques. The effects of air agitation on electrolyte conductivity and commercially produced PCBs were also considered. Optimum agitation conditions were achieved using eight eductors inclined at 37. 5 ° from the horizontal and spaced equidistantly along longitudinal tank walls. Such conditions decreased the standard deviation of copper thickness measured on high surface area panels and lessened edge-effects. Consistent agitation levels up to ten times greater than static solution were recorded, providing enhanced deposition rates; by comparison, air agitation achieved levels of around seven times in uniform regions. Conductivity data showed good correlation with a theoretical approach; air agitation was found to reduce conductivity in proportion to the voidage fraction of gas bubbles and by 20 - 30...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe low-viscosity {{layer in}} the upper mantle, the asthenosphere, is a {{requirement}} for plate tectonics 1. The seismic low velocities and the high electrical conductivities of the asthenosphere are attributed either to subsolidus, water-related defects in olivine minerals 2, 3, 4 or to a few volume per cent of partial melt 5, 6, 7, 8, but these two interpretations have two shortcomings. First, {{the amount of water}} stored in olivine is not expected to be higher than 50 parts per million owing to partitioning with other mantle phases 9 (including pargasite amphibole at moderate temperatures 10) and partial melting at high temperatures 9. Second, elevated melt volume fractions are impeded by the temperatures prevailing in the asthenosphere, which are too low, and by the melt mobility, which is high and can lead to gravitational segregation 11, 12. Here we determine the electrical conductivity of carbon-dioxide-rich and water-rich melts, typically produced at the onset of mantle melting. Electrical conductivity increases modestly with moderate amounts of water and carbon dioxide, but it increases drastically once the carbon dioxide content exceeds six weight per cent in the melt. Incipient melts, long-expected to prevail in the asthenosphere 10, 13, 14, 15, can therefore produce high electrical conductivities there. Taking into account variable degrees of depletion of the mantle in water and carbon dioxide, and their effect on the petrology of incipient melting, we calculated conductivity profiles across the asthenosphere for various tectonic plate ages. Several <b>electrical</b> <b>discontinuities</b> are predicted and match geophysical observations in a consistent petrological and geochemical framework. In moderately aged plates (more than five million years old), incipient melts probably trigger both the seismic low velocities and the high electrical conductivities {{in the upper}} part of the asthenosphere, whereas in young plates 4, where seamount volcanism occurs 6, a higher degree of melting is expected...|$|R

Thirty-six aluminum flat-plate {{transmission lines}} submerged in a water dielectric deliver a timed electrical pulse from coaxial tube sections to a ring stack section. Each of the lines are electrically isolated from each other by transit-time effects. The water-lines are configured radially at four vertical levels. Each level has nine sets of bi-plates, with a transition section that is unique to that level. Mechanically, the bi-plate sections are designed to carry both static and dynamic loads.

40|$|Reliability of high {{resolution}} airborne and shipborne magnetic surveys depends on accurate removal of temporal variations from the recorded total magnetic field intensity data. At mid latitudes, {{one or a}} few base stations are typically located within or near the survey area and are used to monitor and remove time dependent variations. These are usually assumed to be of external origin and uniform throughout the survey area. Here we investigate the influence on the magnetic base station correction of the time varying magnetic field variations generated by internal telluric currents flowing in anomalous regional 2 D/ 3 D conductivity structures. The study is based on the statistical analysis of a data set collected by four magnetovariational stations installed in northwestern Italy. The variometer stations were evenly placed with a spacing of about 60 km along a profile roughly parallel to the coastline. They recorded the geomagnetic field from the beginning to the end of April 2005, with a sampling rate of 0. 33 Hz. Cross-correlation and coherence analysis applied to a subset of 125 five hours long magnetic events indicates that, for periods longer than 400 s, there is an high correlation between the horizontal magnetic field components at the different stations. This indicates spatial uniformity of the source field and of the induced currents in the 1 D Earth. Additionally, the pattern of the induction arrows, estimated from single site transfer functions, reveals a clear electromagnetic signature of the Sestri-Voltaggio line, interpreted as a major regional tectonic boundary. Induced telluric currents flowing through this 2 D/ 3 D <b>electrical</b> conductivity <b>discontinuity</b> affect mainly the vertical magnetic component at the closer locations. By comparing this component at near (32 km) and far (70 km) stations, we have found that the mean value of the power spectra ratio, due to the electromagnetic induced field, is about 1. 8 in the frequency band ranging from 2. 5 × 10 − 3 to 5. 5 × 10 − 5 Hz. This energy, folded in the spatial domain of an hypothetical survey in this region produces unwanted noise in the dataset. Considering a fifth of nyquist frequency the optimal tie-line spacing to assure complete noise removal would be 1 km and 15 km for a rover speed of 6 knots (marine magnetic survey) and 100 knots (aeromagnetic survey) respectively.
