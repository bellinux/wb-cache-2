Shabazz suffered burns over 80 {{percent of}} her body, and remained in intensive care for three weeks, at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. She underwent five skin-replacement operations as doctors struggled to replace damaged skin and save her life. Shabazz died of her injuries on June 23, 1997. Malcolm Shabazz was sentenced to 18 months <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> detention for manslaughter and arson.|$|E

40|$|Biochemical {{composition}} of the muscle of juveniles belonging to 18 different species of freshwater fishes showed that the protein percentage <b>in</b> <b>juveniles</b> was higher than the adults. The fat, on the other hand, was much lower. This suggests that the body fat increases {{with the onset of}} maturity. No clear inverse relationship was found between fat and protein <b>in</b> <b>juveniles.</b> Moisture percentage was very high <b>in</b> <b>juveniles.</b> This was probably because of low fat content. In most species the sum of fat and water contents (F + W) was found to be constant. The percentages of ash, calcium and phosphorus were higher <b>in</b> <b>juveniles</b> than those of adults. Dry matter percentage varied inversely with the moisture and in most species carbohydrate was generally low. <b>In</b> <b>juveniles</b> although the calorific value of protein-fraction was high the total calorific value was lower than the adults...|$|R

5|$|The pigeye shark is {{a largely}} solitary animal, though {{occasionally}} several individuals {{may be found}} at the same location. In the Mozambique Channel, it outnumbers the bull shark on the east side while the opposite is true on the west side, suggesting there may be competitive exclusion between these similar species. Parasites documented from the pigeye shark include the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini, the copepods Pandarus smithii and P. cranchii, and the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, Cathetocephalus sp., Floriceps minacanthus, Heteronybelinia australis, Otobothrium australe, O. crenacolle, and Protogrillotia sp. Young pigeye sharks are potentially vulnerable to predation by larger sharks. The natural mortality for juveniles in Cleveland Bay has been measured at no more than 5% per year; this rate is comparable to that <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> bull sharks, and is much lower than <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) or lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in spring or summer, {{although}} observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E

5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb.

5|$|A cold open shows Trey Atwood (Bradley Stryker) and {{his brother}} Ryan {{stealing}} a car. The police chase and arrest the boys, resulting in a prison term for Trey and a short stay <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> hall for the underage Ryan. A conversation between Ryan and his public defender, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), establishes Ryan as a smart boy with a rough upbringing; he has three truancies and two suspensions, but his SAT I scores are in the ninety-eighth percentile. When Ryan's mother, Dawn (Daphne Ashbrook), collects Ryan, Sandy gives his business card to the boy. At home in Chino, Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J. (Ron Del Barrio), expels him from the house. Standing at a payphone with nowhere to go, Ryan calls Sandy for help. As Sandy drives Ryan to his house in Newport Beach, the opening credits and the theme tune play—unlike the other episodes, there is no title sequence.|$|E
5|$|In Panama, it breeds year-round without {{apparent}} seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's Mamíferos de Venezuela (Mammals of Venezuela), reproductive {{activity is}} highest in June–July and December. In the laboratory, the gestation period is 28days; Linares reports {{that it is}} 20 to 30days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year {{and there are two}} to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> fur, probably less than 50days old, were already pregnant. The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old; he estimated that animals were unlikely to live {{for more than a year}} in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2.9months.|$|E

5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered <b>in</b> <b>juvenile</b> plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E

30|$|Synopsis of {{the studies}} {{included}} in the review also revealed that age and growth status were factors influencing the level of cytokines in GCF that is shown {{to have an effect}} on the rate and amount of tooth movement. Mediator levels were seen to vary with growth status of individuals as evaluated in adolescents and adults [57] or compared <b>in</b> <b>juveniles</b> and adults [30],[38]. In one study, different mediators were found to increase in different age groups with IL- 6, GM-CSF increasing only <b>in</b> <b>juveniles</b> while PGE 2 increasing both <b>in</b> <b>juveniles</b> and adults [38]. In addition, activity index (AI) that is the ratio of IL- 1 β/IL- 1 RA in GCF, was found to influence velocity (Vt) of OTM both in growers and non-growers [35]. Mean Vt of growers was 0.050  mm/day and of non-growers was 0.024  mm/day for the same amount of applied stress that was correlated with higher levels of IL- 1 β and an increased AI in growers [35]. A greater Vt and amount of OTM <b>in</b> <b>juveniles</b> as compared to adults could be explained on the basis of a higher RANKL/OPG ratio <b>in</b> GCF <b>in</b> <b>juveniles</b> [30]. Other studies also support the variation in Vt according to varying mediator levels and AI in GCF [24],[35],[40],[56]. It was found that association between AI and Vt was stronger from distal than from mesial of retracted teeth, thus emphasizing greater values of IL- 1 β on the distal [40]. Thus, evidence from this literature review emphasizes the role of RANKL/OPG ratio in OTM in either of the age groups owing to its significance in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption that ultimately alters the amount and velocity of OTM.|$|R
