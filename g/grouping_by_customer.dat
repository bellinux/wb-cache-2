Due to its importance, in order that people get a fair benefit from it, water {{management}} has been undertaken by government via Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM). However, PDAM in four regencies (Banyumas, Cilacap, Purbalingga and Banjarnegara) continue to suffer from losses. This study is aimed at (1) finding out the process of services on PDAM in four regencies (Banyumas, Cilacap, Purbalingga and Banjarnegara); (2) measuring the dimension of service quality that have highest effect on PDAM in the above regencies. This study was carried out using survey method and customers of four PDAMs serve as the unit of analysis. The sample size was 200 respondents. Sample was selected through several stages. At the first stage, population was classified by areas. At the second stage, the populations of all regencies were <b>grouped</b> <b>by</b> <b>customer</b> strata.

40|$|Phenomenal {{data mining}} finds {{relations}} between the data and the phenomena {{that give rise to}} data rather than just relations among the data. For example, suppose supermarket cash register data does not identify cash customers. Nevertheless, there really are customers, and these <b>customers</b> are characterized <b>by</b> sex, age, ethnicity, tastes, income distribution, and sensitivity to price changes. A data mining program might be able to identify which baskets of purchases are likely to have been made <b>by</b> the same <b>customers.</b> In this example, the receipts are the data, and the customers are phenomena not directly represented in the data. Once the “baskets ” of purchases are <b>grouped</b> <b>by</b> <b>customer,</b> the way is open to infer further phenomena about the customers, e. g. their sex, age, etc. This article concerns what can be inferred by programs about phenomena from data and what facts are relevant to doing this. 1 We work mainly with the supermarket example, but the idea is general. 1 In a sense, all data mining is phenomenal; it’s just that the phenomenal part is usually done by hand. We want the computer to do the phenomenal part also. 1 In order to infer phenomena from data, facts about their relations must be supplied. Sometimes these facts can be implicit in the programs that look for the phenomena, but more generality is achieved if the facts are represented as sentences of logic in a knowledge base used by the programs. The result of phenomenal data-mining might include an extended database with additional fields on existing relations and new relations. Thus the relations describing supermarket baskets might be extended with a customer field, and new relations about customers and their properties might be introduced. ...|$|R
5000|$|Having used {{straight}} six, straight {{eight and}} V-12 engines {{in the interim}} period, the need for another new engine was recognised in the early 1950s. Development of a totally new V8 engine began in 1952, bearing {{no relation to the}} 1905 version apart from its V8 configuration. Rolls-Royce purchased Bentley in 1931 and the new engine was intended for use in both Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles. The result was a series of V8 engines known internally as the [...] "L410", the name relating to its bore size of 4.10 inches, in accordance with the company practice. Despite some attempts at changing the naming convention, the engine has kept both the 4.10 inch bore and the name L410 throughout its life, {{with the exception of the}} odd prototype. Continuous improvement saw the L410I, denoting fuel injection, the L410IT (for Injection Turbo) and the L410ITI (for Injection Turbo Intercooler). 94MY (model year) saw the introduction of a serpentine drive belt front-end, revised combustion system and an integrated engine cover. Developments of the L410 continued in production to power Rolls-Royces and Bentleys until the adoption of BMW V12 power by Rolls-Royce in the Silver Seraph and, subsequently, after BMW was granted a license to use the Rolls-Royce brand (for automobiles) in the Goodwood-produced Phantom. The L410 engine is still used by Bentley well into the 21st century, having been brought back into production <b>by</b> Volkswagen <b>Group</b> <b>by</b> <b>customer</b> demand. Renamed the L675, it remains under continuous development, despite an attempt to replace it with the 6.0L W12 Volkswagen engine. The Bentley brand and all former Rolls-Royce and Bentley automotive manufacturing assets have been owned by Volkswagen AG since 1998.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{purpose of}} my {{presentation}} {{is to consider}} whether the use of self-directed teams enhances competitiveness in services. In the context of heightened competition brought about by deregulation and the internationalization of service markets, do "team-based " work systems produce higher quality service and customer satisfaction? Do workers benefit as well? Should unions as well as management support this innovation? If so, under what conditions and why? This presentation complements {{that of the other}} panelists in this session in important ways. First, while Verma provides an overview of the array of workplace innovations being introduced in telecommunications firms (from joint labor-management consultation to total quality and self-management), I focus on a more detailed quantitative assessment of use of one of those innovations—self-directed work groups.

40|$|Abstract — A multiobjective {{programming}} for transportation model with {{the consideration of}} both depot to customer and customer to customer relationships is proposed in this research. The objectives are to minimize the total transportation cost which is the baseline objective and to minimize the overall independence value. A Lexicographic Goal Programming (LGP) {{is applied to the}} proposed model. A minimization of the total transportation cost is set to the first goal and a minimization of the overall independence value is set to the second goal of the proposed model. This model can obtain the better result than a single objective transportation model with a minimization of the total transportation cost objective. That is because the depot to customer relationship is considered in the first priority to get the lowest cost and the vicinity of customers in the same depot is concerned in the second priority to <b>group</b> near <b>by</b> <b>customers</b> to be served in the same depot if the capacity of the depot is sufficient. Moreover, each customer can be served by only one depot. These advantages are more compatible to the reality than conventional transportation model.

5000|$|The classic {{supply chain}} {{approach}} has been to try to forecast future inventory demand as accurately as possible, by applying statistical trending and [...] "best fit" [...] techniques based on historic demand and predicted future events. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that it can be applied to data aggregated at a fairly high level (e.g. category of merchandise, weekly, <b>by</b> <b>group</b> of <b>customers),</b> requiring modest database sizes and small amounts of manipulation. Unpredictability in demand is then managed by setting safety stock levels, so that for example a distributor might hold two weeks of supply of an article with steady demand but twice that amount for an article where the demand is more erratic. Universally accepted statistical methods such as Standard Deviation and Mean Absolute Deviation are often used for calculating safety stock levels.|$|R

This research paper identifies and quantifies the major defects in crisplant, and outlines the solutions {{to reduce the cost}} of handling these defects in RNO 1. The project work thoroughly assesses the entire RNO 1 crisplant operations (induct, sort, pack, SLAM, and problem solve) through four-phase approach: Understand the crisplant Process Flow, Develop a Data Collection Framework, Collect and Analyze Data, and Identify/Implement Data Driven Solutions. Lean principles and methodologies were used throughout the project work especially when identifying solutions. For example, opportunities that improved the packing process were identified based on a deep-dive analysis {{as a part of the}} Kaizen study. The project results demonstrated 50 % reduction in cost of handling crisplant defects in RNO l.
