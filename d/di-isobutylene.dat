40|$|This work {{presents}} {{some representative}} reactive distillation (RD) models to obtain attainable region for multi-component reaction systems when feed contains {{significant amount of}} inerts in it. One can achieve maximum selectivity for a quantitative conversion unlike conventional reactors with semibatch reactive rectification (SRR) as the best RD configuration when the inert is more volatile than the reactant. The other plausible RD configurations were suggested for different volatility patterns of the components and the inert. The MINLP optimization technique is also applied to industrially important case of dimerization of isobutylene for maximizing the selectivity towards <b>di-isobutylene</b> {{and the results were}} in agreement to those obtained from conceptual design. This work highlights the potential of optimization as a tool to complement the conceptual design method for selectivity engineering in RD columns...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{efficiency}} of {{spark ignition engine}} is usually limited {{by the appearance of}} knock, which is linked to fuel octane number (Research Octane Number – RON and Motor Octane Number-MON). If running the engine at its optimal efficiency requests a high octane number at high load, a lower octane number is only needed at low load. Based on this, the application of so-called Octane On demand concept, whereby the fuel anti knock quality is customized to match the real time requirement of a conventional spark ignition engine has been identified as highly promising. The objective {{of this study is to}} define the best fuel couple for the dual fuel " Octane-On-Demand " concept, including a low RON based fuel and an octane booster for minimizing global CO 2 tailpipe emissions and the octane booster consumption. The work covers 4 octane boosters: ethanol, reformate, <b>di-isobutylene,</b> and Superbutol™, and two fuel baseline: non-oxygenated gasoline RON 91 and naphtha based fuel RON 71. The present activity uses 0 D vehicle simulations, based on a M-segment vehicle equipped with an up-to-date 1, 6 L turbocharged GDI engine, to guide the choice of the fuel couple together with the optimal engine compression ratio. Dedicated inputs, such as engine octane requirement map and fuel anti-knock properties of various blends, are given to properly run the model...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost of the time, Spark Ignition (SI) engine {{performance}} {{is limited by}} knock phenomena (especially for turbocharged engines), which are linked to fuel resistance to auto-ignition, quantified by its octane number (Research Octane Number – RON and Motor Octane Number-MON). If high octane numbers are crucial for efficient high load operating points, they are less necessary at low load. Thus, if the octane number of the fuel could be tuned as any other engine setting parameter, the engine efficiency and CO 2 emissions could be improved, leading to an " Octane on Demand " concept, using for instance a dual fuel strategy. This requires understanding the behavior of dual fuel combustions with lower / higher octane fuels, and more particularly the evolution of RON when blending high RON fuels with low RON ones. Developing an Octane on Demand concept requires to choose appropriate octane enhancers and understand their blending behavior. For this purpose, RON measurements were performed on a CFR engine using {{a wide range of}} mixtures of low-octane base fuels with various boosters capable of increasing the antiknock resistance of the blends. The chemical composition of booster streams was chosen to assess the potential of using alternative refinery products for improving fuel resistant auto-ignition properties when added to a whole-range naphtha and RON 91 gasoline. The study covers five octane boosters: ethanol, reformate, <b>di-isobutylene,</b> 2 -butanol, and a mixture of butanols...|$|E
40|$|Silica aerogel and lyogel {{have been}} {{successfully}} sulfonated in one step by a simple post-synthesis method using microwaves as well as conventional heating. The use of microwaves allowed loading higher amounts of sulfonic acid groups in both silicas, according to the higher S/Si atomic ratio determined by XPS, and the higher sulfur content determined by TGA, also exhibiting lower surface area and higher acidity. Sulfonated aerogels showed higher conversion and selectivity to h-GTBE (glycerol di- and tri-ethers) than sulfonated lyogels for the acid-catalyzed etherification of glycerol with isobutene. This was attributed to the higher content of sulfonic acid groups incorporated in aerogel. Microwave-assisted sulfonated aerogel yielded 75 % of selectivity to h-GTBE, {{which can be used}} as fuel additive, for practically total conversion. Interestingly, larger porosity of aerogel avoided the partial blocking of pores by reaction products observed when other micro- and mesoporous catalysts were tested for this reaction. The combination of high conversion, high selectivity to h-GTBE, practically no formation of undesired <b>di-isobutylenes</b> and very high resistance to catalyst deactivation makes microwave-assisted sulfonic acid functionalized aerogel a promising catalyst for this etherification reaction.
