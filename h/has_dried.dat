The more populous King County {{is also in}} the lahar area, but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard. More recently (since 2001) funding from the federal government for lahar protection in the area <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> up, leading local authorities in at-risk cities like Orting to fear a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy.|$|E
5|$|The three {{travel to}} Florida, but {{find that the}} Lake <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> up {{and is now a}} swamp filled with gold from the sunken {{treasure}} fleet last seen in Act I. There, they destroy a Circle base in the swamp. Cooper finds and attempts to capture Beaumont, but Beaumont commands two wolves to attack him. Cooper shoots one of them with his pistol, but the other kills him. Amelia, now wanting to avenge Cooper, learns from the local Seminoles that there is an Inca city in Pacamayo Valley where several barrels of the Fountain's water have been stored.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Lymm lies {{to the south}} west of Warburton in the borough of Warrington, with the River Bollin forming {{the border between the}} two villages. The Bollin joins the River Mersey in the village; however the Mersey in Warburton <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> up, as it was {{diverted}} into the Manchester Ship Canal further upstream. To the east lie Dunham Town, Dunham Massey, Bowdon and Altrincham, with Little Bollington to the south, and Partington and Urmston to the north. The local geology is lower keuper marl, with a ridge of sand and gravel running from Warburton to Dunham.|$|E

5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin <b>has</b> <b>dried,</b> tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E

25|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} cutting the members to size and then drilling {{a series of}} holes in the joint surface of each member.

The holes are drilled such that there are corresponding holes in each member into which short dowels are inserted with some glue. The joint is brought together and clamped until the glue <b>has</b> <b>dried.</b>|$|E
25|$|Geologically, Lake Victoria is {{relatively}} young – about 400,000 years old – and it formed when westward-flowing rivers were dammed by an upthrown crustal block. During its geological history, Lake Victoria went through changes ranging from its present shallow depression, through to {{what may have}} been a series of much smaller lakes. Geological cores taken from its bottom show Lake Victoria <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> up completely at least three times since it formed. These drying cycles are probably related to past ice ages, which were times when precipitation declined globally. Lake Victoria last dried out about 17,300 years ago, and it refilled 14,700 years ago.|$|E

25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst.

For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
25|$|When alfalfa {{is to be}} used as hay, it {{is usually}} cut and baled. Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed. Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the {{subsequent}} cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest. When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the alfalfa and arranges it in windrows. In areas where the alfalfa does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that crimp and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the alfalfa dry faster. After the alfalfa <b>has</b> <b>dried,</b> a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{drainage}} {{of water}} from the bogs as a result of human activity, most of Wicklow's peat <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> out too much for Sphagnum mosses to grow and moorland and heath vegetation has taken over. Active peat building is still occurring at some sites, most notably the Liffey Head Bog. Common heather (or ling) and bell heather are the most common moorland plants along with bilberry (or fraughan, as it is known in Ireland), bog cotton, deergrass and purple moor grass. Bird species found on the Wicklow moorland include red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. Birds of prey found in the uplands include kestrels, hen harriers, merlins and peregrine falcons. The latter of these are protected species. The uplands are used for sheep grazing and so the moorland is periodically burned to keep the growth of heather in check and encourage growth of grasses.|$|E

25|$|The reader learns a {{great deal}} about what the family was like from how the robots {{continue}} on in their functions. Breakfast is automatically made, clothes are laid out, voice reminders of daily activities are called out, but no one is there. Robotic mice vacuum the home and tidy up. As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather. A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies. Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto {{the side of the house}} (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion. That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> up and failed.

25|$|Once all {{the cars}} have formed on the grid, a light system above the track {{indicates}} {{the start of the}} race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted {{in the event of a}} serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2017 season there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources of}} water supply for Damascus are the Fijeh and Barada springs. The Fijeh springs are {{a group of three}} large karstic springs - The Fijeh main spring, the Fijeh side spring and the Harouch spring - in the Barada gorge. The three springs used to {{contribute}} half the flow of the Barada River. The Barada spring is located North of the Fijeh springs close to the Lebanese border. The entire flow of all these springs is captured today, including through wells positioned around the springs. This is why it appears during the summer that the Barada spring <b>has</b> <b>dried</b> up, while its flow is actually being captured and transferred along the river to supply various towns in the Barada gorge as well as Damascus itself with drinking water. Water from the Barada and Fijeh springs is transferred to a mixing station near Dummar where it is being chlorinated and distributed to the city. The city’s water supply is complemented by well fields in the plains around the city. The flow of the springs is highly seasonal, lagging several months behind the precipitation because of snow melt and the karstic characteristics of the rocks from which they emerge. The flow of the Figeh springs is less than 4 m3/second during the low-flow period from July to December. However, it reaches a maximum of more than 12m3/second (average 1962-1991) in April.|$|E
