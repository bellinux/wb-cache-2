American Psychological Association (APA) format is double spaced lines, one-inch margins, and two spaces between each sentence. This section serves as a short introduction to your essay. Describe your topic and tell how your essay will treat it. Heading (a short title <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>paragraph)</b> Discuss a main point here. Be clear and concise. When you use a quote of under 40 words put it in quotation marks. Ridener and Fritzer (2004) stated “something that relates to your essay ” (p. 12). If you paraphrase (put in your own words) something that an author said indicate that at the end of the paraphrase. Math is super fun for kids (Ridener & Fritzer, 2004). If your quote is more than 40 words, you indent. Ridener and Fritzer stated: This quote is more than forty words. Notice how I did not include the year following Ridener and Fritzer.

We {{have also}} the strongest grounds {{to believe that}} the debts will be in other respects {{considerably}} less than they are now computed by you; and consequently, the Company's annual proportion of the twelve lacs will be larger than it appears on your estimate. But even on your own statement of it, if we add to the 150,000l., or 3,75,000 pagodas, (which you take as the annual proportion to be received by the Company for five years to the end of 1789,) the annual amount of the Tanjore peshcush for the same period, and the arrears on the peshcush, (proposed by Lord Macartney to be received in three years,) the whole will make a sum not falling very short of pagodas 35,00,000, the amount of pagodas 7,00,000 per annum for the same period. And if we carry our calculations farther, it will appear, that, both by the plan proposed by the Nabob and adopted in <b>your</b> <b>paragraphs,</b> and by that which we transmitted to you, the debt from the Nabob, if taken at 3,000,000l., will be discharged nearly at the same period, viz., {{in the course of the}} eleventh year. We cannot, therefore, be of opinion that there is the smallest ground for objecting to this arrangement, as injurious to the interests of the Company, even if the measure were to be considered on the mere ground of expediency, and with a view only to the wisdom of reëstablishing credit and circulation in a commercial settlement, without any consideration of those motives of attention to the feelings and honor of the Nabob, of humanity to individuals, and of justice to persons in your service and living under your protection, which have actuated the legislature, and which afford not only justifiable, but commendable grounds <b>for</b> <b>your</b> conduct.|$|R
