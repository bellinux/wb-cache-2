Byrd warned {{today that}} the United States should adopt {{measures}} of protection against {{the possibility of an}} invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a [...] recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking– recalled the admiral – {{is one of the most}} important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety." ...|$|E

That's near the river and within fifty miles or so of the edge of the Rim Rock. Somewhere up there Cheseldine holds fort. Somewhere to the north is the town Fairdale. But he doesn't hide {{all the time in the}} rocks. Only after some daring raid or hold-up. Cheseldine's got border towns on his staff, or scared of him, and these places we want to know about, especially Fairdale. Write me care of the adjutant at Austin. I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> you to be careful where you mail letters. Ride a hundred, two hundred miles, if necessary, or go clear to El Paso." ...|$|E

6000|$|MISS GILPIN (with a sad smile). I'm {{glad you}} feel that way. It shouldn't be hard now for you to {{convince}} her. But I know Eileen. She will never consent--for your sake--until she is well again. And stop and think, Mr. Murray. Even if she did consent to marry you right now the shock--the excitement--it would be suicide for her. I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> her against it myself; and you wouldn't propose it if you knew the danger to her in her present condition. She hasn't long to live, at best. I've talked with Dr. Stanton. I know. God knows I {{would be the first}} one to hold out hope if there was any. There isn't. It's merely a case of prolonging the short time left to her and making it happy. You must bear that in mind--as a fact! ...|$|E
6000|$|Virginia {{laid down}} her {{magazine}} for a moment, and with half-closed eyes tried to think. Within the next room, {{only a few}} yards away, and nearer to the door leading into the flat than she herself was, was hiding the person who for two thousand five hundred pounds was proposing to rid the world of Norris Vine. What would happen if she sat still? If Norris Vine should come in, and it was almost the time at which he was expected, his assailant would probably be waiting behind the door. She had no doubt but that the attack would be swift and sudden, and that once made some means would be taken to keep her a prisoner in the room where she now was, or perhaps there might be even worse things in store for her. In any case, within a few yards of her a man lay in hiding with murder in his heart, and between them the closed door which might at any moment be opened. What chance would she <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> Norris Vine? None at all! ...|$|E
6000|$|But now, {{there is}} one thing against which I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> you most solemnly, and {{especially}} in such days as these. You may believe my words to your own ruin, or to your own salvation. They are [...] "the Gospel," [...] "the good news of the Kingdom of God"--that is, the good news that God has condescended to become our King, to govern and guide us, to order all things for our good. But as St. Paul says, the Gospel may be a savour of death unto death, as well as a savour of life unto life. And I will tell you now; that you have only to do what the Jews just before the coming of our Lord did, and give way to the same thoughts as they, and then, like them, it were better for you that you had never heard of God, and been like the savages, to whom little or no sin is imputed, because they are all but without law. How is this? ...|$|E

"There {{are others}} who have displeased the Parisians whose lives they will also demand, {{and there are several}} women among them; therefore, it is clear that even the sex of your lady will not save her and her {{children}} from the fury and longing for revenge, felt by the family of Legoix and by Caboche the skinner. The only question is, where can they be bestowed in safety? I know what you would say, that all this is monstrous, and that it is incredible that the Parisians will dare to take such steps. I can assure you that it is as I say; the peril is most imminent. Probably to- night, but if not, to-morrow the gates of Paris will be closed, {{and there will be no}} escape for any whom these people have doomed to death. In the first place, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> your Burgundian friends; that done, you must see to the safety of your four men. The three Frenchmen may, if they disguise themselves, perchance be able to hide in Paris, but your tall archer must leave the city without delay, his height and appearance would betray him in whatever disguise he were clad.|$|E
