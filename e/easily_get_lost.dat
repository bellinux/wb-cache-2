A flyer might <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> on patrol. Lts. Harold G. Peterson, pilot, and Paul H. Davis, observer-gunner from Marfa Field, Texas, found it could happen while following a river on a clear day. [...] Their mission was to patrol along the Rio Grande from Lajitas to Bosque Bonito and then land at Fort Bliss. Coming {{to the mouth of}} the Rio Conchos at Ojinaga, Chihuahua, they mistook the Conches for the Rio Grande and followed it many miles into Mexico before being forced down by engine trouble. Thinking they were still on the Rio Grande, the airmen picked a spot on the “American” side of the river to land. The terrain was rough and the plane was wrecked. Having buried the machine guns and ammunition {{to keep them out of}} the hands of bandits, Peterson and Davis started walking down the river, thinking they would come to the U.S. Cavalry outpost at Candelaria, Texas.|$|E
2500|$|ZombiU {{gameplay}} was criticized. Sterling {{wrote that}} there was too little enemy variety, which made the game's combat repetitive. He also criticized its map design, saying that in his 11-hour experience with the game, {{he could not find}} his way to objectives for at least two hours. Turi called the game's map was confusing, agreeing with Sterling that players would <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost.</b> He criticized the game's melee weapon as unsatisfying to use, comparing it unfavorably to Dead Island and Left 4 Dead 2. According to Turi, the melee-combat shortcomings were highlighted by the game's shortage of ammunition. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot and Miller shared similar concerns, calling the melee combat repetitive. According to McGee, the game's simplistic mission design and puzzle offer little variety. Stanton wrote that although the game's combat was simple, it developed into [...] "something special" [...] since players needed to choose their weapons wisely. Cooper found several flaws in the systems, such as characters not acknowledging the death of a previous player character and forcing players to replay some game segments. Klepek found the gunplay to be mediocre, but thematically correct.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including <b>easily</b> <b>getting</b> <b>lost),</b> mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|R

We present a concept that utilizes different search heuristics to identify probable ancestors of source documents, and pair this with clone detection to locate origins of inserted code. Arbitrary kinds of metadata can then be linked to code sections and be preserved automatically while code evolves. We evaluate our approach using code from the Hydra and FreeCol projects, and sketch prospective applications...|$|R
30|$|Conventional {{subsurface}} mines are detected {{through a}} variety of sonar techniques, which proved inadequate for spotting floating mines due to the practical matter of downward sensor inclination, but more importantly because of the sea surface presenting a strongly cluttered background in which the small target <b>easily</b> <b>gets</b> <b>lost.</b> The same reasoning applies above water: the target is small and partially submerged, and the agitated sea surface acts as a dynamic and noisy background hiding the target among the clutter. In practice, the only reliable detection method so far proved to be a human lookout, which significantly complicated operations since every potential contact had to be carefully approached and identified visually. This experience shows that an automated detection system would be beneficial in similar conflicts, and in cleanup operations of the abandoned mines of old conflicts.|$|R
40|$|During the {{creation}} of a software architecture, the architects and stakeholders take a lot of decisions. Many of these decisions can be directly related to functional or quality requirements. Some design decisions, though, are more or less arbitrarily made on the fly because of personal experience, domain knowledge, budget constraints, available expertise, and the like. These decisions, as well as the reasons for those decisions, are often not explicit upfront. They are implicit, and usually remain undocumented. We call them assumptions. There is no accepted way to document assumptions, and the relation between the software architecture and these assumptions <b>easily</b> <b>gets</b> <b>lost,</b> becomes hidden in the girders of the architecture. They are rediscovered at a later stage, when the software evolves and assumptions become invalid or new assumptions contradict earlier ones. In this paper, we develop a method to recover such assumptions from an existing software product. We illustrate the method by applying it to a commercial software product, and show how the results can help assess the evolutionary capabilities of its architecture. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Butt plugs of excess diameter can, especially when inserted too rapidly and/or too forcefully, lead to sphincter tear, detachment or other rectal failure. Kegel exercises can help maintain normal, healthy sphincter function. When inserting a butt plug, one should be gentle, use plenty of lubrication, start with smaller sizes, and exercise patience. While medical data is sparse, some recommend not leaving a butt plug inserted for longer than two to three hours.|$|E

The combination of its size, linguistic oddness and polemic themes caused a shock when it was published, but now it is widely regarded as one of the greatest works of Brazilian literature and one of the most important novels of Portuguese language literature and South American literature.

5000|$|Manna plants: Small pink fungi {{that can}} rapidly blanket an area. During some seasons, the plant dries out and becomes brittle and powdery. It will {{dissipate}} when touched into powdery strands. The strands of many plants clump together into puffballs which can grow to enormous sized. Eventually, the puffballs explode into a fine powder compared to cotton candy. This creates {{a storm of}} powder that lasts about a week, during which the lower Chtorran fauna come out to feed and reproduce, which is then echoed {{all the way up}} the food chain. Most Earth animals and plants will die in a puffball storm, and humans will <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> and overwhelmed. They are perhaps the most subtly dangerous lifeform in the Chtorran ecosystem; the powder destroys machinery, as it is not only flammable, but (like grain dust) fine enough to act as a thermobaric weapon. The powder is every bit as hazardous to terrestrial animals as it is filled withChtorran bacteria; exposure to it quickly results in an equivalent of Legionellosis known as [...] "pink lung" [...] that is 100% fatal within days of exposure without state-of-the-art treatment. As basic mushroom-like fungi in their simpler stages, scientists suspect that manna plants were among the first Cthorran life-forms to appear on Earth, acting as primary plant growth which established groundwork conditions for other Chtorran life forms birthed out of the shambler tree wombs. Retroactive analysis confirmed that there were reports of manna plants (thought to just be a new kind of fungus) years before the wave of plagues hit in the initial invasion.|$|E
