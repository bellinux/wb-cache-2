5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} in {{the short-term}} management of <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall. According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), benzodiazepines {{can be used in}} the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of Yiqiyangxin Chinese medicine compound combined with cognitive therapy on <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> MethodsA total of 202 <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders</b> patients were randomly allocated to a control condition (Paroxetine combined with cognitive therapy) or a treatment condition (Yiqiyangxin Chinese medicine compound combined with cognitive therapy). Subsequently, scores of Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and blood routine, urine routine, liver function, renal function, electrocardiogram were detected before treatment, 3 months, 6 months after treatment and 6 months after medicine withdrawal, respectively. ResultsHAMA and SAS scores were significantly reduced in two groups (P 0. 05). HAMA and SAS scores were significantly increased in two groups (P< 0. 05) after medicine withdrawal, {{and there were}} significant differences in HAMA and SAS scores, recurrent disease and adverse reaction (P< 0. 001). The incidence of recurrent disease and adverse reaction in treatment group was low. Both two groups showed no apparent abnormality in blood routine, urine routine, liver and renal function, and electrocardiogram. ConclusionsYiqiyangxin Chinese medicine compound combined with cognitive therapy can significantly reduce the recurrence after medicine withdrawal and is effective on <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorders.</b> Furthermore, the incidence of adverse reactions is low.

5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (GAD) {{may take}} up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder)</b> or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
40|$|Although social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> {{appears to}} confer {{impairment}} in friendships, evidence beyond selfreport is minimal. We used the flexible iterated prisoner’s dilemma as a simulated interaction {{with a friend}} with 27 individuals with the generalized type of social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and 23 demographically equivalent individuals without the disorder. Participants with <b>generalized</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> were less giving on the task. Lower giving was also moderately associated with interpersonal variables (e. g., coldness). A trend was also found for participants with <b>generalized</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> to show lower assertiveness on the task. The connection between <b>generalized</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and friendship impairment appears likely to be partially explained by interpersonal constraint that is perceived by others as coldness and manifests in a behavioral economics task...|$|R

5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons about students who get diagnosed with <b>generalized</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and we learn that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who says that the perpetrator was probably in the vicinity of the bus crash. Veronica learns that the “I am God” image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} whether the self-report {{version of the}} Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR) could accurately identify individuals with social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and individuals with the generalized subtype of social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> Furthermore, the study sought to determine the optimal cutoffs for the LSAS-SR for identifying patients with social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and its <b>generalized</b> subtype. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-one patients with clinician-assessed social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> (240 with <b>generalized</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder)</b> and 53 control participants who were free from current Axis- 1 disorders completed the LSAS-SR. Results: Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses revealed that the LSAS-SR performed well in identifying participants with social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder</b> and <b>generalized</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder.</b> Consistent with Mennin et al. ’s [2002 : J Anxiety Disord 16 : 661 – 673] research on the clinician-administered version of the LSAS, cutoffs of 30 and 60 on the LSAS-SR provided the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for classifying participants with social <b>anxiety</b> and <b>generalized</b> social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> respectively. Conclusions: The LSAS-SR may be an accurate and cost-effective way to identify and subtype patients with social <b>anxiety</b> <b>disorder,</b> which could help increase {{the percentage of people}} who receive appropriate treatment for this debilitating disorder.
