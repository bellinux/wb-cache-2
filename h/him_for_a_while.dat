500|$|Phineas {{is part of}} a blended family, a {{decision}} creator Marsh made to reflect his own experiences growing up. His stepbrother, Ferb, is his best friend. Phineas's birth father is never present or discussed in the series, something Marsh and Povenmire have stated that they fully intend to keep that way. It is established that his mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher married Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher, after dating <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> in the 1990s. They truly fell in love at a concert of the fictitious band [...] "Love Händel" [...] after they were put on the kiss cam.|$|E

500|$|After the race, Simpson {{prepared}} for the world road championships with distance training and criteriums. At the world championships on 3 September, the [...] road race consisted of twenty-four laps of a varying circuit at Sallanches in the French Alps. Simpson crashed on the third lap while descending in wet conditions, damaging a pedal. He {{got back to the}} peloton, launching a solo attack on a descent; he then chased down the group of four leaders with two laps to go. On the last lap he was dropped by three riders, finishing six seconds behind. On 17 October, Simpson rode in the Giro di Lombardia. Halfway through the race he was given the wrong musette (bag) by his team in the feed zone, and threw it away. With the head of the race reduced to five riders, Molteni's Gianni Motta attacked. Simpson {{was the only one who}} could follow, but he began to feel the effects of not eating. Motta gave him part of his food, which sustained <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> On the final climb Simpson led Motta, but was exhausted. Over the remaining [...] of flat terrain, Motta dropped him; Simpson cracked, and was repeatedly overtaken, finishing twenty-first. He closed the year riding track races.|$|E
500|$|Early breaker Denifl {{was alone}} in front and had about two minutes of an {{advantage}} with [...] to go. Behind, Domenico Pozzovivo placed an acceleration that put the lead group in difficulty, but he was brought back. The time gap rapidly decreased, due to dubious time monitoring again. Pinot launched an attack from the group, but Špilak had the resources {{to keep up with}} <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> but was ultimately dropped. Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot. [...] "I'm very happy, it was important for me and the team. We came here to win a stage, and I had good legs today. I've got a lot of confidence now, that’s important for the Tour de France. And it's true, racing in Switzerland seems to suit me," [...] said Pinot. [...] "The objective is to win overall here, but the rouleurs like [...] Thomas and [...] Dumoulin aren't far back," [...] he added. [...] "It'll be a long and difficult time trial [...] We'll see what happens on the day." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{last years}} of Ludlow’s life {{seem to have been}} a {{constant}} struggle with addiction. Family letters, when they mention him, usually either hopefully discuss his latest release from habit or mourn his latest relapse. His cousin wrote in March 1870, that “Dr. Smith has been treating <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> but he said to a lady the other day — that there was no use in his wasting his strength [...] Mr. Ludlow, for he took a teaspoonful of morphine in a glass of whisky every day — and while he persisted in doing that it was only time & strength thrown away...” ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{immediate}} crisis, Sisko convinced Worf to join the crew as Strategic Operations officer. In this role, he would coordinate all Starfleet activity in the Bajoran sector and act as an executive officer on the USS Defiant, meaning he had to adjust to the requirements and obligations that came with the red [...] "command personnel" [...] uniform. For the first months, Worf had difficulties adjusting to life on the station, unintentionally overstepping his boundaries by acting as he did on the Enterprise, putting <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> at odds with Chief of Security Odo. For Worf, the station's life seemed just too much 'grey', subsequently requesting to relocate his quarters aboard Defiant.|$|E
2500|$|Two street racers, the Driver (Taylor) and the Mechanic (Wilson) live on {{the road}} in their highly modified, primer-gray, 1955 Chevrolet 150 two-door sedan drag car and drift from town to town, making their income by {{challenging}} local residents to impromptu drag races. [...] As they drive east on Route 66 from Needles, California, they pick up the Girl (Bird), a female hitchhiker, in Flagstaff, Arizona when she gets into their car at a diner. Although the Driver develops a crush on the Girl, she sleeps with the Mechanic when the Driver goes out drinking one night. In New Mexico, they begin to encounter another car driver, GTO (Oates), on the highways. An atmosphere of hostility develops between the two parties. Although GTO is not an overt street racer, and, in fact, seems to know little about cars, a cross-country race to Washington, D.C. is suggested. The Driver proposes that the prize should be [...] "for pinks," [...] or legal ownership of the loser's car. Along the way, GTO picks up various hitchhikers, including an importuning homosexual hitchhiker (Harry Dean Stanton). When GTO's inexperience becomes apparent, he, the Driver and the Mechanic form an uneasy alliance; the Driver even drives with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> when GTO gets fatigued.|$|E
2500|$|Cindy grow {{close and}} begin a relationship. Stephanie Waring, who portrays Cindy, said the pair [...] "bring {{out the best}} in each other". Pickard {{explained}} that when Cindy ends the relationship because he does not plan to marry her, his character is shocked that he [...] "misses Cindy. They talk things through and, out of the blue, Tony proposes in jest. But Cindy goes along with it..." [...] He explained that Tony is unaware of Cindy's true nature although he did suspect Cindy to be manipulating <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Pickard added that Cindy will [...] "want to get married as soon as possible before Tony can change his mind". He added that Cindy is [...] "acting like she genuinely loves him and he desperately wants that love" [...] so he remains unsuspicious towards her and her plans to scam him. Despite her plans, Pickard felt Cindy has [...] "some feelings" [...] for Tony. He felt that Tony has [...] "fallen for her, yes. It surprises him but she's started to mean a lot to him. Cindy's smart and sexy and they're good together". Pickard felt that if his character discovered Cindy and Darren Osborne's (Ashley Taylor Dawson) plans to scam him he would be [...] "furious but also he'd be really down about it. It would upset him to think they were trying to con him but he'd be angry with himself for being so gullible". He added that [...] "Tony thinks [...] never have agreed to marry him if Darren still meant something to her".|$|E
6000|$|But {{she did not}} rise. After {{looking at}} <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> she sank down closer to him, laid her arm across his knee, and {{dropping}} her head upon it, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] conceded Monna Lisa, at last, [...] "if I let <b>him</b> stay <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{and carry}} things {{up the hill}} for me, thou must keep thy counsel and tell nobody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] she whispered, [...] "touch him not. Perchance {{he would}} cry out--and we seek higher game. He has that within him which will hold <b>him</b> fast <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Follow where I shall lead." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1989 {{he succeeded}} Peter May as Chairman of the England Cricket Selectors, {{receiving}} £60,000 pay {{to compensate for}} his lost business interests, the first chairman to be so paid. [...] "Dexter was soon in action, initially by way of press conferences and then, as the season developed, by lightning visits to the county grounds. These he made, despite an operation to a heel that put <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> on crutches, by motorbike and car, a demonstration of enthusiasm and interest that was impressive." [...] After the chaos of 1988 – the Summer of Four Captains he wanted the tough Mike Gatting as captain, but was vetoed by Ossie Wheatley and his status was immediately undermined. Instead the more relaxed David Gower was appointed for the six Test series. Dexter tackled the role with energy and enthusiasm, but the shine soon wore off as Allan Border's 1989 Australians beat England 4–0 to regain the Ashes, their first series victory in England since 1975. His cause was not helped by {{the announcement of the}} Mike Gatting's Rebel tour of South Africa {{in the middle of the}} series, which removed the England players Bill Athey, Kim Barnett, Ian Butcher, Chris Broad, Chris Cowdrey, Graham Dilley, Richard Ellison, John Emburey, Neil Foster, Bruce French, Paul Jarvis, Matthew Maynard, Tim Robinson, Greg Thomas and Alan Wells from contention. Admittedly England were already 2–0 down in the series and none of these players had shown any talent so far in the summer, but it was an indication of the division and demoralisation of English cricket. In the First Test at Headingley Dexter selected four fast bowlers and no spinners for the team, advised Gower to put Australia in to bat, only to see them made 601/7 and win by 210 runs. For the Second Test he wrote an inspirational hymn for the England cricketers to sing called [...] "Onward Gower's Soldiers" [...] and appointed a team chaplain, but remained aloof from the players and seldom visited the dressing room. At the end of the summer he told the press that he couldn't think of any mistakes he had made and later joked that the [...] "lines of Venus were in the wrong juxtaposition", which was incorrectly translated by the press as a genuine belief in New Age mysticism. The lackadaisical Gower was fired at the end of the summer and the more painstaking Graham Gooch was made captain until 1993, despite Dexter having called his previous appointment as captain as [...] "being hit in the face by a dead fish".|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> with cold, unkind scrutiny, like one who tries the temper of a tool.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brunelli escorted Katy to {{a little}} table embowered with {{shrubbery}} in tubs, {{and asked her to}} excuse <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, poor fellow," [...] said Captain Fooks. [...] "Neefit {{has done}} that <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Ralph <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> was so knocked off his pins by the breeches-maker, that he didn't {{know where to look}} for shelter." ...|$|R
60|$|Marguerite watched <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> longer: he {{was evidently}} endeavouring {{to make her}} think that he had become {{oblivious}} of her presence, and his transparent little manoeuvers amused and puzzled her not a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'm glad to say that, as I half expected, we {{have got}} the fellow; corralled <b>him</b> <b>for</b> horse-stealing <b>a</b> <b>while</b> ago, and he'll be charged with robbing you in due time. But go on." ...|$|R
60|$|There we {{all looked}} upon <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> exulting greatly in our success, but yet {{with a sort of}} pity for the man's shame.|$|E
60|$|So he {{went down}} and hid himself among some ferns and bushes where we saw no more of <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and, to tell the truth, forgot his existence.|$|E
6000|$|... "To Minstead," [...] quoth he. [...] "My brother Simon Edricson is socman there, and I go to bide with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> I prythee, {{let me have}} my score, good dame." ...|$|E
60|$|Henery Walker at once gave 'im {{some more}} gin and beer, and arter he 'ad drunk it the old gentleman said that he'd go {{and live with}} <b>'im</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> to see 'ow he liked it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was indeed}} obvious that Mr Verloc {{was not in}} his usual state, {{physically}} and even mentally. A sombre irresolution held <b>him</b> silent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Then he murmured a few ominous generalities {{on the theme of}} necessity.|$|R
60|$|She slowly, with {{a little}} {{trembling}} nodding of her bonnet, turned her head and glanced quietly, fixedly, and unflinchingly, out of the half-open door. 'But that's not my affair.' And again she looked at <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Little Pauline {{stood looking}} seriously at <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> [...] "I am sorry for thee, Otto," [...] said she, at last. And then, at her childish pity, he began crying in earnest.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she shut}} {{and locked the}} door. Coming to the bedside she knelt down rather stiffly, looked at <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to make sure, and kissed him, not once, but many times.|$|E
6000|$|My desire became {{to comfort}} him--a {{sentiment}} I think he understood and was grateful for. Advancing into the open, I sat down over against him, and watched <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> in silence. Presently he said:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Toots, who {{had been}} {{detained}} by an important letter from the Duke of Wellington, found Paul out after a time; and having looked at <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while,</b> as before, inquired if {{he was fond of}} waistcoats.|$|R

60|$|But having {{stood before}} <b>him,</b> silent, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> it moved towards the fire; then stopped.|$|R
