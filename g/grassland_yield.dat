40|$|Cutting {{date and}} {{frequency}} are important parameters determining grassland yields {{in addition to}} the effects of weather, soil conditions, plant composition and fertilisation. Because accurate and area-wide data of grassland yields are currently not available, cutting frequency can be used to estimate yields. In this project, a method to detect cutting dates via surface changes in radar images is developed. The combination of this method with a <b>grassland</b> <b>yield</b> model will result in more reliable and regional-wide numbers of grassland yields. For the test-phase of the monitoring project, a study area situated southeast of Munich, Germany, was chosen due to its high density of managed grassland. For determining grassland cutting robust amplitude change detection techniques are used evaluating radar amplitude or backscatter statistics before and after the cutting event. CosmoSkyMed and Sentinel- 1 A data were analysed. All detected cuts were verified according to in-situ measurements recorded in a GIS database. Although the SAR systems had various acquisition geometries, the amount of detected grassland cut was quite similar. Of 154 tested grassland plots, covering in total 436 ha, 116 and 111 cuts were detected using CosmoSkyMed and Sentinel- 1 A radar data, respectively. Further improvement of radar data processes as well as additional analyses with higher sample number and wider land surface coverage will follow for optimisation of the method and for validation and generalisation of the results of this feasibility study. The automation of this method will than allow for an area-wide and cost efficient cutting date detection service improving <b>grassland</b> <b>yield</b> models. * Corresponding author. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the effect of the nitrification inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on forage production and N uptake from slurry applications in comparison to mineral ones in grassland systems of the Basque Country. Two kinds of fertilisers were applied: mineral (M) as ammonium sulphate nitrate 26 % (19. 5 % ammoniacal and 6. 5 % nitric) and cattle slurry (S). DMPP (1 kg ha- 1) was used or not with both types of fertiliser. Following each fertiliser application <b>grassland</b> <b>yield</b> was assessed.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze impacts {{of climate change}} on managed {{grassland}} systems and to project potential changes in farmers' management practices in response to altered climatic conditions, we develop a modeling approach that integrates a process-based grassland model into an economic model.

We apply the bio-economic model to an intensively managed grassland system with a geographic focus on the Swiss Plateau. Our results show an increase of future production risks in grassland production due to climate change. Projected changes in <b>yield</b> levels, <b>grassland</b> composition and optimal responses of risk-averse farmers are dependent on the assumptions concerning cross-compliance obligations, forage quality and particularly on the assumed effect of elevated CO 2 concentrations: <b>Grasslands</b> <b>yields</b> will increase under future climatic conditions only if the benefits of rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are taken into account.

30|$|As {{has been}} {{emphasized}} by many other authors (e.g., de Groot et al. 2002, 2010; Haines-Young and Potschin 2009; Carpenter et al. 2009), this latter aspect demonstrates {{the importance of}} including ecological processes in socio-economic modeling frameworks {{for the assessment of}} EGS. Ecological processes, such as the development of tree species under drought conditions or the variance in agricultural crop and <b>grassland</b> <b>yields</b> at higher temperatures and different elevational gradients, form a fundamental basis for the quantitative assessment of EGS changes.

40|$|Ammonia {{is easily}} lost after land {{spreading}} of livestock slurries. Low-emission techniques entailing injection and trailing shoes have therefore become compulsory in the Netherlands on grassland. There {{is an argument}} that the emission of ammonia after surface application is overestimated and that the emission of various other nitrogen (N) compounds, following the prescribed low-emission techniques, is underestimated. Opponents also claim that injection in particular decreases <b>grassland</b> <b>yields</b> due to its negative effect on soil quality and biodiversity. They state that a similar reduction in ammonia emissions could be realized via low-protein dairy cow diets and slurry spreading under favourable weather conditions. This study evaluates these claims and concludes that low-emission techniques reduce the loss of ammonia effectively and increase the availability of N to grassland. There are no indications that low-emission techniques per se have negative effects on soil quality, the productivity of crops and biodiversity. It has also been demonstrated that the efficacy of proposed alternatives is limited. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} tractor traffic on <b>grassland</b> <b>yield,</b> soil porosity and penetration resistance in three field trials on contrasting soils in different regions of Norway (medium sand at Tjøtta, Nordland, silty medium sand at Fureneset, Sogn og Fjordane, silt at Løken, Oppland). The trials had a split-plot design with three levels of two wheel-by-wheel tractor passes after each cut (no traffic, light tractor 3 - 4 Mg, heavy tractor 6 - 7 Mg), three different seed mixtures and two fertilization levels. At three other field trials (Balsfjord in Troms, Fjærland in Sogn og Fjordane and Hokksund in Buskerud) impacts of both traffic and the inclusion of clovers in the seed mixture on <b>grassland</b> <b>yield</b> and penetration resistance were studied. These trials had a split-plot design with three levels of one wheel-by-wheel tractor and harvesting machinery pass and three different seed mixtures. During the first three ley years the yield reduction by tractor traffic was 26 % at Løken, 4 % at Fureneset and zero at Tjøtta. There was {{a positive correlation between}} yield reduction and the soil moisture content at wheeling. Tractor traffic reduced pore volume and air capacity and increased bulk density, degree of compactness and penetration resistance, with the largest effect on the silty soil at Løken and the smallest on the sandy soil at Tjøtta. Prediction of soil compaction by using the Terranimo® model gave a good picture of the situation at Fureneset and Tjøtta, but at Løken the soil was far more compacted than predicted by the model. The depth of tracks after wheeling was not found to give a reliable measure of soil compaction effects, as the yield reduction on the silty soil at Løken was far larger than at Tjøtta and Fureneset at the same level of track depth. In the field trials at Balsfjord, Fjærland and Hokksund the yield reduction after wheeling varied between 8 and 27 % and penetration resistance increased. Inclusion of clovers (red and white) in the seed mixture increased yields at second cuts, but 30 % clover compared to 15 % did not affect yields. During these first three years of the experimental period {{there were no significant differences}} in either yield, soil physical properties or penetration resistance between wheeling with light or heavy tractors at any of the sites. At Løken and Fureneset, the experimental period was extended for two years. At Løken the experimental setup was kept the same and the yield reduction from traffic was about 15 %. At Fureneset the number of cuts and wheelings was increased from two to three times per year, and both the fertilization level and tyre pressure were also increased. This gave significant yield reductions in the third cuts. In the last year of the experimental period (2015) there was also a significant beneficial effect on yield of using a light tractor rather than a heavy tractor. Overall soil texture and soil moisture content are major factors explaining traffic effects on soil physical properties and <b>grassland</b> <b>yield.</b> It seems that these factors explain more of the yield reduction than do the weight of tractors and machinery, at least in the short run when using low tyre pressures...|$|E

In addition to silage type, concentrate supplementation, without and with (10 kg/day), was included as a factor in a 2 × 2 factorial, continuous experiment.

Increasing {{the use of}} semi-natural, species-rich grasslands for grazing and hay-making {{could serve as a}} way to bridge biodiversity conservation and livestock production but we know little about the nutritional composition of native grasslands. To determine the effect of grassland biodiversity on forage quality and the potential benefits and limitations of using conservation grasslands for agriculture, I conducted ecological and ethnobotanical research at 30 grassland sites in Oxfordshire, England. Species-richness and composition increased forage dry matter, sugar, and Phosphorus (P) content. Forage from species-rich grasslands contained up to 27 % more protein, 56 % more Phosphorus (P), 106 % more Potassium (K), and 183 % more Calcium (Ca) than cereals and conventional hay and met the nutritional requirements of beef cattle, sheep, and horses. Farmers and graziers valued species-rich grasslands were (1) the medicinal effect of specific grassland plants on livestock, (2) affordability, (3) the resilience of species-rich grasslands to drought and flooding, (4) conservation, and (5) marketability of pastoral products. The main factors inhibiting the (continued or increased) agricultural use of species-rich grasslands were restrictions on time of grazing, restrictions on time of hay-cut, and reduced <b>grassland</b> <b>yield</b> and forage quality due to recent increases in invasive plants.

The most common way to weight the green plant material is to drive over a scale, and to measure the dry extract with your own gauge. It takes in average two minutes to weight one load of green plant material. The pressure of the soil in grassland farming is also an important question. Almost all the farmers are aware of this and uses good tire equipment and drives during good weather conditions. The loss after storage can only be measured after storage through weighing. These farmers who does that means that the loss is between 10 to 20 %. The yield of the grassland is very interesting and fluctuates between 5. 5 – 15 ton per hectare.

40|$|Purpose – From the {{perspectives}} of the probable replacement of the national calamity funds by multi-peril grassland insurance, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to estimate demand for grassland production insurance. Design/methodology/approach – A discrete stochastic programming model with a three-year planning horizon was used to run simulations for farms raising suckler cows primarily with grasslands. In this model, the annual area insured and some production decisions are optimized under grasland yield uncertainty, with possible ex post production-system adjustments. The effects of insurance loading cost (14 levels), insurance coverage level (three levels), risk aversion (two levels) and stock levels (forage and animal stocks vary according to <b>grassland</b> <b>yields</b> and to farm management of the previous years) were analyzed. Findings – The results show that grassland insurance could be used as a flexible risk management tool, when farm becomes vulnerable to fodder shortfall. According to previous years’ <b>grassland</b> <b>yields</b> and to the subsequent states of hay stock and animal liveweight, the area insured could vary between nearly the none and full. Farmers with low-average stocking rate and important hay storage capacity have less incentive to buy grassland insurance. The author also demonstrates that for a given loading cost, more insurance is purchased at a coverage level of 70 percent of average yield than at higher coverage levels. The cost of self-insurance increases for important and rare losses while multi-peril grassland insurance premium decreases. Higher levels of risk aversion also raise the quantity of insurance subscribed. Eventually, insurance price is a key factor. Almost no insurance is bought for loading costs greater than 1. 1 under low-risk aversion and for loading costs greater than 1. 3 under moderate risk aversion. Research limitations/implications – The willingness to pay for insurance could have been overestimated for different reasons. First, basis risks have not been introduced in the simulation framework. Although the Forage Production Index performed quite well, basis risks are high enough to trigger inappropriate indemnifications in some cases. Consequences of these risks should be estimated in further research. Second, other self-insurance options and public emergency measures such as subsidized loan or reduction in social security contributions should also be considered to assess and reduce farmers vulnerability to risks. Practical implications – The launching of the multi-peril grassland insurance is likely to be successful thanks to the 65 percent of public subsidies on insurance premiuml. However, considering that the loading cost is likely to be high and that demand for grassland production insurance is rather low, multi-peril grassland production insurance may struggle to continue unsubsidized. Originality/value – This paper provides a framework that enables to estimate demand for grassland production insurance factoring in substitution with self-insurance and taking into account successive risks...|$|R

Our objective was to evaluate imaging spectroscopy {{as a means to}} obtain accurate, detailed, and rapid measurements of grass yield and quality. The work consisted of three steps. In the first step, a new mobile measurement system comprising several hyperspectral sensors was constructed and calibrated on measurements collected in six field experiments in the Netherlands in 2 yr. A partial least squares regression model was used to fit parameters derived from hyperspectral images to values of DM (dry matter) yield and quality obtained through destructive sampling. Leave-k-out cross validation showed relative errors of prediction of 8 to 22 % (167 ¿ 477 kg DM ha¿ 1 absolute) for DM yield, 21 % (0. 07 absolute) for the fraction of clover in DM, 6 to 12 % for nutrient concentration, 15 to 16 % for sugar concentration, and 3 to 5 % for feeding values.

40|$|The French {{government}} and private companies are {{currently working on a}} scheme to insure grassland against unfavourable weather conditions. Objectives of this study are 1) to analyse how <b>grassland</b> <b>yield</b> insurance would substitute for self insurance in suckler cow farms, 2) to assess efficiency of these insurance options and 3) to test effects of public supports on insurance demand and profit distribution. To meet these objectives, simulations have been performed thanks to a bio-economic model applied to French suckler cow farms. Different scenarios enables to isolate effects of risk aversion and self insurance, of market insurance, of insurance premium subsidies and additional direct payments. Self insurance is defined as the reduction of animal stocking rate compared to the stocking rate of a risk neutral farmer. Self insurance alone enables to reduce profit variability by 55 % but sensitivity to extreme yield conditions remains high. Rather risk-averse farmers will use both self insurance and market insurance to secure their farm against risk. Profit variation is divided by 70 % and the lowest value of profit increased by 400 %. Market insurance can indeed cover farmers the lowest forage yield at a lower cost than self insurance. Market insurance demand varies from one year to the next according to the availability of extra forage stocks. Both subsidies on insurance premium and a raise of direct payments induce an increase of expected profit and reduce value of the lowest profit. Premium subsidies decrease also standard deviation in spite of a slight increase of animal stocking rate...|$|E
40|$|Organic milk {{production}} in Norway {{has become more}} intensive, which, among other things, has led to increased focus on forage quality. The primary growth (PG) is harvested at an earlier stage of development with the consequence {{that more than half}} of the total yearly yield is from the regrowth (RG, second and third cuts). The RG contains a high proportion of clover. Thus, the RG forage has likely high crude protein content, while the PG forage has high energy value but low protein content. The use of fish meal as feed to ruminants is now prohibited, also in Norway, and alternative feed protein sources are expensive. The value of on-farm grown forage is therefore becoming even higher. The project aims to bring to light knowledge that makes dairy farmers better prepared to produce forage in high quantities and qualities as allowed by local climate and resources, adapt forage and {{milk production}} better to these constraints,and assess the economics, resource use and environmental impacts linked to forage production and feed ration with high forage quality. Specifically, the research conducted in the project seeks to answer the following questions: -	Little is known about the yield and forage quality formation in RG and how the RG should be divided between a second and a third cut under different climatic conditions. So when ought the RG to be harvested? -	Are early red clover varieties better suited than late ones in intensive harvesting regimes when it comes to sustain high yields and to even out differences in forage yield and quality between cuts? -	Will other grasses than timothy and meadow fescue perform better as companion species to red clover under intensive harvesting regimes? Are grass species and variety mixtures that are less synchronous in generative development better? -	 How should forage with high clover proportion be preserved in order to ensure high preservation of the forage protein? -	Is it possible to utilize that PG and RG silages have different feed quality by mixing them when fed? What is the best proportion of respective types in rations for high yielding cows? -	What is won and what is lost in economic terms when applying intensive harvesting regime? -	Will a mixing of PG and RG silages at feeding reduce methane emission and nitrogen loss in the cow and from the slurry storage? The primary objective is to improve the basis for tactical and strategic choices in the production, use and utilisation of grassland forage in organic milk production. Secondary objectives are to: 1.

Plant growth and consequently <b>grassland</b> <b>yields</b> depend strongly on water supply {{during the growing}} season, which is projected {{to change in the}} future. We therefore investigated the effect of summer drought on the water uptake of an intensively managed lowland and an extensively managed sub-alpine grassland in Switzerland. Summer drought was simulated by using transparent shelters. Standing above- and belowground biomass was sampled during three growing seasons. Soil and plant xylem waters were analyzed for oxygen (and hydrogen) stable isotope ratios, and the depths of plant water uptake were estimated by two different approaches: (1) linear interpolation method and (2) Bayesian calibrated mixing model. Relative to the control, aboveground biomass was reduced under drought conditions. In contrast to our expectations, lowland grassland plants subjected to summer drought were more likely (43 - 68 %) to rely on water in the topsoil (0 - 10 cm), whereas control plants relied less on the topsoil (4 - 37 %) and shifted to deeper soil layers (20 - 35 cm) during the drought period (29 - 48 %). Sub-alpine grassland plants did not differ significantly in uptake depth between drought and control plots during the drought period. Both approaches yielded similar results and showed that the drought treatment in the two grasslands did not induce a shift to deeper uptake depths, but rather continued or shifted water uptake to even more shallower soil depths. These findings illustrate the importance of shallow soil depths for plant performance under drought conditions...|$|R

40|$|Several species {{within the}} {{miscanthus}} genus (Miscanthus spp.) {{are characterized by}} high biomass yields and low production input requirements. This raised increasing interests in their applications for bioenergy. However, to date, only small areas of Miscanthus × giganteus (approximately 40, 000 ha) are commercially grown and used for generating electricity and heat in Europe, where miscanthus has been developed as bioenergy crop for more than decade. Reviewing state-of-the-art revealed four main factors limiting the implementation of miscanthus production. These are inefficient and expensive propagation techniques, land use dilemma (i. e. lack of land available for growing miscanthus), lack of varieties/genotypes adapted to various and especially to stressful environmental conditions and lack of efficient agronomic practices for miscanthus establishment. Against these limiting factors, this thesis aims to (1) evaluate the different propagation systems with regard to technologies and costs, and improve the preferred rhizome propagation techniques; (2) address the land use dilemma through exploring marginal land (i. e. non-arable land with ability to grow plants with tolerance to environmental stresses) for miscathus production; (3) and screen optimal genotypes and effective practices for establishing and managing miscanthus on marginal land in a case study on grassland. To achieve the first objective, a review, our own field trials and farmer surveys were performed. Direct seed sowing {{was found to be}} the cheapest propagation method (1, 508. 5  ha- 1 overall establishment costs) and micro-propagation the most expensive (6, 320. 8  ha- 1). Direct rhizome planting is the farmers most preferred and most applied establishment method and has moderate establishment cost of 1, 904 - 3, 375. 7  ha- 1. However, it goes along with the lowest propagation efficiency (1 : 10) and consequently restricts the availability of propagation material for large-scale plantations. However, the multiplication ratio can be increased by reducing the rhizome size. Field trial results showed that 6 -cm length is close to the minimum size of rhizome that can germinate after directly planting into field. Compared to the traditionally used macro-rhizome, the multiplication ratio of the improved rhizome propagation (using 6 -cm rhizomes) is tripled. In addition, the multiplication ratio can also be increased by transplanting rhizome- or stem-derived plantlets. However, due to higher labour and energy inputs required for the pre-growing of plantlets, their establishment cost reduction potential is limited, with estimated costs of 4, 240. 8 - 4, 400. 8  ha- 1. Direct seed sowing as the cheapest method is presently only possible for Miscanthus sinensis and not yet practical under German conditions. In addition, the seed-setting rate of M. sinensis is very low (0. 0 - 28. 7 %) under the climatic conditions of south-west Germany, making commercial seeds production difficult. For all the propagation methods considered, more research efforts are still required to reduce the material production costs and simultaneously increase the multiplication ratio. For the second objective, the production potential of miscanthus on marginal land in China was assessed. Because China has limited agricultural land resources and its non-food bioenergy policy (it is only allowed to grow energy crops on marginal land) is adamant, there is a desideration for exploiting its marginal land potential. In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, model simulation were adopted to identify the productive marginal areas for miscanthus and to estimate their biomass and bioenergy production potentials. The results show that in China there are large marginal land areas of 17, 163. 54 × 104 ha available for growing miscanthus. However, due to limitation by low winter temperatures and low precipitation levels in some areas, the total marginal area suitable for growing miscanthus is only 769. 37 × 104 ha. The Monteith radiation yield model was used to determine the potential miscanthus yield in Chinese climatic conditions. The simulation gave the actual harvestable yield levels on arable land of 18. 1 - 44. 2 odt ha- 1 yr- 1. Taking the environmental stresses of marginal conditions into account an achievable miscanthus yield potential on marginal land of 2. 1 - 32. 4 odt ha- 1 yr- 1 was calculated (varying between different marginal land types). Based on these achievable yield levels, the total miscanthus production potential on the entire suitable marginal land areas is 13, 521. 7 × 104 odt yr- 1; the corresponding bio-electricity generation and total greenhouse gas saving potentials are 183. 9 TW h yr- 1 and 21, 242. 4 × 104 t CO 2 eq. yr- 1, respectively. The spatial distribution of the suitable marginal areas shows that they are mainly concentrated in the central part of Northeast China and the Loess Plateau. Both regions are recommended as priority development zones for the Chinese miscanthus-based bioenergy industry. However, implementation of this huge marginal land potential is currently constrained by many barriers, e. g. concerns on potential ecological effects, competition for marginal land from other uses, lack of high yield varieties in marginal conditions. Lack of varieties with suitability to marginal conditions and efficient agronomic practices for the establishment on marginal land are the main barriers that limit using marginal land for miscanthus production. Therefore, stress tolerant varieties need to be selected and methods of effective establishment of miscanthus on marginal land need to be developed. Worldwide, grassland is the most important marginal land type because it has the largest terrestrial area and mild environmental stresses for growing energy crops (including miscanthus). However, it is undesirable or even legally prohibited to convert grassland into bioenergy cropland to avoid biodiversity loss and soil carbon being reduced by tilling practices. Hence, no-till establishment practices for miscanthus establishment and maintenance on grassland are investigated here under the third objectives. Our study demonstrates that miscanthus can be successfully cultivated on both good (nutrient-rich) and marginal (nutrient-poor) grassland using the proposed agronomic practices and an increased grassland productivity may be achieved through the establishment of suitable miscanthus genotypes. The recommended agronomic practices are summarized as following. Miscanthus genotypes with tall, thick shoots perform better than those with short, thin shoots. Better establishment is achieved when rhizome-derived plantlets are transplanted into pre-disturbed grassland. The grassland pre-disturbance of low vegetation cutting (5 cm) and herbicide spraying in narrow stripes is recommended for its beneficial effect on miscanthus establishment without significant negative effects on grassland productivity. Two harvests, one in late spring and one in late autumn, are optimal to achieve a high <b>grassland</b> <b>yield.</b> In this thesis, the limitation of the inefficient propagation technique was mitigated through minimizing the rhizome size and exploring the seeds propagation potential. The land-use dilemma was alleviated by exploring the marginal land production potential. Additionally, constrains of lack of genotypes and agronomic practices for the miscanthus establishment on marginal land were improved by field trials on grassland (the most important marginal land type with a huge potential). These results can improve the implementation and expansion of miscanthus production. However, in addition to constrains improved in this thesis, the miscanthus production is currently constrained by many other technical, economic and financial, social and political, environmental issues. It is unlikely that the implementation and expansion will achieve without mitigating these constrains. Further research and support should address these barriers in an integrate manner. Mehrere Arten innerhalb der Gattung Miscanthus (Miscanthus spp.) zeichnen sich durch hohe Biomasseerträge und eine effiziente Ressourcennutzung aus. Daher steigt das Interesse an ihrer Nutzung als Rohstoff für die Bioenergieerzeugung. Dennoch wird in Europa, wo innerhalb der letzten Jahrzehnte die Nutzung von Miscanthus als Bioenergiepflanze entwickelt wurde, bis heute nur der Genotyp M. × giganteus in geringem Umfang (ca. 40. 000 ha) kommerziell angebaut und zur Erzeugung von Strom und Wärme genutzt. Anhand der Überprüfung des aktuellen Wissensstands kristallisieren sich im Wesentlichen vier Hauptursachen heraus, die die Ausweitung des Miscanthusanbaus begrenzen. Neben der ineffizienten und dadurch sehr teuren Vermehrung von Miscanthus spielt vor allem der Mangel an Land, welches für den Anbau von Miscanthus verfügbar ist, eine Rolle. Zusätzlich fehlen einerseits geeignete Sorten beziehungsweise Genotypen, die an verschiedene Umweltbedingungen - vor allem auf marginalen Standorten - angepasst sind, und andererseits effiziente Verfahren zur Etablierung von Miscanthus. Ziel dieser Dissertation ist es, Lösungen für die oben genannten limitierenden Faktoren zu finden, um den weiteren Ausbau des Miscanthusanbaus zu ermöglichen. Dies soll geschehen durch (1) eine Evaluierung der vorhandenen Vermehrungsverfahren hinsichtlich der verschiedenen Technologien und jeweiligen Kosten sowie durch die Verbesserung des Verfahrens der Rhizomvermehrung; (2) die Erforschung marginaler Standorte, d. h. zur Zeit ungenutzte landwirtschaftliche Nutzflächen, die potenziell für den Anbau von stresstoleranten Kulturpflanzen in Frage kämen, auf ihre Eignung für den Anbau von Miscanthus zu überprüfen; (3) sowie die Selektion optimaler Genotypen und effizienter Verfahren für die Etablierung und Bewirtschaftung von Miscanthus auf marginalen Standorten in einer Fallstudie auf Grünland. Um das erste Ziel zu erreichen, wurden neben einer Literaturstudie und einer Umfrage unter landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben auch eigene Feldversuche durchgeführt. Es wurde festgestellt, dass Direktsaat das günstigste Vermehrungsverfahren ist (1. 508, 5  ha- 1 Gesamtetablierungskosten) und In-vitro-Vermehrung das teuerste (6. 320, 8  ha- 1). Das von landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben bevorzugte und dadurch auch am häufigsten angewandte Verfahren ist die direkte Pflanzung der Rhizome. Diese Methode ist zwar verhältnismäßig kostengünstig (1. 904 - 3. 375, 7  ha- 1), hat aber auch die geringste Vermehrungseffizienz (1 : 10), wodurch nicht ausreichend Vermehrungsmaterial für den großflächigen Miscanthusanbau zur Verfügung gestellt werden kann. Allerdings kann durch eine Verkleinerung der Rhizome die niedrige Vermehrungseffizienz bei der direkten Pflanzung der Rhizome verbessert werden. Die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit durchgeführten Feldversuche haben gezeigt, dass eine Mindestgröße der Rhizome von etwa 6 cm erforderlich ist, um ein Austreiben der Rhizome nach der Direktpflanzung nicht zu beeinträchtigen. Die Vermehrungseffizienz des bislang praxisüblichen Verfahrens der direkten Pflanzung der Rhizome kann durch die Verwendung von 6 cm langen Rhizomen verdreifacht werden. Des Weiteren kann durch das Verpflanzen von aus Rhizomen oder Stängeln gewonnenen Jungpflanzen die Vermehrungseffizienz weiter erhöht werden. Doch die Etablierungskosten sind mit geschätzten 4. 240, 8  4. 400, 8  ha- 1 auch wesentlich höher, da dieses Verfahren arbeits- und energieintensiver ist. Das günstigste Vermehrungsverfahren, die Direktsaat, ist bislang nur mit Miscanthus sinensis möglich, jedoch nicht unter den klimatischen Bedingungen Süddeutschlands, wo außerdem die Samenbildungsrate sehr niedrig ist (0, 0 bis 28, 7 %) und somit nicht für eine kommerzielle Saatgutproduktion vor Ort ausreichen würde. Folglich sind für alle hier berücksichtigten Vermehrungsmethoden weitere Forschungsanstrengungen notwendig, um sowohl die Produktionskosten zu senken als auch das Multiplikationsverhältnis zu erhöhen. Für das zweite Ziel wurde das Produktionspotenzial von Miscanthus auf Grenzertragsflächen in China berechnet. China hat nur begrenzte landwirtschaftliche Nutzflächen zur Verfügung und seine Non-Food-Bioenergiepolitik legt fest, dass nur marginales Land für den Anbau von Energiepflanzen genutzt werden darf. In dieser Studie wurde das Geographische Informationssystem (GIS) sowie eine Modellsimulation genutzt, um marginale Standorte in China für den Anbau von Miscanthus zu identifizieren, sowie ihre Biomasse- und Bioenergiepotenziale abzuschätzen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass in China theoretisch 17. 163, 54 × 104 ha marginales Land für den Anbau von Miscanthus zur Verfügung stehen. Aufgrund der Einschränkungen durch niedrige Temperaturen im Winter und geringe Niederschlagsmengen, umfassen davon jedoch die Flächen, die auch praktisch für den Anbau von Miscanthus geeignet sind, nur 769, 37 × 104 ha. Ein Strahlung-Ertrags-Modell nach Monteith wurde verwendet, um den potenziellen Miscanthusertrag unter den klimatischen Bedingungen in China zu bestimmen. Die Simulation ergab, dass der potenzielle Ertrag auf Ackerland in China zwischen 18, 1 und 44, 2 t Trockenmasse (TM) ha- 1 Jahr- 1 liegt. Wenn die Umweltbedingungen auf den Marginalstandorten berücksichtigt werden, ergibt sich für verschiedene Grenzertragsflächen ein durchschnittliches Ertragspotenzial für Miscanthus von 2, 1 bis 32, 4 t TM ha- 1 Jahr- 1. Basierend auf diesen modellierten Erträgen, ist das Biomassepotenzial von Miscanthus hochgerechnet auf die gesamten geeigneten marginalen Flächen 13. 521, 7 × 104 t TM Jahr- 1. Ausgehend von diesem Biomassepotenzial ergibt sich eine theoretische Stromerzeugung von 183, 9 TWh Jahr- 1 und somit eine theoretische Treibhausgaseinsparung von insgesamt 21. 242, 4 × 104 t CO 2 eq. Jahr- 1. Die Untersuchung der räumlichen Verteilung der geeigneten Flächen zeigt, dass sich diese vor allem auf den zentralen Teil von Nordostchina und das Löss-Plateau konzentrieren. Beide Regionen bieten sich daher als prioritäre Entwicklungszonen für die chinesische miscanthus-basierte Bioenergieindustrie an. Allerdings ist die Nutzung dieses großen Potenzials an marginalem Land zur Miscanthusnutzung in der Praxis derzeit aus mehreren Gründen nur eingeschränkt möglich. So gibt es beispielsweise Probleme hinsichtlich der ökologischen Auswirkungen der Ausweitung des Miscanthusanbaus, des Wettbewerbs um marginale Flächen, in dem der Miscanthusanbau mit anderen Verwendungsmöglichkeiten konkurriert, sowie zusätzlich des Mangels an für diese Grenzertragsflächen geeigneten Hochertragssorten. Das Fehlen von Genotypen, die an die Bedingungen marginaler Standorte angepasst sind, und ein Mangel an effizienten praxistauglichen Etablierungsverfahren verhindern bislang die Nutzung marginaler Standorte durch den Anbau von Miscanthus. Daher müssen stresstolerante Genotypen identifiziert werden sowie effektivere Methoden zur Etablierung von Miscanthus auf marginalen Standorten entwickelt werden. Weltweit stellen hierfür Grünlandflächen die bedeutendsten Marginalstandorte dar, da sie zum einen die größte Landfläche bieten und zum anderen noch relativ milde Stressfaktoren für den Anbau von Energiepflanzen (einschließlich Miscanthus) aufzeigen. Um den aus klima- und umweltschutztechnischen Gründen unerwünschten und oft gesetzlich verbotenen Grünlandumbruch zu vermeiden, wurden im dritten Teil dieser Arbeit direkte Etablierungsverfahren von Miscanthus auf Grünlandstandorten untersucht, die keine Bodenbearbeitung benötigen. Die Studie ergab, dass Miscanthus in einem speziellen Anbauverfahren sowohl in guten (nährstoffreichen) als auch in marginalen (nährstoffarmen) Grünlandbeständen integriert werden kann, wobei die Produktivität des Grünlands durch geeignete Miscanthus-Genotypen sogar verbessert werden kann. Die hierfür empfohlenen Anbautechniken können wie folgt zusammengefasst werden. Miscanthusgenotypen mit hohen, dicken Trieben entwickelten sich besser als solche mit kurzen, dünnen Trieben. Die Etablierung kann ferner dadurch optimiert werden, indem aus Rhizomen gezogene Jungpflanzen gepflanzt werden. Grundsätzlich ist es empfehlenswert, vor der Etablierung des Miscanthus einen niedrigen Schnitt des Grünlands (5 cm) mit einer anschließenden Herbizidbehandlung in schmalen Streifen zu kombinieren. Diese Bewirtschaftungsweise hat zum einen eine positive Wirkung auf die Etablierung der Miscanthusbestände und zum anderen geringe negative Auswirkungen auf die Produktivität des Grünlandes. Um hohe Grünlanderträge zu erzielen, sollte das Grünland in jedem Jahr zweimal geschnitten werden, im späten Frühjahr und im Spätherbst. In dieser Thesis konnte die geringe Effizienz der Vermehrungsverfahren von Miscanthus durch eine Verwendung kleinerer Rhizome sowie durch die Erforschung der Möglichkeit Miscanthus über Samen zu vermehren verbessert werden. Das Landnutzungs-Dilemma konnte durch eine Untersuchung des Produktionspotenzials marginaler Standorte klarer eingegrenzt werden, und in Feldversuchen konnten zusätzlich Genotypen und Anbautechniken aufgezeigt werden, die eine direkte Etablierung (ohne Bodenbearbeitung) von Miscanthus auf Gründlandstandorten, und somit auf den bedeutendsten marginalen Standorten ermöglichen. Diese Ergebnisse können dabei helfen, die Einführung und den Ausbau des Miscanthusanbaus weiter voranzutreiben. Allerdings gibt es neben den Limitationen, die in dieser Arbeit diskutiert werden, viele weitere technische, ökonomische, soziale, politische und ökologische Belange, ohne deren Berücksichtigung eine zunehmende Einführung und Ausweitung des Miscanthusanbaus unwahrscheinlich bleibt. Zusätzlich bedarf es daher weiterer Forschung, in der diese Probleme im Gesamtzusammenhang betrachtet und bearbeitet werden...|$|E
40|$|For crop management, {{information}} on the actual status of the crop is important for taking decisions on nitrogen supply, water supply or harvesting. One {{would also like to}} take into account the local spatial variation of the crop. Remote sensing has proved to be a useful technique for estimating and mapping the spatial variation of various biophysical variables. Calibration of the image data is crucial in the performance and applicability of this technique. The aim of this paper is to show the possibility to calibrate remotely sensed imagery using fast and non-destructive close-range (below 1. 3 m height) sensing instruments, thus providing a means for the assessment of plant characteristics over large areas at low costs. This concept was tested on a homogeneously managed grassland field, subdivided into 20 plots of 15 x 3 m, at the end of July 2004. Reflected radiation was recorded with an active close-range sensing device, consisting of a visible light and near-infrared (NIR) imaging spectrograph, and a 3 CCD camera, equipped with special band filters (central wavelengths are at 600, 710 and 800 nm). An airborne campaign with a four-band UltraCam digital CCD camera was used for extrapolation to larger scales. Plots were harvested, and fresh and dry biomass and leaf nitrogen content were determined. Partial least squares (PLS) models combining spectral and spatial information from the close-sensing device yielded acceptable results in predicting <b>grassland</b> <b>yields</b> and nitrogen content. Subsequently, these predictions were used to calibrate a model with the image data of the remote sensing device. These were then compared, using leave-one-out cross-validation, with the measured field variables, and the model proved to have an acceptable predictive power...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the economic impacts of summer drought on Swiss grassland production. We combine field trial data from drought experiments {{in three different}} grasslands in Switzerland with site-specific information on economic costs and benefits. The analysis focuses on the economic implications of drought effects on <b>grassland</b> <b>yields</b> as well as grassland composition. In agreement with earlier studies, we found rather heterogeneous yield effects of drought on Swiss grassland systems, with significantly reduced yields {{as a response to}} drought at the lowland and sub-alpine sites, but increased yields at the wetter pre-alpine site. Relative yield losses were highest at the sub-alpine site (with annual yield losses of up to 37 %). However, because income from grassland production at extensive sites relies to a large extent on ecological direct payments, even large yield losses had only limited implications in terms of relative profit reductions. In contrast, negative drought impacts at the most productive, intensively managed lowland site were dominant, with average annual drought-induced profit margin reductions of about 28 %. This is furthermore emphasized if analyzing the farm level perspective of drought impacts. Combining site-specific effects at the farm level, we found that in particular farms with high shares of lowland grassland sites suffer from summer droughts in terms of farm-level fodder production and profit margins. Moreover, our results showed that the higher competitiveness of weeds (broad-leaved dock) under drought conditions will require increasing attention on weed control measures in future grassland production systems. Taking into account that the risk of drought occurrence is expected to increase in the coming years, additional instruments to cope with drought risks in fodder production and finally farmers’ income have to be developed...|$|R
40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} to calculate carbon fluxes from agricultural soils. The model includes the effects of crop (species, yield and rotation), climate (temperature, rainfall and evapotranspiration) and soil (carbon content and water retention capacity) on the carbon budget of agricultural land. The changes in quality of crop residues and organic material {{as a result of}} changes in CO 2 concentration and changed management were not considered in this model. The model was parameterized for several arable crops and grassland. Data from agricultural, meteorological, soil, and land use databases were input to the model, and the model was used to evaluate the effects of different carbon dioxide mitigation measures on soil organic carbon in agricultural areas in Europe. Average carbon fluxes under the business as usual scenario in the 2008 – 2012 commitment period were estimated at 0. 52 tC ha− 1 y− 1 in grassland and − 0. 84 tC ha− 1 y− 1 in arable land. Conversion of arable land to <b>grassland</b> <b>yielded</b> a flux of 1. 44 tC ha− 1 y− 1. Farm management related activities aiming at carbon sequestration ranged from 0. 15 tC ha− 1 y− 1 for the incorporating of straw to 1. 50 tC ha− 1 y− 1 for the application of farmyard manure. Reduced tillage yields a positive flux of 0. 25 tC ha− 1 y− 1. The indirect effect associated with climate was an order of magnitude lower. A temperature rise of 1 °C resulted in a − 0. 05 tC ha− 1 y− 1 change whereas the rising CO 2 concentrations gave a 0. 01 tC ha− 1 y− 1 change. Estimates are rendered on a 0. 5 × 0. 5 ° grid for the commitment period 2008 – 2012. The study reveals considerable regional differences in the effectiveness of carbon dioxide abatement measures, resulting from the interaction between crop, soil and climate. Besides, there are substantial differences between the spatial patterns of carbon fluxes that result from different measure...|$|R
40|$|Global {{food demand}} is {{expected}} to increase, affecting required land, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs along with unintended emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG) and losses of N and P. To quantify these input requirements and associated emissions/losses {{as a function of}} food demand, we built a comprehensive model of the food system and investigated the effects of multiple interventions in the food system on multiple environmental goals. Model outcomes are compared to planetary boundaries for land system change, climate change and the global N and P cycles to identify interventions that direct us towards a safe operating space for humanity. Results show a transgression of most boundaries already for 2010 and a drastic deterioration in the reference scenario for 2050 in which no improvements relative to 2010 were implemented. We defined the following improvements for 2050 : reduction of waste, less consumption of animal products, higher feed conversion efficiency, higher crop and <b>grassland</b> <b>yields,</b> reduction of N and P losses from agricultural land and reduction of ammonia (NH 3) volatilization. The effects of these measures were quantified individually and in combination. Significant trade-offs and synergies in our results underline the importance of a comprehensive analysis with respect to the entire food system, including multiple measures and environmental goals. The combination of all measures was able to partly prevent transgression of the boundaries for: agricultural area requirement, GHG emission and P flow into the ocean. However, global mineral N and P fertilizer inputs and total N loss to air and water still exceeded their boundaries in our study. The planetary boundary concept is discussed in relation to the selected variables and boundary values, including the additional necessity of eliminating the dependency of our food production on finite P reserves. We argue that total N loss is a better indicator of the environmental impacts of the global N cycle than fertilizer N input. Most measures studied in this paper are also on the agenda of the United Nations for Sustainable Development, which gives added support to their implementation...|$|R
40|$|Canopy {{water content}} (CWC) is {{important}} for understanding the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Biogeochemical processes like photosynthesis, transpiration and net primary production are related to foliar water. The first derivative of the reflectance spectrum at wavelengths corresponding to the left slope of the minor water absorption band at 970 nm {{was found to be}} highly correlated with CWC and PROSAIL model simulations showed that it was insensitive to differences in leaf and canopy structure, soil background and illumination and observation geometry. However, these wavelengths are also located close to the water vapour absorption band at about 940 nm. In order to avoid interference with absorption by atmospheric water vapour, the potential of estimating CWC using the first derivative at the right slope of the 970 nm absorption feature was studied. Measurements obtained with an ASD FieldSpec spectrometer for three test sites were related to CWC (calculated as the difference between fresh and dry weight). The first site was a homogeneous grassland parcel with a grass/clover mixture. The second site was a heterogeneous floodplain with natural vegetation like grasses and various shrubs. The third site was an extensively grazed fen meadow. Results for all three test sites showed that the first derivative of the reflectance spectrum at the right slope of the 970 nm absorption feature was linearly correlated with CWC. Correlations were a bit lower than those at the left slope (at 942. 5 nm) as shown in previous studies, but better than those obtained with water band indices. FieldSpec measurements showed that one may use any derivative around the middle of the right slope within the interval between 1015 nm and 1050 nm. We calculated the average derivative at this interval. The first site with <b>grassland</b> <b>yielded</b> an R 2 of 0. 39 for the derivative at the previously mentioned interval with CWC (based on 20 samples). The second site at the heterogeneous floodplain yielded an R 2 of 0. 45 for this derivative with CWC (based on 14 samples). Finally, the third site with the fen meadow yielded an R 2 of 0. 68 for this derivative with CWC (based on 40 samples). Regression lines between the derivative at the right slope of the 970 nm absorption feature and CWC for all three test sites were similar although vegetation types were quite different. This indicates that results may be transferable to other vegetation types and other site...|$|R

The overall performance of LINGRA-N is fair for perennial ryegrass (RMSE% < 25 %) and good for cock’s foot and S 72 (RMSE% < 15 %).

A higher total DM yield was obtained under sheep grazing (P< 0. 05) than under cattle grazing, whereas grazing by cattle resulted in higher values of dead plant material compared to grazing by sheep (P< 0. 01). Application of 150 kg ha- 1 N resulted in 19. 2 % higher <b>grassland</b> DM <b>yield</b> in comparison with N 0 (P< 0. 01). Sheep grazing was less detrimental to legumes DM yield than was cattle grazing (P< 0. 05), whereas omission of N application (N 0) resulted in higher legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield compared to N 150 (P< 0. 01). A grazing management x N rate interaction (P< 0. 05) was recorded for legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield. Application of 150 kg ha- 1 N resulted in 29 % higher grasses DM yield and 9 % in higher grasses contribution to total DM yield in comparison with N 0 (P< 0. 01).

Analysis of data from ‘De Marke’ and from monitoring projects shows that grassland production and utilization can be improved by changes in operational <b>grassland</b> management.
