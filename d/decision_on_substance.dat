DD relates positively to impulsivity and is present in patients with various types of addictions and other disorders involving impulsivity. This article aims at presenting DD and its relation to addiction based on a review of studies that examined this relationship and the applicability of the results as a measure of impulsivity.

Few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to this new phenomenon in the drug field, but methodological difficulties to detect them are considerable.

40|$|Few {{substantive}} {{areas have}} merited as little empirical scrutiny as the Supreme Court's <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> {{the conduct of}} United States foreign policy Many scholars have seemingly accepted as axiomatic that Court <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> foreign policy have been rare and almost always supportive of the President. We challenge these twin assumptions and demonstrate that the Supreme Court has repeatedly issued <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>substance</b> and process of American foreign policy, and that while generally supportive of the executive branch, the High Court has often ruled against it. More-over, we model the outcomes of these decisions emphasizing the impor-tance of the constitutional basis of laws and issues raised in judicial deci-sion-making. We find that the executive branch is least likely to be supported when a case involved civil liberties, and when the executive powers claimed by the President were neither expressly permitted nor prohibited by the Constitution. The executive branch {{is more likely to}} emerge victorious when the case involved the supremacy of federal over state law, foreign actors, or the President's constitutional powers.

40|$|This {{concept paper}} for a {{guidance}} document provides a first draft {{based on the}} outcome of a BfR workshop* on how evaluation of endocrine effects of active substances, safeners or synergists to be used in plant protection products might be conducted. Its development has become necessary in the context of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market of the European Community. Even though the criteria developed and the data set used as a basis for toxicological analysis of such substances are considered to be specific for plant protection products, it is recognized that a guidance document once developed might also have implications for other classes of substances such as biocides or chemicals under REACh. It is recommended that the proposed measures should be tested upon a certain number of plant protection products to examine their applicability and to facilitate improvement of the framework. Concerning specific scientific criteria for the assessment of endocrine disrupting properties, a tiered approach for decision making is proposed reflecting single steps of the regulatory <b>decision</b> process <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> with endocrine disrupting properties for their use in plant protection products. In a first step all available data are evaluated in an endpoint-based manner. In a second step mechanisms of toxicity are analysed if present. Human relevance of these mechanisms of toxicity is examined in a third step. The fourth step consists of a decision. In this context two options are proposed which may be regarded as alternatives, representing to some extent complementary procedures: An exposure-based approach and a classification-based manner. *[URL]...|$|R

For transparency and openness, SEAFO accords accessibility of observers to its meetings and to its documents. SEAFO Scientific Committee provides scientific advice to the Commission on the conservation and management issues such as the status of the resources and the harvesting levels. Subsidiary bodies may be established by the Commission, as needs arise, from time-to-time.

3000|$|Long-term {{strategies}} of the EU are on the development and adaptation of legislative instruments and policy action that enable hazard identification, risk assessment and risk management of EDCs. Specifically, current initiatives such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Environment and Health Strategy (SCALE) shall serve as legislative frameworks {{in support of the}} regulation of EDCs. Relevant recent developments were the adoption of regulation 1907 / 2006 (REACH), formally adopted on 18 December 2006, the proposal for a directive setting environmental quality standards for priority substances under the water framework directive (2006) or the new pesticide regulation 1107 / 2009 EEC [14, 15] (to be applied in the European Union from 14 June 2011). Specifically, REACH requires an authorization (and/or replacement by suitable alternative substances or technologies) for substances with endocrine disrupting properties, for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment which give rise to an equivalent level of concern as CMR-substances (carcinogens, mutagens, toxic for reproduction - the two highest categories each), PBT-substances (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) and vPvB substances (very persistent and very bioaccumulative). For pesticides with similar properties as these so-called REACH-SVCHs (substances of very high concern according to REACH article 57) no authorization shall be granted according to the new Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009. Regarding wildlife, the new [...] "endocrine cut-off criterion" [...] states: [...] "An active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, {{on the basis of the}} assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines, it is not considered to have endocrine disrupting properties that may cause adverse effects on non-target organisms unless the exposure of non-target organisms to that active substance in a plant protection product under realistic proposed conditions of use is negligible" [...] (EC 1107 / 2009, Annex II, 3.8. 2). Thus, a paradigm shift in regulatory decision making was introduced for pesticides with endocrine properties: Instead of the established risk-based approach, a hazard-based approach is now required (i.e. only the proven presence or assumed absence of endocrine disrupting properties shall be decisive for a [non]authorization). However, specific scientific criteria to support regulatory <b>decision</b> making <b>on</b> <b>substances</b> with endocrine disrupting properties both under REACH and the new pesticide regulation are lacking today and thus have to be developed and agreed upon (at least in the EU) within the near future.|$|R
