50|$|Darker {{than the}} {{previous}} album, and with a higher presence of synthesizers, effects and electronic sequences, Fin del Mundo represented a kind of confluence to Richter´s essence, an acid, ironic and paradoxical combination of extremes, from party to sorrow. With a rather futuristic and apocalyptic concept, the double sense of the album name (“End of the World”), as “end of times” and also referring to the geographical position of Argentina in the map, wrapped intriguing lyrics that called to celebration among <b>defeat,</b> <b>confusion,</b> decadence and marginality.|$|E
40|$|Questions {{frequently}} asked when introduced as a co-author of Radical Sydney (2010) are: “What is radicalism?”; “Is radicalism dead?”; and specifically {{with regard to}} Australia, “Where is radicalism today?”. Often, it seems, the unstated, implied premise behind {{some of these questions}} is that radicalism once was, but is no more, a questioning underpinned by senses of <b>defeat,</b> <b>confusion,</b> with a hint of nostalgia thrown in...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{claims that}} besides {{training}} and equipment shortcomings, Argentine command structure was {{another source of}} problems that affected the military operations during the Falklands/Malvinas Campaign during April-June 1982. Consequently, the flawed command structure {{can be seen as}} a contributing factor in Argentina’s military <b>defeat.</b> Improvisation, <b>confusion,</b> lack of coordination, and desperation prevailed along the command structure throughout the conflict. Operational and tactical commands were seem to be pulling apart between the political imperatives of the High Command in Buenos Aires that transcended to the islands and the military imperatives of the front. This handicap was critical to conduct operations. By using official documents, reports and accounts and the own participants’ testimonies, this paper clarifies the issues connected with the structure of the Argentine High Command and it furthers our understanding of how the Argentine armed forces functioned. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of psychological treatments for PTSD {{is likely to}} be enhanced by improved understanding of the factors involved in maintaining the disorder. Ehlers and Clark [A cognitive model of persistent posttraumatic stem disorder Behav. Res. Ther. 38 (2000) 319 - 345] recently proposed a cognitive model of maintenance. The current study aimed to investigate several cognitive factors highlighted in Ehlers and Clark's model using a prospective design. Fifty-seven victims of physical or sexual assault participated in the study. Cognitive factors were assessed within 4 months of assault and victims were followed-up 6 and 9 months after the assault. Cognitive variables which significantly predicted PTSD severity at both follow-ups were: cognitive processing style during assault (mental <b>defeat,</b> mental <b>confusion,</b> detachment); appraisal of assault sequelae (appraisal of symptoms, perceived negative responses of others, permanent change); negative beliefs about self and world; and maladaptive control strategies (avoidance/safety seeking). Relationships between early appraisals, control strategies, and processing styles and subsequent PTSD severity remained significant after statistically controlling for gender and perceived assault severity. These findings support the cognitive model of PTSD proposed by Ehlers and Clark and suggest that effective treatment will need to address these cognitive factors...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive factors {{hypothesised}} {{to influence}} the development and maintenance of PTSD were investigated. 92 assault victims completed questionnaires assessing a range of cognitive variables. Factors relating to onset of PTSD were investigated by comparing victims who did and who did not suffer PTSD. Factors relating to maintenance of PTSD were investigated by comparing victims who had recovered from PTSD with victims who had persistent PTSD. Cognitive factors associated with both onset and maintenance of PTSD were: appraisal of aspects of the assault itself (mental <b>defeat,</b> mental <b>confusion,</b> appraisal of emotions); appraisal of the sequelae of the assault (appraisal of symptoms, perceived negative responses of others, permanent change); dysfunctional strategies (avoidance/safety seeking) and global beliefs impacted by assault. Cognitive factors that were associated only {{with the onset of}} PTSD were: detachment during assault; failure to perceive positive responses from others and mental undoing. Relationships between the cognitive variables and PTSD remained significant when variations in perceived and objective assault severity were statistically controlled. The cognitive factors identified in the study may contribute to PTSD directly, by generating a sense of ongoing threat, or indirectly, by motivating cognitive and behavioural strategies that prevent recovery, or by affecting the nature of the traumatic memory...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{important}} obligations of the instructor {{is to set up}} the learning situation in such a manner that each trainee {{will be able to see}} evidence of progress and achieve some degree of success. Experiences that produce feelings of <b>defeat,</b> frustration, anger, <b>confusion,</b> or futility are unpleasant for the student. If, for example, an instructor attempts to teach advanced concepts on the initial engagement, the student is likely to feel inferior and be frustrated. Impressing upon students the difficulty of a task to be learned can make the teaching task difficult. Usually it is better to tell students that a problem or task, although difficult, is within their capability to understand or perform. Every learning experience does not have to be entirely successful, nor does the student have to master each lesson completely. However, every learning experience should contain elements that leave the student with some good feelings. A student’s chance of success is definitely increased if the learning experience is a pleasant one.|$|R
