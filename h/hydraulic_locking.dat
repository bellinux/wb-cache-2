A general one-dimensional solution of the Reynolds equation which governs <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> is presented. The solution embraces the particular solutions of past workers, and allows ready solution for piston-cylinder configurations for which a one-dimensional solution is adequate. A general method for making full solutions of the Reynolds equation is presented, requiring {{the use of a}} digital computer for particular solutions. Pressure distribution, the lateral force on the piston which produces <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock,</b> and the location of the lateral force can be obtained. The commonly occurring case of a single-land piston lying tilted in its bore is examined in detail.

50|$|Stealths {{restraint}} system {{consists of a}} thick, rigid lap bar and two thin, flexible over-the-shoulder restraints.

40|$|Material {{feeding and}} {{handling}} {{systems have been}} cited {{as one of the}} most common causes of process downtime where thermochemical conversion processes are concerned. New and emerging fuels come in a variety of forms, and if such fuels are to be deployed widely it is imperative that material feeding and handling systems are designed appropriately. This study proposes an approach for designing material feeding and handling systems for use with coarse solid fuels. The data obtained from this study indicates particle size to be one of the key issues affecting the flowability of bulk solids further to the uniformity in particle shape. Coarse bulk solid samples were shown to flow more freely than their milled and pulverised counterparts, generating higher degrees of flowability. The results from this study were also applied to a new feed system used for feeding solid fuels to high pressure processes named the <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lock</b> Hopper. In this study the <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lock</b> Hopper demonstrated the feeding of wood pellets, torrefied spruce pellets, and ground anthracite coal grains against a pressure of 25 barg in two modes of operation.

40|$|The paper {{collects}} {{some examples}} of CFD application to hydraulic components design, aimed at showing how a complex tool can be used both for the internal flow characterisation and the macroscopic analysis of component behaviour. In its first part, the paper deals with the steady-state characterisation of a commercial 4 / 3 on Zoff distributor, and focuses the attention on CFD strategies used {{in order to obtain}} an accurate description of steady-state axial flow-forces, acting on the spool of the component. The solution of simplified models (axis-symmetric) and the development of an extended and novel non-dimensionalization technique are the key to the use of a limited number of distributor configurations and a minimum number of operational conditions to obtain a full characterisation of the component. The second part of the paper is devoted to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>locking</b> analysis, where CFD is applied to tapered 3 D geometry in order to validate the results of specific design assumptions and to verify the results obtained by a simplified, though two-dimensional, approach to radial forces estimation in spool valves. As a final example, {{the last part of the}} paper is dedicated to particle tracking analysis and collisioni erosion prediction, using a simplified approach based on the hypothesis of uncoupled motion of fluid and particles. In this last case, the CFD computed flow field, is used in arder to allow the solution of the lagrangian equations of motion for solid particles dragged by the fluid according to a given law. The aim of the examples collected is not the solution of the problems dealt with (to this purpose the reader is referred to the bibliography), but rather the identification of areas and methods where the application of a complex and expensive design toollike CFD analysis can reach the breakeven point of a convenient application in the design phase of a hydrauliccomponent...|$|E

40|$|The {{large size}} of the cab of an {{electro-hydraulic}} elevator necessitates the arrangement of two cylinders located symmetrically {{on both sides of}} the cab.

50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lock</b> {{can occur}} in steam engines due to steam {{condensing}} back into water. In most steam engine designs {{there must be a}} small moment {{at the end of the}} return stroke of the piston when all the valves are shut and it is compressing any remaining steam. Water can be introduced from the boiler or in a cold engine, steam will condense to water on the cool walls of the cylinders and can potentially hydrolock an engine. This is just as damaging as it is to internal combustion engines and in the case of a steam locomotive can be very dangerous as a broken connecting rod could puncture the firebox/boiler and cause a steam explosion. Steam engines (with the exception of small model and toy machines) are always fitted with cylinder drain cocks which are opened to allow excess water and steam to escape during warm up.|$|R
