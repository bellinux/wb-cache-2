40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{modeling}} the random field (amplitude) in a reverberation chamber (RC) were conducted either by fitting a given distribution to measured data or by comparing different distributions using goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests. However, the GOF tests are inappropriate for comparing different distribution candidates {{in that they}} are meant to check if a given <b>distribution</b> <b>provides</b> an adequate fit for a set of data or not and they cannot provide correct relative fitness between different candidate distributions in general. A fair comparison of different distributions in modeling the RC field is missing in the literature. In this paper, Akaike's information criterion (AIC), which allows fair comparisons of different distributions, is introduced. With Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami, Bessel K, and Weibull distributions as the candidate set, the AIC approach is applied to measured data in an RC. Results show that the Weibull <b>distribution</b> <b>provides</b> the best fit to the field in an undermoded RC and that the Rayleigh <b>distribution</b> <b>provides</b> the best approximation of the field in an overmoded RC. In addition, it is found that both the Rician and Weibull <b>distributions</b> <b>provide</b> improved approximations of the field in an RC loaded with lossy objects. This study provides correct complementary results to the previous RC studies...|$|R
