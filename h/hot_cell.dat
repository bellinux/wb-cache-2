Craven meets Harcourt and Pendleton at the House of Commons where an inquiry is taking place into the sale of International Irradiated Fuels (IIF) – Northmoor's owners – to the Fusion Corporation of Kansas, owned by Jerry Grogan (Kenneth Nelson). Pendleton tells Craven that he believes Grogan was behind Emma's death. Returning to Yorkshire for Emma's funeral, Craven is refused permission to seek a warrant to enter Northmoor. Returning home, he is observed by McCroon (Sean Caffrey).|$|E
5|$|Shooting on Edge of Darkness {{began on}} 9 July 1984 {{and ran for}} five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the {{headquarters}} of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the O2 building) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the <b>hot</b> <b>cell</b> a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we knew when we were making it {{that it was a good}} piece of work” while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works”.|$|E
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford site 327 Building, {{built in}} 1953, {{played a key}} role in reactor {{material}} and fuel research programs. The facility includes nine shielded <b>hot</b> <b>cells,</b> a fuel storage basin, dry sample storage, and a large inerted <b>hot</b> (SERF) <b>cell.</b> In 1996, the 327 Building was transferred from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to Fluor Hanford, Inc., to begin the transition from the mission of irradiated fuel examination to stabilization and deactivation. In 2001, a multi-contractor team conducted a review of the concept of intact (one piece) removal, packaging, and disposal of the 327 <b>hot</b> <b>cells.</b> This paper focuses on challenges related to preparing the 327 Building <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> for intact one-piece disposal as Low Level Waste (LLW) at the Hanford Site. These challenges, described in this paper, are threefold and include: Sampling and characterization of the cells for low level waste designation; Packaging of the cells for transportation and waste disposal; Transportation from the facility to the disposal site. The primary technical challenges in one-piece removal, packaging, and disposal of the <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> involve the techniques required to characterize, remove, handle, package and transport a large (approximately up to 12 -feet long and 8 -feet high) contaminated object that weighs 35 to 160 tons. Specific characterization results associated with two <b>hot</b> <b>cells,</b> G and H cells will be reported. A review of the activities and plans to stabilize and deactivate the 327 Building provides insight into the technical challenges faced by this project and identifies a potential opportunity to modify the baseline strategy by removing the <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> in one piece instead of decontaminating and dismantling the cells...|$|R

25|$|The {{glass inside}} a {{cylinder}} {{is usually a}} black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using <b>hot</b> <b>cell</b> systems. Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop {{the formation of the}} volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, strontium-90 {{contamination}} in the reactor facility led the NRC to require PermaGrain to begin decontamination work, and the Pennsylvania DEP commissioned a [...] "site characterization study". In 1998, a firm named NES began the cleanup work; {{they changed their}} name to Scientech in 1999 and to EnergySolutions in 2006. The cleanup was originally estimated to take six months; by 2006 it had taken 8 years and cost $30million. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Bureau of Radiation Protection: [...] "Inadequate characterization of the site {{and the presence of}} ongoing industrial operations resulted in many project delays and increased costs." [...] The hot cells proved to have more radioactive sources than originally thought. In October 1998 a Scientech worker doing decontamination cut a tube in <b>hot</b> <b>cell</b> number 4, which accidentally released strontium-90 into PermaGrain's work area. As a result, a robot had to be constructed to remove 3,000curies of cobalt-60 in two of the hot cells, dismantle cell 4, and decontaminate the rest remotely.|$|E

2500|$|Salts {{freezing}} - Fluoride salt mixtures have melting points {{ranging from}} 300 to 600°C (...) [...] The salts, {{especially those with}} beryllium fluoride, are very viscous near their freezing point. This requires careful design and freeze protection in the containment and heat exchangers. Freezing must be prevented in normal operation, during transients, and during extended downtime. The primary loop salt contains the decay heat-generating fission products, which help to maintain the required temperature. For the MSBR, ORNL planned on keeping the entire reactor room (the <b>hot</b> <b>cell)</b> at high temperature. This avoided the need for individual electric heater lines on all piping and provided more even heating of the primary loop components. One [...] "liquid oven" [...] concept developed for molten salt-cooled, solid-fueled reactors employs a separate buffer salt pool containing the entire primary loop. Because of the high heat capacity and considerable density of the buffer salt, the buffer salt prevents fuel salt freezing and participates in the passive decay heat cooling system, provides radiation shielding and reduces deadweight stresses on primary loop components. This design could also be adopted for LFTRs.|$|E
2500|$|Proliferation {{risk from}} {{reprocessing}} - Effective reprocessing implies a proliferation risk. LFTRs {{could be used}} to handle plutonium from other reactors as well. However, as stated above, plutonium is chemically difficult to separate from thorium and plutonium cannot be used in bombs if diluted in large amounts of thorium. In addition, the plutonium produced by the thorium fuel cycle is mostly Pu-238, which produces high levels of spontaneous neutrons and decay heat that make it impossible to construct a fission bomb with this isotope alone, and extremely difficult to construct one containing even very small percentages of it. The heat production rate of 567W/kg means that a bomb core of this material would continuously produce several kilowatts of heat. The only cooling route is by conduction through the surrounding high explosive layers, which are poor conductors. This creates unmanageably high temperatures that would destroy the assembly. The spontaneous fission rate of 1204kBq/g is over twice that of Pu-240. Even very small percentages of this isotope would reduce bomb yield drastically by [...] "predetonation" [...] due to neutrons from spontaneous fission starting the chain reaction causing a [...] "fizzle" [...] rather than an explosion. Reprocessing itself involves automated handling in a fully closed and contained <b>hot</b> <b>cell,</b> which complicates diversion. Compared to today's extraction methods such as PUREX, the pyroprocesses are inaccessible and produce impure fissile materials, often with large amounts of fission product contamination. While not a problem for an automated system, it poses severe difficulties for would-be proliferators.|$|E

40|$|Spallation neutron sources expose {{materials}} to high energy (> 100 MeV) proton and neutron spectra. Although {{numerous studies have}} investigated the effects of radiation damage in a lower energy neutron flux from fission or fusion reactors on the mechanical properties of materials, very little work has been performed on the effects that exposure to a spallation neutron spectrum has on the mechanical properties of materials. These effects can be significantly different than those observed in a fission or fusion reactor spectrum because exposure to high energy protons and neutrons produces more He and H along with the atomic displacement damage. Los Alamos National Laboratory has unique facilities to {{study the effects of}} spallation radiation damage on the mechanical properties of materials. The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) has a pulsed linear accelerator which operates at 800 MeV and 1 mA. The Los Alamos Spallation Radiation Effect Facility (LASREF) located {{at the end of this}} accelerator is designed to allow the irradiation of components in a proton beam while water cooling these components and measuring their temperature. After irradiation, specimens can be investigated at <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> located at the Chemical Metallurgy Research Building. Wing 9 of this facility contains 16 <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> set up in two groups of eight, each having a corridor in the center to allow easy transfer of radioactive shipments into and out of the <b>hot</b> <b>cells.</b> These corridors have been used to prepare specimens for shipment to collaborating laboratories such as PNNL, ORNL, BNL, and the Paul Scherrer Institute to perform specialized testing at their <b>hot</b> <b>cells.</b> The LANL <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> contain capabilities for opening radioactive components and testing their mechanical properties as well as preparing specimens from irradiated components...|$|R

40|$|This CSER {{gives the}} limits for {{the storage of}} one-gallon cans in the <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> and the SERF in the 327 Building. The 327 Building is used to perform post {{irradiation}} testing of fissionable materials in remotely manipulated <b>hot</b> <b>cells.</b> Historically, scrap pieces of fuel cladding, cleanup materials, and other items have been placed into one-gallon paint cans for storage and ultimately disposal. These cans of materials had been assumed to contain no (or essentially no) fissionable materials, and therefore were not specifically controlled for material accountability. Recently, eight cans with high radiation levels were selected to be assayed for content. These cans contained from 0 to 2. 5 grams of fissionable material, {{with an average of}} 1 gram per can. Since several of the <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> contained a significant quantity of the cans, concerns were raised as to whether a CPS nonconformance had occurred, and should the cans have some limits for operation placed on them. This analysis is a response to the concerns raised, and gives guidance for incorporating operating limits for the one-gallon waste cans...|$|R
30|$|It may be {{appropriate}} to consider PQ of <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> in conjunction with OQ, {{as there is no}} significant difference in their mode of operation during the preparation of the RPs or at rest. On the other hand, this is not true in case of manual or semi-automated operations, when manipulations may affect laminar flow pattern, e.g. due to the movement of the operating personnel arms through the gloves. Thus, the above test should be executed both at rest (OQ) and “in operation” (PQ). As for particle monitoring, it has to be noted that radioactivity may strongly influence the instrument response, as radiation pulses may be erroneously “counted” by the particle monitoring system, and thus particle contamination may be overestimated. Keeping this in mind, for <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> dedicated to automated preparation or dispensing operations, PQ tests should be performed during their normal work cycles (e.g. during the preparation or the dispensing of the intended radiopharmaceuticals). In case of <b>hot</b> <b>cells</b> used for manual RP preparations, which are typically performed by personnel through suitable sealed gloves, PQ tests should be performed during normal workflow (e.g. during the preparation of Tc- 99  m labelled kits).|$|R

The proposed algorithm dynamically controls the associations of relay stations to base stations, and the associations of mobile users to relay stations and base stations.
