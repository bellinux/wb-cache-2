5|$|In 1979, before {{construction}} had <b>even</b> <b>begun,</b> {{there was}} {{opposition to the}} construction of Trump Tower and other buildings in the area. The New York Committee for a Balanced Building Boom was concerned about the planned rezoning of the area that would arise due {{to the construction of}} high-rise towers along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 57th Streets.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first major}} book, What Not to Wear, was {{published}} in 2002. It gained them a British Book Award in 2003 for The TV & Film Book of the Year. The book outsold popular television chefs Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson when sale figures reached a total of 670,000 copies, selling 300,000 copies in just fifteen weeks. It was also selling 45,000 copies a week at one point, and had sold 250,000 copies before the peak book selling season had <b>even</b> <b>begun.</b> What Not to Wear made sales worth £8.7 million {{which led to a}} £2 million book deal to produce more of their fashion books.|$|E

5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The reform was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This reform was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the reform was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The reform is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|Second, Amenhotep I {{appears to}} have nearly {{finished}} preparations for a sed festival, or <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> celebrating it; but Amenhotep I's reign is usually given only 21 years and a sed festival traditionally cannot be celebrated any earlier than a ruler's 30th year. If Amenhotep I had a significant co-regency with his father, {{some have argued that}} he planned to celebrate his Sed Festival on the date he was first crowned instead of the date that he began ruling alone. This would better explain the degree of completion of his Sed Festival preparations at Karnak. There are two contemporary New Kingdom examples of the breaking of this tradition; Hatshepsut celebrated her Heb Sed Festival in her 16th year and Akhenaten celebrated a Sed Festival near the beginning of his 17-year reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the 11 November bombing halt was that the average daily sortie rate over southern Laos rose to 620 per day before the new campaign had <b>even</b> <b>begun.</b> The freeing of aircraft (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) {{that had previously been}} participating in Rolling Thunder, when combined with those from Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound (which were both superseded by Commando Hunt), promised to create an interdiction effort of unprecedented scale. The new sensor-directed effort would see, for the first time, continuous round-the-clock bombing of the communist logistical system. During daylight, the missions would be performed by propeller-driven and jet fighter-bombers and B-52s. At night, fixed-wing gunships would prowl for prey. The new effort would also be supported by aerial defoliation missions (Operation Ranch Hand) and the cloud-seeding weather modification effort known as Operation Popeye (see Ho Chi Minh Trail). On 15 November 1968 the Seventh Air Force was granted authorization for launch of Commando Hunt.|$|E

5|$|Having {{failed to}} defeat the RAF, the Luftwaffe adopted a {{different}} and clearer strategy of strategic bombing known as The Blitz. However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had <b>even</b> <b>begun.</b> The end result of the air campaign against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and {{that there would be a}} Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The first Quatermass film {{had been}} a major success for Hammer and, eager for a sequel, they {{purchased}} the rights to Nigel Kneale's follow-up before the BBC had <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> transmission of the new serial. For this adaptation, Nigel Kneale himself was allowed to write {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, although subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest. The plot is a condensed but largely faithful retelling of the original television serial. The main difference between the two versions is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass blasts off in a rocket to confront the aliens in outer space, whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, to destroy the aliens' asteroid base. Returning director Val Guest once again employed many cinema vérité techniques to present the fantastic elements of the plot with the greatest degree of realism. Nigel Kneale was critical of the final film, mainly on account of the return of Brian Donlevy in the lead role. Kneale was unhappy with Donlevy's interpretation of the character and also claimed the actor's performance was marred by his alcoholism, a claim denied by Val Guest.|$|E
5|$|The {{match against}} England was causing the Natives' players and {{management}} problems {{before it had}} <b>even</b> <b>begun.</b> The team manager, Scott, was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played– the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at Blackheath's ground, but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval, where a larger crowd, and therefore higher gate receipts, could be secured. The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit-making motives of the Natives, and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue. The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home Unions over {{the formation of the}} International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). Following a disputed try in an England–Scotland international match in 1888, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891, when, following arbitration, the RFU relented and joined the IRFB. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the Natives on 16 February 1889.|$|E
