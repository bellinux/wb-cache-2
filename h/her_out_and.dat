25|$|Following {{the initial}} season of Survivor, {{there were two}} {{elements}} of controversy raised that involved Boesch. One was a claim from a voted-out contestant that show producer Mark Burnett had at one point influenced tribal council members to vote <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> not Rudy, because he had more appeal to viewers. This was adamantly denied by Burnett and CBS. Another was a claim from a different cast member that Boesch had told them that he had known Burnett before the show. By some accounts, Boesch had been cast by responding to a newspaper advertisement. However, he had also previously worked in 1996 {{as part of the}} logistics team for Burnett's earlier adventure race show Eco-Challenge. Boesch said several hundred others had also worked on the show in that capacity and that he had not known Burnett personally, and Burnett said he had not realized Boesch's earlier involvement until after Survivor had begun.|$|E
