5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> was reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for}} a brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{staircases}} on {{the first}} three quadrangles are marked with Arabic numerals, the <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> is marked with Roman numerals. Both sites have the numbering running anticlockwise around each quadrangle {{and there are two}} staircase eighteens − Mary Quad's staircase numbering finishes at 18 and O'Brien Quad's staircase numbering begins with XVIII.|$|E
5|$|Accommodation is {{provided}} for all undergraduates, {{and for some}} graduates, though some accommodation is off-site. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one informal and one formal, except on Saturdays, where there is only an informal sitting. The Bar, situated underneath the Hall, serves food from mid-morning and drinks in the evening. There is both a Junior Common Room (JCR), between Second and Third quad, and a Middle Common Room (MCR), on the <b>Island</b> <b>Site.</b>|$|E

25|$|English {{attempts}} {{to settle the}} Roanoke Colony in 1585–87 failed. Although the <b>island</b> <b>site</b> is located in present-day North Carolina, the English then considered it part of the Virginia territory. The English collected ethnological information about the local Croatan tribe, as well as related coastal tribes extending {{as far north as}} the Chesapeake.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{conceived}} in the 1930s {{as the main}} airport for Toronto, the Toronto island airport (today known as Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport) {{has long been a}} source for political debate as to the proper use of its waterfront site in central Toronto. Building the airport necessitated the closure of park lands, a hotel, cottages and an amusement park on the Toronto <b>Island</b> <b>site.</b> Construction of the airport in the late 1930s was stopped and started and its final construction only went ahead after the death of the Toronto mayor who had opposed its construction.|$|E
25|$|Sheltering {{the head}} of the bay is Whiddy <b>Island,</b> <b>site</b> of an {{important}} oil terminal, originally owned by Gulf Oil. On 8 January 1979 the oil tanker Betelgeuse exploded, killing all 42crew members, as well as seven employees at the terminal. The jetty was seriously damaged, but the storage tanks were not affected. Nevertheless, 250employees at the terminal, one of the largest employers in the region, lost their jobs. There was also significant environmental impact and the local fishing industry was affected. Local interests subsequently initiated mussel-farming in the sheltered waters between Whiddy and the town and this industry has since enjoyed considerable success.|$|E
50|$|In {{an early}} study, {{looking at a}} limited set of {{transcriptional}} promoters, Fernandez et al. examined the DNA methylation profiles of 855 primary tumors. Comparing each tumor type with its corresponding normal tissue, 729 CpG <b>island</b> <b>sites</b> (55% of the 1322 CpG <b>island</b> <b>sites</b> evaluated) showed differential DNA methylation. Of these sites, 496 were hypermethylated (repressed) and 233 were hypomethylated (activated). Thus, {{there is a high}} level of promoter methylation alterations in tumors. Some of these alterations may contribute to cancer progression.|$|R
50|$|After Japan's initial {{successes in}} the Pacific during World War II, {{the need for}} a fighter {{aircraft}} capable of operating from austere <b>island</b> <b>sites</b> with minimal infrastructure was regarded as a high priority.|$|R
30|$|Although {{all sites}} {{contained}} quaking aspen, {{there were differences}} between and within sites. Aspen patches in the two Sky <b>Island</b> <b>sites</b> were smaller than on the Mogollon Plateau (Table 1, Figure 2). This pattern can be partially explained by less land area in the aspen zone (2600 m to 3100 m) at the Sky <b>Island</b> <b>sites</b> (2927 ha in CHI, and 5945 ha in PIN) compared to Mogollon sites (7088 ha in SFP, and 7645 ha in GIL). Within-site differences in vegetation that could affect fire regimes were driven by aspect, with south-facing slopes containing drier, more open forests, and north-facing slopes generally supporting more mesic, denser forests.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the three}} other lighthouses in Saugeen Shores, Ontario, this station was {{nominated}} under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. The other three were subsequently designated as protected under the Act in 2012. The Chantry <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> {{has yet to be}} designated. The Act requires ownership of a light station to be first transferred from the federal government to another entity, such as the Town, which did take over ownership of the other lighthouses. That transfer has not occurred because of the uncertainty created by First Nations land claims to islands in the Lake Huron basin. In the meantime, the Chantry Island light station is leased to the Town and sublet to the Marine Heritage Society.|$|E
25|$|More than 5000 MW of {{hydroelectric}} potential {{could be}} developed in Manitoba, which includes 1380 MW at the Conawapa site, 695 MW at the Keeyask site, and 1000 MW at the Gillam <b>Island</b> <b>site,</b> all on the lower Nelson river. Other sites have been assessed but are not currently under study for development. All of these developments would require a large increase in electric power exports, since Manitoba load growth will not require this capacity for a generation or more. All of these projects require additional HVDC transmission capacity from the North to the South. One such project, Bipole III, has been discussed with communities {{on the east side}} of Lake Winnipeg, but this area is ecologically and culturally sensitive and power line construction will require extensive environmental impact assessment.|$|E
25|$|There were {{originally}} three lighthouse keepers {{with their families}} on the island. The initial rotating light mechanism had to be wound up hourly, and in 1883, the principal lighthouse keeper died when he fell down the central shaft trying to attach weights to the mechanism. In 1977, the number of lighthouse keepers were reduced from two to one due to operational improvements. There was a Committee of Inquiry into lighthouse automation in 1981 and the Dog <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> was one of nine sites throughout New Zealand that was to remain staffed; in this case, {{it was due to}} its remoteness, and its ability to help with search and rescue in the area. In August 1989, Dog Island was fully automated and the last permanent lighthouse keeper in New Zealand was withdrawn from service. The lighthouse is remote controlled from Maritime New Zealand's Wellington office.|$|E
5000|$|Round Island (...) is a 4.09 ha {{island to}} the north of St Helen’s with an {{unmanned}} lighthouse on the summit. It is part of the Pentle Bay, Merrick and Round <b>Islands</b> <b>Site</b> of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).|$|R
30|$|For central North <b>Island</b> <b>sites,</b> {{where the}} GBD/GWD ratio data were collected, the {{calculated}} MTBWt% was 6.8  % for the median tree from the 17 sites. The calculated MTBWt% for the median tree ranged from 6.2 to 7.5  %, being highest for the warmest site.|$|R
5000|$|Beatrice Islets are {{reported}} as probably being named after HMS Beatrice, a schooner which conducted coastal survey operations in South Australia during the 1870s.

25|$|More than 5000 MW of {{hydroelectric}} potential {{could be}} developed in Manitoba, which includes 1380 MW at the Conawapa site, 630 MW at the Keeyask site, and 1000 MW at the Gillam <b>Island</b> <b>site,</b> all on the lower Nelson river. Other sites have been assessed but are not currently under study for development. All of these developments would require a large increase in electric power exports, since Manitoba load growth will not require this capacity for a generation or more. All of these projects require additional HVDC transmission capacity from the North to the South. One such project, Bipole III, had been discussed with communities {{on the east side}} of Lake Winnipeg, but this area has been reserved by the provincial government, making transmission line construction infeasible. The government and Manitoba Hydro have currently rerouted Bipole III through the west side of Manitoba and construction has begun as of 2012.|$|E
500|$|The <b>island</b> <b>site</b> covers {{an area of}} [...] {{bounded by}} St Giles High Street, Earnshall Street, Bucknall Street and Dyott Street.

500|$|The {{influence}} of the Celtic rite in East Anglia had been strong whilst the monastery of Saint Fursey and Saint Foillan at Cnobheresburg had existed. The authority of East Anglian Christianity still resided in the East Anglian see at Dommoc, obedient to Canterbury. Saint Botolph began to build his monastery at Iken, on a tidal <b>island</b> <b>site</b> in the River Alde, Suffolk, in about 653, the year that Anna of East Anglia was killed at the Battle of Bulcamp.|$|E

500|$|Another {{attraction}} on today's Notre Dame <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> is the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve {{race track}} {{that is used}} for the Canadian Grand Prix. The Olympic basin is used by many local rowing clubs. [...] A beach was built on the shores of the remaining artificial lake. There are many acres of parkland and cycle paths on both Saint Helen's Island and the western tip of Notre Dame Island. [...] The site has been used for a number of events such as a BIE-sponsored international botanical festival, Les floralies. The young trees and shrubs planted for Expo 67 are now mature. The plants introduced during the botanical events have flourished also.|$|E
500|$|After 1967, the {{exposition}} {{struggled for}} several summer seasons as a standing collection of international pavilions known as [...] "Man and His World". However, as attendance declined, the physical {{condition of the}} site deteriorated, and less and less of it was open to the public. After the 1971 season, the entire Notre Dame <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> closed and three years later completely rebuilt around the new rowing and canoe sprint (then flatwater canoeing) basin for Montreal's 1976 Summer Olympics. Space for the basin, the boathouses, the changing rooms and other buildings was obtained by demolishing many of the former pavilions and cutting in half the area taken by the artificial lake and the canals.|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} {{trip to the}} United States, Bartholdi {{addressed}} a number of groups about the project, and urged the formation of American committees of the Franco-American Union. Committees {{to raise money to}} pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. The New York group eventually took on most of the responsibility for American fundraising and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "American Committee". One of its members was 19-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, the future governor of New York and president of the United States. On March 3, 1877, on his final full day in office, President Grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the President to accept the statue when it was presented by France and to select a site for it. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who took office the following day, selected the Bedloe's <b>Island</b> <b>site</b> that Bartholdi had proposed.|$|E
