50|$|The <b>hot-wire</b> <b>microphone</b> {{was often}} used as an {{acoustic}} detector, especially for infrasound. It was invented {{around the time of}} the First World War for use in acoustic artillery ranging, and an improved model was developed by Tucker and Paris Trans. Roy. Soc. A221, 390 (1921) and is described in Wood, pp. 303-305. It consists of a grid of fine platinum wire suspended in a hole in a mica disc closing the mouth of a Helmholtz resonator. A current is passed through the wire to heat it, while its resistance is measured with a Wheatstone bridge. The periodic air currents established when a signal is received cool the wire (at twice the frequency of vibration) and change its resistance. It is very useful for infrasonics, where impedance matching is more important than speed. The <b>hot-wire</b> <b>microphone</b> has no diaphragm to add inertia. It is useful for frequencies as high as 512 Hz, and is quite sensitive. Hot-wire microphones were often used in long-distance sound investigations.|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Measurements {{are given}} of the {{turbulence}} in the working-section together with {{measurements of the}} noise. With all the screens fitted in the tunnel, the intensities of lateral components are of the same order as the longitudinal component and range from about 0 · 01 per cent to 0 · 03 per cent of the mean speed. Frequency analyses have shown the longitudinal components to consist of fan frequencies and a low-frequency contribution at about 5 to 10 c. p. s. The lateral components consist almost entirely of a similar low-frequency contribution. With all the screens in the tunnel {{the low level of}} turbulence is confined to a restricted area near the centre of the tunnel with flashes of high-intensity turbulence spreading a considerable distance from the walls. Noise measurements with the <b>hot-wire</b> <b>microphone</b> {{in the middle of the}} working-section showed that above a tunnel speed of 150 ft/sec the longitudinal component consisted mainly of noise. Some measurements were also made with the <b>hot-wire</b> <b>microphone</b> in the turbulent boundary layer on the walls. 1.

40|$|The use of {{a heated}} fine wire as a {{delicate}} detector of fluid velocity and pressure {{has been known for}} many years. King, in an intensive series of experiments and theoretical examination, developed the hot-wire anemometer and indicated the linear relation between the heat lost by a hot wire in a moving stream of air and the square root of its velocity, at high velocities. The <b>hot-wire</b> <b>microphone,</b> a sensitive means of detection of acoustic waves was brought into prominence by Tucker and Paris. With grids of fine platinum wires mounted in the necks of suitable resonators they were able to detect, selectively, low frequency sound waves which were quite inaudible. In their method, a grid of wires raised to high temperature above ambient by the passage of d. c. current was exposed to the resonantly-amplified air-particle velocity, thereby effecting average and periodic cooling, producing average and periodic resistance changes. The former was measured with a Wheatstone net, the latter produced a periodic voltage which was amplified and measured with a tuned galvanometer. Also developed by them was an empirical relation which indicated that the heat lost by the grid varied as the square of the velocity of unidirectional air, at very low velocities. [ [...] . ...|$|E
50|$|The present-day {{standard}} atmosphere has a ground temperature of 288K, stratospheric temperature 217K at 12 km, {{with an increase}} beginning at 25 km, and a maximum temperature of 283K at 50 km. It is clear that Whipple's results {{are very close to}} the truth. They were the very first good measurements of temperatures in the upper atmosphere. Whipple carried out further experiments with gunfire. A gun at Shoeburyness could be heard at Grantham, 185 km away to the north. Guns were fired from three points just east of London, and sounds were received at Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Nottingham, Exeter and North Walsham, using <b>hot-wire</b> <b>microphones.</b> An array of three microphones, with accurate time measurements, allowed the determination of the angle of incidence. Experiments were carried out in December, 1932 with four explosions at Oldebroek in Holland, showing the expected zone of audibility to the east, and none to the west.|$|R
40|$|Small and {{sensitive}} silicon based sensors for {{the measurement of}} turbulence and wall-pressure fluctuations have been designed and fabricated using microelectronic technology. To determine the performance of these sensors, comparisons with conventional <b>hot-wires</b> and <b>microphones</b> were carried out in a well-defined two-dimensional turbulent flat plate boundary layer. The velocity sensors {{were found to have}} a spatial and frequency resolution that makes them suitable for turbulence measurements. For the pressure transducers the same good resolution was found, and from the power spectrum, determined directly with a small silicon sensor, a slope in the inertial sub-layer in agreement with the 5 / 3 -law of Kolmogorov was found...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{experimental}} set-up, {{aimed at}} investigating the coupling between the flow in a corrugated pipe, the acoustically generated flow oscillations and the emitted resulting noise is carried out. <b>Hot-wire</b> anemometry and <b>microphone</b> measurements are associated {{to characterize the}} flow. The flow response to the corrugation is shown to fit to the 6 th to 9 th acoustic modes of the pipe according to the flow rate. When low frequency acoustically generated oscillations interfere with this, one checks that they either significantly reduce the noise level or modify the peak frequencies. In addition, theoretical/numerical works are also performed, {{in order to provide}} an analytical framework describing the acoustical properties of such corrugated pipe flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustical}} excitation of shear layers is investigated experimentally. Acoustical excitation causes, for example, {{the so-called}} 'orderly structures' in shear layers and jets. The deviations in the spreading rate between different turbulent-shear-layer experiments {{are due to}} the same excitation mechanism. The present investigations focus on measurements in the linear interaction region {{close to the edge}} from which the shear layer is shed. Two sets of experiments (Houston, 1981, and Berlin, 1983 and 1984) are reported on. The measurements have been carried out with laminar shear layers in air using <b>hot-wire</b> anemometers and <b>microphones.</b> The agreement between these measurements and the theory is good. Details of the fluctuating flow field are found to correspond to theoretical predictions, such as the local occurrence of negative phase speeds...|$|R
40|$|This work details an {{experimental}} investigation {{aimed at reducing}} the noise output of piezoelectrical-driven synthetic jet actuators while minimising peak jet velocity reduction. The study considers double-chamber actuator for anti-phase noise suppression and lobed orifice as a method to enhance jet turbulent mixing to suppress jet noise. The study involved the design, manufacture and bench test of interchangeable actuator hardware. <b>Hot-wire</b> anemometry and <b>microphone</b> recordings were employed to acquire velocity and sound pressure level measurements respectively {{across a range of}} excitation frequencies for a fixed diaphragm clamping and input voltage. The data analysis indicated a 26 % noise reduction (16 dB) from operating a single-chamber, round orifice actuator to a double-chamber, lobed orifice one at the synthetic jet resonant frequency. Results also showed there was a small reduction in peak jet velocity of 7 % (∼ 3 m/s) between these two cases based on orifices of the same discharge area. The electrical-to-fluidic power conversion efficiency of the double-chamber actuator was found to be 15 % for both orifice types at the resonant frequency; approximately double the efficiency of a single-chamber actuator...|$|R
40|$|Airfoils in low-to-moderate Reynolds number flows produce {{discrete}} tones {{which can}} be annoying to the human ear and potentially impede the design of fans, compressors, helicopter rotors and unmanned air vehicles. This paper dis-cusses an experimental investigation into the generation of tones from a NACA 0012 airfoil for varying angles of at-tack and Reynolds numbers between 50, 000 and 150, 000. The investigaton employed acoustic beamforming, <b>hot-wire</b> anemometry, single <b>microphone</b> measurements and surface flow visualisation techniques. The experimental re-sults were used to calculate flow and noise parameters {{that were used in}} an acoustic feedback loop model to deter-mine its validity. Surface flow visualisation techniques revealed locations of boundary layer separation. The phase difference between the noise signal and local flow velocities near the airfoil surface was used to measure the convec-tive velocity of the disturbances in the airfoil boundary layer. A good agreement between the experiment and pre-dicted tonal frequencies was obtained when the experimentally determined length and velocity scales were used in the feedback model, supporting the applicability of a feedback model for tonal noise in this case.

40|$|This paper details an {{experimental}} investigation {{aimed at reducing}} the noise output of piezoelectrical-driven synthetic jet actuators without compromising peak jet velocity. Specifically, the study considers double-chamber (‘back-to-back’) actuators for anti-phase noise suppression and corrugated-lobed orifices as a method to enhance turbulent mixing of the jets to suppress jet noise. The study involved the design, manufacture and bench test of interchangeable actuator hardware. <b>Hot-wire</b> anemometry and <b>microphone</b> recordings were employed to acquire velocity and noise measurements respectively for each chamber configuration and orifice plate {{across a range of}} excitation frequencies and for a fixed input voltage. The data analysis indicated a 32 % noise reduction (20 dBA) from operating a single-chamber, circular orifice SJA to a double-chamber, corrugated-lobed orifice SJA at the Helmholtz resonant frequency. Results also showed there was a small reduction in peak jet velocity of 7 % (~ 3 m/s) between these two cases based on orifices of the same discharge area. Finally, the electrical-to-fluidic power conversion efficiency of the double-chamber actuator was found to be 15 % across all orifice designs at the resonant frequency; approximately double the efficiency of a single-chamber actuator.
