5|$|British {{secret service}} agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre</b> while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he {{eventually}} gets the gangsters to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Michel {{that he is in}} America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in Toronto, as part of his quest to ferret out SPECTRE. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots him.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, then England-based Australian, Russell Ingall {{was chosen}} to fill the vacant {{endurance}} seat. After a forgettable Sandown 500, Perkins and Ingall won the 1995 Tooheys 1000 after being in last place after one lap following a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre</b> off the start line when Perkins and the HRT car of Craig Lowndes touched which ripped the valve out causing the tyre to instantly deflate. The car then went a lap down after 50 laps. The pair charged {{back to the front}} to take the lead with nine laps remaining, helped by safety cars periods and also by the race leader Glenn Seton blowing the engine of his Falcon on lap 152 while holding a 10-second lead over Perkins.|$|E

25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed {{that his wife was}} seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running {{along the top of the}} wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down the steps to the tower gate, but it would not open. At the bottom of the stairs was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
500|$|The fifth {{stage was}} [...] to Florence. Like the fourth, it {{was plagued by}} punctures. Luigi Ganna led until he had a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre</b> with about [...] to go. A few riders passed him as he {{repaired}} it but he chased them down and won the stage. On the sixth stage, [...] from Florence to Genoa, Carlo Galetti and Giovanni Rossignoli {{broke away from the}} leading group of seven as they neared the downhill finish, with Rossignoli winning the stage in front of a large crowd. Race leader Ganna had suffered more punctures but managed to fight his way back to finish third.|$|E
500|$|The five {{riders in}} the {{breakaway}} rode strongly and the peloton {{was forced to}} ride hard all day to chase down their lead. With [...] remaining, the breakaway had a lead of 1' 20". A few kilometres later, the lead was under a minute. 's efforts stopped around [...] {{from the end of}} the stage, when their sprinter Danny van Poppel suffered a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre.</b> After a conversation with the team, van Poppel decided to change his wheel. He then chased back into the peloton through the team cars and several teammates helped him back to the front of the group; other riders remained at the front to chase the breakaway down after van Poppel had rejoined the group.|$|E
50|$|Michelines offered {{unprecedented}} ride smoothness, {{but they}} soon {{proved to be}} problematic because the low load that the wheels could bear limited railcar sizes and demanded {{a high number of}} tyres (up to 20) per car. Furthermore, they were subject to <b>flat</b> <b>tyres,</b> unlike cars with steel wheels.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous races, snow and ice were much less and the track had become much more muddy and therefore slower. As a result, several rocks surfaced which were barely visible and often covered in small pools of water. The race {{would turn out to}} become tough on the material, with especially <b>flat</b> <b>tyres</b> playing a deciding role.|$|R
50|$|The ASLAV has an eight-wheeled {{configuration}} (capable {{of either}} four or eight wheel drive), is amphibious {{and has a}} range of 600 km with a top road speed of 120 km/h.

500|$|Every year {{we change}} fewer wheels, because the {{wheels and tyres}} are getting better and better. We changed about 20 wheels today. Five years ago, it was much worse— we'd be {{choosing}} about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. So, yes, our job is easier— except that the race generally goes faster now, so we're under a bit more pressure. Every year, there's new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it's getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre</b> {{we need to think}} of a lot of things at once.

500|$|The {{eighth and}} final stage started in Turin, covered , and {{finished}} in Milan {{in front of}} a crowd of more than 30,000. Ganna was amongst the leading group until he suffered a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre.</b> He managed to fight his way back until, with the leaders in sight, [...] he had another puncture. The leading group pulled away until the race directors stopped them to let Ganna catch up. Escorted by mounted police, the riders then made their way into Milan's Arena Civica stadium for the finish. As the racers geared up for the sprint finish a police horse fell, causing a few riders to crash. Dario Beni avoided the incident and edged out Galetti for the stage win, with Ganna coming in third. Thus Ganna became the first winner of the Giro d'Italia. He and his team, Atala, also won the team classification.|$|E
500|$|He {{completed}} {{the course in}} a time of 54' 19", and his time held for around an hour before his teammate Lieuwe Westra assumed top spot; despite being ten seconds down on Larsson at the second intermediate time point, Westra {{completed the}} final portion of the course some twenty seconds quicker, and recorded a time of 54' 09". 's Tony Martin, the world champion, was the next rider to assume the top spot, setting the first time underneath 54 minutes; he set a time of 53' 40", despite riding with a fractured scaphoid bone in his left wrist and suffering a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre</b> in the opening [...] of the stage. Fabian Cancellara of [...] improved the quickest time benchmark; he set the fastest time at each of the two intermediate time points on the stage, and having passed the rider who started three minutes before him on the road, 's Bauke Mollema, Cancellara established a time for the course of 52' 21", beating Martin's time by 1' 19".|$|E

500|$|Black and Horn {{realize that}} the killer will have chosen the {{optician}} as his next victim, and agree to set another trap with her as the bait. Horn, more and more unhinged throughout the case, begins imagining the killer and his van at every turn. As he and Black wait for the killer to make an attempt on the optician's life, Horn admits that he cannot trust himself to be there, and is told to go home. However, he parks his car on the route towards the trap, feigning a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre.</b> When the killer's van attempts to pass, Horn attacks him, but the police arrive in time to stop him beating the killer to death. The attack renders any evidence found in the van inadmissible in court, although Black tells him enough evidence was found at the killer's home to secure a conviction. Later, Horn asks Black how he can deal with cases like this on a regular basis. [...] Black does not answer, but later comforts his daughter after another bad dream.|$|E
500|$|According to Cynthia Lennon, {{when the}} group walked past the Maharishi {{on the way to}} their taxis he looked [...] "very biblical and {{isolated}} in his faith". The Maharishi reportedly said, [...] "Wait, talk to me". After leaving the ashram, the taxis kept breaking down, leading the Beatles to wonder if the Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a <b>flat</b> <b>tyre</b> and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London, during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. The Harrisons were not ready to go home, so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar. Harrison said when he got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for {{the second half of the}} course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon wanted to get back to his relationship with Ono.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Australia in November 1949, Eaton became Deputy Director of Training at the Department of Air, Canberra, {{where he}} {{remained}} until 1951. Later that year, {{he was appointed}} Officer Commanding No.78 (Fighter) Wing at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales. He had reverted to a substantive rank of wing commander since leaving Japan, as the RAAF shrank dramatically with demobilisation and many senior officers lost the temporary or acting ranks they had gained in wartime. On 15September, he landed a Vampire jet fighter at Point Cook with one <b>flat</b> <b>tyre</b> and one wheel retracted, after its undercarriage had become jammed. The plane skidded off the runway but Eaton was able to walk away, reportedly remarking [...] "Well, I didn't wreck it". He married Josephine Rumbles at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 10May 1952; the couple later had a son and two daughters. Following Britain's request to the Australian government for a Commonwealth garrison in the Mediterranean, in July 1952 Eaton led No.78 Wing on deployment to RAF Hal Far near Valletta, Malta, where its combat squadrons, Nos.75 and 76, were equipped with leased Vampire FB9s. As the overseas posting was {{for a minimum of}} two years, his new bride and the families of other staff were permitted to make the journey as well. The Australian airmen participated in many NATO exercises while stationed at Malta, and one year took first and second place in the Middle Eastern Gunnery Contest for the [...] "Imshi" [...] Mason Cup. Promoted to the substantive rank of group captain on 1January 1953, Eaton was granted command of RAF Ta'Kali when the wing transferred there from Hal Far in June.|$|E
