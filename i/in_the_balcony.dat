5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the large number}} of people attending on the High Holy Days, since 2001 Temple Sinai has held its main High Holy Day services at Oakland's NRHP-listed Art Deco Paramount Theater. While it still holds smaller High Holy Day services in the sanctuary at 2808 Summit Street, the main services at the Paramount fill the entire 1,800 seats on the mezzanine of the theater, and most of the 1,200 seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Balcony</b> in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E

25|$|The Civil Rights Movement touched Augusta {{as it did}} {{the rest}} of the United States. In 1961, soul {{musician}} Ray Charles canceled a scheduled performance at the Bell Auditorium when he learned that the black attendees would be segregated from the whites and forced to sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> A few days after the Kent State shootings and Jackson State killings in May 1970, six African-American students were killed after they were shot in the back for looting by police following civil rights demonstrations.

25|$|As was {{the case}} in most {{southern}} cities, African Americans in Hopewell were subject to Jim Crow segregation until the success of the Civil Rights Movement. The picturesque theater in the middle of town, the Beacon Theater, only allowed Blacks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> In August 1966, the Ku Klux Klan confronted the Reverend Curtis Harris and other Black Hopewell citizens when they attempted to petition the city manager to find an alternate location for a landfill {{that was going to be}} opened in the middle of a Black neighborhood. Hopewell public schools were desegregated under court order in 1963, following Renee Patrice GILLIAM et al v. School Board of the City of Hopewell, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} section there is a {{representation}} of Jesus {{in the house of}} Caiaphus. Seventy two judges try Jesus with Pontius Pilate on the side <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> On the north side, Pilate appears again but the Jewish judges stay outside the Roman magistrate's house because they are observing Passover. The south side presents Pilate presenting Jesus and Barabbas and asking to choose who to let go. On the east side is a scene with Jesus being flogged while tied to a post. On the south wall there is a Neoclassical altarpiece of stone with gold leaf. This contains an image of Christ tied to a post and bearing the marks of being flogged. This is called the Señor de la Columna.|$|E
25|$|Head coach Carl C. Taylor, {{seeking an}} indoor home venue for the {{basketball}} team, {{reached an agreement}} with the Ben Hur Temple in downtown Austin to rent the building's theater for basketball games and five hours of practice weekly for the 1913 season for $75. The building was originally constructed in 1872 as an opera house for the Turnverein, a German gymnastics, social, and cultural society, and it had been purchased in 1912 by the Shriners and Scottish Rite Masons. Basketball goals were mounted on the balcony and in front of the stage, boundary lines were drawn on the double-layer pine floor, and bleachers were erected {{on each side of the}} diminutive court, bringing seating capacity to roughly 350 people, including spectators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> and on the stage.|$|E

500|$|The character's {{transformation}} into a vampire, and the visceral nature this trait lends the series, {{was derived from}} William Shakespeare's classical models: [...] "for <b>the</b> drunken commoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front rows he would insert dirty jokes to keep them entertained but for <b>the</b> aristocracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> he would write very cerebral metaphors". According to Silicon Knights, the gore and vampirism in Blood Omen served as their [...] "dirty jokes", supplemented by a complex story.|$|R

25|$|Behind the Memorial Hall to {{the west}} is the semicircular Memorial Theater, which was {{designed}} to seat 1,000. (After being reconfigured, it seats just 358 today.) The Memorial Theater features a fan-shaped ceiling and 16 St. Genevieve marble columns around its perimeter. Around the mezzanine are 14 bronze bas-relief portraits of Presidents of the United States who were Freemasons. Behind the stage is the portrait of Washington donated by Rep. Sol Bloom. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> in the theater's eastern end is the Moller organ donated by Grand Lodge of New Jersey. On the north side on the first floor is the North Lodge Room. An open-beam arched ceiling marks this room, which is in the half-timbered style and has balconies on three sides and a stage in front. This is the meeting room of Andrew Jackson Lodge No. 120, as well as other Masonic lodges who wish to use it for meetings while visiting the memorial.|$|E
25|$|Genet's plays present highly stylized {{depictions of}} ritualistic struggles between outcasts {{of various kinds}} and their oppressors. Social identities are parodied and shown to involve complex {{layering}} through manipulation of the dramatic fiction and its inherent potential for theatricality and role-play; maids imitate one another and their mistress in The Maids (1947); or the clients of a brothel simulate roles of political power before, in a dramatic reversal, actually becoming those figures, all surrounded by mirrors that both reflect and conceal, <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Balcony</b> (1957). Most strikingly, Genet offers a critical dramatisation of what Aimé Césaire called negritude in The Blacks (1959), presenting a violent assertion of Black identity and anti-white virulence framed in terms of mask-wearing and roles adopted and discarded. His most overtly political play is The Screens (1964), an epic account of the Algerian War of Independence. He also wrote another full-length drama, Splendid's, in 1948 and a one-act play, Her (Elle), in 1955, though neither was published or produced during Genet's lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of turning a profit on a single-screen theater in the age of multiplex cinemas, Landmark Theatres Corp. let its lease expire in September 1992. As owner of the building 20th Century Theaters sought to continue independent films at the Majestic and installed their district manager Jerry Fladen to oversee operations. The city of Madison designated the building a historic landmark in 1995, but its infamously uncomfortable seats and substandard sound did little to encourage attendance. The theater also suffered from its antiquated design, with a tiny lobby and concessions area, plus the only restrooms were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> Because the auditorium was never designed for movies, the pictures were difficult to keep in focus projected from such a steep angle. Ironically the widening popularity of independent films may have doomed the theater, with the Majestic no longer holding a monopoly on the art house films that were also shown regularly at the multi-screened Hilldale and Westgate Cinemas. As attendance declined, the union projectionists stopped working there so Fladen could save on expenses.|$|E
50|$|During its {{run as a}} porno theater, {{there were}} several {{incidents}} of attempted arson, purportedly stemming from one offended local woman; she succeeded at one point <b>in</b> burning <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> stairs <b>in</b> 1978, and was never caught.|$|R

25|$|After {{graduating from}} the conservatory, Cuney {{returned}} to Texas, studying privately with pianist Emil Ludwig in Austin. She taught at the Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youths in 1897 and 1898. She chose to oppose racial prejudice when management of the Austin Opera House demanded that Negroes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience coming to her performance must be segregated and seated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> She and Emil Ludwig cancelled the planned concert and performed instead at the Texas Institute for Colored Youths, where no distinction of color was applied.|$|R
25|$|The rear {{battalion}} was the 4th Sikh Infantry, {{which reached}} Candeapar {{in the early}} hours of 19 December, and not to be bogged down by the absence of the Borim bridge (already blown up), went across the Zuari river in their military tankers and then waded across a small creek, in chest high water, to reach a small dock known as Embarcadouro de Tembim in Raia, presently under survey No.44/5 of Raia Village, from where there exists a connecting road to Margão (Old Portuguese Planta 4489 & 4493). At Tembim the 4th Sikh Infantry rear battalion, took some rest in a cattle shed on the small dock, and sprawled on the ground and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of a house adjacent to the dock, drank some water, retrieved their tankers and then proceeded to Margão—the administrative centre of Southern Goa—by 12:00. From here, the column advanced towards the harbour of Mormugão. En route to this target, the column encountered fierce resistance from a 500-strong Portuguese unit at the village of Verna, where the Indian column was joined by the 2nd Bihar. The Portuguese unit surrendered at 15:30 after fierce fighting, and the 4th Sikh then proceeded to Mormugão and Dabolim Airport, where the main body of the Portuguese Army awaited the Indians.|$|E
25|$|The {{new owner}} of the {{building}} was indoor soccer field developer Richard Fritz, who purchased the Majestic for $248,800. In April 2000 {{it was announced that}} local restaurateur Henry Doane would lease the theater and reopen after extensive renovations. Doane had bought the 71-year-old Orpheum Theatre (with the attached Stage Door Theater) a year earlier and installed a restaurant and bar in the lobby, making him the operator of the last three commercial movie screens in downtown Madison. Admitting publicly that he may lose money on the Majestic venture, he confessed to sentimental feelings about the theater and believed it could return to its former art house glory. Fritz and Doane spent $250,000 on a new roof, a new sound system, a larger concession stand and a first-floor restroom. Seating capacity went from 537 to 400 to provide more leg room, and padded bench seats were installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> The theater reopened on June 30, 2000 with Hamlet starring Ethan Hawke. The Majestic became one of the venues for the growing Wisconsin Film Festival. But Doane struggled to make a profit {{in the face of the}} same competition with the Westgate and Hilldale Theaters for independent film bookings and audiences. The theater stopped showing films on September 1, 2002 as a new buyer was found who planned to turn the movie house into a nightclub.|$|E
25|$|For First Class passengers, the Pont Veranda (Veranda Deck) held most of {{the public}} rooms. These {{included}} the , , , and balcony of the , which was dedicated to First Class passengers only. These rooms were arranged down {{the centre of the}} ship, with large, glass-enclosed promenades to either side. The Library was a circular room with glass and lacquered aluminum enclosed book-cases all around, holding 2,200 editions, and was overseen by an attendant who regulated the borrowing and returning of books, as well as assisting passengers with their choices. The Grand Salon had a raised ceiling in the centre, over the abstract grey and white marble mosaic dance floor, with lower more intimate spaces at the corners. The theatre, which functioned both as a Proscenium (live theatre) and cinema, sat 185 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> and 479 on the orchestra level, and had a projection booth which could handle 16, 35, and 70mm film. Until the 1990s it was the largest theatre ever constructed on a ship. However, one of the main showpieces of the First Class salons was the Smoking Room at the very aft of the Pont Veranda. Two stories high, with a raised section in the centre flanked by large columns, and double-height windows to port and starboard, the room {{was one of the most}} imposing aboard the ship.|$|E
