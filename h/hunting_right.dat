[...] In Japanese shore-based net whaling, right whales were the prime target, and the whale fisheries were devastating to the stocks as catch quantities declined greatly in relatively short periods, and the effect of the industries were more notable on the whale populations than the later American whaling, resulting not only in financial solvencies of many whaling groups but also in disputes between feudal domains in western Japan that required the shogunate itself to settle. Among this, it has been revealed that Japanese people have been trying to shift responsibility of whale declines to the later American whalers to control public opinions since at the end of the Edo period.|$|E

The division of <b>hunting</b> <b>rights</b> (which remains to this day) follows a line from the summit of Gannoch, down the Allanstank burn, along the Feugh to the Forest of Birse kirk and then along a track which runs north to Glencat.

It further analyses the impact of diminishing of the minimum area of the hunting grounds on the economy of hunting. It also tries {{to find out whether}} the diminishing would lead to <b>hunting</b> <b>rights</b> more interwoven with the ownership of the hunting lands. The conducted research confirmed the existence of two types of hunting grounds that differ by the kind of ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding <b>hunting</b> <b>rights</b> in these <b>hunting</b> lands. It was further found out that the diminishing of the minimum area of the hunting grounds would increase the bindingness of the <b>hunting</b> <b>rights</b> with the ownership of the hunting lands.

50|$|An {{important}} {{chapter of}} Canadian Arctic policy regarding {{development of the}} Inuit culture {{is reflected in the}} agreements settling Inuit land claims opposed to the Canadian state. The advancing exploitation of the Canadian Arctic and if its mineral resources led to ever more conflicts about land ownership and title between Inuit representatives and Federal Government. Land that is not under private ownership is considered as Federal land, but the Inuit claim large areas that they have inhabited and utilized for many centuries. The agreement reached in 1984 regarding land claims of the Inuvialuit (Inuit in the western Arctic) provided means to improve the situation of the indigenous residents of this region, by assuring 91,000 km2 of land to 2,500 Inuvialuit, as well as monetary compensation, funds for improving the social structure, <b>hunting</b> <b>right,</b> and more influence on dealing with the fauna, on natural and environmental protection.|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Symposium sessions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Boston College Law School, Dr. Michael Moore provided a narrative and photographic introduction to current threats to whale survival, with particular reference to North Atlantic waters off the eastern coast of the United States and the most endangered whale species, the North Atlantic right whale, Eubalaena glacialis. The conditions experienced by North Atlantic right whales reflect conditions faced by all the great whales of the North Atlantic. Given the 1935 absolute moratorium on <b>hunting</b> <b>right</b> whales in any waters, there are three major areas of current concern for whale conservation and survival noted in Dr. Moore’s presentation and addressed in legal terms by subsequent contributors to the Symposium: (1) entanglement in commercial fishing gear; (2) vessel strikes; and (3) ambient and episodic marine noise. Each of these is generated by human activities on the oceans...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{definition}} {{and management of the}} <b>hunting</b> <b>right</b> in Denmark and Portugal, with contrasting political and legal histories. Whilst in Denmark game is an attribute of private landownership (res propria), in Portugal game is owned by no one until capture by the hunter (res nullius). Through two case studies, the paper describes and analyses the outcomes of these two different conceptions in terms of the right to landscape. The legal right to hunt and the actual management of this right reflect a particular power, which shapes specific hunting landscapes, creating both inclusions and exclusions. In Hvorslev/Denmark, the individualised custody of hunting grounds prevents the over-exploitation of natural resources but limits the potential for collective planning and management initiatives. With the commodification of hunting, this activity is separated from everyday rural life and low income hunters are excluded. In Mértola/Portugal, State regulation operated a change from open-access towards control by hunting agencies. Game sustainability is favoured and hunting fosters place-based identities. However, class-based identities are also favoured, with landless and low-income hunters being excluded...|$|E
