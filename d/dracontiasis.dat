40|$|Epidemiology of {{guinea worm}} disease was studied in {{relation}} to sex, age, community and drinking water of inhabi-tants of 12 desert villages in Barmer district. Western Rajasthan, India. Data were also stratified with respect to first infection and reinfection. Infection was significantly (p 0. 05). Of various water sources reported pond water was {{a major source of}} contamination. 82. 7 % of the population examined was at risk of developing guinea worm infection at any time. No effective treatment is yet available. <b>Dracontiasis</b> is widespread in India, with guinea worm transmission occurring in almost three quarters (240 / 329) of districts. 1 Guinea worm disease incidence when based upon hospital statistics 1 ' 2 ' 3 gives an under-estimation because guinea worm patients seldom go t...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the current {{situation}} on dirofilariasis in Astrakhan region. Materials and methods. On the territory of Astrakhan region from 2001 to 2012 there was registered dirofilariosis in 43 people, among them 74. 4 % women, 25. 6 % men. From 2013 dirofilariosis has not being registered in the Astrakhan region. Results of the study. The parasite localized in the eyelid area in 46. 5 % cases, on the forehead in 14. 0 %, in the scalp area in 9. 4 %, on the upper extremities in 16. 3 % cases. Patients complained of pain, burning, redness and swelling in the affected area. More {{than half of all}} patients (53. 5 %) noted the migration of parasite under skin. There were diagnosed lipoma (30. 2 %), dirofilariosis (37. 2 %), atheroma (14. 0 %), foreign body and neoplasm (4. 7 %). In a few cases (2. 3 %) there were diagnosed allergic edema, boil, <b>dracontiasis</b> and varicose veins. Urbanites were two much as ruralists among the patient with dirofilariosis. In 88. 4 % cases of treatment live worms removed from a man were delivered. The size of extracted worms ranged from 40 to 150 mm. Conclusions. In recent years there has been {{an increase in the number}} of cases of dirofilariosis among people. We have developed a modified method of dirofilariasis diagnosis in animals, that reduces the time intervals to diagnosing...|$|E
