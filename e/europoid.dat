F. : 3. 109 BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of gastric cancer (GC) is extremely high in Russia and eastern Siberia, where {{information on the}} epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection is fragmentary. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of both H. pylori infection (including CagA status) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) in Russian and eastern Siberian populations carrying a different risk of GC. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  A sample of 2129 consecutive patients was considered, including 689 <b>Europoids</b> and 1440 Mongoloids (493 Evenks, 533 Khakass people, and 414 Tuvans), who all underwent serum sampling and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. H. pylori status was established (ELISA, urease test, and histology), and IgG anti-CagA antibodies were assessed (ELISA) in H. pylori-positive cases. At least 3 biopsy samples per patient were considered, and IM was scored as present versus absent. The prevalence of H. pylori, CagA+ve status, and IM was compared with the {{incidence of}} GC according to the regional cancer registries. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori was similar for the <b>Europoids</b> and Mongoloids (93. 6 vs 94. 3...|$|R

Historically, Central Asia has been a [...] "melting pot" [...] of West Eurasia and East Eurasian peoples, leading to high genetic admixture and diversity. Physical and genetic analyses of ancient remains have concluded that - while the Scythians, including those in the eastern Pazyryk region - possessed predominantly features, found among others, in <b>Europoids,</b> mixed Eurasian phenotypes were also frequently present, suggesting that the Scythians as a whole were descended in part from East Eurasian populations.|$|R
40|$|The ethnic {{people of}} the Republic of Khakassia (the Khakas) with ulcer disease show a {{significant}} T-cell activation and humoral immune response {{when compared with the}} <b>Europoids.</b> The reasons for such differences could be due to certain ethno-specific allelic variants of the interleukins, which considerably change the degree of cytokine expression. The aim was to study the peculiarities of the association of the interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) gene polymorphisms and interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra). Patients with chronic gastritis and ulcer disease were examined using the restriction analysis method. The most wide-spread allelic variants among the Khakas were discovered to be С�� IL- 1 β and R 4 R 4 IL- 1 Ra. In this study, we suggest the necessity to define the population’s risk and the protective genotypes that promote Helicobacter pylori-associated ulcer disease among the Khakas people...|$|R
25|$|The Indo-Iranian migrations {{took place}} in two waves, {{belonging}} to the second and the third stage of Beckwith's description of the Indo-European migrations.

The Khazar realm was a polyglot (multi lingual) and polyethnic (multicultural) state, with Iranian, Finnic, Ugric, Slavic, and North Caucasian languages. According to anthropological data, it was ruled by Inner Asian Mongoloid (with some <b>Europoid</b> somatic elements) core tribes that accompanied the dynasty. The Turkic tribes probably spoke a number of Turkic languages. Scholars considered it a possibility that the term Khazar denoted one or even several languages; however, the sources cannot determine the extent of its use.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, {{a genetic}} study of ancient Siberian cultures, the Andronovo culture, tha Karasuk culture, the Tagar {{culture and the}} Tashtyk culture, was {{published}} in the journal Human Genetics. Four individuals of the Karasuk culture of four different sites from 1400 BC to 800 BC were surveyed. Extractions of mtDNA from two individuals were determined to possess the Western Eurasian U5a1 and U4 lineages. Extractions of Y-DNA from two individuals were both determined to be of Y-chromosome haplogroup R1a1, which is thought to mark the eastward migration of the early Indo-Europeans.

50|$|The {{origins of}} the Karasuk culture are complex, but it is {{generally}} accepted that its origins lie both with the Andronovo culture and local cultures of the Yenisei. The ethnic identity of the Karasuk is problematic, as the Andronovo culture {{has been associated with}} the Indo-Iranians while the local cultures have been considered as unconnected to the steppe. Nevertheless, a specifically Proto-Iranian identity has been proposed for the Karasuk culture. The Karasuk tribes have been described by archaeologists as exhibiting pronounced <b>Europoid</b> features. George van Driem has suggested a connection with the Yeniseian and Burushaski people, proposing a Karasuk languages group.|$|E

50|$|The Roman mole, Talpa romana, {{was once}} {{considered}} a subspecies of the European mole {{as they are}} of similar size.

Although similar in body, the dentition of T. romana is obviously larger in size than that of the European mole. Both the length of the tooth row and the individual elements are larger. Moreover, the mesotyle of the upper molars is generally divided. The dentition of Talpa europaea is small and the length of M1-M3 is less than 19% of the length of the condyle base.

50|$|The Tagar {{culture was}} preceded by the Karasuk culture. The Tagars have been {{described}} by archaeologists as exhibiting pronounced <b>Europoid</b> features.

They made a living by raising livestock, predominantly large horned livestock and horses, goats and sheep. Harvest was collected with bronze sickles and reaping knives. The Tagar produced animal art motifs (Scythian art) very similar to the Scythians of southern European Russia. Perhaps the most striking feature of the culture are huge royal kurgans fenced by stone plaques, with four vertical stelae marking the corners. The Tagar culture was succeeded by the Tashtyk culture.|$|E

50|$|The Eurasian Avars were {{group of}} sixth-century nomadic warriors {{that came from}} Northern Central Asia who ruled in what is today Central Europe. Anthropological {{research}} has revealed few skeletons with Mongoloid-type features, although there was continuing cultural influence from the Eurasian nomadic steppe.

Mongoloid and Euro-Mongoloid types compose about one-third of the total population of the Avar graves of the eighth century with the late Avar Period showing more hybridization resulting in higher frequencies of Europo-Mongolids. Initially, the Avars and their subjects lived separately, except for Slavic and Germanic women who were married to Avar men. Eventually, the Germanic and Slavic peoples were included in the Avaric social order and culture, which itself was Persian-Byzantine in fashion.|$|E
50|$|Although {{cultivation}} of crops has continued since the Neolithic, agriculture has always remained small in scale compared to pastoral nomadism. Agriculture may have first been introduced {{from the west}} or arose independently in the region. The population during the Copper Age {{has been described as}} mongoloid in the east of what is now Mongolia, and as <b>europoid</b> in the west. Tocharians (Yuezhi) and Scythians inhabited western Mongolia during the Bronze Age. The mummy of a Scythian warrior, which is believed to be about 2,500 years old, was a 30- to 40-year-old man with blond hair; it was found in the Altai, Mongolia. As horse nomadism was introduced into Mongolia, the political center of the Eurasian Steppe also shifted to Mongolia, where it remained until the 18th century CE. The intrusions of northern pastoralists (e.g., Guifang, Shanrong, Donghu) into China during the Shang dynasty (1600-1046 BC) and Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BC) presaged the age of nomadic empires.|$|E
5000|$|Bronze {{metallurgy}} in China {{originated in}} what {{is referred to as}} the Erlitou (...) period, which some historians argue places it within the range of dates controlled by the Shang dynasty.

Though this provides a concise frame of reference, it overlooks the continued importance of bronze in Chinese metallurgy and culture. Since this is significantly later than the discovery of bronze in Mesopotamia, bronze technology could have been imported rather than discovered independently in China. While there may be reason to believe that bronzework developed inside China separately from outside influence, the discovery of <b>Europoid</b> mummies in Xinjiang suggests a possible route of transmission from the West.|$|E
