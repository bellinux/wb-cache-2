5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and <b>genitals</b> were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and <b>genitals.</b>|$|E

40|$|Rat {{somatosensory}} cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic <b>genital</b> representation. <b>Genital</b> cortex undergoes an unusual 2 -fold expansion during puberty.

Raising female rats {{in contact with}} adult males promoted <b>genital</b> cortex expansion, whereas contact to adult females or nontactile (audio-visual-olfactory) male cues did not. <b>Genital</b> touch imposed by human experimenters powerfully advanced female <b>genital</b> cortex development and sexual maturation.

5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the <b>genitals</b> after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the <b>genitals</b> may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} lower <b>genital</b> tract infections on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA shed-ding in the female <b>genital</b> tract.

Both ulcerative sexually transmitted infections (syphilis, chan-croid, and herpes) and nonulcerative sexually transmitted in-fections (gonorrhea and chlamydia) {{have been associated with}} higher rates of transmission and acquisition of HIV [1].

5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion {{may lead to the}} anus being below the <b>genitals,</b> or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male <b>genitals</b> allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether patients with <b>genital</b> warts carry human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA on their fingers. METHODS: 14 men and eight women with <b>genital</b> warts had cytobrush samples taken from <b>genital</b> lesions, finger tips, and tips of finger nails. Samples were examined {{for the presence}} of HPV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in all female <b>genital</b> samples and in 13 / 14 male <b>genital</b> samples.

Although sexual intercourse is considered the usual mode of transmitting <b>genital</b> HPV infection, our findings raise the possibility of transmission by finger-genital contact. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is polygynandrous, {{although}} the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season.

Males may inspect the female's <b>genitals</b> to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E
