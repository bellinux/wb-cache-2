40|$|The {{interaction}} of proteins and cells with polymers {{is critical to}} their use in scientific and medical applications. In this study, plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) was used to modify {{the surface of the}} conducting polymer, polypyrrole, which possesses electrical properties. PIII treatment enabled persistent, covalent binding of the cell adhesive protein, tropoelastin, without employing chemical linking molecules. In contrast tropoelastin was readily eluted from the untreated surface. Through this differential persistence of binding, surface bound tropoelastin supported cell adhesion and spreading on the PIII treated but not the untreated polypyrrole surface. The application of a steel shadow mask during PIII treatment allowed for spatial definition of tropoelastin exclusively to PIII treated regions. The general applicability of this approach to other extracellular matrix proteins was illustrated using collagen I, which displayed similar results to tropoelastin but required <b>extended</b> <b>washing</b> conditions. This approach allowed fine patterning of cell adhesion and spreading to tropoelastin and collagen, specifically on PIII treated polypyrrole regions. We therefore present a methodology to alter the functionality of polypyrrole surfaces, generating surfaces that can spatially control cellular interactions through protein functionalization with the potential for electrical stimulation...|$|R

Binding followed saturation kinetics and was competitively inhibited by unlabeled medium components, both the dialyzable and nondialyzable fractions. Other oral streptococci were also found to bind these complex medium components. Rabbit antiserum elicited to the high-molecular-weight Todd-Hewitt broth components reacted with monkey cardiac muscle and with S. mutans coated with medium components. Absorption of the anti-Todd-Hewitt broth serum with homogenized heart removed antibodies that reacted with Todd-Hewitt broth-coated S. mutans.

40|$|The polyamines putrescine (PUT) and spermine (SPM) were {{examined}} {{for their ability}} to protect human cell Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) against the formation of radiation-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). As observed previously, under conditions where polyamines were shown to be almost completely absent, association with nuclear matrix protein into a nucleoid, and organization into chromatin structure, protected DNA from induction of DSBs by factors of 4. 5 and 95, respectively. At concentrations below 1 mM, PUT or SPM provided equivalent levels of protection to deproteinized nuclear DNA, consistent with their capacity to scavenge radiation-induced radicals. At constant ionic strength, 5 mM SPM protected deproteinized DNA and nucleoid DNA and DNA in nuclear chromatin by factors of 100 and 26, respectively. At 5 mM, SPM provided 15 times greater protection of deproteinized DNA than did PUT. Under physiologically relevant conditions, 5 mM SPM protected DNA in the intact nucleus from the induction of DSBs by a factor of 2 relative to DNA in the absence of SPM. Studies of SPM binding during cellular fractionation revealed that a significant fraction of the cellular SPM is tightly bound in the nucleus but can be removed by <b>extended</b> <b>washing.</b> Thus the association of SPM with nuclear chromatin appears to be a significant contributor to the resistance of the cell's DNA to the induction of DSBs...|$|R
40|$|Lichens, {{self-supporting}} mutualistic {{associations between}} a fungal partner {{and one or}} more photosynthetic partners, also harbor non-photosynthetic bacteria. The diversity and contribution of these bacteria to the functioning of lichen symbiosis have recently begun to be studied, often by culture-independent techniques due to difficulties in their isolation and culture. However, culturing as yet unculturable lichenic bacteria is critical to unravel their potential functional roles in lichen symbiogenesis, to explore and exploit their biotechnological potential and for the description of new taxa. Our objective was to improve the recovery of lichen associated bacteria by developing novel isolation and culture approaches, initially using the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea. We evaluated the effect of newly developed media enriched with novel lichen extracts, {{as well as the}} influence of thalli washing time and different disinfection and processing protocols of thalli. The developed methodology included: i) the use of lichen enriched media to mimic lichen nutrients, supplemented with the fungicide natamycin; ii) an <b>extended</b> <b>washing</b> of thalli to increase the recovery of ectolichenic bacteria, thus allowing the disinfection of thalli to be discarded, hence enhancing endolichenic bacteria recovery; and iii) the use of an antioxidant buffer to prevent or reduce oxidative stress during thalli disruption. The optimized methodology allowed significant increases in the number and diversity of culturable bacteria associated with P. furfuracea, and it was also successfully applied to the lichens Ramalina farinacea and Parmotrema pseudotinctorum. Furthermore, we provide, for the first time, data on the abundance of culturable ecto- and endolichenic bacteria that naturally colonize P. furfuracea, R. farinacea and P. pseudotinctorum, some of which were only able to grow on lichen enriched media.

Three different concentrations of AgCl + TiO 2 (500 ppm, 2500 ppm, and 5000 ppm) were applied using pad and exhaust application methods. Exhaust bath samples were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minute time points. Ag concentration analysis provided insight on exhaustion behavior. Samples from each treatment group underwent 0, 1, 5, and 10 accelerated laundering cycles and were tested against Escherichia coli and Staphyloccocus aureus. Exhaustion in all three fabric bath concentrations occurred rapidly in the first 15 minutes, continuing to exhaust at a slower rate throughout the sample time frame. Samples treated with the exhaust application method produced larger zones of inhibition and retained antimicrobial effectiveness through more launderings than those treated with the pad application against both bacterial species. All fabric samples lost antimicrobial effectiveness after 5 accelerated launderings, well below the industry standard of 50. A statistically significant difference in the mean zones of inhibition existed between pad and exhaust application methods after 0 wash cycles for E. coli. After 0 accelerated laundering cycles, S. aureus exhibited a mean zone of inhibition on the statistical cusp of significance between application methods. A statistically significant difference existed in the mean zones of inhibition between Ag concentrations after 0 accelerated laundering cycles for both bacterial species. While results of this experimentation show Ag does exhaust onto nylon fabric, a bath treatment or alteration in exhaustion conditions, such as addition of a binding agent, may yield complete exhaustion, leaving minimal Ag in wastewater. While the exhaust application method provides greater antimicrobial action at low washings than the pad method, it does not improve the longevity of antimicrobial properties after <b>extended</b> <b>washing.</b> Addition of an auxiliary to the exhaustion bath could improve durability to laundering, reducing Ag in wash effluent, and perhaps cost effectiveness of treatment. This study provides future researchers with a foundation for research that focuses on improving the exhaust application method...|$|R
40|$|In ophthalmology, {{there is}} a need for novel degradable {{biomaterials}} for e. g. controlled drug release in the vitreous body. These degradable materials should feature both excellent biocompatibility, and well-defined kinetics of degradation. In most cases, poly(D,L-lactic acid), or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) are used. These materials, however, suffer from some serious drawbacks, since the degradation kinetics are difficult to control, especially since the so-called 'burst-degradation' occurs. Here, we describe a set of novel polymeric networks which largely consist of poly(dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate) (poly(DMAEMA)); these materials are crosslinked via a dimethacrylate molecule that contains two carbonate groups. This system is susceptible to hydrolytic scission. The degradation products do nor exert a catalytic effect on the ongoing degradation reaction (i. e. there is no burst effect). We describe the synthesis of three of these materials, which differ merely with regard to the crosslinker content. These materials were characterized through DMTA, H- 1 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The reaction DMAEMA + 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was studied in detail, using H- 1 NMR spectroscopy, and these experiments revealed that the reaction of DMAEMA and HEMA produces a random (Bernouillian-type) copolymer. From this, we contend that the new materials have more or less uniform distribution of the crosslinks throughout their volume. Structural degradation of the three materials was studied in vitro, at pH 7. 4, 9. 1 and 12. 0. It is found that the materials exhibit smooth hydrolysis, which can be controlled via the crosslink density and the pH, as was expected a priori. It should be noted that degradation of these materials produces non-hydrolysable, but water-soluble, oligo(DMAEMA) and poly(DMAEMA) molecules. We subsequently performed in vitro studies on the biocompatibility of these materials. The MTT cytotoxicity assay revealed that the materials were cytotoxic to chondrosarcoma cells. This is most probably due to local increase of the pH due to the basic character of the pending dimethylamino groups. Cytotoxicity remained virtually unchanged after <b>extended</b> <b>washing</b> with water. This indicates that the cytotoxicity is an intrinsic property of the material and was not caused by remnants of free monomer. Cytotoxicity was also seen in cell cultures (human fibroblasts isolated from donor corneas) which were grown in contact with the materials. It is concluded that the new materials have attractive degradation characteristics, but their cytotoxicity makes them unsuitable for applications in ophthalmology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, {{recycling}} {{represents one}} of the most successful and widespread examples of polymer recycling. This material is fully recyclable and may be used for manufacturing new products in many industrial areas. Nevertheless, the excellent properties of PET needed for its many applications are also responsible for the difficult degradation of PET and an accumulation of polymer waste, which in turn creates serious environmental problems connected to littering and illegal landfilling or incineration. The main goal of this study was to examine the effect of alkali pretreatment on the properties of PET flakes. PET flakes were washed at twotemperatures, 70 °C and 75 °C and in various time intervals of 15, 18, 21, 25, and 30 min. All samples were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and by contact angle measurements. The results showed that during the alkali treatment the partial depolymerization of PET was obtained, which resulted in the formation of various types of oligomers with hydroxyl and carboxyl end groups, which were the result of loss of high molecular structure. Decrease of intensity of characteristic vibrational bands (CO at 1717, COO at 1265 and CH 2 at 722 cm- 1) with extended time was observed (Figs. 1 and 2). Further on, the formation of hydroxyl groups at ṽ = 3428 cm- 1 was also observed as a result of PET depolimerization during the alkali treatment, which behaviour was better visible for samples washed at 75 °C and with <b>extended</b> <b>washing</b> time (Fig 2 b). During the DSC thermal analysis, multiple melting peaks were observed in some studied samples which could be linked to partial melting and re-crystallization of PET or to the occurrence of new polymer fractions of lower molecular mass (Figs. 3 and 4). It is evident that the contact angle of PET samples (Fig. 5) decreases in comparison to the PET 0, which points to the changes on the PET surface during the alkali treatment. Decrease in contact angle (which is measured with water) indicates an increase in surface hydrophilicity and increase in the number of present polar -OH and -COOH groups formed during the partial degradation. Also, the values of total surface energies and their polar and dispersive components indicate that during the alkali treatment the surface characteristics of PET flakes were slightly changed due to depolymerization (Table 3). Generally, it can be concluded that partial depolymerization of PET flakes occurs during the alkali treatment but the material retains its good properties and it is appropriate for the further recycling process...|$|R

FTIR-spektroskopijom potvrđeno je nastajanje karboksilnih i hidroksilnih skupina na ṽ = 3428 cm- 1 tijekom alkalnog pranja. Smanjenje intenziteta karakterističnih vibracijskih vrpci (CO, COO i CH 2) također ukazuje na depolimerizaciju PET-a odnosno nastajanje kraćih polimernih lanaca. DSC-om su određene {{temperature}} kristalizacije i taljenja te se iz dobivenih rezultata može zaključiti da je tijekom pranja došlo do djelomične depolimerizacije PET-a.

40|$|A {{series of}} pilot and {{full-scale}} experiments {{were carried out}} at the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant in Kitchener, Ontario to {{examine the impact of}} backwash technique, filter media characteristics, and combinations thereof on single stage drinking water biological filter performance. The media characteristics investigated were effective size, uniformity coefficient, and media type (GAC and anthracite). Backwash techniques investigated were the collapsed pulse backwash, the <b>extended</b> terminal subfluidization <b>wash</b> (ETSW), and the presence of chlorine in the wash water. Single stage biological filters must serve the dual purpose of biologically mediated removal of biodegradable organic matter (BOM), as well as meeting traditional filter performance criteria such as turbidity removal with minimal head loss accumulation. Accordingly, dissolved organic carbon removal, biodegradable dissolved organic carbon removal, biological respiration potential, turbidity removal, filter ripening time, and head loss accumulation were all quantified as measures of biological filtration performance. The results of this study have several implications for optimized design and operation of biological filters during drinking water treatment. An increase in effective size of media grains from 1. 0 mm to 1. 3 mm was shown to significantly extend filter run time by minimizing head loss accumulation without compromising turbidity or BOM removal. Uniformity coefficient however, showed no significant effect on biological filter performance; indicating that the performance benefits associated with highly uniform media may not be commensurate with cost. GAC was found to be significantly more resilient to backwashing in collapsed pulse and chlorinated modes, which impaired BOM removal in anthracite filters. This resilience imparts a high degree of operational flexibility to backwashing GAC filters. The significant decrease in BOM removal by anthracite filters can be minimized; however, by using an optimized backwashing technique. Collapsed pulse backwashing was found to {{have a significant effect on}} biological filter performance. When chlorinated collapsed pulse was used, filter cycles were significantly shortened by approximately 30 – 50 % due to a sudden surge in effluent turbidity. This effect is thought to be the result of biofilm, damaged during the course of backwashing sloughing from the media. <b>Extended</b> terminal subfluidization <b>wash</b> was found to significantly reduce, and often eliminate filter ripening entirely. Additionally, the extended contact time with chlorine associated with chlorinated ETSW did not appear to have a significant effect on filter BOM removal. By eliminating filter ripening without compromising biological performance, ETSW shows promise for significant water and production cost savings by minimizing the filter-to-waste period during filter ripening. The presence of chlorine however, was associated with decreased DOC, 24 hours in to the filter cycle. This factor, combined with the negative interaction between chlorine and collapsed pulse suggests chlorinated wash water should be avoided in biological filtration systems like the ones investigated...|$|R

Previous NVR validation testing of space hardware used Freon (CFC- 113) as the test solvent.

A check list was used during the observation of hand washing practices and an interview guide was used for the focus group discussions. The results showed that, most school children observed did not practice proper hand washing with soap, both in school and at home due to the unavailability and inaccessibility of hand washing facilities such as soap, towel and clean running water. However, majority (90. 2 %) of those who used the school toilet practiced hand washing with soap after defecation. Private schools were found to be 63 % (p = 0. 02) less likely to wash their hands after using the toilet, 51 % (p = 0. 03) less likely to wash their hands before eating and 77 % (p< 0. 001) less likely to wash their hands with soap after eating compared to their public school counterparts. Parents reported the presence of hand washing facilities at home but structured observations during home visits proved otherwise. The need to <b>extend</b> the hand <b>washing</b> campaigns to private schools cannot be overemphasised. It will be useful for the Ghana Education Service to collaborate with all stakeholders; such as Ghana Health Services, National Community on Water and Sanitation Programme, health workers, and the Parents Teacher Associations (PTAs). This union will foster stronger linkages that will pave the way for educating and monitoring the school children for effective hand washing practices...|$|R
40|$|Peptides are {{polymers}} of {{amino acids}} and are better drug candidates than traditional small-molecule compounds {{due to high}} specificity and potency. Conventional synthesis methods include Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis (LPPS), which have different technical limitations. Significant improvements {{can be made by}} a new technology, Membrane Enhanced Peptide Synthesis (MEPS), which integrates nanofiltration into LPPS for the purification of intermediate products. The research work described in this thesis is an outcome of the MemTide consortium (Imperial College London, Institute for Research in Biomedicine (Barcelona) (IRB) and University of Turku) and three companies (Evonik Membrane Extraction Technology (MET) Ltd, Janssen Pharmaceutica and Lonza AG), whose task was to investigate membrane enhanced synthesis for both peptides and oligonucleotides. This research project demonstrates that MEPS is ready for industrial application in terms of technical feasibility and economic performance relative to SPPS and LPPS. The MEPS of two peptides (Fmoc-Arg-Ala-Asp-Ala-NH 2 (fully deprotected Fmoc-RADA-NH 2) and Pyr-Ser(Bzl) -Ala-Phe-Asp-Leu-NH 2 (partially deprotected Pyr-SAFDL-NH 2)) is presented in the form of case studies. In the first case study, MEPS of fully deprotected Fmoc-RADA-NH 2 was attempted four times. The first three attempts encountered the problem of incomplete coupling after the post-de-Fmoc diafiltration, which was solved by the <b>extended</b> diafiltration (14 <b>wash</b> volumes). At a scale of 10. 01 mmol (those in the proof of concept studies were 0. 9 and 1. 8 mmol), the fourth attempt at MEPS was successful with a purity of 98. 5 % and an overall yield of 78. 6 % before cleavage and global deprotection. This shows that the integration of nanofiltration into LPPS was technically feasible for obtaining high purity and decent yield of the anchored peptide that were comparable to those of SPPS (85. 3 % and 78. 3 % respectively before cleavage and global deprotection). In the second case study, a similar research approach was adopted for the partially deprotected Pyr-SAFDL-NH 2 and the same problem of incomplete coupling occurred even with increased wash volumes. The cause was found to be residual piperidine in the system after the post-de-Fmoc diafiltration. The solution was to add a base (diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), which was also a reagent in each coupling) into the system during diafiltration to assist the removal of piperidine. At a scale of 33. 65 mmol and an anchor concentration of 10. 4 weight % in the starting solution, the third attempt at MEPS was successful with a purity of 88. 1 % and an overall yield of 71. 2 % before cleavage and global deprotection (98. 6 % and 72. 6 % respectively for SPPS; 100. 0 % and 72. 4 % respectively for LPPS (by precipitation)). Furthermore, MEPS outperformed SPPS and LPPS (by precipitation) in terms of material cost (8. 7 – 13. 0 % lower), process time (33. 3 – 91. 7 % shorter), volumetric efficiency (15. 4 – 15. 9 % higher) and E-factor (29. 3 – 68. 8 % lower). The results proved that this novel process is indeed an attractive alternative to SPPS and LPPS (by precipitation) and is ready for industrial application. Encouraged by the positive results from the two case studies, attempts were made to further improve the performance of MEPS before cleavage and global deprotection by reducing the significant yield loss during diafiltration. Peptide synthesis was performed on two alternative anchors (amine-functionalised silica nanoparticles and a branched compound with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) arms (PyPEG)), but each had technical limitations during the coupling of amino acids. On the other hand, promising results were obtained from the modelling of MEPS in a two-stage membrane cascade system, as the second membrane served to recover the anchored peptide that permeated through the first one during diafiltration. As a result, the overall yield would increase from 71. 2 to 93. 8 %, making the new process even more attractive in terms of material cost (23. 6 – 33. 5 % lower than the single-stage MEPS and SPPS).

40|$|The {{meniscus}} is a fibrocartilage structure {{found within}} the knee joint whose functions. include; stress distribution, load transmission, stability and lubrication ofthe joint. Demand for a suitable, 'off the shelf meniscal replacementhas increased considerably due to the rising number of injuries to the knee. This predisposition to meniscal injury relates to the limited vascularisation of the tissue resulting in restricted access of necessary repair factors. Damage to the avascular areas of the meniscus may lead to loss of function, compromising the tribological function of the knee joint. Allografts represent the gold standard in meniscal replacement, but problems related to foreign body reaction, sizing/shrinkage of the implant and lack ofchondroprotection, {{have yet to be}} solved. Synthetic products such as the Collagen Meniscal ImplantÃ‚Â™ are available which allow repair of large defects, however, this only functions when the exterior meniscal rim is intact and has been associated with poor biomechanical functioning. The overall aim of this project was to develop and evaluate the potential ofan acellular porcine medial meniscus for use as a biological matrix for a tissue engineered meniscal substitute. Following several iterations, whole porcine medial menisci were decellularised by subjecting the tissue to freeze thaw cycles, incubation in hypotonic tris buffer, 0. 15 % (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in hypotonic buffer plus protease inhibitors, nucleases, hypertonic buffer followed by disinfection using 0. 1 % (v/v) peracetic acid and final washing in, phosphate buffered saline. The presence or absence ofcells was confirmed histologically, whilst DNA levels were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed using a range of molecular techniques including agarose gel electrophoresis and nano-spectrophotometry (amount ofDNA). Histological analysis demonstrated an absence of cells within the decellularised tissue whilst DNA levels were less than 2 ng. mg-I. Histologica. l, immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis (collagen and glycosaminoglycans) of the decellularised tissue in comparison to the fresh porcine medial meniscal tissue confirmed the retention of the major structural proteins (collagen: fresh, 83. 4 % (Ã‚Â± 13. 9, 95 % confidence limits [CLl) (w/w); decellularised, 74. 3 % (Ã‚Â± 21. 7, 95 % iii CL). There was however a 59. 4 % loss ofglycosaminoglycans as determined by the sulfated/carboxylated sugar assay. In addition, electron microscopy allowed visualisation of areas ofsynovial-like membrane damage following decellularisation. Biomechanical properties were determined by indentation and uni-axial tensile tests which confirmed the' retention of biomechanical function following decellularisation. Biocompatibility of the acellular scaffold was determined using in vitro contactand extract cytotoxicity tests. Unfortunately, deep meniscal tissue was found to be cytotoxic. Modifications to the original decellularisation protocol were incorporated to overcome this problem. These included, reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration (0. 1 % (w/v)), reduced detergent wash temperature (45 Ã‚Â°C) and <b>extended</b> terminal buffer <b>wash.</b> Consequently, decellularised tissue and extracts were found not to be cytotoxic to cells. Residual sodium dodecyl sulfate present within the acellular scaffold was determined using radio labelled 14 C sodium dodecyl sulphate (0. 022 % (Ã‚Â± 0. 08, 95 % CL) (w/w) SDS), whilst differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated retention of the thermal stability of the decelhilarised meniscus (denaturation enthalpy: fresh outer meniscus, 510. 4 J. g- 1 (Ã‚Â± 153. 19, 95 % CL); fresh inner meniscus 399. 23 Ig-I (Ã‚Â± 99. 4, 95 % CL); [...] deceIlularised outer meniscus, 492 J. g- 1 (Ã‚Â± 73. 99, 95 % CL), decellularised outer meniscus, 283. 86 J. g- 1 (Ã‚Â± 115. 75, 95 % CL). Immunohistochemistry and antibody adsorption assays showed no evidence ofthe expression of the major antigenic epitope, galactose-a-I, 3 -galactose in the decellularised porcine medial meniscus. The biocompatibility of the acellular scaffold was assessed in vivo by subcutaneous implantation into galactosyl-transferase knockout mice. The explanted tissue was assessed for foreign body response (capsule thickness), cellular _infiltr~te phenotype (F 4 / 80, CD 3, CD 4, CD 34 and C 3 c), as well as the presence of antigalactose- a-I, 3 -galactose antibodies in the mouse serum. A non-specific foreign-body response was observed following implantation of the decellularised porcine medial meniscal tissue. Preliminary investigations into in vitro recellularisation of the acellular medial meniscal scaffold demonstrated the successful attachment ofprimary human dermal fibroblasts and primary porcine meniscal cells. In addition, primary human dermal fibroblasts were able to iv infiltrate the scaffold following seven days in culture. Studies into the potential incorporation of bone blocks demonstrated almost complete cell removal following application of the established decellularisation treatment, whilst the galactose-a-l, 3 galactose epitope was not detected by immunohistochemistry and antibody adsorption assay. In conclusion, this study has generated preliminary results into the production of a biocompatible, biomechanically functional scaffold which has excellent potential for development ofa tissue engineered solution to meniscal repair.
