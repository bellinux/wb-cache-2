5|$|Deeply {{shocked and}} {{upset by the}} accident, Wilbur {{determined}} to make even more impressive flight demonstrations; in the ensuing <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> he set new records for altitude and duration. In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France, {{and for a time}} they were the three most famous people in the world, sought after by royalty, the rich, reporters and the public. The kings of Great Britain, Spain and Italy came to see Wilbur fly.|$|E
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E
5|$|These happenings were a first {{cumulation}} {{of a civil}} commotion, {{that had}} started {{a few days earlier}} with large strikes and demonstrations. On 4November 1918, a first workers' council under the leadership of the 23-year-old Spartacist Fritz Rück had been established in Stuttgart. During the following <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> more spontaneously elected worker and soldier councils were formed, and took over a large part of Württemberg. Rau was elected leader of the military police in his home city of Zuffenhausen, a part of Stuttgart's urban area.|$|E

5|$|After a quiet {{period in}} February 1945 {{absorbing}} replacements, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} defensive line and ordered to recapture Trier from the US Army. This attack started on 7 March in freezing conditions but after limited success a fresh US offensive struck the division and forced them back north of Mainz. By 19 March, Raithel's regiment had {{been converted into a}} kampfgruppe (battlegroup) consisting of two gebirgsjäger battalions, a mountain artillery battalion, a pioneer company and eight anti-tank guns. Two weeks later they were fighting their way out of encirclement near Limburg. On 1 April 1945, Kampfgruppe Raithel and the rest of what remained of the division drove east. Shortly afterwards, Raithel received a serious head wound and was captured. The remnants of the division disintegrated over the next few <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> and were captured by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply in the coming <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks.</b> Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him in the <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{launched}} an offensive against France and, {{adhering to the}} Manstein Plan also attacked the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940. That same day British forces landed in Iceland and the Faroes to preempt a possible German invasion of the islands. The U.S., in close co-operation with the Danish envoy to Washington D.C., agreed to protect Greenland, laying the political framework for the formal establishment of bases in April 1941. The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics in a few <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks,</b> respectively. The French-fortified Maginot Line and {{the main body of}} the Allied forces which had moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes region, mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. As a result, the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten. The majority were taken prisoner, whilst over 300,000, mostly British and French, were evacuated from the continent at Dunkirk by early June, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.|$|E

25|$|The policy also {{encouraged}} {{the development of}} the first early warning systems. Conventional war, even at its fastest, was fought over <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks.</b> With long-range bombers, from the start of a nuclear attack to its conclusion was mere hours. Rockets could reduce a conflict to minutes. Planners reasoned that conventional command and control systems could not adequately react to a nuclear attack, so great lengths were taken to develop computer systems that could look for enemy attacks and direct rapid responses.|$|E
25|$|Although twelve states sent delegations, {{there were}} {{never more than}} eleven {{represented}} in the floor debates, often fewer. State delegations absented themselves at votes different times of day. There was no minimum for a state delegation; one would do. Daily sessions would have thirty members present. Members came and went on public and personal business. The Articles Congress was meeting at the same time, so members would absent themselves to New York City on Congressional business for <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> at a time.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 1939, {{without a}} formal {{declaration}} of war, Nazi Germany invaded Poland using {{the pretext of}} the Gleiwitz incident, a provocation (one of many) staged by the Germans, who claimed that Polish troops attacked a post along the German–Polish border. During the following <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> the technically, logistically and numerically superior German forces rapidly advanced into the Polish territory. Secured by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet troops also invaded Poland on 17 September 1939.

On July 8 the army's forward (mobile) detachment, which included the 1434th SU Regiment (SU-85s), liberated the Belorussian town of Novogrudok. In the following <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeks</b> the advance became slower and more grueling, across the Neman River through Grodno, to the approaches to East Prussia, arriving there in late August. On July 15, Boldin was promoted to the rank of Colonel General. In November, Rokossovsky was moved to the command of 2nd Belorussian Front, and Boldin once again came under his orders.|$|E

During the storm, 10,563people evacuated to storm shelters. Across the island, 11,463houses were severely damaged by Hortense. The hurricane left $128.4million in crop damage, primarily to coffee, plantains, and bananas. There was another $25million from road damage. There were 19deaths on the island, {{many of whom}} due to flash flood drownings.
