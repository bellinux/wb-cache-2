30|$|Replicating the pore topology/structure {{of tight}} gas {{reservoirs}} {{is essential to}} model fluid flow through such porous media. Constitutive relationships between the macroscopic properties of the medium can often help with such modeling efforts. Permeability and formation factor are rock properties providing useful information for assessing the potential of hydrocarbon recovery. Pore topology/structure and pore–throat radius distributions are the major factors having influence on permeability and formation factor estimation. A stochastic random generation algorithm is employed to study the effect of pore structure and geometries on the relationships of formation factor–permeability and permeability–porosity on physically realistic 3 D random networks. These relationships are derived by constructing two sets of physically <b>equivalent</b> pore <b>networks</b> of tight porous media and are validated using experimental measurements of Mesaverde tight gas sandstones. The first set of networks were based on Berea sand network properties, which are then reduced and derived using a Weibull truncated equation to produce physically sound tight porous media. The second <b>equivalent</b> <b>networks</b> are constructed according to experimentally derived throat size distributions obtained from ambient mercury injection capillary pressure for 17 selected core samples from three Mesaverde tight gas sandstones basins in the U.S. Imperial college Pore-Scale Modeling software is used to model the single liquid flow properties through constructed <b>equivalent</b> <b>networks.</b> The estimated porosity, absolute liquid permeability and formation factor of the constructed physically <b>equivalent</b> <b>networks</b> are in good agreement with measured data obtained by Byrnes et al. (Analysis of critical permeability, capillary and electrical properties for Mesaverde tight gas sandstones from Western US basins: final scientific. Technical report submitted to DOE and NETL 355, 2009). However, a variation between estimated absolute permeability to liquid and measured routine gas permeability is accounted in core samples that have measured permeability smaller than 0.1  mD. Networks based on Berea sand properties show qualitative agreement between modeled data points and experiment data. However, modeled data are off by two orders of magnitude and all fall more or less on the same line.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{supposed}} that the radiation losses, because actually the metallic plates have a finite width, are negligible. In fact, supposing {{that the field}} evanescent in the outside air-regions is negligible at the aperture, {{we can assume that}} the situation substantially coincides with the ideal case of the metallic plates having infinite width.

50|$|The taper {{design for}} {{controlling}} the sidelobe level would therefore involve only the relative unbalance Δb/bm.The transverse <b>equivalent</b> <b>network</b> is slightly {{complicated by the}} presence of two additional changes in height of the waveguide,which can be modeled by means of shunt susceptances and ideal transformers.The ideal transformer accounts for the change in the characteristic impedance, while the storing of reactive energy is taken into account through the susceptance.Scanning arrays achieve scanning in two dimensions by creating a one-dimensional phased array of leaky-wave line-source antennas. The individual line sources are scanned in elevation by varying the frequency.Scanning in the cross plane, and therefore in azimuth, is produced by phase shifters arranged in the feed structure of the one-dimensional array of line sources.The radiation will therefore occur in pencil-beam form and will scan in both elevation and azimuth in a conical-scan manner.The spacing between the line sources is chosen such that no grating lobes occur, and accurate analyses show that no blind spots appear anywhere.The described arrays have been analyzed accurately by unit-cell approach that takes into account all mutual-coupling effects.Each unit cell incorporates an individual line-source antenna, but in the presence of all the others.The radiating termination on the unit cell modifies the transverse equivalent network.A key new feature of the array analysis is therefore the determination of the active admittance of the unit cell in the two-dimensional environment as a function of scan angle.If the values of β and α did not change with phase shift, the scan would be exactly conical.However, it is found that these values change only a little, so that the deviation from conical scan is small.We next consider whether or not blind spots are present.Blind spots refer to angles at which the array cannot radiate or receive any power; if a blind spot occurred at some angle, therefore, the value of α would rapidly go to zero at that scan angle.To check for blind spots, we would then look for any sharp dips in the curves of α/k0 as a function of scan angle. No such dips were ever found.Typical data of this type exhibit fairly flat behavior for α/k0 until the curves drop quickly to zero as they reach the end of the conical-scan range, where the beam hits the ground.|$|E

The purpose of our approach is to allow {{the interpretation of the}} “network behavior, ” as it can be utilized by photointer-preters for the validation of the neural classifier. In addition, our approach gives a criterion for defining the network architecture, so avoiding the classical trial-and-error process.

Then, such networks are trained to solve the problem by the error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, they are transformed into <b>equivalent</b> <b>networks</b> to obtain a simplified representation.
