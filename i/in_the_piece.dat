5|$|Of all {{the strains}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
5|$|Ricordi {{sent his}} agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to {{negotiate}} with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{effect of}} these passages is often further enhanced by textural and/or cyclical devices, such as a sudden shift of musical texture, concomitant with the shift in tonality; the use of mechanically repetitive accompanimental patterns, such as ostinati and repeated chords, in the tonally remote or oscillating passages; and the allusion to previously stated material, which appeared earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> in tonally detached passages. Schubert's frequent use of similar harmonic, textural and cyclical devices in his settings of poems depicting such emotional states, only strengthens the suggestion of these psychological connotations.|$|E

5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|The song {{reveals a}} {{complete}} departure from Ciara's previous style, neither a sensual ballad nor incorporating Crunk influences. It embraces a dance-pop sound, while including R and funk via a retro 1970s-style guitar present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> Many critics noted {{the similarities between}} the song and music on Timberlake's album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006). Critics gave the song mixed reviews, complimenting the song's funk and retro feel and the chemistry present between Ciara and Timberlake. The song would later go on to be nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 52nd Grammy Awards.|$|E
5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Dmitriy Shostakovich {{worked on}} Boris Godunov in 1939–1940 on a {{commission}} from the Bolshoy Theatre {{for a new}} production of the opera. A conflation of the 1869 and 1872 versions had been published by Pavel Lamm and aroused keen interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> However, it did not erase doubts as to whether Mussorgsky's own orchestration was playable.

25|$|The {{character}} of Hedwig was originally a supporting character <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> She was loosely {{inspired by a}} German female babysitter/prostitute who worked for Mitchell's family {{when he was a}} teenager in Junction City, Kansas. The {{character of}} Tommy, originally conceived as the main character, was based on Mitchell himself: both were gay, the sons of an army general, deeply Roman Catholic, and fascinated with mythology. Hedwig became the story's protagonist when Trask encouraged Mitchell to showcase their earliest material in 1994 at NYC's drag-punk club Squeezebox, where Trask headed the house band and Mitchell's boyfriend, Jack Steeb, played bass.|$|E
25|$|However, since 1980, {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> has increased, and {{the work}} has enjoyed a notable number of revivals, including Toronto (1985), Vienna (1992–1994, 1996), Opera North (1995), Geneva (1996), San Francisco Opera (1996), Copenhagen (1996 and 1999), Amsterdam (1997), Karlsruhe (1998), Washington Concert Opera (1998), Tokyo (1999), Paris (2000), Toulouse (2000), Moscow (2001), Prague (2002), Opera Theatre of Saint Louis (2002), London (2003), and Barcelona (2003, DVD available). The latter production (first shown in Geneva) {{was presented at the}} Metropolitan Opera in 2010.

Her London West End debut was at the Apollo Theatre in the comic opera Tom Jones (1907), which had a libretto co-written by her father. Her first starring role was Eileen Cavanagh in the long-running Edwardian musical comedy The Arcadians, which she took over from Phyllis Dare in 1910. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> that followed, The Mousmé (1911), which also featured a book co-written by her father, she was cast {{in one of the}} two leading female roles alongside Florence Smithson.|$|E

25|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{considered}} one of the great pieces of war-related art. Its enduring popularity, historian Allen Frantzen says, is because it is both simple and expressive, its abstraction reflecting the modernity people valued after the war. Fabian Ware argued that its greatness was because its symbolism is so purposefully vague: To some, it is a Christian cross; to others, the stone is irrelevant and the sword itself is the cross; and to others, the artwork symbolizes those who sacrificed their lives to the sword. The theme of sacrifice is commonly seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> Jeroen Geurst points out that Lutyens' War Stone unsettlingly brings to mind images of soldiers sacrificed on the altar of war, while Blomfield's cross speaks about self-sacrifice and the saving grace of Jesus Christ's sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} {{inherent}} vice, the intrinsic instability {{of the fabric}} and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within {{the fabric of the}} material and therefore is a natural occurrence. Deterioration of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil manufacturing defects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a handle that is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third manufacturing defect includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, Prince Albert co-authored {{an op-ed}} {{published}} in the Wall Street Journal with Charles Clover, the author of , a book about overfishing and ocean conservation issues that had recently been made into a documentary by Rupert Murray. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> Prince Albert and Clover note that bluefin tuna has been severely overfished in the Mediterranean, and decry the common European Union practice of awarding inflated quotas to bluefin fleets. Albert also announced that Monaco would seek to award endangered species status to the Mediterranean bluefin Thunnus thynnus, (also called the Northern bluefin) under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). If upheld by the voting CITES delegates, this proposal would effectively ban the international trade in Mediterranean bluefin. This {{was the first time}} a nation had called for the inclusion of Mediterranean bluefin under CITES since Sweden at the 1992 CITES Conference, which was vehemently opposed by Japan who eventually threatened retaliation through trade barriers. Sweden withdrew its proposal.|$|E

25|$|For {{twenty years}} Vernet lived in Rome, {{producing}} views of seaports, storms, calms, moonlights, and large whales, becoming especially popular with English aristocrats, {{many of whom}} were on the Grand Tour. In 1745 he married an Englishwoman whom he met in the city. In 1753 he was recalled to Paris: there, by royal command, he executed the series of the seaports of France (now in the Louvre and the Musée national de la Marine) by which he is best known. His The Port of Rochefort (1763, Musée national de la Marine) is particularly notable; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> Vernet is able to achieve, according to art historian Michael Levey, one of his most 'crystalline and atmospherically sensitive skies'. Vernet has attempted to bring the foreground of his work to life through painting a wide array of figures engaging in a variety of activities, endeavouring to convey a sense of the commotion and drama of France's seaports.|$|E
25|$|The {{large-scale}} St. Luke Passion (1963–66) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, {{not least}} because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences {{saw it as a}} snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> The experimental textures, such as were seen in the Threnody, are balanced by the work's Baroque form and the occasional use of more traditional harmonic and melodic writing. Penderecki makes use of serialism in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the BACH motif, which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The Stabat Mater section {{toward the end of the}} piece concludes on a simple chord of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.|$|E
