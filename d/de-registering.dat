50|$|In 2001 the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) {{asked the}} DLP to provide names and details {{of at least}} 500 DLP members so it could check that they were valid members and also ensure there was no overlap with other parties' membership.

The DLP initiated legal action to restrain the AEC from <b>de-registering</b> the party on grounds including that the requirement to name 500 members, and the no-overlap rule, were invalid. The High Court of Australia unanimously dismissed the appeal in May 2004. The DLP survived despite the court ruling.

It can then respond with a [...] "listener ready" [...] message that is forwarded back towards the talker. Intermediate bridges use the [...] "ready" [...] message to lock down the resources needed by the stream {{and to make the}} appropriate entries in their forwarding database to allow the stream to be sent on the port that received the [...] "ready" [...] message.

50|$|As of 2007, {{new number}} plates {{normally}} cost around €30, while {{the cost of}} <b>de-registering</b> a vehicle and re-registering it with new plates is between €10 and €40. The license plates themselves are not made by the registration office but by independent for-profit stores that are usually located {{in the same building}} as the registration office or close by. Upon successful registration the applicant is merely given a slip of paper with the assigned number that can be presented at any store that makes plates. Sometimes there are several stores {{in the vicinity of the}} registration office with prices for plates dropping the further the store is away from the registration office. Once the plates are made, which is a matter of minutes, the owner must return to the registration office with them, pay the costs for registration and then the required registration seal and safety test stickers are applied to the plates making them legal for use in traffic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the {{structure}} of criminal networks, groups of related malicious infrastructures that work in concert to provide hosting for criminal activities. We develop a method to construct a graph of relationships between malicious hosts and identify the underlying criminal networks, using historic assignments in the DNS. We also develop methods to analyze these networks to identify general structural trends and devise strategies for effective remediation through takedowns. We then apply these graph construction and analysis algorithms to study the general threat landscape, as well as four cases of sophisticated criminal networks. Our results indicate that in many cases, criminal networks can be taken down by <b>de-registering</b> as few as five domain names, removing critical communication links. In cases of sophisticated criminal networks, we show that our analysis techniques can identify hosts that are critical to the network’s functionality and estimate the impact of performing network takedowns in remediating the threats. In one case, disabling 20 % of a criminal network’s hosts would reduce the overall volume of successful DNS lookups to the criminal network {{by as much as}} 70 %. This measure can be interpreted as an estimate of the {{decrease in the number of}} potential victims reaching the criminal network that would be caused by such a takedown strategy. ...|$|E
30|$|As Font and Méndez (2013) pointed out, there are, {{on the one}} hand, {{surveys that}} are {{specifically}} designed to measure and capture the realities of migrants. On the other hand, there are surveys {{that are designed to}} cover the general resident population in a given country, which includes individuals with a migration background. Several large-scale assessments, such as the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), are examples of the latter approach. PIAAC is an international survey conducted {{under the auspices of the}} OECD that assesses basic skills of adults aged 16 – 65  years in the areas of literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments in the official language or languages of the respective participating countries. Information on social and language background, time in country, education, and labor force status, among other topics, was collected in a personal interview. As proficiency in the language of the host country is one central factor for the successful social and economic integration of migrants, the PIAAC data are an excellent source with which these questions can be further explored (OECD 2013 a). For integration-related research, however, it is crucial that the core migrant population be suitably covered. For migrants, the basic skills assessed in PIAAC, such as literacy and numeracy, can serve as indicators of the extent to which they have achieved key prerequisites for social participation or structural integration in the host country. Literacy, for instance, is assessed through tasks such as reading and understanding text passages of varying length and difficulty, for example a medical package insert, a short newspaper article, or an online job advertisement (OECD 2013 a). The tasks used to measure literacy are related to everyday life situations and are comparable for individuals from different countries as well as from various migrant subgroups within these countries (Zabal et al. 2014). However, if we take a look at the skills of migrants in the PIAAC countries overall (e.g., OECD 2013 a; Maehler et al. 2014), we can observe a literacy gap between natives and migrants: The proportion of adults classified as individuals with a low literacy level (i.e., level I and below) is, on average, twice as high in the subpopulation with a migration background (operationalized here as first-generation migrants). Considering literacy as the target variable, and assuming that persons with low literacy skills are less likely to participate in surveys, the results might even be further tilted against migrants’ literacy. In this context, it is important to look at effects that are potentially induced by nonresponse. In the case of a registry-based sample design (e.g., PIAAC Germany; Zabal et al. 2014), sample units—in this case, individuals—are selected from a population register. These registers might be affected to some extent by incomplete or out-of-date information. If, for example, migrants were selected into the gross sample on the basis of the current information available in the population register, but they have since moved abroad without <b>de-registering</b> with their local registration office (Martin et al. 2015; Salentin 2014), it would not have been possible to contact them and they would have become nonrespondents. If migrants with low literacy skills happened to be more likely to have moved abroad than those with high literacy levels—for example, because, being low-skilled, they had fewer job opportunities—this could lead to an overestimation of the literacy level in the resident migrant subpopulation.|$|E
