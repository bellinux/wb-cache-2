40|$|ABSTRACT Local {{anesthetic}} solutions {{were applied}} suddenly {{to the outside}} of single myelinated nerve fibers to measure the time course of development of block of sodium channels. Sodium currents were measured under voltage clamp with test pulses applied several times per second during the solution change. The rate of block was studied by using drugs of different lipid solubility and of different charge type, and the external pH was varied from pH 8. 3 to pH 6 to change the degree of ionization of the amine compounds. At pH 8. 3 the half-time of action of amine anesthetics such as lidocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and others was always less than 2 s and usually less than 1 s. Lowering the pH to 6. 0 decreased the apparent potency and slowed the <b>rate</b> of <b>action</b> of these drugs. The <b>rate</b> of <b>action</b> of neutral benzocaine was fast (1 s) and pH <b>independent.</b> The <b>rate</b> of <b>action</b> of cationic quaternary QX- 572 was slow (> 200 s) and also pH independent. Other quaternary anesthetic derivatives showed no action when applied outside. The result is that neutral drug forms act much more rapidly than charged ones, suggesting that externally applied local anesthetics must cross a hydrophobic barrier to reach their receptor. A model representing diffusion of drug into the nerve fiber gives reasonable time courses of action and reasonable membrane permeability coefficients {{on the assumption that the}} hydrophobic barrier is the nodal membrane. Arguments are given that there may be a need for reinterpretation of many published experiments on the location of the anesthetic receptor and on which charge form of the drug is active to take into account the effects of unstirred layers, high membrane permeability, and high lipid solubility...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the bi-directional relationship between sovereign credit ratings and financial market volatility. Prior literature focuses on {{one aspect of}} the relationship which is the impact of credit <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> on financial assets’ returns, whereas the links between <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> and market volatility have attracted little attention. Based on a comprehensive dataset of rating events from the three largest credit rating agencies (CRAs) i. e. S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch, this thesis presents unique evidence of (i) inter-relationships between sovereign rating information and equity market volatility dynamics; (ii) heterogeneous effects of sovereign <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> on equity and foreign exchange market volatilities; (iii) volatility spill-over effects of <b>rating</b> <b>actions.</b> Several methodologies are employed in order to confirm the robustness of the findings, including event study, multivariate regressions, non-parametric tests, Vector Autoregressive models, probit analyses, and Monte Carlo experiments. The findings reveal that certain types of rating news play an important “confirmation role” whereby <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> can reduce market ex-post volatility and ex-ante uncertainty. Also, there is evidence of differences in rating policies and timeliness across CRAs which provides some explanation for the heterogeneous effects of <b>rating</b> <b>actions.</b> <b>Rating</b> news which incorporates new information, either negative or positive, is associated with elevated ex-ante market uncertainty and ex-post volatility, while additional rating news which is not new to the public can lead to reduced market uncertainty and volatility. The contribution of this thesis is threefold. First, the findings contribute significantly to the debate on the information content of rating news and highlight the importance of multiple ratings in coordinating investors’ heterogeneous beliefs. Second, the thesis provides valuable insights for the debate on the role and regulation of CRAs since the global financial crisis. Third, the findings offer practical implications for option traders, international investors, financial institutions, and portfolio managers...|$|R

40|$|I {{study the}} {{association}} between revisions in analysts’ consensus earnings forecasts and credit <b>rating</b> <b>actions.</b> Controlling for other information in the market, downwardly (upwardly) revised analyst consensus {{is associated with a}} higher likelihood of credit rating downgrades (upgrades) relative to rating affirmations; this association robustly exists in firms whose ex ante credit ratings are investment-grade. <b>Rating</b> <b>actions</b> are at best weakly associated, economically and statistically, with subsequent revisions in analyst consensus.

We find that sovereign rating upgrades (downgrades) have strong effects on bank rating upgrades (downgrades). The impact of sovereign watch status on bank <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> is much weaker and often insignificant.

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{reaction}} of common stock returns to rating changes: {{it is the first}} empirical evidence for the Italian case. The analysis focuses on a sample of 299 <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> announced by Fitch, Moody’s and Standard&Poor’s with respect to Italian firms in the period January 1991 –August 2003. Rating changes announcement are classified according to the their direction (i. e. upgrades versus downgrades), their anticipation (i. e. <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> following additions to a credit watch list), the presence of concurrent news, the reason of the <b>rating</b> <b>action,</b> the sector of the issuer. Additions to credit watch lists were also examined as separate events. The results showed significant average excess returns in the event window only for additions to the negative credit watch list and for actual downgrades. Additions to positive credit watch list and upgrades show statistically significant and positive abnormal returns after the event window. These evidence is consistent with the results found by the previous literature. Expected <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> exhibit a greater impact on market prices than unexpected ones: such result may in part be {{explained by the fact that}} most of the expected <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> are also anticipated by a concurrent disclosure. Contaminated events are in fact associated with a higher stock price reaction; this is also true for the sample of downgrades following mergers and acquisitions, which almost overlap with the contaminated sample. Finally, the impact of rating changes seems to be different depending on the sector of the issuer only for downgrades: the results show that negative abnormal returns are lower for financial than for industrial firms. Overall, the abnormal returns, if any, seem to be driven mainly by concurrent disclosure concerning the reason underlying the <b>rating</b> <b>action.</b> The striking result is, however, the absence of pre-announcement abnormal returns even for the contaminated subsample: this might be indirect evidence that rating agencies react promptly when to the news which is already in the public domain. On policy grounds, the evidence lends support to those advocating that ratings cannot be usefully employed as an instrument for investor protection. ...|$|R

We find that Fitch, the rating agency among the "Big Three" with significantly stronger ties to Europe compared to its two more US-tied peers, assigned on average more favourable ratings to Eurozone issuers during the crisis. However, Fitch's better ratings for Eurozone issuers seem to be neglected by investors as they rather follow the <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> of Moody's and S&P.

40|$|DO CREDIT RATING ANNOUNCEMENTS MATTER? OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY This {{study has}} two main objectives: First, {{it aims to}} find out how much impact {{different}} types of credit rating announcements have on the credit default swap (CDS) market. Second, the study searches for evidence of possible herding behaviour between the major credit rating agencies. DATA AND METHODOLOGY Credit rating data comprises of the investment grade level credit <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> issued by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch for U. S. companies included in S&P 500 index {{at the end of the}} observation period from January 1, 2000 to June 4, 2009. CDS data consist of 334, 190 spread observations for five-year contracts linked to companies subject to credit <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> in the credit rating data set. CDS market reactions to credit rating announcements are studied by analysing adjusted spread changes during [- 90, 90] day window around the credit rating announcements. Herding behaviour is studied by comparing quantities of rating announcements that closely follow <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> by other agency to same direction credit quality wise across multiple time windows. RESULTS I find that during the whole observation period the CDS market seems to generally anticipate and react to negative rating announcements, whereas positive rating announcements are found in general less significant. Most significant CDS market response is related to negative view watchlist announcement. Moreover, I find CDS market reactions around rating announcements by S&P and Moody’s stronger than Fitch’s during the whole observation period. However, burst of the credit crisis has increased the significance of Fitch’s and Moody’s rating announcements simultaneously weakening the impact of S&P’s announcements. Considering the market impact, I find that among negative rating announcements, it matters more whether a downgrade is preceded by corresponding watchlist announcement than how many notches the credit rating actually moves. My herding study results show that among major rating agencies only every fifth <b>rating</b> <b>action</b> occur within [- 60, 60] day window around <b>rating</b> <b>action</b> by other agency to same direction credit quality wise, when simultaneously rating a same company. Furthermore, my study finds no specific evidence of herding behaviour between S&P and Moody’s. However, there remains a slight possibility that Fitch would be influenced by S&P’s <b>rating</b> <b>actions.</b> Herding results concerning specifically agency pair Moody’s and Fitch are mixed due to small sample size. In general, I find that herding is an uncommon practice among the major credit rating agencies. KEYWORDS Rating agency, rating announcement, credit default swap market, herding behaviou...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of credit rating {{announcements}} on daily stock returns for Norwegian equities listed on Oslo Stock Exchange. The empirical study is conducted using an event study, defining an event as a <b>rating</b> <b>action</b> {{from one of the}} credit rating agencies (CRA’s) Standard & Poor (S&P) and Moody’s. Besides core rating changes the paper also investigates several categories of other <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> and subsamples of <b>rating</b> <b>actions</b> with certain features. Rating news reflects the CRA’s review of the company and its ability to service its debt. It is a signal to the market about the expected future performance of the company. However as a credit rating in focusing on the liability side, a credit rating can also signal the CRA’s opinion about how management is prioritising a company’s claimants. If the market is concerned about the CRA’s assessment and views it as an analysis of performance, we expect to find negative (positive) abnormal stock returns around negative (positive) rating announcements. If the CRA’s actions are viewed as signals about altered prioritising of claimants, the opposite logic could to some degree apply. We initially assume that negative (positive) credit actions are interpreted as negative (positive) for both equity and debt holders by the market. We therefore anticipate negative abnormal equity returns for negative news and vice versa for positive news. Significant negative abnormal stock returns for negative <b>rating</b> <b>actions,</b> especially downgrades, are in line with most previous studies on the subject. On the different positive rating news, prior research is less conclusive. The analysis does not show any significant abnormal return in the case of downgrades. However, our results display a significant negative abnormal return when aggregating all negative rating announcements, i. e. including outlook and watchlist placements. Investigating this further we find that the most severe <b>rating</b> <b>action</b> is a negative watchlist placement which shows large and significant negative abnormal returns. In addition, the negative effect is larger for small firms, unexpected rating news is more severe and a rating change between investment and speculative grade is more dramatic for the issuer’s stock price. Our analysis also shows that the significance of negative rating announcements in the Norwegian market seems to have increased after the credit crisis in 2008...|$|R
