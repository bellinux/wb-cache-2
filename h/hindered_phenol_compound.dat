A {{series of}} thin, {{low-cost}} and environment-friendly organic hybrid composites consisting of reclaimed rubber(R-Rubber) {{which is a}} waste product of roller processing of textile mill filled with organic <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> <b>compound</b> 2, 2 ’-methylenebis (6 -tert-butyl- 4 -methyl-phenol) (AO 2246) were fabricated. In this study the damping property of the R-Rubber composites were tested in the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The study concluded that R-Rubber/AO 2246 composites exhibited an exceptional damping performance with a broad temperature range. Meanwhile, by addition of AO 2246, the tan δ peak maximum (tan δ max) of R-Rubber/AO 2246 composite was remarkably increased up to 1. 5. Furthermore, with increasing the AO 2246 content, storage modulus (E') and loss modulus (E") increases up to R-Rubber/AO 2246 (100 / 80) and then becomes smaller. There is critical value on E ’ and E " increasing which {{is caused by the}} excessive crystallization. The Interaction of AO 2246 crystallizing, hybridized state and Molecular hydrogen bond led not only to control Tan δ max of R-Rubber, but also to regulate glass transition temperature and improve the storage modulus, which make R-Rubber have potential applications in fields of engineering...|$|E
30|$|The color {{formation}} in neat and stabilized samples after γ-serialization is also represented {{in terms of}} delta yellowness index (d YI) in Figs.  1 and 2. The effect addition of oligomeric HAS, tert-HAS and organo-phosphite to <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> {{can be seen in}} Fig.  2 where yellowness index reduced. It can be seen that the combination of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> with other stabilizers highly prevent the discoloration. For example, the combination of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> with oligomeric HAS, tert-HAS and organo-phosphite (i.e. CTXS) drastically reduces the yellowness index from 3.1 to 0.5. It can be seen that the addition of organo-phosphite (S) to (CX) reduced the YI values from 1.9 to 1.1, while addition of tert-HAS (T) to (CX) did not reduce the yellowness index. The significant reduction in yellowing after addition organo-phosphite (S) to CX and CTX {{can be attributed to the}} fact that organo-phosphite decomposes the hydroperoxides to reduce further oxidation and their reaction with oxidized products of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol,</b> i.e. highly colored quinonoids which are transformed into colorless benzenoid forms [20, 21, 22, 34]. In contrast to tensile property, where the combination of oligomeric HAS stabilizer ‘C’ and <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> ‘X’ (i.e. CX) exhibited the antagonistic effect, the incorporation of oligomeric HAS stabilizer into <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> ‘X’ significantly diminished the YI from 3.1 to 1.8. As explained [20, 21, 22], the reduction in YI after combination oligomeric HAS with <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> may be due to the radical scavenging effect of oligomeric HAS stabilizer. The efficiency of phenolic stabilizer systems for protection against yellowing is as follows: CTXS > CXS > CX > CTX > X. This trend is similar to that observed for iPP and EP, but the magnitude of discoloration was lower in all samples of LDPE than that of iPP and EP due to the high durability of LDPE against γ-radiation. The results clearly indicate that the combination of <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> with different stabilizers highly prevent discoloration. This could be explained by the presence of various stabilizers which prevent the polymer degradation via different protection mechanisms at different stages synergistically.|$|R

It was found that nanocomposites based on both polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene-grafted-maleic anhydride (PEgMA) containing the (AO) OM-Mt gave a higher oxidative stability, along with better clay dispersion, compared to analogous PE or PEgMA-based nanocomposites containing an added (free) conventional antioxidant with a similar <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> function (using the commercial <b>hindered</b> <b>phenol</b> Irganox® 1076).

The decrease and removal of <b>phenol</b> <b>compounds</b> {{may be due}} to their oxidation and their possible further transformations (Belaid et al. 2002). In fact, the complete oxidation of organic compounds to CO 2 and H 2 O results from the split of the various aromatic compounds during the aerobic catabolism permitting their use in the cycle of the Krebs (Anderson and Dagley 1980). Regardless, a higher concentration rate of 39.193 of syringic acid compounds in DOMW was detected in this study.

The effect of the different antioxidants, when used separately and in combination, was investigated by characterising the changes in the polymer's rheological behaviour, colour formation and structural changes based on unsaturated groups and carbonyl content during five multi-pass extrusions. The results showed that all stabilisation systems examined offered higher efficiency in the metallocene polymers compared to the Zeigler. The effect of the extent of SCB in the metallocene polymers on the stabilising efficacy of the antioxidant systems was also examined, and it was shown that it had a significant effect, with both single and combinations of antioxidants giving higher efficiency in the m-LLDPE polymer containing higher extent of SCB. The presence of the lactone HP 136 in mixtures containing hindered phenol–phosphite antioxidant systems gave a higher melt stabilisation efficiency than in its absence and this has been attributed to a co-operative antioxidant reaction steps that take place between the antioxidants resulting in the possible regeneration of the lactone antioxidant through a redox reaction.

Assessment of the extent of in-situ grafting of the antioxidants, their retention after exhaustive solvent extraction in PE and PEXa, and the stabilising performance of the grafted antioxidants (g-AO) in the polymer were examined and benchmarked against conventionally stabilised crosslinked & non-crosslinked polyethylene. It was shown that the functional antioxidants graft to a high extent in PEXa, and that the level of interference of the g-AOs with the polymer crosslinking process was minimal compared to that of conventional antioxidants which bear the same antioxidant function.

30|$|Studies on the {{adsorption}} process of <b>phenol</b> and derivative <b>compounds</b> onto activated carbons {{have been carried}} out for some time and in fact still continue showing that the process presents some complexities. In this respect, the goal of achieving an optimum design for an {{adsorption process}} is an ambitious task for which a thoughtful knowledge of batch kinetics is necessary. Previous pieces of research on the kinetic analyses of batch adsorption processes have suggested the need of performing kinetic studies in which the adsorbent shape is considered, due to the major role that this feature can play during the process [8]. Although non-dimensional models (0 D) are widely used to study the adsorption kinetics of <b>phenol</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{it should be noted that}} their resulting information is quite limited because geometry plays an important role in the mass transfer process between liquid and solid phases. The novelty of the article is the analysis of the effect of particle geometry on adsorption rate of <b>phenol</b> <b>compounds.</b> As far as we know, there are no previous studies of this effect reported in the literature.|$|R
