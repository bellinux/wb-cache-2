This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career.

This caused the other men to profit more than Riley from his own work.|$|E
