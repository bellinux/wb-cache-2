5|$|Astronomical {{models of}} the Universe were {{proposed}} soon after astronomy began with the Babylonian astronomers, who viewed the Universe as a flat disk <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 10 U.S. {{aircraft}} {{were shot down}} by anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine. In total, the U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft machine-gunned Japanese survivors <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> the water. Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the Japanese destroyers {{during the time that}} the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the British {{botanist}} Robert Brown {{observed that}} dust particles inside pollen grains <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> water constantly jiggled about {{for no apparent}} reason. In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that this Brownian motion {{was caused by the}} water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E

5|$|The Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) was a joint NASA/ESA {{proposal}} for exploration of Saturn's moons. It envisions a hot-air balloon <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> Titan's atmosphere for six months. It was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) {{proposal for}} funding.

She soon finds two other patients, Stephen Murdoch (Stan Shaw), and Mr. Barreiro (Del Zamora). They assume that they are dead. Reyes, however, maintains that they are still alive.|$|E

5|$|Final reports {{indicate}} that the official death toll, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people. The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> still-flooded sections, especially in {{the east of the}} city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.|$|E
5|$|Halo: First Strike, the 2003 {{novel by}} Eric Nylund, follows the Master Chief {{after the events}} of Halo: Combat Evolved and bridges the events of Halo and Halo 2. <b>Floating</b> <b>in</b> Halo's debris field, Cortana and the Chief {{discover}} that there are in fact other human survivors. The Master Chief and these soldiers capture the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice, and return to Reach to save any UNSC survivors on the planet. At Reach, the Master Chief discovers that the Covenant had not destroyed the planet's biosphere in the usual manner, and that a few other Spartans survive. The Chief retrieves Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, the creative genius behind the SPARTAN-II Project, and his fellow soldiers. The Spartans then attack a massive Covenant command station, the Unyielding Hierophant, thus delaying a Covenant assault on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932â€“1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E

The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land.

5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E

5|$|On 4 March 1943, {{during the}} Battle of the Bismarck Sea, General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and {{aircraft}} to attack Japanese rescue vessels, {{as well as}} the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or <b>floating</b> <b>in</b> the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service. These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.|$|E
