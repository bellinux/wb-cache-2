5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between the late <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> {{the early nineteenth}} centuries. It {{was part of the}} wider European Romantic movement, which was partly a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, emphasising individual, national and emotional responses, moving beyond Renaissance and Classicist models, particularly to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The southernmost {{section of}} the road {{was known as the}} White Plains Post Road in the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries, a major highway {{connecting}} New York City to White Plains, the Westchester county seat. Route22 in its modern form was established in 1930 as one of the principal routes from New York City to Canada.|$|E

5|$|Aim for the Ace! {{was written}} and {{illustrated}} by Sumika Yamamoto; its first chapter was published by Shueisha in the Japanese magazine Margaret in January 1973. Its serialization finished in 1975, but because of demand from readers its publication restarted from 1978 to February 1980. Its first tankōbon (collected volume) was released by Shueisha on September 20, 1973, and the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> the last one was released on June 30, 1980. Shueisha reprinted the series from December 31, 1978, to August 25, 1981.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the late}} <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> early nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices of the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E

5|$|Beyond Julian Park, it {{has been}} conjectured that the {{structure}} originally continued to the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of Sleights, based on reports from antiquarians in the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries that fragments were visible at numerous points along this course. Hayes and Rutter appear confident of the structure's extent as far as Lease Rigg, but admit that its extent is conjectural from well short of that point, from Dowson Garth Quarry northwards.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries, {{almost all of the}} original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of disturbed behaviour {{in people with}} jaundice may have been described in antiquity by Hippocrates of Cos (ca. 460–370BCE). Celsus and Galen (first and third century respectively) both recognised the condition. Many modern descriptions {{of the link between}} liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms were made in the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth century; for instance, Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) reported in 1761 that it was a progressive condition.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries, {{the mound}} of Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} {{a revival of the}} castle in the late <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and {{existing}} buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} {{has been the}} subject of folklore in the surrounding area for several hundred years and possibly more than a millennium. Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians who visited the site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, attributing its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|While {{he worked}} {{extensively}} {{in the tradition of}} earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica. Largely forgotten during the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.|$|E
5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>and</b> early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E
