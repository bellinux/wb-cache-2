30|$|Plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open patch {{produced}} significantly larger floral displays {{than those}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forested</b> patch <b>in</b> both populations. Floral display size {{had a positive}} effect on pollinator visitation rate per flower in one population, but no effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other. Plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open patch received approximately 8 – 11 times more visitation rates and produced significantly more fruit and seeds per flower than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forested</b> patch. However, supplemental pollination resulted in significantly more fruit and seed production per flower compared to natural pollination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forested</b> patch but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open patch <b>in</b> one population, and did not enhance fruit and seed production <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> <b>forested</b> or <b>the</b> open patch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other. <b>In</b> both populations, supplementally pollinated plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open patch produced significantly more fruit and seeds per flower than supplementally pollinated plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forested</b> patch.|$|R

5|$|Bhagavata Purana further {{states that}} Prithu {{performed}} ninety-nine ashwamedha yagnas (horse-sacrifices), but Indra, kings of the demi-gods, disturbed Prithu's hundredth one. The yagya was abandoned, Vishnu gave Prithu his blessings and Prithu forgave Indra for the latter's theft of the ritual-horse. It also {{states that the}} Four Kumaras, the four sage-incarnations of Vishnu, preached Prithu about devotion to Vishnu. After governing his kingdom for a long time, Prithu left with his wife Archi, to perform penance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> in his last days. He experienced Samadhi and voluntarily gave up his body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> and Archi went Sati on his funeral pyre.|$|E

Tomiko leads three others to his camp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E

5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators that live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E
