5|$|A {{narrative}} pattern follows, whereby Cet {{demands a}} challenge, an Ulster warrior rises, and the Ulaid cry out {{the name of}} the challenger; Cet then proceeds to shame that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him, as above. Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting how he put out his eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taken his son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> pierced his neck with a spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat. In each case, the challenging warriors are compelled to retake their seats in shame.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E

He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952.

5|$|Darius {{was the son}} of Hystaspes and the {{grandson}} of Arsames. Both men belonged to the Achaemenid tribe and were still alive when Darius ascended the throne. Darius justifies his ascension to the throne with his lineage. He claimed he could trace his ancestors back to Achaemenes, even though he was only distantly related. With this in mind, Darius married Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> four sons: Xerxes, Achaemenes, Masistes and Hystaspes. He also married Artystone, another daughter of Cyrus, with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> two sons, Arsames and Gobryas.

It is unknown if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> any children with her. Before these royal marriages, Darius had married an unknown daughter of his good friend and lance carrier Gobryas from an early marriage, with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> three sons, Artobazanes, Ariabignes and Arsamenes. Any daughters <b>he</b> <b>had</b> with her are not known. Although Artobazanes was Darius's first-born, Xerxes became heir and the next king through the influence of Atossa; she had great authority in the kingdom as Darius loved her the most of all his wives.|$|E
