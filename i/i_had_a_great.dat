500|$|Real Madrid {{eventually}} secured Robben's {{services in}} August 2007. He told Chelsea's official club website, [...] "It {{was difficult to}} leave because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> time in my three years at Chelsea and I {{made a lot of}} friends. There was no time to say goodbye because the deal was closed on the Wednesday at 10 o'clock in the evening and the following morning I had to fly.|$|E
500|$|Smith's {{first film}} role came in Heaven Help Us (1985). She then played Putter in The Legend of Billie Jean (also 1985). The film was a box office bomb and {{critically}} panned, although Smith [...] "thought {{it would be}} the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died." [...] When filming was over, she rejoined The Real Thing before being out of work for six months. Smith worried her career was over. However, the following year, she played Connie in Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive (1986), noting it was [...] "truly a dreadful film, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> part in it." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{they would}} do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and {{alterations}} after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, [...] "I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain {{at the end of}} Act II." [...] The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.|$|E

In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. All I have to do is party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and we had so much fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and you have more fun." ...|$|E

In December 2009, prior to the confirmation of his first guest appearance, Entertainment Weekly informed Damon that he {{was at the top of}} Fey's guest star wish list for the show. A fan of the series, Damon replied [...] "I would do [...] in a heartbeat if they asked me to come on. She should call my people—or even better me. Or I could call her. Let's make this happen." [...] A day after the airing of [...] "I Do Do" [...] he was asked if he would reprise his role as Carol in the upcoming season and responded [...] "If they'll have me, I would love to pop in and see the gang again. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> time doing it." [...] In August 2010, Fey confirmed Damon's return saying that he would play her boyfriend once the new season began.|$|E

500|$|Cannon first {{played for}} the LSU varsity {{football}} team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team's primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon's college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech's focus was solely on Taylor. [...] "They were just wearing Jimmy out", he said. [...] "Of course, they weren't looking for me. They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> game." [...] Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:"We kicked off. And that damn Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down there, {{and we were going}} to hit him high and low. We were going to knock the hell out of him... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don't forget that." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Game Informers Matt Helgeson {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a very playable and {{addictive}} open-world game that manages {{to put its}} own fresh spin on the familiar genre." [...] He was critical of the side-missions, calling them [...] "very repetitive," [...] but he concluded [...] "Overall, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> time with Scarface. It's every bit as profane, violent, and over-the-top as the movie, and delivers not only the gunplay you're expecting, but as much depth as almost any other game in the genre." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Perry won the Hart Memorial Trophy, {{prevailing}} over finalists Daniel Sedin and Martin St. Louis, as the League's {{regular season}} MVP. [...] "You don't know what to expect when you come to this thing," [...] Perry said by phone. [...] "You don't want to expect to win. But then you hear your name. I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> chance, but you look at the other two guys and they had great chances as well."

2500|$|His {{former coach}} Dan Reeves said about Gradishar, [...] "He {{was as good}} a linebacker as I have ever been around, and I have been around some great ones. He was a leader without {{question}} of our defense while I was with Denver. He was an exceptional football player. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of respect for him when I was at Dallas before I ever went to Denver. After I arrived in Denver and saw {{what kind of a}} leader he was my respect for him grew. He never missed a game and was a dominant force on the field. The opposing team always had to take him into account when they devised their game plans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{there was}} a kind, gentle, and humble side to Frazier that spectators were able to witness late that night as CBS' {{reporter}} Michele Tafoya handed him the microphone during the postgame celebration following the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. [...] "Oh listen, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> career at Nebraska," [...] Frazier said as this gave the South Floridian the opportunity to open up with gratitude, giving back to the Cornhusker fan base. [...] "There is {{no better way to}} end it; I want to thank all the fans for all the support, and I want to thank all my teammates—most of all important, I want to thank the Lord Jesus Christ above, because without him, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish anything I have." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I was a junkball pitcher, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> knuckleball", Lee confessed. In {{her debut}} season, she {{combined}} with Wiltze (20-16, 1.88 ERA) for 31 of the 45 victories of the helpless Millerettes. The team received {{some pretty good}} performances from Helen Callaghan, who hit [...]287 (2nd in the league) and Faye Dancer (.274, 44 extrabases), who became the first girl to hit two home runs in a single game and two grand slams in a regular season. Playing their home games at Nicollet Park, the Millerettes could not compete with the local Minneapolis Millers. In addition, Minneapolis {{was far from the}} other five cities in the league, forcing the team to spend most of the season on the road. As a result, the team was replaced by the Fort Wayne Daisies in the 1945 season.|$|E
2500|$|When the sprint race had finished, Palmer stated on the podium, [...] "Yesterday {{was first}} to sixth in one lap {{and now it is}} sixth to first so it {{definitely}} made up for it and I am absolutely delighted. We had done a lot of homework on the start and the tyre degradation and I think we nailed them both. He described the race as [...] "tough" [...] and drove more conseratively with the knowledge he acculated from the previous [...] day's race and also made set-up and balance changes. Trummer said it felt [...] "really good" [...] to finish in second place and knew beforehand that he would achieve a good result in the sprint race. He stated he did not defend excessively against Palmer on the second lap because of his fast pace and was aware he had to conserve tyre life, [...] "But I was a bit wrong because he kept this strong pace all race long. Even {{at the end of the}} race I thought he would struggle more but he didn’t. It was really hard to attack him. That was a great race. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> pace and I’m happy with P2." [...] Third-place finisher Leal spoke of an [...] "unbelievable" [...] start of the season for himself and his team but focused their attention to the next race of the season.
