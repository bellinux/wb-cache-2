50|$|Tamayo is a {{city and}} a {{municipality}} in the Baoruco province of the Dominican Republic. Tamayo is the driest location in the Dominican Republic and the only-one with a <b>desertic</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from these}} main types, other sub-types can be found, like the <b>desertic</b> <b>climate</b> {{in parts of}} southeastern Spain, like in coastal Almería. Humid continental, alpine and tundra climates in the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada, and a typical {{subtropical}} climate in the Canary Islands, varying from humid subtropical climates to desertic climates {{in most of the}} islands, and a tropical hot semi-arid climate in coastal parts, such as Tenerife or Gran Canaria.|$|E
50|$|The Sous River or Souss River (Shilha Berber asif n Sus, Classical Arabic وادى سوس wādī Sūs) is a {{river in}} mid-southern Morocco {{located in the}} Sous region. It {{originates}} in the High Atlas and flows west passing Aoulouz, Taroudannt, Oulad Teima, Inezgane and Aït Melloul. It forms a basin which is protected from the <b>desertic</b> <b>climate</b> of the Sahara by the Anti-Atlas mountains {{and is one of}} Morocco's most fertile regions.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} optical {{properties}} (in optic and petrographic microscopy) of mineral particles (diameter> 1 µm) deposited {{on the surface}} of a small (≈ 1. 4 mm height, 610 µm wide) sticky tape triangle corresponding to the Face area of the Turin Shroud (TS). All these particles were studied by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and their elemental compositions were analysed by X-ray microfluorescence (XRMF). These mineral particles were classified among nine main categories: particles of the limestone fraction, alumine, particles of the silica fraction, clay minerals (including kaolinite, montmorillonite and illites), chlorites, talcum and evaporites. The most important fraction (one for two) of the mineral particles found is clay minerals. Some of them (montmorillonite/illites mixtures) are highly characteristic: they are constituted of potassium-rich clays, with a high calcium content and they contain iron and titanium inclusions. Most of the silica particles found are shaped in an eolian fashion. The presence of gypse and ferric oxide indicates a soil nature corresponding to <b>desertic</b> or semi-desertic <b>climates.</b> Some minerals, rounded in shape, can mimic-by aspect and color-true red blood cells...|$|R
50|$|The Southwest Monsoon {{and coastal}} fog both occur at Jiddat al-Harasis; {{the average annual}} {{rainfall}} in the southeastern region is approximately 50 mm. Rainfall, which is low, occurs during the monsoon season from June to October. Due to foggy conditions, humidity is noted to rise in the area. The <b>desertic</b> <b>climate</b> has summer (May to October) temperatures above 30 C with July recording a high mean temperature of 34 C. During winter months the temperatures drops to 15 C. Fog moisture and dew cause rain during the nights, particularly during the months of October to April. This precipitation sustains vegetation and wildlife in the area, despite very low rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
40|$|In Southern High Katanga, the {{ferruginous}} formations such as iron duricrusts {{and stone}} lines with lateritic nodules show a diversity as broad as in Western Africa. Bauxites are nevertheless almost absent proving that, here, aluminium does {{not contribute to}} the genesis of duricrust, leaving iron as the only responsible. Among that wide diversity, the indurated sands form a special case because of their dual origin. Because of a large porosity favouring a fast iron penetration and fixation, some of the sandy concretions or duricrusts may have a short history and some of them may even be very recent. Nevertheless the others have a genesis that fits in with the general longer scheme. The most frequent type of laterite crust is also the most complex one. Its facies is both nodular and vermicular. Several agents and climatic phases are involved in its formation : • A first planation surface with wide-open valleys where the water table lies near the surface induces favourable circumstances for the next step; • In such circumstances, nodules are shaped in the mottled soil horizon. One exceptionally well-preserved site evidences the proximity between mottles (the nodules to be) and water table level {{at the end of the}} dry season; • A revival of erosion enhances river down cutting which in turn lowers the water table so that termites can reach the mottled horizon; • Nodules are mechanically concentrated by elimination of the non-indurated zones (relative accumulation) : within the soil, by termites (on shaly rocks), at the surface by run off (often, on sandy rocks, unfavourable to termites activity); X • Finally the ran off extends to both types of rock and denudes the indurated zone; • A ferruginous coating forms on different substrates : upper laterite surface, internal joints, termite galleries as well as on any gravel at the soil surface. The coating lies unbroken from one object to the other but the outer surface is frequently eroded. The superficial coating could be a rock varnish formed by bacteria during a desertic period. The coating of galleries partly inhibits bioturbation because they collapse no more. The network of the strengthened galleries constitutes an internal skeleton reinforcing the laterite mantle; • With the return of a less severe climate, termites from below the laterite mantle again bring up material. The resulting upper fine deposit often exceeds 2 meter. All those processes imply important climatic variations : • A steppe vegetation with a scanty grass cover favouring run off and planation; • A relatively arid climate for the coatings formation; • A contrasted seasonal regime, not so different from the present day climate (six months dry season) for vertical erosion and intense termite activity. The weathering of rocky materials except for the iron impregnated ones (nodules, ferricretes and so on) requires a humid climate. This is happening nowadays but the more humid Quaternary phases were more effective in that respect. The characteristics of the outer coatings (thickness, colour, conservation state of the included quartz grains) allow us to identify four levels of ferricrete. Their succession is confirmed by the relative position of the coatings between them and by the correlated continental deposits. Because of their coatings, all those ferricretes are dated back to the Tertiary (because of the <b>desertic</b> <b>climate</b> needed for the formation of the rock varnish). Their levels overlook the Quaternary river terraces. The oldest ferricrete is quite different from the others. It shows neither nodules nor termite galleries. Its facies is thus very different from the nodular/vermiform of the three younger ones. It shows three facies, sometimes superimposed : pisolithic, massive or breccia-like. Moreover, the ferricrete of the corresponding level in West Africa contains bauxite. Its genesis is the result of a very different sequence of processes, some aggressive and linked to a humid climate with a great supply of iron and others resulting from more arid conditions producing the thick pisolith coatings. Ferruginous stone-lines present a wider variety of concretions than duricrast. Their upper part is the result of a concentration mainly by run off that occurred during several periods of the Quaternary. Cover loam is each time built up again by the termites from weathered rocks below the stone-line. The same phenomenon is seen on ferricretes. The soil profile where ferruginous formations can be seen consists of horizons of different ages. Weathering of saprolite and soil lifting are still active nowadays. Whereas some stone-line profiles are renewed at each Quaternary dry phase, the ferricrete profiles are build up during a long period of time extending from the Tertiary till now. A new definition of iron duricrast is proposed that is not based on weathering in depth or on the presence of aluminiu...|$|E
