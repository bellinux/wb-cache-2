40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Knee</b> <b>injuries</b> are {{frequent}} in children, with most studies reporting traumatic <b>knee</b> <b>injuries.</b> Evidence {{of risk factors}} for <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> in children is sparse. The {{purpose of this study}} was to report the extent of traumatic and overuse <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> in children and to evaluate intrinsic and extrinsic factors for risk of these injuries. METHODS: Weekly musculoskeletal pain, sport participation and sports type were reported by 1326 school children (8 - 15 years). <b>Knee</b> <b>injuries</b> were classified as traumatic or overuse. Multinomial logistic regression was used for analyses. RESULTS: During the study period, 952 (15...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{different}} <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> can happen. Three {{percent of}} <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> are acute traumatic patellar dislocations. Because dislocations make the knee unstable, 15% of patellas will re-dislocate.|$|R
5000|$|Isolated and {{combined}} posterolateral <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> {{are difficult to}} accurately diagnose in patients presenting with acute <b>knee</b> <b>injuries.</b> The incidence of isolated posterolateral corner injuries {{has been reported to}} be between 13% and 28%. Most PLC injuries accompany an ACL or PCL tear, and can contribute to ACL or PCL reconstruction graft failure if not recognized and treated. [...] A study by LaPrade et al. in 2007 showed the incidence of posterolateral <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> in patients presenting with acute <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> and hemarthrosis (blood in the knee joint) was 9.1%.|$|R

5|$|He {{remained}} with United until July 1989, {{when he was}} sold to Everton for £600,000. However, he retired from playing two years later, aged only 26, due to a <b>knee</b> <b>injury.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{early in}} the {{following}} season, he missed three months because of a <b>knee</b> <b>injury.</b> He returned from injury on 17 December 2011.|$|E
50|$|Injuries to {{the medial}} knee {{stabilizers}} (sMCL, dMCL, and POL) {{are the most}} common <b>knee</b> <b>injuries.</b> The incidence of these injuries in the United States is reported as 0.24 in 1000 people every year. Medial <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> are reported as being twice as prevalent in males (0.36) than in females (0.18). The injured population is most frequently young athletes participating in sports. Most medial <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> occur in isolation and can most commonly be treated without surgery.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the relationship between ankle <b>injuries</b> and future <b>knee</b> <b>injuries.</b> The subjects used for the study were all Division I athletes at Valparaiso University. The question to be answered was: Are ankle <b>injuries</b> precursors to <b>knee</b> <b>injuries?</b> Data was collected through a survey which was distributed to all athletic teams. The survey required information about previous ankle and <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> of each athlete. All surveys {{are in the process of}} coding and analysis. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and linear regression for inferential data will be used for analysis. No conclusion has yet been made about the relationship between ankle <b>injuries</b> and future <b>knee</b> <b>injuries</b> as data is under review...|$|R
