5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Islam, Afghanistan had close {{cultural}} ties with India, and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practiced. Examples of sculptures from the 5th to the 7th centuries have survived, suggesting that the worship of Ganesha was then <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> in the region.|$|E
5|$|Hume often wrote editorials, {{engaged in}} litigation, appealed to legislators, and waged {{political}} campaigns {{to protect his}} business interests. Running as a Republican, he was twice elected, in 1900 and 1902, to represent Coos and Curry counties in the Oregon House of Representatives. According to his biographer, he voted self-interest first and conservative positions second, resisting Populist ideas <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Gillan {{formed the}} Ian Gillan Band with guitarist Ray Fenwick, keyboardist Mike Moran, quickly {{replaced}} with Mickey Lee Soule and then Colin Towns on keyboards, Mark Nauseef on drums and John Gustafson on bass. Their first album, Child in Time {{was released in}} July 1976, followed by Clear Air Turbulence in April 1977 and Scarabus in October. The sound of the band had a distinct jazz-rock aspect which, although interesting to Gillan, proved unpopular, particularly since punk rock was <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> at that time.|$|E

5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then <b>in</b> <b>vogue,</b> arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E
5|$|The Carpet from Bagdad {{is a film}} {{adaptation}} of Harold MacGrath's 1911 novel of the same name. MacGrath was a well-traveled, successful author of over a dozen novels. Stories with Asian settings were <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> at the time, and both The Carpet from Bagdad and the Selig Polyscope Company's previous {{adaptation of}} MacGrath's work, the popular serial The Adventures of Kathlyn, are set in part in the Near East.|$|E
5|$|The post-Chalukya {{period is}} characterised by the {{popularity}} of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings, though secular and courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish. Native metres <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> were the shatpadi (six-line verse), the tripadi, the ragle (rhymed couplets) and the sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment a musical instrument). Overall, Kannada writings began to change from marga ("formal", due to Sanskritic influence) to desi ("vernacular") and become more accessible to the common man.|$|E

5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles <b>in</b> <b>vogue.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the opening of}} the American branch, various trade arrangements were made with other film companies, including American Mutoscope and Biograph, the Warwick Trading Company, the Charles Urban Trading Co., Robert W. Paul's studio, and Gaumont. In these negotiations, a print sale price of 0.15 per foot was standardized across the American market, which proved useful to Méliès. However, later price standardizations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès's financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. In addition, in the years following 1908 his films suffered from the fashions of the time, as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer <b>in</b> <b>vogue.</b>|$|E

During the 2013 Academy Awards, she became the first First Lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture which went to Argo).|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} {{was bought by}} the Ramada hotel chain in 1973, and was redecorated to cover the 1950s design, seen {{at the time as}} outdated. No longer <b>in</b> <b>vogue,</b> but centrally located, the hotel remained prominent for years, and hosted conferences, business meetings, and vacationers. Under Ramada management, however, the property began to show a lack of maintenance, and its popularity declined. It closed in 2001 and its demolition was considered when no purchase offers were received. Admirers of the hotel's exemplary architecture and its local history rallied to save it, and it was placed on the Scottsdale Historic Register.|$|E

5|$|By {{virtue of}} a Hindu belief that {{killing of a}} brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital {{punishment}} was not applicable to them. Upper caste kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. {{if there were no}} male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all <b>in</b> <b>vogue.</b> Memorials containing hero stones (virkal) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Rolls-Royce started {{planning}} its future aero-engine development programme and realised {{there was a}} need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296cu in) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder, as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane (serial number K3036) on 21 February 1935. The engine was originally designed to use the evaporative cooling system then <b>in</b> <b>vogue.</b> This proved unreliable and when ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid-cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, around the {{coronation}} of Edward VII, a discussion started {{on the need for}} a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags. Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were <b>in</b> <b>vogue</b> included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.|$|E
5|$|Realistic {{religious}} painting, sometimes entire {{series of}} related works, served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological themes were banned, {{but other than}} that fancy collection of Western paintings were <b>in</b> <b>vogue.</b> Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, he was {{to spend the rest of}} his life in Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and Jeremias Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars in the middle of the century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Australia, Downes was {{discharged}} from the AIF, but remained in the Army as a reservist. He became an honorary consulting surgeon at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne and Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, and honorary surgeon at Prince Henry's Hospital. He was a founding fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1927, and {{became president of the}} Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1935. He established {{a reputation as one of}} Melbourne's leading paediatric surgeons, but found himself in disagreement with certain medical practices then <b>in</b> <b>vogue.</b> In a 1922 paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia, he examined 100 cases of tonsillectomy in children, and concluded that the majority of them were unnecessary. It would be another four decades before the medical profession in Australia accepted this. He lectured on medical ethics at the University of Melbourne from the late 1930s until his death in 1945, and wrote a course textbook on the subject, entitled Medical Ethics, which was published in 1942.|$|E
