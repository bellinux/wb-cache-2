5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1189, German crusaders marched through Hungary {{under the command of}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Béla welcomed Frederick, and <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> troop to escort the crusaders across the Balkan Peninsula. At Frederick's request, Béla {{released}} his imprisoned brother, Géza, who joined the crusaders and left Hungary. Béla mediated a peace treaty between Frederick I and Isaac II, whose mutual distrust had almost caused war between the German crusaders and the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|The Senate, {{alarmed by}} the size of the revolt and the defeat of the praetorian armies of Glaber and Varinius, <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> pair of {{consular}} legions under the command of Lucius Gellius Publicola and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus. Initially, the consular armies were successful. Gellius engaged a group of about 30,000 slaves, under the command of Crixus, near Mount Garganus and killed two-thirds of the rebels, including Crixus himself.|$|E
5|$|David’s good {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} 987 when he, anxious {{to make his}} extensive possessions a hereditary Bagratid domain, joined his long-time friend Bardas Phokas in a rebellion against the emperor Basil. Once the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine-Rus' forces in 989, Basil <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> strong force under John of Chaldea to punish the Georgians, and David had to submit. Reconciled with the emperor, he was granted, in c. 990, the title of kuropalates again in return for his promise that upon his death the lands previously placed under his sovereignty would revert to the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E

5|$|In AD 13, Augustus {{appointed}} him {{commander of the}} forces in the Rhine, which totaled eight legions and was about one-third of Rome's total military force. The next year in August, Augustus died and on 17 September the Senate met to confirm Tiberius as princeps. That day the Senate also <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> delegation to Germanicus' camp to send its condolences {{for the death of}} his grandfather, and more importantly, to grant him proconsular imperium. The delegation would not arrive until October.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the other conquests, the Empire established a presence in Visigothic Hispania, when the usurper Athanagild requested assistance in his rebellion against King Agila I. In 552, Justinian <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> force of 2,000 men; according to the historian Jordanes, this army was led by the octogenarian Liberius. The Byzantines took Cartagena and other cities on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of Spania before being checked by their former ally Athanagild, who had by now become king. This campaign marked the apogee of Byzantine expansion.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Mataram's request for intervention, VOC <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> large fleet containing Indonesian and European forces, commanded by Admiral Cornelis Speelman. In April 1677 the fleet sailed to Surabaya, where Trunajaya was based. After negotiations failed, Speelman's forces stormed Surabaya {{and took it}} after hard fighting. The troops proceeded to clear the rebels from the area surrounding Surabaya. VOC forces also took Madura, Trunajaya's native island, and laid his residence there in ruin. Trunajaya fled Surabaya and established his capital in Kediri.|$|E

In addition, the New Zealand government provided $70,000 {{for assistance in}} the most affected areas, after the country's Air Force <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> plane over Vanuatu {{to determine the extent}} of damage. The Government of Australia similarly sent a helicopter reconnaissance mission to determine damage, as well as two planes with $200,000 (2004AUD) in relief supplies, including 2,400tarps, 2,600water containers, and 5,200packets of water purification tablets. The French government also sent a helicopter and assistance as per the 1992 FRANZ Agreement between New Zealand, Australia, and France.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} the new year. He <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> two-seater on 26 January and another on 2 February 1917. On 5 February he attacked a Albatros C.III returning from a photo-reconnaissance mission. Diving {{out of the sun}} to blind the gunner, he shot it down over the frontline where it was shelled by British artillery. Ten days later he engaged an Albatros escorted by a LFG Roland C.II. After a brief dogfight and pursuit, the Albatros escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy. Twenty-four hours later McCudden was awarded the Military Cross for his fifth victory. His award was gazetted on 12 March.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1868, {{parties of}} Paraguayans in canoes camouflaged by foliage and brush boarded Brazilian ironclads {{anchored}} in Tayí. The imperiled vessels <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> boat to warn Inhaúma, who was aboard the flagship Brasil downriver at Elisiário Port. By {{the time he}} arrived, the Brazilians had locked themselves inside their ships and the Paraguayans had taken control of the decks. Inhaúma ordered the Brasil and two other vessels to open fire, decimating the Paraguayans and saving the ironclads. A day later he was raised from baron to viscount by Pedro II. On 25 July, the allies occupied Humaitá after the Paraguayans had abandoned it and retreated further upriver.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} negotiator Jean Sainteny flew to Saigon {{to consult}} Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner {{in the absence}} of d'Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a diplomatic solution to a larger conflict, but he still <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his best option because the Soviet Union had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party (VNQDD), and the French Communist Party chose to support French rule in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway, Operation Weserübung, began on 9 April 1940. In {{order to prevent}} any disruption of the invasion by the British, the Kriegsmarine had previously <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> force under Vice Admiral Günther Lütjens to protect the troop convoy landing at Narvik. The German squadron consisted of the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the heavy cruiser , and 10 destroyers. With intelligence suggesting that the Germans were massing ships, the British sent out a squadron under Admiral Sir William Whitworth to deny German access to neutral Norwegian waters by laying mines in Operation Wilfred and prevent any German naval movements into the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{tensions}} heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant {{ships which}} had been licensed {{to operate in the}} disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty.|$|E

A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> liaison party to the area. He was then shot by snipers concealed in the bush. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were lost. Three Italians and an estimated 40 Eritrean ascari were killed, with approximately 70 ascari wounded.|$|E
5|$|Through March and April {{the divers}} and ships' crews worked to recover {{all manner of}} treasure: silver coins, silver bullion, doubloons, jewelry, {{a small amount of}} gold, and other artifacts. Concerned about the {{possibility}} of mutiny, Phips guaranteed to the crew, who had been hired for seaman's wages, that they would receive shares in the find, even if he had to pay them from his own percentage. He carefully avoided putting in at any ports before anchoring at Gravesend, where he <b>dispatched</b> <b>a</b> courier to London with the news.|$|E

Coupled with the treachery of Tatzates and the unreliability of the troops under his command, Irene was now forced to negotiate for their release, especially of her trusted aide Staurakios.|$|E
