5|$|In 2017 Canadian {{scientists}} recreated an extinct {{horse pox}} virus {{to demonstrate that}} the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab {{at a cost of about}} $100,000, by a team of scientists without specialist knowledge. This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> samples are destroyed. Although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of Christian sources, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> other texts are ignored, the Pauline epistles can provide some {{information}} regarding Jesus.

25|$|If {{the entries}} {{of the matrix}} A are all real numbers, then the {{coefficients}} of the characteristic polynomial will also be real numbers, but the eigenvalues may still have non-zero imaginary parts. The entries of the corresponding eigenvectors therefore may also have non-zero imaginary parts. Similarly, the eigenvalues may be irrational numbers <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> the entries of A are rational numbers or {{even if they are}} all integers. However, if the entries of A are all algebraic numbers, which include the rationals, the eigenvalues are complex algebraic numbers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} methods assesses whether the {{inference}} {{was successful in}} light of the given observed data, for example, by comparing the posterior predictive distribution of summary statistics to the summary statistics observed. Beyond that, cross-validation techniques and predictive checks represent promising future strategies to evaluate the stability and out-of-sample predictive validity of ABC inferences. This is particularly important when modeling large data sets, because then the posterior support of a particular model can appear overwhelmingly conclusive, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> proposed models in fact are poor representations of the stochastic system underlying the observation data. Out-of-sample predictive checks can reveal potential systematic biases within a model and provide clues on to how to improve its structure or parametrization.|$|E
25|$|A {{demand for}} control {{of this process is}} based on the {{principle}} of caution and effective control measures are regarded as necessary. However this faces problems that are not negligible. To separate the “pure” dingo from other domestic dogs is difficult, if it is possible at all. The costs would be enormous, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> hybrids are destroyed, there are currently no methods to tests the dingoes in the field. Furthermore, control measures usually do not discriminate between dingoes and other domestic dogs. According to the biologist David Jenkins from the Australian National University there is little {{that can be done to}} reverse the process of interbreeding. Even if selectively searching for hybrids during the killings, it would only disrupt the pack structure and therefore affect the breeding rate of the dogs.|$|E

25|$|Damage modeling, {{although}} {{limited in}} vehicles, is most noticeable {{in the ability}} to burst tires, although wheeled vehicles can still move <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> the tires are gone, slowly rolling along on the rims. Tracked vehicles such as tanks or APCs can lose their tracks as a result of damage, but may continue moving even though there is no way for the drive sprockets to propel the vehicle. Exposed gas cans on Humvees can be shot in order to detonate their contents, which usually results in the explosion of the vehicle. While burning, destroyed vehicles will cause proximity heat damage to objects and characters. Unavailable vehicles shown in-game include jet aircraft, excavator, forklift and for reasons of scale, destroyers. None of the alien machines can be commandeered by players. Interestingly, the wheeled carts which would presumably be used to move aircraft or heavy vehicles, can also be moved by the player, but movement is very slow and useful for little more than entertainment/novelty.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of counting, the Division of Elections showed Murkowski with a lead of some 1,700 votes over Miller, with about 8,000 {{write-in}} votes yet to be counted, and a trend of counting 97 percent of the write-ins as for Murkowski. Murkowski's campaign shied away from declaring a victory before the count was finished. As of November 17, (the {{last day of the}} hand count), the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes, meaning that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> the 8,000 challenged ballots were discounted, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes. The Miller campaign then demanded a hand recount of the entire election, claiming that as Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection Miller should get the same opportunity. The Division of Election officials responded that any recount of non-write-in votes would not be done by hand, but would be done using optical scanners.|$|E
25|$|Louis Caput {{approached}} Edmond Mercier, the bicycle-maker behind Poulidor's team, {{and asked}} to bring Sainz into the team management. Mercier agreed, said Sainz, because he was already treating Mercier for his own health problems. Mercier had also brought in the insurance company, GAN, as main sponsor. GAN, said Sainz, demanded that Poulidor be in the team photo <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> he did was train with the team {{at the start of}} the season. In 1971 Poulidor had decided against riding any more. The tactic, Sainz said, was bluff, to increase his motivation. In Paris–Nice, the first important stage race of the season, Poulidor was 22 seconds behind Eddy Merckx on the morning of the last day. Poulidor attacked from the start, setting a speed record on the Col de la Turbie that stood for more than 10 years and won Paris–Nice by two seconds. Next year he won Paris–Nice again and also the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré.|$|E
