He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing.|$|E

Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses.

[...] "PTS/SP tech" [...] is Scientology terminology referring to the organization's founder L.

Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band, who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio.

500|$|In 1919, {{the matter}} went to {{consideration}} in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their need on the Teschen coal, useful {{in order to}} influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles were to get {{most of the people}} and the strategic rail line. Watt writes: [...] "Czech envoy Edvard Beneš proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Beneš was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Beneš <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing. A plebiscite would take some time to set up, and a lot could happen in that time – particularly when a nation's affairs were conducted as cleverly as were Czechoslovakia's." ...|$|E

500|$|Baen was {{replaced}} by John J. Pierce, but the situation only worsened. [...] Pierce resigned within a year: the company was in increasing debt, and his office assistant recalls that the office appeared inefficiently run, though he commented that Pierce [...] "clearly loved {{what he did and}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about". [...] Pierce's replacement was Hank Stine, who took over in late 1978, though because of Galaxys irregular schedule Pierce's last issue was March–April 1979. [...] Stine managed to produce only two more issues, June–July 1979 and September–October 1979, before UPD's financial problems spelled the end. [...] Rights to the title were transferred to a new company, Galaxy Magazine, Inc., owned by Vincent McCaffrey, proprietor of Avenue Victor Hugo, a second-hand book store in Boston; UPD retained a ten percent interest in order to receive income from future sales to pay off their debts. [...] Stine had compiled two more issues, but neither ever appeared; McCaffrey, who had also launched a separate magazine, Galileo, had cash-flow problems that prevented him from distributing the magazine as he had planned. [...] One more issue did finally appear from McCaffrey, in July 1980, in a large format; it was edited by Floyd Kemske. [...] A subsequent issue, to be dated October 1980, was assembled, but never distributed.|$|E
500|$|... "Disease of the mind" [...] is not {{a medical}} term; it instead means that the {{defendant}} must show {{he was suffering from}} a disease which affected the functioning of the mind, which does not necessarily have to be a disease of the brain. This was confirmed in the case of R v Kemp [...] 1 QB 399, where the defendant's arteriosclerosis led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious. It must then be shown that this disease of the mind led to a [...] "defect of reason"; that the defendant's ability to reason was impaired by the disease. Alternately, the defendant can try to show {{that he did not know}} [...] "the nature or quality of his act or that it was wrong". The first requires proof that the defendant did not know what he was doing; that he had no awareness of what he was happening, that he was unaware of the consequences of his act or that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, but was deluded as to the circumstances; for the latter, Jonathan Herring gives the example of a man who [...] "thought he was killing a monstrous person when he was in fact killing a person". When arguing that the defendant was [...] "not knowing the act was wrong", [...] "wrong" [...] is taken to mean [...] "illegal", as set out in R v Windle [...] 2 QB 826.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Greg Ryan, Keogh was [...] "unanimously {{regarded as}} the best back in the colony" [...] and also [...] "one of the most gifted, colourful and ultimately controversial figures of early New Zealand rugby." [...] While rugby writer Terry McLean wrote of Keogh in 1987 that he was [...] "one of those rare birds of rugby, the genuine 'freak'." [...] A correspondent for Christchurch paper The Sun, lamenting a perceived decline in back play, wrote in 1917 that Keogh [...] "was probably the greatest half-back the rugby world has ever produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods. Neither opponents nor spectators <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do next. He was {{the first player to}} bounce the ball on the head of an opponent on a line-out, catch it, and streak down the field. He was an adept in kneeing the ball over the head of an opposing player; he feinted, he hurdled, he kicked; his play was never the same two minutes together." [...] While a teammate of Keoghs from the Natives, George Williams, said in 1925 that he had never seen Keogh's equal. William McKenzie, known as [...] "Off-Side Mac", who played 20 matches for New Zealand in the 1890s, said of Keogh in 1910: [...] "Keogh is {{regarded as the}} trickiest and most brilliantly attacking back ever turned out of the New Zealand school." ...|$|E

500|$|While other [...] "new magazines—and {{many of the}} old—are {{dying of}} {{literary}} cirrhosis. The cause? Poisoning due to decayed fiction", Gold stated, Galaxy was profitable within five issues; an [...] "incredible" [...] achievement, in his words. The outbreak of the Korean War led to paper shortages—Gold wrote in a 1951 editorial that [...] "buying paper these days is like being mugged on a dark street"—that forced the magazine {{to find a new}} printer, Robert M. Guinn. The new paper was of even lower quality, a disappointment to Gold. That summer, disagreements within World Editions led to attempts to disrupt Galaxys distribution. According to Gold, the circulation director {{and the head of the}} American office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them, and made sure that the ones that did get distributed went to areas of the United States, such as the South, where there was little or no audience for the magazine. [...] The head of the French office of World Editions came to the United States to find out what the problem was, and recommended that the magazine be sold to the two Americans, for $3,000—a very low price. [...] They tried to recruit Gold, but he contacted the Italian office, which rejected the sale and eventually agreed to sell Galaxy to the printer, Robert M. Guinn. It was only after the sale was complete that the sabotaged distribution came to light; World Editions wanted to buy back the magazine, but Guinn quoted a price four times as high as he had paid. [...] In Gold's words, [...] "he, Guinn, <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> buying, whereas World Editions hadn't known what they were selling".|$|E
500|$|Writer Novak {{cites the}} episode as the [...] "most conceptually ambitious" [...] in the show's history. More {{than half the}} episode {{consisted}} of footage from the film. Originally, the producers considered showing just the movie, but they felt that it [...] "would feel like a gimmick or experiment", {{and so it was}} decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film. In order to make the film seem as if Michael had created it, the film used was colorized in post-production to make it seem as if it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high-quality film that the series used. Certain shooting methods, like hand-held and zooms, were nixed, except for in cases where they could be presented in a [...] "poorly-executed" [...] manner. This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing; Novak explained that the crew [...] "didn't want the joke of the episode to be how bad he was at filmmaking" [...] because it would [...] "be a little easy and a little out of character". To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded, Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full-face mold that reportedly [...] "unnerved him greatly". Two molds were taken. Both were filled with explosives, but one was filled with fake blood. Both were shot with slow-motion cameras. However, the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered [...] "too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael", and so the tamer explosion was used.|$|E
