The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of linear polymers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamines found in the biofilm matrices.

50|$|<b>Dispersin</b> B is {{produced}} by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a Gram-negative oral bacterium, when it needs to detach and disperse adherent bacterial cells. A. actinomycetemcomitans forms asymmetric biofilm lobed colonies that release single cells or small clusters of bacterial cells, which can attach to nearby surfaces, form new colonies, and enable the biofilm to spread. A biofilm is a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances that are synthesized by the bacteria. The biofilm's structural integrity is dependent on poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PGA), extracellular DNA, and proteinaceous adhesins. It allows bacteria to adhere to host surfaces, protects the bacterial cells from host defenses, results in increased resistance to antibiotics, and provides a protected environment with microchannels for {{the flow of water}} and other essential nutrients. By hydrolyzing PGA, <b>Dispersin</b> B disrupts the formation of the biofilm matrix and allows adherent cells to be released. <b>Dispersin</b> B has also been shown to cause the detachment of biofilm cells that have adhered to abiotic surfaces as well as cause the disaggregaton of highly auto-aggregated clumps of bacterial cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dispersin</b> B is a β-hexosaminidase that {{specifically}} hydrolyzes β-1,6-glycosidic linkages of acetylglucosamine polymers found in biofilm matrices. As {{a member of}} family 20 β-hexosaminidases, it cleaves terminal monosaccharide residues from the non-reducing end of the polymers. The active site of <b>Dispersin</b> B contains three highly conserved acidic residues: an aspartic acid at residue 183 (D183), a glutamic acid at residue 184 (E184), and a glutamic acid at residue 332 (E332). In the proposed mechanism, E184 serves as the acid/base and donates a proton to the -OR on C1. Crystallographic evidence suggests that substrate-assisted catalysis occurs and D183 is believed to assist in activating the N-acetyl group, which acts as a nucleophilic in an attack of C1. Water then attacks the anomeric centre to release the cleaved polymer from the active site with retention of anomeric configuration. (The mechanism shown below is thus incorrect). The use of the neighboring C2-acetamido group of the substrate differs from the majority of β-glycosidases, which use a carboxyl group as a nucleophile in their mechanisms. Although E332 is located {{farther away from the}} anomeric carbon, the lower activity of <b>Dispersin</b> B with the mutation E332Q suggests that it is important for catalysis. It may be critical in stabilizing the transition state of cleaving the terminal monosaccharide.|$|E

Serum samples were tested for IgG antibody to a recombinant purified <b>dispersin</b> protein by ELISA. For all travellers, with and without diarrhoea, the mean±SD pre-serum absorbance value (read at 450 and 570 nm) was 0. 340 ± 0. 212 and the mean post-serum value was 0. 513 ± 0. 316 (P, 0. 00001).

40|$|Antibiotic therapies to {{eradicate}} medical device-associated infections often fail {{because of the}} ability of sessile bacteria, encased in their exopolysaccharide matrix, to be more drug resistant than planktonic organisms. In the last two decades, several strategies to prevent microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on the surfaces of medical devices, based mainly {{on the use of}} antiadhesive, antiseptic, and antibiotic coatings on polymer surfaces, have been developed. More recent alternative approaches are based on molecules able to interfere with quorum-sensing phenomena or to dissolve biofilms.

In this study, we investigated the functions of two staphylococcal biofilm matrix polymers: poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide (PNAG) and extracellular DNA (ecDNA). We measured the ability of a PNAG-degrading enzyme (<b>dispersin</b> B) and DNase I to inhibit biofilm formation, detach preformed biofilms, and sensitize biofilms to killing by the cationic detergent cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) in a 96 -well microtiter plate assay.

40|$|Biofilms are {{aggregates}} {{of bacteria}} {{embedded in a}} self-produced matrix. In nature most bacteria exist {{in the form of}} biofilms. They are exceptionally resistant to environmental stress. They can survive harsh conditions such as starvation and desiccation, and can withstand conventional antimicrobial agents. Bacteria in the form of biofilms cause many diseases in humans, animals and plants. Formation of biofilms leads to corrosion of pipelines incurring huge losses in industries. The major focus of the research in microbiology is now shifting to biofilms. Researchers are exploring various strategies to combat biofilms. Among different methods of combating biofilms, biological methods offer some advantages over other methods. The biological methods make use of the existing signaling pathways in bacteria and bring about efficient disruption of the target biofilm without having to add any artificially synthesized compound. These methods are particularly attractive in treating biofilm-induced diseases. In this project I have proposed three different strategies of engineering Escherichia coli to disrupt the biofilms of E. coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The anti-biofilm agent used in all the strategies is <b>Dispersin</b> B, an enzyme that hydrolyzes poly-N-acetyl glucosamine found in the matrix of the target biofilms. Hydrolysis of this polymer leads to disruption of the biofilm. The first strategy makes use of the N-acetyl glucosamine signaling and chemotaxis pathway of E. coli to detect the target biofilm and to synthesize <b>Dispersin</b> B. The product of the action of <b>Dispersin</b> B is N-acetyl glucosamine, which acts as an inducer to elevate the synthesis of <b>Dispersin</b> B. The second strategy exploits the biofilm-specific pattern of gene expression in E. coli biofilms. The engineered bacterium expresses <b>Dispersin</b> B from the promoter of a gene that is multi-fold activated when the bacterium acquires the biofilm lifestyle. It incorporates itself in the target biofilm and disrupts the biofilm through the action of <b>Dispersin</b> B. The third strategy is specifically aimed at disrupting S. epidermidis biofilms. It uses the agr quorum-sensing system of S. epidermidis to detect the target biofilm and to synthesize <b>Dispersin</b> B. The strategies proposed in this project have been partially successful. I have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered to express and secrete <b>Dispersin</b> B, which can disrupt the target biofilm efficiently. The strategies proposed in this project are versatile in application. They can be modified to engineer similar biological systems against biofilms of other species of bacteria. In the course of accomplishing the objective of this project I have explored some unknown aspects of the N-acetyl glucosamine signaling in E. coli. The analysis of the transcriptome of E. coli biofilms has revealed the up regulation of redox stress-associated genes in the attached cells of E. coli biofilms.

40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are diarrheal {{pathogens}} {{defined by}} a ‘stacked brick’ epithelial cell adherence pattern, attributable {{to a variety of}} adhesins. Heat‐resistant agglutinin 1 (Hra 1), an outer membrane protein of EAEC strain 042, is sufficient to confer aggregative adherence, autoaggregation and enhanced biofilm‐forming capacity on laboratory E. coli strains. 042 hra 1 mutants lose the stacked brick formation and show decreased virulence in C. elegans, but are quantitatively unimpaired in biofilm formation, autoaggregation or epithelial cell adherence, a result of <b>dispersin,</b> a secretory protein, masking Hra 1. Colonization patterns of GFP‐expressing mutants of 042, single and double mutants of hra 1 and aap, were examined within C. elegans to test the hypothesis that both hra 1 and aap are necessary to create a specific colonization pattern that enhances virulence. Differences in colonization patterns were compared to C. elegans slow‐killing assay rates to investigate a possible relationship between colonization patterns and 2 virulence. Both <b>dispersin</b> and Hra 1 result in a colonization pattern is optimal for virulence. The loss of aap results in highly localized colonization pattern that decreases virulence. Additionally, the loss of hra 1 and aap or just hra 1 results in an overly dispersed colonization pattern that also decreases virulence. Both Hra 1 and <b>dispersin</b> are necessary to create a colonization pattern that results in maximal virulence.

These results were confirmed by further studies, which showed that the PNAG hydrolase, <b>dispersin</b> B, eliminated immunoreactivity of extracts from the species that were tested (B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans). <b>Dispersin</b> B also inhibited biofilm formation and dispersed preformed biofilms of Burkholderia species. These results imply a role for PNAG in the maintenance of Burkholderia biofilm integrity. While PNAG was present in biofilms {{of all of the}} wild-type test organisms, a ΔpgaBC mutant of B. multivorans (Mu 5) produced no detectable PNAG, indicating that these genes are needed for Burkholderia PNAG formation. Furthermore, restoration of PNAG production in PNAG negative E. coli TRXWMGΔC (ΔpgaC) by complementation with B. multivorans pgaBCD confirmed the involvement of these genes in Burkholderia PNAG production. While the confocal scanning laser microscopy of untreated wild-type B. multivorans showed thick, multilayered biofilm, Mu 5 and <b>dispersin</b> B-treated wild-type biofilms were thin, poorly developed, and disrupted, confirming the involvement of PNAG in B. multivorans biofilm formation.

40|$|Background: In prior work, a phage {{engineered}} with a biofilm-degrading enzyme (<b>dispersin</b> B) cleared artificial, short-term biofilms {{more fully}} than the phage lacking the enzyme. An unresolved {{question is whether}} the transgene will be lost or maintained during phage growth – its loss would limit the utility of the engineering. Broadly supported evolutionary theory suggests that transgenes will be lost through a ‘tragedy of the commons ’ mechanism unless the ecology of growth in biofilms meets specific requirements. We test that theory here. Results: Functional properties of the transgenic phage were identified. Consistent with the previous study, the <b>dispersin</b> phage was superior to unmodified phage at clearing short term biofilms grown in broth, shown here to be an effect attributable to free enzyme. However, the <b>dispersin</b> phage was only marginally better than control phages on short term biofilms in minimal media and was no better than control phages in clearing long term biofilms. There was little empirical support for the tragedy of the commons framework despite a strong theoretical foundation for its supposed relevance. The framework requires that the transgene imposes an intrinsic cost, yet the transgene was intrinsically neutral or beneficial when expressed from one part of the phage genome. Expressed from {{a different part of the}} genome, the transgene did behave as if intrinsically costly, but its maintenance did not benefit from spatially structured growth per se – violating the tragedy framework. Conclusions: Overall, the transgene was beneficial under many conditions, but no insight to its maintenance was attributable to the established evolutionary framework. The failure likely resides in system details that would be used to parameterize the models.

The three strains that produced the highest amounts of biofilm exhibited steady-state or decreased biofilm formation in the presence of sub-MIC antibiotics, whereas the three strains that produced lower amounts of biofilm exhibited up to 10 -fold-increased biofilm formation in the presence of sub-MIC antibiotics. In two of the inducible strains (9142 and 456 a), antibiotic-induced biofilm formation was inhibited by <b>dispersin</b> B, an enzyme that degrades poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) biofilm polysaccharide.

DNase I had no effect on antibiotic-induced biofilm formation in strains 9142 and 456 a.

A major com-ponent of the Escherichia coli biofilm matrix is PGA, a linear polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in (1, 6) linkage.

In this report, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that PGA is also a major matrix component of biofilms produced by the human periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the porcine respiratory pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.

A {{small percentage of}} the GlcNAc residues in each polysaccharide were N-deacetylated. These structures were nearly identical to those of biofilm matrix polysaccharides produced by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. PCR analyses indicated that a gene encoding the PGA-specific glycoside transferase enzyme PgaC was present on the chromosome of 15 out of 15 A. pleuropneumoniae reference strains (serotypes 1 - 12) and 76 out of 77 A. pleuropneumoniae field isolates (serotypes 1, 5 and 7).

These strains were more tolerant to the lethal effect of BC both in suspension and biofilm than the remaining five biofilm producing strains. The five BC susceptible strains were characterized by lack of the ica operon, and their biofilms were detached by Proteinase K or trypsin, but not <b>Dispersin</b> B, indicating that proteins were major structural components of their biofilm matrix. Several novel cell wall anchored repeat domain proteins with domain structures similar to that of MSCRAMM adhesins were identified in the genomes of these strains, potentially representing novel mechanisms of ica-independent biofilm accumulation. Biofilms from all strains showed similar levels of detachment after exposure to alkaline chlorine, which is used for cleaning in the food industry. Strains with qac genes encoding BC eﬄux pumps could grow at higher concentrations of BC than strains without these genes, but no differences were observed at biocidal concentrations. In conclusion, the biofilm matrix of food associated staphylococci varies with respect to protein or polysaccharide nature, and this may affect the sensitivity toward a commonly used disinfectant...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria in a biofilm are {{enmeshed in}} a self-synthesized {{extracellular}} polysaccharide matrix (PGA), {{which is a}} linear polymer of β(1, 6) -linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. <b>Dispersin</b> B (DspB), a soluble glycoside hydrolase produced by the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans degrades PGA. The enzyme DspB is an α/β TIM-barrel protein and belongs to family 20 glycosyl hydrolases members. The enzyme activity of DspB with regard to its substrate specificity towards β(1, 6) -linked GlcNAc polymers and its endo/exo character was investigated through ligand docking and the hydrolysis of synthetic oligosaccharides. Ligand docking analysis suggested that β(1, 6) -linked GlcNAc oligosaccharide bound to the active site better that β(1, 4) -linked GlcNAc oligosaccharide. Our combined results indicate that DspB is an exo-acting enzyme that hydrolyzes β(1, 6) -linked N-acetylglucosamine oligomers...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} potential anti-biofilm {{agents for}} their ability to enhance the activity of antibiotics for local treatment of localized biofilm infections. Methods Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro biofilm models were developed. The putative antibiotic enhancers N-acetylcysteine, acetylsalicylic acid, sodium salicylate, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I, <b>dispersin</b> B, hydrogen peroxide and Johnson’s Baby Shampoo (JBS) were tested for their anti-biofilm activity alone and their ability to enhance the activity of antibiotics for 7 or 14 [*]days, against 5 [*]day old biofilms. The antibiotic enhancers were paired with rifampicin and clindamycin against S. aureus and gentamicin and ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa. Isolates from biofilms that were not eradicated were tested for antibiotic resistance. Results Antibiotic levels 10 × MIC and 100 × MIC significantly reduced biofilm, but did not consistently eradicate it. Antibiotics at 100 × MIC with 10...|$|E
40|$|Not all {{strains of}} Escherichia coli are pathogenic; however, even {{harmless}} strains can become pathogenic {{by picking up}} plasmids that contain virulence genes. One particular strain, 60 A, was isolated from a child with diarrhea in Mexico, and is unique because it contains the novel virulence plasmid pLMJ 50. 60 A {{is a type of}} E. coli known as Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), which is characterized by aggregative patterns of adherence. The pLMJ 50 plasmid, like other EAEC plasmids, has been shown to carry several genes predicted to encode aggregative adherence fimbriae, the Aap <b>dispersin</b> and its secretion system, the AggR regulator, and the serine protease autotransporter precursor, all of which are known to be involved in virulence. However, while other EAEC plasmids are known to contain some, but not all, of the genes on the pLMJ 50 plasmid, pLMJ 50 itself lacks some toxic genes commonly found in other EAEC strains. Our goal is to determine which genes on the pLMJ 50 plasmid are involved in pathogenesis. We predict that these genes will cause virulence via aggregation and biofilm formation, and that, if fed to Caenorhabditis elegans, they will cause the bacteria to colonize the worm’s gut...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} the prevalence of 19 virulence factors and biofilm production in 86 EAEC isolates causing diarrhea in children less than 5 years of age from Ifakara, Tanzania. Virulence factors were detected by PCR, whereas biofilm production was determined using a microtiter plate assay. No virulence factor, {{with the exception of}} the aat gene used to identify EAEC, was detected in 11 / 86 isolates (12. 8 %). The most frequently detected virulence factor was the aggR gene in 53 (61. 6 %) EAEC, followed by antigen 43 in 33. 7 %, <b>dispersin</b> in 26. 7 %, yersiniabactin in 22. 1 %; autrotransporter Sat in 20. 9 %; Shigella enterotoxin- 1 in 16. 3 %, and heat-stable toxin- 1 in 15. 1 %. Biofilm was produced in 66 / 86 (76 %) isolates. AggR was the most prevalent virulence factor in the biofilm-forming group (65 % versus 38 %, P � 0. 032). These results again show the high heterogeneity of virulence factors among EAEC isolates causing diarrhea in children, and that biofilm may be an important virulence factor, strongly associated with the presence of AggR...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{importance of}} Acinetobacter baumannii is {{partly due to}} its natural ability to survive in the hospital environment. This persistence may be explained by its capacity to form biofilms and, interestingly, A. baumannii can form pellicles at the air-liquid interface more readily than other less pathogenic Acinetobacter species. Pellicles from twenty-six strains were morphologically classified into three groups: I) egg-shaped (27 %); II) ball-shaped (50 %); and III) irregular pellicles (23 %). One strain representative of each group was further analysed by Brewster’s Angle Microscopy to follow pellicle development, demonstrating that their formation did not require anchoring to a solid surface. Total carbohydrate analysis of the matrix showed three main components: Glucose, GlcNAc and Kdo. <b>Dispersin</b> B, an enzyme that hydrolyzes poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) polysaccharide, inhibited A. baumannii pellicle formation, suggesting that this exopolysaccharide contributes to pellicle formation. Also associated with the pellicle matrix were three subunits of pili assembled by chaperon-usher systems: the major CsuA/B, A 1 S_ 1510 (presented 45 % of identity with the main pilin F 17 -A from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli pili) and A 1 S_ 2091. The presence of both PNAG polysaccharide and pili systems in matrix of pellicles migh...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{isolates}} of the periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans form matrix-encased biofilms on abiotic {{surfaces in}} vitro. A {{major component of}} the A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm matrix is poly-beta- 1, 6 -N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PGA), a hexosamine-containing polysaccharide that mediates intercellular adhesion. In this report, we describe studies on the purification, structure, genetics and function of A. actinomycetemcomitans PGA. We found that PGA was very tightly attached to A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells and could be efficiently separated from the cells only by phenol extraction. A. actinomycetemcomitans PGA copurified with LPS on a gel filtration column. (1) H NMR spectra of purified A. actinomycetemcomitans PGA were consistent with a structure containing a linear chain of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues in beta(1, 6) linkage. Genetic analyses indicated that all four genes of the pgaABCD locus were required for PGA production in A. actinomycetemcomitans. PGA mutant strains still formed biofilms in vitro. Unlike wild-type biofilms, however, PGA mutant biofilms were sensitive to detachment by DNase I and proteinase K. Treatment of A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with the PGA-hydrolyzing enzyme <b>dispersin</b> B made them 3 log units more sensitive to killing by the cationic detergent cetylpyridinium chloride. Our findings suggest that PGA, extracellular DNA and proteinaceous adhesins all contribute to the structural integrity of the A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm matrixPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Biofilms are {{composed}} of bacterial cells encased in a self-synthesized, extracellular polymeric matrix. Poly-β(1, 6) -N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) is a major biofilm matrix component in phylogenetically diverse bacteria. In this study we investigated the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the PNAG matrix in biofilms produced in vitro by the gram-negative porcine respiratory pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and the gram-positive device-associated pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis. The effect of PNAG on bulk fluid flow was determined by measuring the rate of fluid convection through biofilms cultured in centrifugal filter devices. The rate of fluid convection was significantly higher in biofilms cultured {{in the presence of the}} PNAG-degrading enzyme <b>dispersin</b> B than in biofilms cultured without the enzyme, indicating that PNAG decreases bulk fluid flow. PNAG also blocked transport of the quaternary ammonium compound cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) through the biofilms. Binding of CPC to biofilms further impeded fluid convection and blocked transport of the azo dye Allura red. Bioactive CPC was efficiently eluted from biofilms by treatment with 1 M sodium chloride. Taken together, these findings suggest that CPC reacts directly with the PNAG matrix and alters its physical and chemical properties. Our results indicate that PNAG plays an important role in controlling the physiological state of biofilms and may contribute to additional biofilm-associated processes such as biocide resistance...|$|E
40|$|While coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), {{with their}} ability to form a thick, {{multilayered}} biofilm on foreign bodies, {{have been identified as}} the major cause of implant-associated infections, no data are available about biofilm formation by staphylococcal small-colony variants (SCVs). In the past years, a number of device-associated infections due to staphylococcal SCVs were described, among them, several pacemaker infections due to SCVs of CoNS auxotrophic to hemin. To test the characteristics of SCVs of CoNS, in particular, to study the ability of SCVs to form a biofilm on foreign bodies, we generated a stable mutant in electron transport by interrupting one of the hemin biosynthetic genes, hemB, in Staphylococcus epidermidis. In fact, this mutant displayed a stable SCV phenotype with tiny colonies showing strong adhesion to the agar surface. When the incubation time was extended to 48 h or a higher inoculum concentration was used, the mutant produced biofilm amounts on polystyrene similar to those produced by the parent strain. When grown under planktonic conditions, the mutant formed markedly larger cell clusters than the parental strain which were completely disintegrated by the specific - 1, 6 -hexosaminidase <b>dispersin</b> B but were resistant to trypsin treatment. In a dot blot assay, the mutant expressed larger amounts of polysaccharide intercellular adhesi...|$|E
