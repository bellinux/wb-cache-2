40|$|We {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that the relative abundance of feedback loops in many empirical complex networks is severely reduced owing to the presence of an inherent global directionality. Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a simple probabilistic model in which a free parameter <b>gamma</b> <b>controls</b> the degree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also feedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and feedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio-technological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical networks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network randomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively reproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter gamma. Moreover, the fitted value of gamma correlates quite well with another direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a novel algorithm. We conclude that the existence of an inherent network directionality provides a parsimonious quantitative explanation for the observed lack of feedback loops in empirical networks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Macrophages are {{the primary}} {{effector}} cells responsible for killing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) through various mechanisms, including apoptosis. However, MTB can evade host immunity to create a favorable environment for intracellular replication. MTB-infected human macrophages produce interleukin- 32 (IL- 32). IL- 32 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and has several isoforms. We previously found that IL- 32 gamma reduced the burden of MTB in human macrophages, in part, through the induction of caspase- 3 -dependent apoptosis. However, based on our previous studies, we hypothesized that caspase- 3 -independent death pathways may also mediate IL- 32 control of MTB infection. Herein, we assessed the potential roles of cathepsin-mediated apoptosis, caspase- 1 -mediated pyroptosis, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in mediating IL- 32 <b>gamma</b> <b>control</b> of MTB infection in THP- 1 cells. RESULTS: Differentiated human THP- 1 macrophages were infected with MTB H 37 Rv alone or {{in the presence of}} specific inhibitors to caspase- 1, cathepsin B/D, or cathepsin L for up to four days, after which TUNEL-positive cells were quantified; in addition, MTB was quantified by culture {{as well as by the}} percentage of THP- 1 cells that were infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -labeled MTB as determined by microscopy. AIF expression was inhibited using siRNA technology. Inhibition of cathepsin B/D, cathepsin L, or caspase- 1 activity significantly abrogated the IL- 32 gamma-mediated reduction in the number of intracellular MTB and of the percentage of GFP-MTB-infected macrophages. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase- 1, cathepsin B/D, or cathepsin L in the absence of exogenous IL- 32 gamma resulted in a trend toward an increased proportion of MTB-infected THP- 1 cells. Inhibition of AIF activity in the absence of exogenous IL- 32 gamma also increased intracellular burden of MTB. However, since IL- 32 gamma did not induce AIF and because the relative increases in MTB with inhibition of AIF were similar in the presence or absence of IL- 32 gamma, our results indicate that AIF does not mediate the host-protective effect of IL- 32 gamma against MTB. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-MTB effects of IL- 32 gamma are mediated through classical caspase- 3 -dependent apoptosis as well as caspase- 3 -independent apoptosis...|$|E

Whereas the Tif- 1 <b>gamma</b> branch <b>controls</b> lineage expansion, the Smad 4 branch maintains the maturation stage that is initially repressed by a Tif- 1 gamma/Smad 4 -independent branch.

40|$|The {{steady-state}} {{production of}} a product produced through the growth of microorganisms in a continuous flow bioreactor is presented. A generalised reactor model is used in which both the classic well-stirred bioreactor and the idealised membrane bioreactor are considered as special cases.

40|$|Control of {{cytokine}} {{production by}} immune cells is pivotal for counteracting infections via orchestration {{of local and}} systemic inflammation. Although their contribution has long been underexposed, it has recently become clear that human Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma Rs), which are receptors for the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, {{play a critical role}} in this process by controlling tissue- and pathogen-specific cytokine production. Whereas individual stimulation of Fc gamma Rs does not evoke cytokine production, Fc gamma Rs cell-type specifically interact with various other receptors for selective amplification or inhibition of particular cytokines, thereby tailoring cytokine responses to the immunological context. The physiological function of Fc <b>gamma</b> R-mediated <b>control</b> of cytokine production is to counteract infections with various classes of pathogens. Upon IgG opsonization, pathogens are simultaneously recognized by Fc gamma Rs as well as by various pathogen-sensing receptors, leading to the induction of pathogen class-specific immune responses. However, when erroneously activated, the same mechanism also contributes to the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
