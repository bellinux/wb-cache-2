5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E
25|$|Bascinets, {{other than}} great bascinets, could be worn beneath a great helm. However, only those without face protection, {{or those with}} the close fitting bretache, could be worn in this manner. The great helm afforded a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> but {{at the cost of}} very {{restricted}} vision and agility. The lighter types of bascinet gave less protection but allowed greater freedom of movement and better vision. The practicality of a man-at-arms being able to take off a great helm during a battle, if he wanted to continue fighting wearing just a bascinet, is unclear. By the mid 14th century the great helm was probably largely relegated to tournament use. However, Henry V of England is reputed to have worn a great helm over a bascinet at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He was recorded as receiving a blow to the head during the battle, which damaged his helmet; the double protection afforded by wearing two helmets may have saved his life.|$|E

50|$|Indian {{labour law}} refers to laws {{regulating}} labour in India. Traditionally, Indian governments at {{federal and state}} level have sought to ensure a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> for workers, but in practice, legislative rights only cover a minority of workers. India is a federal form of government and because labour is a subject in the concurrent list of the Indian Constitution, labour matters are in the jurisdiction of both central and state governments; both central and state governments have enacted laws on labour relations and employment issues.|$|E
