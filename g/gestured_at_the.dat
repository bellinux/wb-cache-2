After exiting the vehicle, Rees <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> couple to roll down their car window, displaying a gun. After being refused demands for cigarettes and money, an angered Rees shot Harold point-blank in the face. The horrified soldier fled the scene and ran across several rural fields before reaching a farmhouse, where he called the police. As the soldier was being {{picked up at the}} farmhouse, other officers arrived at the crime scene, where they found that Rees had removed the deceased Harold's clothing and sexually assaulted her.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson and {{his command}} arrived {{late in the}} afternoon. However, unable to find A.P. Hill or D.H. Hill, Jackson did nothing. Although a major battle was raging within earshot, he ordered his troops to make camp for the evening. Hill's 11,000 men, most of them green regiments who had never fired a shot in battle, {{launched}} a series of futile attacks {{over the next few}} hours. The brigade of John R. Anderson assaulted the Union right flank, with James Archer's and Charles W. Field's brigades in support. Maxcy Gregg's brigade was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle at all. Directing his troops, John Reynolds <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oncoming mass of Confederates and told a staffer [...] "There they come like flies on a piece of gingerbread." [...] The Union artillery and musketry tore enormous gaps in the Confederate lines as they attempted to cross the creek. Although A.P. Hill had 24 guns with him, he made no attempt to use massed artillery fire to counter the Union gunners, instead sending individual batteries in support of the infantry, most of which were quickly put out of action by enemy shelling.|$|E

30|$|Paula {{made the}} {{necessary}} adjustments to her gestures {{based on her}} observations of Haile. He showed how {{he could make a}} repeating pattern out of shells. Here, I refer to Vygotsky (1978) who states that pointing gestures were the first stage in the development of speech and that it is nothing more than an unsuccessful attempt to grasp. Over time a child’s movements “change with the act of pointing becoming a gesture of pointing for others and is understood by others as a gesture” (Ewing 2005, p. 44). Paula was influenced by Haile’s physical movements, gestures and facial expressions, all the while gently prompting and guiding him through the task. Where Haile became unsure, she <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thirteenth shell with him. He then confidently continued to explain the pattern ending with a triumphant grin.|$|E
40|$|When {{the doctors}} couldn’t cure the Tyrant’s headache, he called upon the philosophers. “Show me some {{necessary}} condition for having a headache, which I can defeat!” The philosophers sent forth the great David K. Lewis in magician’s robes. 1 With him traveled a madman, in top hat and monocle, and a Martian. Said the Philosopher to the Tyrant: There might be a strange man who sometimes feels pain, just as we do, but whose pain differs greatly from ours in its causes and effects. Our pain is typically caused by cuts, burns, pressure, and the like; his is caused by moderate exercise on an empty stomach. Our pain is generally distracting; his turns his mind to mathematics, facilitating concentration on that but distracting him from anything else. Intense pain has no tendency whatever to cause him to groan or writhe, but does cause him to cross his legs and snap his fingers. He {{is not in the}} least motivated to prevent pain or to get rid of it. The Philosopher <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> madman, who did forty jumping-jacks, then sat crosslegged upon a windowsill, snapped his fingers six times, and began a discourse on the relation between e and π. (“Most Stoical, how he deals with his pain! ” whispered an advisor to the Tyrant. ...|$|E
40|$|My paper {{deals with}} mythological/religious imagery and syncretic soteriologies in Thomas Pynchon’s 2006 novel 'Against the Day', {{focusing}} in particular {{on the character}} of Cyprian Latewood, bisexual spy, Orpheus stand-in, and masochist par excellence. Cyprian’s path throughout the novel is specifically an Orphic descent/return myth, but it also deals with issues of mystical transcendence, metempsychosis, Dionysian 'ekstasis', and Buddhist 'nirvana'. These are represented at the macro level in themes such as retreat from the world, neo-monasticism, anarchic activism, or hope for transcendent knowledge, and also within specific images and scenes, such as those involving flight, self-negation, disembodied voices, and the final voyage of the Chums of Chance, a Manichaean allegory of escape. Cyprian’s final home at a Bogomil-Orphic monastery near Thrace serves to tie together disparate religio-political strands within the novel, including a syncretic teleology (Gnostic/Buddhist/Manichaean) and countercultural activism. It is simultaneously a retreat from the world – a political move with relevance to the history of the Bogomils as both persecuted sect and social agitators – and also a move towards transcendence through gnostic ritual. There are a few important results of this reading, touching on religious, mythological, and Pynchon studies, and sexual and political discourse. Firstly, it challenges the ease with which Western, and specifically Christian, ideologies appropriate counter-discourses in acts of cultural hegemony, exemplified in one instance by Kathryn Hume’s early reading of the novel’s ethos as explicitly Roman Catholic, {{even in the face of}} overwhelming evidence to the contrary (“The Religious and Political Vision of 'Against the Day'”, 2007). Secondly, though other critics have <b>gestured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> presence of Orphism and Buddhism in 'Against the Day', they have failed to convincingly tie these concerns to a larger conversation around Pynchon’s oeuvre and the meaning of the evolution of the author’s religious vision. None, so far as I know, have commented on the expressly Manichaean concepts in the work, and the consequences of the presence of this specific cosmological binary. Lastly, by making the heroic Cyprian the focus of the novel’s transcendental religious narrative, the author complicates two assumptions which have lingered unquestioned for far too long in Pynchon studies, namely the anti-metaphysics of his earth-centered onto-epistemology, and the inherent homophobia present in  a worldview which privileges the nuclear, procreative family structure and seems to use homosexuality and sadomasochism strictly in negative significations, as metaphors for unequal political and economic power dynamics (see Julie Christine Sears’ “Black and White Rainbows and Blurry Lines”).  This paper resists the reductive impulse towards conclusiveness, but rather seeks to complicate existing readings while pushing forward into new territory by synthesizing areas of discourse around the author, his works, and mythology and politics, which are usually considered only as discrete entities. Pynchon’s postmodern playfulness in his arrangement of historical, religious, and political signifiers resists organization into a singular narrative, but is rather designed to lead readers to question the ways in which knowledge is produced and belief is rationalized, and to consider alternatives to a future which marches blindly in lockstep with our past and present realities...|$|E
