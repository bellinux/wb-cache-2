25|$|The {{relationship}} between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of each individual photon is why ultraviolet light can cause sunburn, but visible or infrared light cannot. A photon of ultraviolet light will deliver a high amount of energy– enough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs in a sunburn. A photon of infrared light will deliver a lower amount of energy– only enough to warm one's skin. So, an <b>infrared</b> <b>lamp</b> can warm a large surface, perhaps large enough to keep people comfortable in a cold room, but it cannot give anyone a sunburn.|$|E

50|$|Radiant {{energy is}} used for radiant heating. It can be {{generated}} electrically by <b>infrared</b> <b>lamps,</b> or can be absorbed from sunlight and used to heat water. The heat energy is emitted from a warm element (floor, wall, overhead panel) and warms people and other objects in rooms rather than directly heating the air.

50|$|IR {{radiation}} is more useful than the visible radiation for heating our body, because we absorb most of it, {{compared to a}} strong reflection of visible light. Penetration depth of infrared radiation in our skin is dependent of wavelength. IR-A is the most penetrating, and reaches some millimeters, IR-B penetrates into the dermis (about 1 mm), and IR-C is mostly absorbed in the external layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum). For this reason the <b>infrared</b> <b>lamps</b> used for therapeutic purposes produce mainly IR-A radiation.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the package}} is {{soldered}} into place, {{it is difficult to}} find soldering faults.

If a BGA is found to be badly soldered, it can be removed in a rework station, which is a jig fitted with <b>infrared</b> <b>lamp</b> (or hot air), a thermocouple and a vacuum device for lifting the package. The BGA can be replaced with a new one, or it can be refurbished (or reballed) and re-installed on the circuit board. Pre-configured solder balls matching the array pattern can be used to reball BGAs when only one or a few need to be reworked.|$|E
