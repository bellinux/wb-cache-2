Their high-pressure parts, which {{are subjected to}} the highest steam parameters, are most affected by these conditions and may suffer from creep deformation. Permanent changes in geometry become visible in <b>high-pressure</b> turbine <b>casings</b> when they are disassembled after a certain time in operation...|$|R

50|$|With Baker {{secure and}} the priceless {{airfield}} constructed {{and ready for}} use by 11 September, Trathen headed for Hawaii. On 29 September, the ship commenced screening operations for Task Group (TG) 14.5, as it sortied from Pearl Harbor, bound for Wake Island. Under the command of Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery, this fast carrier task force—the largest yet assembled—consisted of Essex (CV-9), Yorktown (CV-10), Lexington (CV-16), Cowpens (CVL-25), Independence (CVL-22), and Belleau Wood. On 5 and 6 October, Montgomerys planes made six strikes, flying 738 combat sorties while battleships and cruisers provided their heavy gunfire for further harassment of the Japanese-held island. Despite a cracked <b>high-pressure</b> turbine <b>casing,</b> Trathen retired with the task force back toward the Hawaiian Islands and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 11th.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Steam Turbines are devices used {{to convert}} thermal energy of steam into {{mechanical}} energy, {{which may be}} used to produce Electrical Energy. Steam turbine generator units are being used extensively all over the world for generation of electric power and for co-generation of steam and power. Contact pressure and pretension in bolts-analysis has been made easier in recent years due to the availability of high computational capabilities and flexibility in the computational methods using finite element analysis. In the present work, one such analysis is carried out to evaluate the contact pressure in a high pressure steam turbine casing. The shape and design of a steam turbine casing depends on key sensitivity parameters like bolt pre-tensions, contact pressure and thickness of casing which determine the structural integrity of the casing. The preset work reviews a recent structural integrity assessment carried out on a <b>high-pressure</b> turbine inner <b>casing</b> that had suffered from temper embrittlement Conventional design of a steam turbine casing is considered. Experimental work is carried out at Maxwatt to verify the contact pressure. The assessment will be carried out to demonstrate that the casing can be safely returned to service based on custom made revised operating conditions. The experimental results will be verified through finite element Analysis results. The project which is presented in this paper has paid special attention to employ a standard methodology to perform static analysis and experimental condition. For this purpose a new methodology called “Contact pressure ” ha...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 46 - 59 The current {{centrifugal}} compressor {{design for the}} Oil & Gas market {{is more and more}} challenging since the cost requirements and the presence of many competitors is pushing towards casing size reduction and rotational speed increase. The first requirement basically leads {{to increase the number of}} wheels per rotor and the second to cross more critical speeds requiring the proper degree of damping. The two consequences together lead also to increase the rotor flexibility ratio (defined as the ratio between the Maximum Continuous Speed and the first critical speed as per the Fulton diagram and API 617 7 th ed. [1 - 2]) and finally the rotordynamic stability is very much challenged. The {{centrifugal compressor}}s rotordynamic stability is then strictly related to the internal seals? dynamic behaviour and for this reason the authors? Company decided several years ago to develop internally a High Pressure Seal Test Rig to measure seals? stiffness and damping. The rig is now in operation. This paper aims to describe the main test rig capabilities, the applied identification procedures and the preliminary test results on a long labyrinth seal (smooth rotor - straight toothed stator). Due to the pressure level (500 bar design pressure), the test rig plant appears like a high-pressure industrial plant equipped with the testing cell (a 1 : 1 scale high pressure compressor) and all the relevant auxiliaries: a 400 kW electric motor (driven by a VFD), a speed increaser gear box, a high pressure reservoir (6 m 3) with a volumetric compressor to fill it, high pressure pipes and valves. The testing cell is composed of a <b>high-pressure</b> compressor <b>casing</b> with stator parts capable to regulate the seal inlet swirl and a rotor running on Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs), which serve as exciters (5 kN MAX Force over a 0 - 330 Hz frequency range per axis) and displacement transducers. Special instrumentation is installed into the testing cell in order to measure the main test parameters: seal upstream/downstream gas pressure, upstream temperature and swirl and mass flow. Industrial high-pressure instrumentation is installed on the plant for regulation and monitoring purpose. Maximum test pressure is 350 bar and maximum rotational speed is 15000 rpm. Test gas is nitrogen. The AMBs control-system capabilities have been tuned to define several alternative excitation patterns and the relevant state of the art identification techniques have been applied. The first seal tested is a long labyrinth seal to simulate a centrifugal compressor balance piston seal. Test results and comparison with a commercial bulk flow code predictions will be fully described. Finally, the future test program will be showed...|$|R
