5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the <b>farad,</b> named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one <b>farad</b> is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Charles Bright and Latimer Clark {{proposed}} {{the names of}} ohm, volt, and <b>farad</b> in honour of Georg Ohm, Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively for the practical units based on the centimetre-gramme-second absolute system. This was supported by Thomson (Lord Kelvin) These names were later scaled {{for use in the}} Practical System. The concept of naming units of measure after noteworthy scientists was subsequently used for other units.|$|E
5|$|The plots shown {{of image}} impedance, {{attenuation}} and phase change are the plots of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal impedance R0 = 1 Ω. This {{is produced by}} a filter half-section where L = 1 henry and C = 1 <b>farad.</b> This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E

25|$|Early {{electrochemical}} capacitors {{used two}} aluminum foils covered with activated carbon—the electrodes—which were soaked in an electrolyte and {{separated by a}} thin porous insulator.

25|$|Capacitance {{is defined}} as the ratio of the {{electric}} charge on each conductor to the potential difference between them. The unit of capacitance in the International System of Units (SI) is the <b>farad</b> (F), defined as one coulomb per volt (1 C/V).

25|$|Practical {{applications}} and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised units of measure. They {{led to the}} international standardization of the units volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, <b>farad,</b> and henry. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893. The publication of these standards {{formed the basis of}} future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.|$|E

25|$|A {{capacitor}} {{consists of}} two conductors separated by a non-conductive region. The non-conductive region can either be a vacuum or an electrical insulator material known as a dielectric. Examples of dielectric media are glass, air, paper, and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors. A capacitor {{is assumed to be}} self-contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field. The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field. In SI units, a capacitance of one <b>farad</b> means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device.|$|E
500|$|The SI unit of {{elastance}} is {{the reciprocal}} <b>farad</b> (F−1). The term daraf is sometimes {{used for this}} unit, {{but it is not}} approved by SI and its use is discouraged. [...] The term is formed by writing <b>farad</b> backwards, {{in much the same way}} as the unit mho (unit of conductance, also not approved by SI) is formed by writing ohm backwards.|$|E
500|$|In a {{reference}} to the Palestinian leadership, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat is mentioned by name. Even though foreign dignitaries were normally fictional on the show, producer Aaron Sorkin said it felt right to call the Chairman by his real name [...] "'cause Arafat's been around forever and he'll be around forever". In a later episode, however ("Gaza" [...] in season five), the name of the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was changed to Nizar <b>Farad,</b> a fictional character. By that point in mid-2004, Arafat was in failing health in real life, and would die in November 2004. The show continued to use the <b>Farad</b> character and never made any references to Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas.|$|E

[...] However, {{it is used}} in theoretical work in network analysis and has some niche applications at microwave frequencies.|$|E
500|$|The unit {{of length}} adopted for the {{practical}} system was [...] (approximately {{the length of the}} Earth's quadrant), the unit of time was the second and the unit of mass an unnamed unit equal to [...] and the definitions of electrical units were based on those of the EMU system. The names, but not the values, amp, volt, <b>farad</b> and ohm were carried over from the EMU system. The system was adopted at the First International Electrical Congress (IEC) in 1881. [...] The second IEC congress (1889) defined the joule and the watt as the practical units of energy and power respectively. The units were formalised as the International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units at the 1893 congress of the IEC in Chicago, where the volt, amp and ohm were formally defined.

2500|$|Faraday was an {{excellent}} experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language; his mathematical abilities, however, did not extend as far as trigonometry and were limited to the simplest algebra. James Clerk Maxwell took the work of Faraday and others and summarized it {{in a set of}} equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. On Faraday's uses of lines of force, Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday [...] "to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order – one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods."
