5000|$|Other {{factors like}} poor garage door maintenance, loose tracks, or {{components}} shorten torsion spring life. Owners {{are advised to}} avoid applying grease to garage <b>door</b> <b>tracks</b> because that makes the wheels [...] "skate" [...] in the track instead of turning on their bearings. Only bearings, hinges, and spring wire require lubricant.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{panel of}} a {{sectional}} door {{has its own}} connection to the <b>door</b> <b>track.</b> This increases reliability and robustness compared to monolithic doors, which {{have only a few}} track connections for the whole panel.|$|R

5000|$|For {{the concerts}} on this tour, the band {{intended}} to use a scaled-down approach {{similar to the one}} they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed In Through the Out <b>Door</b> <b>track</b> [...] "Carouselambra" [...] was included in the tentative set-list.|$|R
50|$|A {{garage door}} with a broken spring, or the wrong {{strength}} spring, can fall. Because the effective mass of the door increases as the garage door sections transfer from the horizontal to vertical <b>door</b> <b>tracks,</b> a falling garage door accelerates rapidly. A free falling garage door can cause serious injury or death.|$|E
50|$|The {{time taken}} for 12 men to erect the hangar at Thornaby, {{including}} levelling the ground, laying <b>door</b> <b>tracks,</b> erecting the steelwork, and fitting oiled canvas doors, was 500 man-hours. Two light jib derricks using timber poles {{were required to}} erect the fabricated vertical and side members. The roof trusses were assembled on the ground before being lifted into position.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{continued}} {{to expand its}} product line in the 1920s and 1930s, adding {{a wide array of}} products, including barn cupolas, exhaust and intake hoods and louvers, fans, valves, pulleys, power hoists, concrete mangers, a patented garage door hanger (using overhead <b>door</b> <b>tracks</b> for ease in opening and closing), playground equipment (including slides, see-saws, gym sets, [...] "swing bobs," [...] and [...] "whirl-arounds"), and themostats.|$|E
50|$|Extension spring systems {{should always}} be {{restrained}} by a safety cable {{that runs through the}} middle of the spring, tying off to a solid point at the rear and front of the horizontal <b>door</b> <b>track.</b> Extension springs represent a hazard to bystanders when a spring, pulley, or cable breaks under tension. Metal parts from extension spring systems can suddenly be launched.|$|R

5000|$|Peter Frantz was the Company's inventor. An {{adjustable}} lighting {{product called}} the [...] "Lightning Lamp Adjuster" [...] was patented and was among its first production products. The Company soon expanded its line to hardware products ranging from hinges to barn <b>door</b> <b>track</b> and hangers to garage door hardware {{for the new}} automobiles that began to appear. It distributed its products widely throughout the country using a captive sales force.|$|R
50|$|Problems {{with the}} design also became {{apparent}} as the Darrin entered the market, especially regarding its sliding doors. While interior space was adequate, entering or exiting through the narrow door openings could prove awkward. Doors on early production vehicles tended to jam. A switch to nylon roller bushings (retrofitted to early cars) corrected the problem to some extent but owners still had to keep <b>door</b> <b>tracks</b> free of dirt, mud or debris. Also, the folding top and side curtains leaked and the heater proved inadequate. While these last two problems plagued sports cars {{of the time in}} general, they also limited the Darrin's marketability. Kaiser dealers were reluctant to order them.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} garage door {{to date in}} Australia is the B&D Rolla Door, having been around since 1956 and still in heavy use today. They are a {{corrugated}} flexible but strong sheet steel door, sliding up tracks and rolling around a drum mounted above the door opening {{on the inside of}} the garage. These come in manual and remote controlled electric (known as the Control-a-Door), with conversion kits available. Locking is provided by a key lock in the centre of the door moving two square sliding lock bars in and out of holes in the <b>door</b> <b>tracks,</b> locking and unlocking it, or by the solenoid lock in the automatic motor.|$|E
5000|$|The Fred and Rosa Fulton Barn is a {{historic}} building located north of Selma, Iowa, United States in rural Jefferson County. The barn was built by Rosa from plans prepared by the Louden Machinery Company of Fairfield, Iowa. It {{is a good example}} of the company's Gothic laminated roof design. [...] The barn also includes other Louden-manufactured devices, including [...] "Master-Made" [...] ventilator windows, metal roof aerators, hay carrier and fork, and <b>door</b> <b>tracks</b> and trolleys. This equipment is original to the barn's construction in 1947. [...] Built for a dairy operation, the structure has subsequently been used for general farm purposes. The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.|$|E

50|$|The {{adjacent}} {{village of}} Tide Mills {{was the site}} of an experimental seaplane base {{at the head of the}} beach. The first formation of No. 242 Squadron RAF was on 15 August 1918 from numbers 408, 409 and 514 Flights at the seaplane station at New haven, Sussex. Operating from there and the nearby airfield at Telscombe Cliffs, it was equipped with Short Type 184 seaplanes and carried out anti-submarine patrols over the English Channel until the end of the First World War. Surveys carried out in 2006 have exposed part of the slipway, concrete aprons to both hangars with <b>door</b> <b>tracks</b> and several other slabs presumed to be workshops. Sussex Archaeological Society started a dig in April 2006 to catalogue the entire East Beach site.|$|E

50|$|The Whippany line is M&E's {{original}} main line, in use since 1903 {{and with}} some portions dating back to 1895. The 9-mile (14.48 km) line runs between Baker Interlocking (connection with NJT's Morristown Line in Morristown, where M&E's main office, yard, and shop are located) northeast to Roseland in Essex County. The line is single track and has many grade crossings. It serves Cedar Knolls and Whippany in Hanover Township, and East Hanover and Roseland. The line currently ends east of Interstate 280 in Roseland. The outer half-mile {{has been out of}} service since customer Bobst Group, Inc. closed it <b>doors.</b> <b>Track</b> conditions have since degraded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} this track {{date back to}} the early 1970s, when Status Quo heard the <b>Doors</b> <b>track</b> Roadhouse Blues in a club and adopted its {{chugging}} rhythm as a template for much of their early self-penned material. Roadhouse Blues itself had been recorded by Quo in 1972 on the Piledriver album and, with vocals by bassist Alan Lancaster, was a staple of the band's live set for many years. By 1976's [...] "Status Quo Live!" [...] album the song had been extended to more than twelve minutes in duration, featuring a lengthy middle section in which parts of a traditional Irish jig, [...] "Irish Washer Woman" [...] were played.|$|R

50|$|The Movie is a {{poem about}} the mystery and seductive power of cinema, written and {{recorded}} by Jim Morrison. Morrison's influences for this poem is from his time at U.C.L.A. in 1964. It became a track on the official studio album by The Doors, An American Prayer, which includes poetry by Morrison and music by the band. The musique concrète piece includes microphone sounds. The track is an influence from avant-garde composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage. Along with Babylon Fading, Horse Latitudes and Dawn's Highway, {{it is one of}} the only <b>Doors</b> <b>tracks</b> that include poetry and musique concrète influences. The track is played at the beginning of the film about the band.|$|R
50|$|Single panel doors {{can also}} be {{installed}} with (one piece track type hardware) that folds the door back with a single horizontal track on each side (which is mounted {{at the top of}} the wood frame) and a roller, (mounted to the top of the door on each side. A hinge on each side that attaches to the bottom of each side of garage <b>door.</b> Using <b>track</b> hardware, a car can be parked much closer to the door, as the whole door, when in the open position, rests completely inside of the garage <b>door</b> header. <b>Track</b> type hardware has much less arc when raising and lowering the garage door as opposed jamb type hardware.|$|R

It {{is mounted}} inside the {{container}} to sense {{opening of the}} container <b>door.</b> <b>Tracking</b> device is the CSD which is developed in this research whose major features are sensing door opening status as well as history inquiring on internal environment and shock to the container by mounting the temperature / humidity / shock sensors. This paper introduces the development trend of tracking device, compares the container device which is developed thru this research and other company's tracking, and introduces tracking System which is designed and established using tracking device. Finally, from our tracking device, we believe that our approach can achieve the security goals driven by the government as well as create new business value for global supply chain participants...|$|R
5000|$|... "Coming Up You" [...] {{first saw}} release as the eighth <b>track</b> on <b>Door</b> to Door in August 1987. The song later saw a single release in America and Australia, backed with the fellow <b>Door</b> to <b>Door</b> <b>track</b> [...] "Double Trouble". The third single from Door to Door (after the top twenty hit [...] "You Are the Girl" [...] and its less {{successful}} follow-up [...] "Strap Me In"), the song peaked at #74 on the Billboard Hot 100 (a slight improvement from {{the performance of}} [...] "Strap Me In") and #37 on the Adult Contemporary chart. However, unlike its predecessors, it failed to chart {{at all on the}} Mainstream Rock chart. Also it is among the very few songs by the group not to feature a promotional video.|$|R
5000|$|... "Crazy Fingers" [...] sets {{music to}} Hunter's series of haiku. [...] "The Music Never Stopped" [...] began life as [...] "Hollywood Cantata", a Weir-Hunter composition. Weir later used lyrics {{composed}} by his main writing partner, John Barlow. Original credits list [...] "King Solomon's Marbles" [...] and [...] "Stronger than Dirt or Milkin' the Turkey" [...] as individual songs. However later credits list [...] "Stronger than Dirt" [...] and [...] "Milkin' the Turkey" [...] as composed {{in two parts}} and combined to make [...] "King Solomon's Marbles". The first section was so-named by Lesh because, {{like the end of}} the Doors' Touch Me, a four-note cadence was reminiscent of a contemporary advertisement jingle (unlike the <b>Doors</b> <b>track,</b> the Dead did not vocalize the slogan).|$|R

"I like to {{say this}} is the first new <b>Doors</b> <b>track</b> of the 21st century", Ray Manzarek said of a new song he {{recorded}} with Robby Krieger, John Densmore and DJ/producer Skrillex (Sonny Moore). The recording session and song are part of a documentary film, Re:GENERATION, that recruited five popular DJs/producers to work with artists from five separate genres and had them record new music. Manzarek and Skrillex had an immediate musical connection. [...] "Sonny plays his beat, {{all he had to do}} was play the one thing. I listened to it and I said, ‘Holy shit, that's strong,’" [...] Manzarek says. [...] "Basically, it's a variation on ‘Milestones’, by Miles Davis, and if I do say so myself, sounds f**king great, hot as hell." [...] The track, called [...] "Breakn' a Sweat", was included on Skrillex's EP Bangarang.|$|R
