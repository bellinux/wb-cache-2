All {{the little things that}} might have been {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm {{the sort of person who}} wakes up in the morning and needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E
500|$|Like Chapman, Schaefer {{is a fan}} of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, {{and said}} he began the script to try to {{understand}} [...] "how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better, and so much less alone." ...|$|E

No one can realize more than [...] how poor little Johnnie meant to [...] who hardly knew him..." [...] He went on to state [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." [...] In her final mention of John in her diary, Queen Mary wrote simply [...] "miss the dear child very much indeed." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind wrote, [...] "The {{directing}} {{and music}} choices this season on Supernatural have been fantastic; whoever chose the static-like sound {{that was all}} over this episode really outdid themselves, because that fit perfectly. The directing <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more daring and interesting and exciting than in the past; before, {{it seemed like it}} was pretty simple, straightforward work was being done. I'm not putting that down, or at least I don't mean to, but this year <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> different. Perhaps I'm just enjoying the story and the like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> I am being more charitable, but I don't think so. Something is different this year about Supernatural, and I can't quite put my finger on it." ...|$|R
50|$|The song has {{a highly}} unusual {{instrumental}} turn, the whole song is largely built around an electric sitar; that the song <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> like a hit {{comes from the}} surging chorus and Bradfield’s voice delivery. It is the shortest song in the album, it has 3:51. It is also featured as track number 11 in the Forever Delayed compilation by the band.|$|R

500|$|Larter {{appeared}} in Glamour along with fellow actresses Rachel Bilson and Diane Lane in 2007. When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, you get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers praised {{refinements}} of gameplay aspects {{present in}} Path of Radiance, {{such as the}} weapon forging system, which ONM thought was simpler to control in Radiant Dawn. Despite this, other changes, such as those to the support system, were not as welcome, with GameSpot commenting that support conversations [...] "have been reduced to mere battlefield chatter." [...] 1UP's Michael Donahoe praised the game's length and range of characters, but stated that the laguz [...] "still aren't very useful." [...] Although Fire Emblem games have been praised for their plot and characterisation in the past, GameSpot described the story as [...] "laughable" [...] and the game's villains as clichéd and [...] "one-dimensional." [...] Conversely, RPGamer lauded the alterations in perspective by use of different protagonists, which Boulette felt [...] "makes the overall story <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> broader and more expansive in scope." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{youngest}} brother, Prince John, {{died at the}} age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after {{a severe}} seizure. John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as [...] "little more than a regrettable nuisance". He wrote to his mistress of the time that [...] " [...] told [...] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. 's been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." [...] He also wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: [...] "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him... I <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was {{met with}} mainly {{positive}} reviews from contemporary music critics. Lucy Davis from BBC Music wrote that the song [...] "might {{mean a lot to}} some, those with the tiresome self defence lyrics should go [...] when she gets on with the singing, there's nothing to prove". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani deemed [...] "Oh Mother" [...] a [...] "lovely" [...] piano and string melody [...] "that we're offered a reprieve". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic was also positive toward [...] "Oh Mother", commenting that [...] "another ode to her single mother and middle-finger to her abusive father, is yet more proof that Aguilera works best when the subject matter actually means something to her, when the song is more than just something to sing". Spence D. for IGN was positive toward the song's meaning, writing that it [...] "resonates with a bittersweet energy that helps it rise above the standard young pop queen fare of the day". musicOMH's John Murray was not impressed with the song, calling it [...] "good" [...] but saying that it would [...] "just make the bad moments <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> worse". Digital Spy critic Nick Levine provided a negative review, giving it a two out of five stars rating and calling it [...] "tremulous" [...] with a [...] "vibrato-fuelled conclusion". He also compared [...] "Oh Mother" [...] to Madonna's song [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989) for the same sad melody as well as the same theme of child abuse.|$|E
500|$|Ferrier {{spent two}} months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought {{to her at the}} {{hospital}} by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would {{no longer be able to}} negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this [...] "unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better". This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. [...] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was [...] "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".|$|E

5000|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste {{gave the}} episode a 7.9/10, calling it [...] "the best episode {{so far this}} season". He wrote: [...] "The {{strength}} of 'Dr. James Covington' lies {{in its ability to}} not take itself so seriously. It has fun with these dumb, little ideas, and it <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more enjoyable as a show because of it.

That is what my poor father <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> Eleonora is his special darling, and he says he could have overlooked anything but the concealment." ...|$|R
