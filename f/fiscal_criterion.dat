40|$|The Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the {{description}} of the Maastricht criteria, and an analysis of the time period between 1995 to 2015. The work is divided into two chapters. The first chapter describes each of the Maastricht criteria and analyzes the <b>fiscal</b> <b>criterion</b> of sustainability of public debt in select EU Member States (Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy, Ireland, Germany and Greece) during this time, which includes the criteria of public debt and public deficit. The aim is to assess whether these fiscal criteria are met. The last chapter covers further regulatory measures of the Maastricht criteria, like the Stability and Growth Pact, the Euro Plus Pact and the fiscal compact, which addresses their shortcomings...|$|E
40|$|Following their {{accession}} to the European Union, {{new member states}} are now facing {{the next step in}} the integration process: the adoption of the common currency. While there is a relative agreement about the overall benefits of joining the European Monetary Union (EMU), the timing of entry has been subject to significant controversy. A gradual path of accession is often suggested since the contractionary effects of fulfilling the <b>fiscal</b> <b>criterion</b> of the Maastricht Treaty might contradict the objective of real convergence. The author argues against this position by showing that even without EMU entry it is the self-interest of the new member states to pursue policies in accordance with its rules, considerations of competitiveness make the usual options of financing further deficits (inflation, accumulation of debt, or increasing taxes) very costly in terms of long-term growth prospects. Slovenia and the Baltic countries have already recognised this and have achieved a virtuous circle of low deficit, low debt and high growth rates. In contrast, the Visegrád countries are struggling with the fiscal criteria. In their case accession into the euro-zone opens a window of opportunity to introduce reforms, which are conducive to the long-term sustainability of their finances...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{understand}} the impact on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) economy of the objective of reducing its dependence on oil, trying to achieve the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) fiscal convergence criterion and the inevitable depletion of oil resources. Design/methodology/approach - An 18 equation compact macro-econometric model is constructed and is evaluated and calibrated employing dynamic simulation techniques. Optimal control techniques are used to analyze the economic impact of the three objectives listed above. Findings - Each of the optimal control experiments that has been carried out has served to reinforce the fact that the UAE is still critically dependent on oil. An increase in the share of the non-oil sector, adhering to the GCC <b>fiscal</b> <b>criterion</b> and any reduction in oil output production will affect government finances adversely. Research limitations/implications - The macro-econometric model developed is for the UAE and further research is needed to see if the conclusions can be generalized to the other oil exporting countries. Practical implications - The estimated macro-econometric model and the optimal control experiments indicate to the policy makers the need to continue the diversification of the economy and for government to actively explore and enhance non-hydrocarbon sources of revenue. Originality/value - This paper develops a compact macro-econometric model of the UAE and uses optimal control techniques which go well beyond the standard simulation techniques and the routine counter-factual experiments to understand the working of the economy...|$|E

Using bivariate co-integration and error-correction models, this paper investigates the relationship between revenue and expenditure in seven member countries to determine the feasibility {{and nature of the}} policy adjustment required to meet the new convergence criteria.

This consistency is important within a monetary union because fiscal policy is the primary instrument through which national governments can influence macroeconomic performance. We comment on how surveillance might be improved by broadening the region''s current criteria through alternative fiscal indicators, some focus on the scope and nature of external shocks, and attention to the consistency of policies in assuring the viability of the union and its fixed exchange rate regime.

Due to this pressure situation on the sustainability of public finances, examining the adoption, application and enforcement of the fiscal policy rules expressed by the evolution of the Fiscal Rule Index for the period 2000 - 2011, the importance of rules in the fiscal management of the Union and especially of the euro area appears increasingly obvious...|$|R

Our study includes alternative measures of fiscal convergence and employs vastly flexible tests of convergence, allowing for structural breaks. The findings indicate poor progress on convergence in general, and more importantly, we find that the new members are relatively more disciplined than the core and periphery EU members. The results suggest that monetary unions may not provide strong fiscal discipline. We conclude with some suggestions for the pilgrims to improve their fiscal discipline to satisfy the Maastricht criteria...|$|R

40|$|The {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe, despite similarities in their routes towards market {{economy and the}} EU membership, often differed in their choices regarding fiscal policy and the fiscal instruments to be applied while trying to attain their social and economic goals. At the same time, {{the social and economic}} effects of the fiscal measures applied sometimes deviated from the intended ones. Some of the new post-communist members of the European Union have already joined – and others aspire to join – the Eurozone, whose stability depends on compliance with the adopted <b>fiscal</b> <b>criteria.</b> All those developments give rise to questions about the most efficient fiscal solutions available to the national economies in the process of attaining the assumed economic goals. Another question well worth considering is whether in the perspective of further economic integration the nations of the former Eastern Block are capable of continuously meeting the <b>fiscal</b> <b>criteria</b> of such an integration. The recent developments in Greece have demonstrated that even the “old ” EU members may have some problems there, and that such problems affect other members of the European Community. The analysis has demonstrated the risks related to unsound selection of fiscal policy instruments that are run by the {{countries of}} Central and Eastern Europe. The core objective of fiscal policy is attaining a high rate of sustainable economic growth. However, the emerging economies are often tempted to achieve the short-term social objectives. The budget deficit may be utilised to achieve such objectives e. g. to maintain a political consensus. Still, a frequent side effect is an increased public debt...|$|R
25|$|The SGP was {{initially}} proposed by German finance minister Theo Waigel in the mid-1990s. Germany had long maintained a low-inflation policy, {{which had been}} {{an important part of}} the German economy's strong performance since the 1950s. The German government hoped to ensure the continuation of that policy through the SGP, which would ensure the prevalence of fiscal responsibility, and limit the ability of governments to exert inflationary pressures on the European economy. As such, it was also described to be a key tool for the Member States adopting the euro, to ensure that they did not only meet the Maastricht convergence criteria at the time of adopting the euro, but kept on to comply with the <b>fiscal</b> <b>criteria</b> for the following years.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is the fulfillment of the Maastricht convergence criteria by Greece. The first chapter deals with the general characteristics, historical, political and economical development since World War II to the present. The second chapter shows and explains the Maastricht convergence criteria.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} macroeconomic and also some selected structural consequences of the proposed fiscal consolidation necessary for Poland to fulfil the Maastricht <b>fiscal</b> <b>criteria.</b> The <b>fiscal</b> adjustments are assessed with a CGE model simulated over the 2006 – 2008 horizon. Two sets of simulations are analysed, namely rigid vs. flexible wages. It is shown that the fiscal tightening programme analysed in this paper does not necessarily incur any costs in terms of aggregate GDP loss in years 2006 – 2008. On the contrary, it may generate additional growth effects, provided that downward wage adjustments reduce unit labour costs, thus fostering the growth. It is concluded that the condition for the achievement of a smooth and relatively low-cost fiscal adjustment is to supplement it with labour market reform. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the challenges {{for entry into}} EMU set up by Germany {{and the extent to}} which potential members accepted these challenges. Three groups of countries are identified: the core group (D-mark zone), the outsider group (countries not willing to participate), and the convergence group (formerly) unstable countries willing to participate). It is especially the progress towards convergence made by the convergence group and the non-compliance of most countries with the <b>fiscal</b> <b>criteria</b> which leads to uncertainty for the future path of European monetary integration: there is still no consensus on the interpretation of the convergence criteria. Additionally, there is another - maybe even more important - challenge for European monetary integration - the lack of a consensus about the blueprint for economic policy making in an European currency area - centralized versus decentralized, active versus passive monetary and exchange rate policy. ...|$|R

We discuss how {{monetary union}} could affect fiscal discipline and the arguments for explicit fiscal restraints considered in the European Monetary Union literature, and their applicability to West Africa. The empirical evidence, EMU literature, and CFA experience suggest that monetary union could create the temptation for fiscal profligacy through prospects of a bailout, or costs diluted through the membership. Thus, a West African monetary union could promote fiscal discipline only if {{the hands of the}} fiscal authorities are also tied by a strong set of fiscal restraints.

40|$|European Monetary Union {{experiences}} the division into two major blocks {{according to their}} ability to respect <b>fiscal</b> <b>criteria</b> and replace their bonds on the market. The so-called PIIGS countries are asked to hardly reduce their deficit and debt in order to prevent speculative attacks and preserve the Currency Union. The aim of the paper is to show that speculative attacks on government debt are not directly linked to default probability, but to liquidity requirements and to the EU fiscal constraints. In times of crisis the path of deficit/GDP ratio goes up and send the signal that governments are loosening their fiscal stance. As far as there are liquidity constraints, markets increase the spreads and force governments to fiscal retrenchments, hardly increasing the cost of adjustment. The result is that {{in the absence of a}} bailout shared mechanism financial markets give policy prescriptions and exert a political pressure without having fiscal sovereignty. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} socio-economic development and fiscal policy. We introduce an indicator for socio-economic development (SEDI) and investigate its relationship with different fiscal variables, using data for the cohesion countries, namely Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland for 1980 - 1999. We find that an improvement in the net lending position of the government, {{as well as a}} fall in the level of public debt, would be beneficial for socio-economic development in the medium term. Furthermore, fiscal consolidation is found to be more relevant for promoting socio-economic development in the cohesion countries than in the other EU- 15 Member States. Our results provide support for incentives to curb spending, such as the <b>fiscal</b> <b>criteria</b> of the Maastricht Treaty or the Stability and Growth Pact.
