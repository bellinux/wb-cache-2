25|$|Being a {{phosphate}} mineral, turquoise {{is inherently}} fragile and sensitive to solvents; perfume and other cosmetics will attack the finish and may alter the colour of turquoise gems, as will skin oils, as will most commercial jewellery cleaning fluids. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may also discolour or dehydrate turquoise. Care {{should therefore be}} taken when wearing such jewels: cosmetics, including sunscreen and <b>hair</b> <b>spray,</b> should be applied before putting on turquoise jewellery, and {{they should not be}} worn to a beach or other sun-bathed environment. After use, turquoise should be gently cleaned with a soft cloth to avoid a buildup of residue, and should be stored in its own container to avoid scratching by harder gems. Turquoise can also be adversely affected if stored in an airtight container.|$|E
