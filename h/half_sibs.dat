40|$|Extrapair fertilizations (EPFs) {{have been}} found in most {{socially}} monogamous passerine species. EPFs are generally beneficial for males because they increase the number of sired offspring. The benefit accrued by females, however, is less obvious. Maternal benefits may involve fertility insurance, increased genetic variability of the offspring, and improved offspring quality via compatible genes or 'good genes'. In a Hungarian population of the collared flycatcher, we investigated whether the occurrence of extrapair young (EPY) in a brood could be predicted by the traits of the females or their social mates, and whether EPY were superior to their <b>half</b> <b>sibs</b> in terms of growth and. edging condition. We found that 55. 7 % of the broods contained EPY. The females' participation in extrapair copulations (EPCs) was not related to any of the characteristics of their mates (body size, condition, wing and forehead patch size). The EPY did not differ from their <b>half</b> <b>sibs</b> in any measures of offspring quality. The <b>half</b> <b>sibs</b> had similar embryonic and postembryonic growth and. edged with similar body condition. Female body size was related to extrapair paternity: larger females were less likely to produce mixed-paternity broods. This suggests that the role of female traits in EPCs deserves more attention. We also found that male nestlings grew faster than females, although females could catch up by the time of. edging, so we argue that sex-dependent development should be taken into account in studies using nestling growth as a measure of nestling quality.

The variance component method for fine-mapping of QTL {{was used to}} estimate QTL position and variance components. The design of many families with small size gave a higher mapping resolution than a design with few families of large size. However, the difference is small in <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> designs. The proportion of replicates with the QTL positioned within 3 cM of the true position is 0. 71 in the best design, and 0. 68 in the worst design applied to 128 animals with a phenotypic record and a QTL explaining 25 % of the phenotypic variance. The design of two <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> families each of size 64 was further investigated for a hypothetical population with effective size of 1000 simulated for 6000 generations with a marker density of 0. 25 cM and with marker mutation rate 4 × 10 - 4 per generation. In mapping using bi-allelic markers, 42 ~ 55 % of replicated simulations could position QTL within 0. 75 cM of the true position whereas this was higher for multi allelic markers (48 ~ 76 %). The accuracy was lowest (48 %) when mutation age was 100 generations and increased to 68 % and 76 % for mutation ages of 200 and 500 generations, respectively, after which it was about 70 % for mutation ages of 1000 generations and older. When effective size was linearly decreasing in the last 50 generations, the accuracy was decreased (56 to 70 %).

For generating the simulated population in which animals were inferred to genomic polymorphism, we assumed that the number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) were equal with the number of no effect markers.

The accuracies of estimated breeding values by way of indicating correlations between true and estimated breeding values were compared on several cases of marker distances, heritabilities and family sizes.

40|$|Full and <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> covariances were {{investigated}} in an artificial autotetraploid population with random mating in Astragalus sinicus L [...] Since {{a set of}} homologous chromosomes is not necessarily involved in aneuploidy, the covariances must be averaged for two cases, that is, with and without involvement. To average the covariances, {{the probability that a}} set of homologous chromosomes was involved in aneuploidy was assumed as 3 / 8, where “ 8 ” and “ 3 ” represent the chromosome number of a genome and the mean number of quadrivalent chromosomes formed in a euploid, respectively. The covariances were calculated under the assumption that quadrivalent chromosomes were distributed to the poles by 2 - 2 and 1 - 3 with probabilities κ＝ 0. 8 and λ ＝ 0. 2 (κ＋λ＝ 1) respectively, and that trisomic and pentasomic chromosomes were distributed by 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 both with a probability of 1. It was also assumed that the inbreeding coefficient of the parents was F＝ 0, and that 2 x and 2 x＋ 1 pollens and all female gametes could fertilize equally. The covariance of a family was taken as an average of the covariance of each sib combination in a family. As a result, the covariance of a population could be obtained as an average of the covariance of each family in a population. The coefficients of variance components calculated under these assumptions were different from those calculated under the same condition except that 2 x＋ 1 pollen could not fertilize. Differences in the coefficient of additive genetic variance components were about 3. 3 % and 7. 2 % for full and <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> covariances, respectively. Coefficients of the other variance components were also different between the two cases. However, 2 x＋ 1 pollen could rarely fertilize, since their ability to fertilize in a practical population were lower than 2 x pollen.

Wounding by drilling in stems of Scots pine seedlings have been suggested to induce production of pinosylvin and pinosylvin monomethyl ether in xylem of these seedlings which transforms to heartwood on maturity. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the transcripts co-expressed with candidate genes in the stilbene biosynthesis pathway (Ps 4 CL, PsPAL, PsSTS and PsPMT) and their expression patterns, reconstruct a comprehensive transcriptome and decipher the difference between <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> families in the expression of transcripts reacting to the wounding of Scots pine seedlings using the next generation sequence (ABI SOLiD) profiling of RNA (RNA-Seq). Our bioinformatic pipeline involving de novo transcriptome assembly and scaffolding, read mapping and Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis were utilized to analyze this RNA-Seq data and its results were validated with quantitative PCR. The results show that RNA-Seq analysis generated 25, 010 non redundant consensus sequences (representing expressed transcripts) and DGE revealed that the Scots pine seedling transcriptome was altered with up-regulation of 830 EST tags (genes) and down-regulation of 518 EST tags. PsSTS was induced in the wounding experiment while Ps 4 CL, PsPAL and PsPMT appeared to be expressed constitutively.

This {{study investigated the}} prevalence and familial aggregation of endometriosis {{in one of those}} species, the rhesus maca-que. METHODS: Between 1978 and 2001, 142 animals with endometriosis were identi®ed from necropsy and surgi-cal records and through the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, Madison, USA. All cases were used to build one large multigenerational pedigree and nine nuclear families comprising 1602 females in total. By 2002, the pedigrees contained 124 cases diagnosed at necropsy; 17 at surgery and three at MRI. Female animals that had died aged> 10 years without endometriosis, had both ovaries until at least 1 year prior to death, and had a full necropsy, were considered unaffected. RESULTS: The prevalence of endo-metriosis among necropsied animals aged> 10 years in the colony was 31. 4 % [95 % con®dence interval (CI) 26. 9 ± 35. 9 %]; prevalence increased with rising age and calendar age at death. Familial aggregation of endometriosis was strongly suggested by a signi®cantly higher average kinship coef®cient among affecteds compared with unaffecteds (P < 0. 001) and a higher recurrence risk for full sibs (0. 75; 95 % CI 0. 45 ± 1. 0) compared with maternal <b>half</b> <b>sibs</b> (0. 26; 95 % CI 0. 10 ± 0. 41) and paternal <b>half</b> <b>sibs</b> (0. 18; 95 % CI 0. 02 ± 0. 34).

40|$|Research on QTL mapping in {{dairy cattle}} breed-ing {{during the last}} decade has yielded a {{steadily}} growing success as Khatkar et al. (2004) showed in their review and meta analysis. This is true of adapt-ing and developing new approaches and describing statistical-genetic tools for data analyses. However, the way from coarse QTL mapping to finally find-ing the causative gene is still a challenge. The more information is available in the pedigree, the better the results of QTL estimation, mainly in terms of precision of the QTL position. The ability to cope with different characteristics is of vital importance for adapting the right tool. Known simulation stud-ies based on an ideal and well-defined family design with evenly spaced markers (e. g. Sørensen et al., 2003) are efficient for testing the methods in most cases, but they do not usually fit practical condi-tions. Data structure is important for a successful fine mapping study.

40|$|Methods for {{detection}} of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in sheep are discussed. There {{is a reasonable}} coverage of the sheep map with microsatellite markers. Developments in molecular genetic technology have now made available very dense marker maps based on single nucleotide polymorphisms, which will soon be available for sheep. Mapping methods were originally based on linkage analysis, either using crosses of divergent breeds or paternal <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> designs in commercial populations. The size of most QTL experiments {{are too small to}} allow precise estimation of QTL with moderate effects. Fine mapping is based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) and methods using LD information have now been developed for mapping of QTL. LD analysis can be based on a random sample of animals from the population and is less dependent on marker information and designed experiments...|$|R
40|$|Birth weights of 1, 030 Boran calves {{born between}} 1961 and 1979 at Malya Livestock Research Center in Tanzania were {{analysed}} to obtain means and study factors affecting this trait {{over the years}} under study and to estimate correction factors for effect of season and sex of calf. Also determined were heritability estimates from sire and dam components of variance. Last squares mean birth weights for Period I (1963 - 1969) and Period II (1970 - 1979) were 26. 0 ±. 5 and 25. 4 ± 7 respectively. Heritability estimates used on paternal <b>half</b> <b>sibs</b> were 0. 33 ± 0. 12 and 0. 18 ± 0. 13, for periods I and II respectively. Year, season, sire, dam and sex effects were highly significant (...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the effects of β-κ-casein (CN) haplotypes on first-lactation milk production traits. The β-κ-CN haplotypes were deduced using information on β- and κ-CN genotypes of cows and their sires for 16, 973 Finnish Ayrshire cows that had at least nine paternal <b>half</b> <b>sibs.</b> Effects of CN haplo-types on milk production traits were estimated for one haplotype at a time using an animal model, which in-cluded the fixed effects for calving year and month, age at calving, days open, β-lactoglobulin, and a β-κ-CN haplotype. Differences in milk production traits were also estimated between haplotype combinations A 1 A+A 2 B and A 1 B+A 2 A within β-κ-CN genotype A 1 A 2 AB and between combinations A 1 E+A 2 A an...|$|E
40|$|Anhidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia (ED 1) {{is characterized by}} hypotrichosis, reduced number of sweat glands, and incisior anodontia in human, mouse, and cattle. In affected humans and mice, mutations in the ED 1 gene coding for ectodysplasin 1 are found. Ectodysplasin 1 is a novel trimeric transmembrane protein with an extracellular TNF-like signaling domain that {{is believed to be}} involved in the formation of hair follicles and tooth buds during fetal development. We report the construction of a 480 -kb BAC contig harboring the complete bovine ED 1 gene on BTA Xq 22 –Xq 24. Physical mapping and sequence analysis of the coding parts of the ED 1 gene revealed that a large genomic region including exon 3 of the ED 1 gene is deleted in cattle with anhidrotic {{ectodermal dysplasia}} in a family of German Holstein cattle with three affected maternal <b>half</b> <b>sibs...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} possible associations between a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism(SNP) of FASN gene {{and each of the}} following productive traits: Feed Intake (FI), Weight Gain (WG) and FinalBody Weight (FBW). At the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), 229 chickens were organizedand bred in full <b>sib</b> and paternal <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> families, these birds were caged individually with water and fed withpellet ad libitum. Body weight was recorded at 54 days old and then individual feed intake and weight were determined weekly during 21 days. FASN gene genotypes were identified by PCR amplification and digested by endonuclease Hae III. Phenotypical data were analyzed independently by ANOVA with a random Model. The SNP evaluated in this work has not been demonstrated as affecting the considered traits...|$|R
40|$|Genotypic {{data for}} 56 {{microsatellites}} (ms) generated from maternal full sib families nested within paternal <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> pedigrees {{were used to}} construct a linkage map of the bovine X Chromosome (Chr) (BTX) that spans 150 cM (ave. interval 2. 7 cM). The linkage map contains 36 previously unlinked ms; seven generated from a BTXp library. Genotypic data from these 36 ms was merged into an existing linkage map to {{more than double the}} number of informative BTX markers. A male specific linkage map of the pseudoautosomal region was also constructed from five ms at the distal end of BTXq. Four informative probes physically assigned by fluorescence in situ hybridization defined the extent of coverage, confirmed the position of the pseudoautosomal region on the q-arm, and identified a 4. 1 -cM marker interval containing the centromere of BTX...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to reveal causes of {{variation}} in carcass traits of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). During slaughtering of one year class Atlantic salmon, composed of <b>half</b> <b>sib</b> and full sib groups, samples for determination of carotenoid levels in flesh and ovaries were collected. Also the hepatosomatic and viscerosomatic indexes as well as relative visceral fat content were determined. As expected it was found that these traits were influenced by several factors. The material is too limited for firm conclusions, but evidently the carotenoid level depends largely on stage of maturity and possibly also on genetic factors. Genetic factors seem to influence the visceral fat content. In hepatosomatic and visceral indexes, and possibly in visceral fat content, a strange and still unexplained interaction between sex and stage of maturation was observed...|$|R
