5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store <b>information</b> <b>such</b> as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day.

5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. This {{could be achieved}} by writing an allocator that allocates extra memory in which it places debugging <b>information.</b> <b>Such</b> an allocator {{could be used to}} ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated by the same type of allocator, and also provide limited protection against overruns.|$|E

5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old.

5|$|Dirge of Cerberus is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} third-person shooter. Battles occur in real-time, with the HUD displaying <b>information</b> <b>such</b> as Vincent's hit points and magic points, the currently selected item and quantity thereof, and a cross-hair {{to aid in}} targeting enemies. The action is viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, {{and at the end}} of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful <b>information</b> <b>such</b> as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E

5|$|Smyth was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} report by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them. It also served as an indication as to what information was declassified; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on <b>information,</b> <b>such</b> as basic nuclear physics, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily deducible by a competent scientist, and omitted details about chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics.|$|E
5|$|Stations {{are divided}} into two areas, paid and unpaid, which allow the rail {{operators}} to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as access control gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store <b>information</b> <b>such</b> as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to buy additional value for stored-value tickets. Tickets for single trips, coloured in green, are valid only {{on the day of}} purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time. Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit.|$|E

Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio.

5|$|The First Folio text of 1623 {{was based}} {{primarily}} on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt book or Q1. Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4). Modern versions—that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos—first appeared with Nicholas Rowe's 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope's 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add <b>information</b> <b>such</b> as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions {{first appeared in the}} Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Partners in Time, with {{an emphasis}} on role-playing games elements and co-operative puzzle solving, {{is similar to that of}} its predecessor, although gameplay differences exist between the games.
