5|$|The assassinations of Aurelian and Probus {{demonstrated}} that sole rulership was {{dangerous to the}} stability of the empire. Conflict boiled in every province, from Gaul to Syria, <b>Egypt</b> <b>to</b> the lower Danube. It was too much for one person to control, and Diocletian needed a lieutenant. At some time in 285 at Mediolanum (Milan), Diocletian raised his fellow-officer Maximian to the office of caesar, making him co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|The main {{innovation}} of {{the pyramid}} of Unas is the first appearance of the Pyramid Texts, {{one of the oldest}} religious texts in <b>Egypt</b> <b>to</b> have survived to this day.

5|$|Although about 300 French knights {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} Holy Land, no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to <b>Egypt</b> <b>to</b> plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil {{by the middle of}} 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.|$|E

The delegation, concerned primarily {{with the release of}} the imprisoned Jews of Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that {{it was an act of}} justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.|$|E

During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from <b>Egypt</b> <b>to</b> augment their breeding programs.|$|E

50|$|According to apologists, a more {{thorough}} examination of the surrounding text suggests that Jeremiah is stating that no refugees who flee <b>to</b> <b>Egypt</b> would return <b>to</b> Israel except for few fugitives.

5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to {{the large numbers of}} peasants who were either deported to <b>Egypt</b> <b>to</b> work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages and farms to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E

In taking Tjaru he cut off all traffic between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from help or supplies coming from Canaan.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture and}} monuments of ancient Egypt {{have left a}} lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.

Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view {{as a place of}} mystery.|$|E
