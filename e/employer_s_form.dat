40|$|Multiple {{molecular}} {{forms of}} acetylcholinesterase from electric organ and electric lobe of Torpedo marmorata were examined at various developmental stages by sucrose density sedimentation. Four major forms {{were characterized by}} their apparent sedimentation coefficients of 6 S, 11 S, 13 S, and 17 S. Embryonic lobe possessed at early stages predominantly the 11 <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> With maturation the 17 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> became the most abundant. The early embryonic stages of the electric organ were characterized by predominating amounts of 6 S and 11 <b>S</b> <b>forms.</b> With differentiation of the postsynaptic membrane of the developing electrocytes, 13 S and 17 <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> replaced the slower−sedimenting forms. Concomitant {{with the formation of}} synaptic contacts, a transient increase in the 13 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> was followed by a dramatic accumulation of rapid−sedimenting 17 <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> The establishment of fully functional synapses was accompanied by an increase in the amount of the hydrophobic 6 <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> At birth, equal amounts of 6 S and 17 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> were found, with the other forms present in only trace amounts.

40|$|In various {{permissive}} monkey {{cell lines}} infected with simian virus 40 {{there are two}} major forms of large T antigen which differ in their rate of sedimentation through sucrose gradients. The lighter (5 to 7 <b>S)</b> <b>form</b> sedimented slightly more rapidly than the 4 S tRNA marker, whereas the heavier (16 <b>S)</b> <b>form</b> sedimented slightly more slowly than the 18 S rRNA marker. The small t antigen did not form complexes which sedimented as rapidly as those formed by the large T antigen. The 16 <b>S</b> T antigen <b>form</b> was converted to the slowly sedimenting 5 to 7 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> in the presence of 1. 0 M NaCl. The majority of large T antigen synthesized in cell-free protein-synthesizing systems primed by mRNA isolated from infected cells sedimented as the 5 to 7 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> even when premixed with excess quantities of cellular T antigen. The formation of the 16 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> in infected cells did not require ongoing viral or cellular DNA replication because considerable quantities of this T antigen class were produced in the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitors, such as cytosine arabinoside. Both 5 to 7 S and 16 <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> could be isolated separately and, therefore, each could be analyzed as to its individual properties. The 5 to 7 <b>S</b> T antigen <b>form</b> bound more efficiently and tightly to DNA and had specific affinity for sequences at the viral origin of replication, whereas the 16 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> bound less efficiently to DNA and exhibited very little specificity for origin-containing DNA sequences.

40|$|In the cercarial and schistosomal {{stages of}} the life cycle of the {{trematode}} Schistosoma mansoni, acetylcholinesterase occurs as two principal molecular forms (both globular), present in approximately equal amounts, with sedimentation coefficients of 6. 5 S and 8 S. The 6. 5 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> is solubilized by bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from intact schistosomula. It is thus located on the outer surface of the schistosomal tegument and is most probably analogous to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored G(2) form of acetylcholinesterase found in the electric organ of Torpedo, on the surface of mammalian erythrocytes, and elsewhere. Both forms are fully solubilized by the non-ionic detergent Triton X- 100. Upon passing such a detergent extract over a heparin-Sepharose column, only the 8 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> was retained on the column. The bound acetylcholinesterase could be progressively eluted by increasing the salt concentration, with approx. 0. 5 - 0. 6 M NaCl being needed for complete elution. Selective inhibition experiments carried out on live parasites using the covalent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor echothiophate (phospholine), which does not penetrate the tegument, selectively inhibited the 6. 5 <b>S</b> <b>form,</b> but not the 8 <b>S</b> <b>form,</b> suggesting an internal location for the latter.

40|$|The binding protein for 15 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25 -OH-D 3) was {{isolated}} from chick serum. The molecular weight was 60, 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, without {{the existence of}} sub-units. Its sedimentation coefficient was 4. 3 S. The isoelectric points of the major and minor components were 6. 1 and 5. 9, respectively. Addition of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 causes an anodal shift in the isoelectric point of the two forms of the binding protein. Heating at 60 degrees C slowly destroys the binding protein but the addition of vitamin D metabolites increases its thermostability. The binding protein has probably a single binding site for all vitamin D metabolites and its association constant for 25 -OH-D 3 at 4 degrees C and pH 7. 4 is 10 (9) M- 1. The same affinity is found for 24, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 but 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 have a 3 - and 10 -fold lower affinity, respectively. The amino acid composition {{is very similar to}} that of the human and rat binding protein.

Chick plasma contains virtually only a 4 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> of the 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 -binding protein but partially hemolyzed chick serum also contains a 6 <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> Addition of pure actin to chick plasma or serum converts all 4 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> to the 6 <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> The serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 -binding protein is thus heterogenous since it exists in two 4 <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> (with different pI) and a 6 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> (complexed with actin).

Adsorption kinetics at the air/water interface were followed with an automated drop tensiometer (ADT) and ellipsometer. The changes in surface concentration, surface pressure, dilational modulus and layer thickness were determined. At acidic pH where glycinin is in the 3 S/ 7 <b>S</b> <b>form,</b> it adsorbs much faster at the air/water interface giving a higher surface concentration and a higher dilational modulus than at pH 6. 7 (where glycinin is in the 11 <b>S</b> <b>form).</b> Surface shear viscosity measurements showed that after short ageing times glycinin gives a protein network that is much more resistant to deformation in shear at pH 3 than at pH 6. 7. After ageing for 24 h, the surface shear viscosity {{is about the same}} at both pH. Foaming experiments failed to give a glycinin stabilised foam at pH 6. 7 while at pH 3 glycinin behaves as a good foaming agent. All results indicate that changing the pH influences the conformation of glycinin and that this has a great impact on the interfacial rheological properties and foaming properties.

(Diptera: Culicidae), its M and <b>S</b> <b>forms,</b> and Anopheles arabiensis among and within larval breeding habitats in Banambani, Mali were investigated under varying conditions of {{water quality and}} rainfall. The intent was to elucidate on niche partitioning of these taxa. Methods Immatures of An. arabiensis, An. gambiae s. s., and its M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> were sampled every alternate day for a month in mid-rainy season from three sampling sites {{in each of the}} larval breeding habitats (rock pools, swamp, and puddles). Water quality was characterized by alkalinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (D. O.), nitrate, orthophosphate, pH, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity. A type 3 analysis of the GENMOD model was used to examine the {{associations between}} the proportional frequencies of young (first and second instar larvae) and old (third and fourth instar larvae and pupae) or total immatures of species or forms among sampling sites within and among larval breeding habitats during a category of rainfall as influenced by water quality. Results Of the 4, 174 immatures sampled, 1, 300 were molecularly identified to species and forms. Significant association between the proportional frequencies of young larvae of An. arabiensis, An. gambiae s. s., its M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> was found among sampling sites within habitats but not among larval breeding habitats. The proportional frequencies of young larvae of M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> varied daily perhaps due to recruitment, mortality, and dispersal within habitats. Conductivity and TDS had significant effects when the proportional frequencies of young larvae of M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> among sampling sites within habitats were significantly associated. Alkalinity, D. O., orthophosphate, pH, nitrate, temperature and turbidity had no effects on niche partitioning of species and forms among sampling sites within habitats. Rainfall did not affect the frequencies of these immatures.

The specific activity of DNA binding was greatest for the 5 S and 7 S subclasses and least for the 14 S subclass. Moreover, the specific activity of the 5 S and 7 S subclasses increased sharply at about 40 h after infection, whereas the activity of the 14 S subclass was maintained at a constant low level throughout infection.

We had shown that arylsulfatase C actually consists of two biochemically distinct isozymes, s and f. Only the <b>s</b> <b>form</b> has steroid sulfatase activity. The f and <b>s</b> <b>forms</b> were thought to be related through posttranslational or posttranscriptional modification of the same gene product. In part consistent with this hypothesis, we now report that in a panel of 28 rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, expression of both s and f was concordant only with the human X chromosome, thus showing that the f form is also X linked. In three separate somatic hybrids containing human X chromosomes in an inactive state, the f form was still expressed. Thus, similar to the <b>s</b> <b>form,</b> the f form also escapes from X inactivation. However, contrary to expectations, the <b>s</b> and f <b>forms</b> were not related by posttranslational modification of the same gene product. A full-length cDNA for the <b>s</b> <b>form</b> failed to hybridize to transcripts produced from an f-expressing cell line, showing that there is little sequence identity between the two. They are also not related by differential splicing of a common primary transcript, since fibroblasts from some patients with steroid sulfatase deficiency due to gene deletion of the <b>s</b> <b>form</b> continue to express the f form. Therefore, although the f and s isozymes of arylsulfatase C are X linked and escape from X inactivation, they are products from separate genes, thus providing a unique isoenzyme system to study possible gene duplication and regulation in the part of the human X chromosome that escapes inactivation...|$|R

Pulse-chase experiments suggested that the 5 to 6 S large T antigen is a precursor of the more stable, faster-sedimenting forms of T antigen. Monkey cells infected with a tsA mutant of simian virus 40 at 41 degrees C contained only 5 to 6 S large T antigen, implying that this form is not active in the initiation of simian virus 40 DNA replication. In pulse-chase, shift-down experiments, DNA replication resumed, and the 5 to 6 S large T antigen which had accumulated at 41 degrees C was partially converted at 33 degrees C to a fast-sedimenting form. However, shift-up experiments demonstrated that the fast-sedimenting large T antigen, once formed, remained stable at 41 degrees C, although it was unable to function in initiation.

Binding of macromolecular C 1 was shown by fixation and transfer tests and by C 4 consumption. C 1 fixation and transfer tests provide evidence that C 1 and C 1 q were bound more tightly to the Re form than to the <b>S</b> <b>form.</b> At physiological ionic strength, all cell-bound molecules were released from the <b>S</b> <b>form,</b> whereas at least 60 % remained on the cell surface of the Re form.

In the present study, we explored physiological and developmental trade-offs at play in laboratory colonies and field populations of the M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> that originated from an area of sympatry in Burkina Faso, where M and S larvae exhibit such habitat segregation. In the laboratory, larvae of the M form developed slower than the <b>S</b> <b>form</b> (mean values 9. 51 and 8. 85 days, respectively, Wilcoxon's test, P < 0. 001). Although wing length and dry weight at emergence showed large variations, M females were on average 8 % heavier than S females of similar wing length. Higher nutritional reserves (proteins and lipids) in teneral adults explained part of this weight difference, reflecting a better ability of the M form to garner resources at the larval stage. Furthermore, a higher rate of ovarian maturation was observed in the M form after a single bloodmeal. The relevance of these findings for parasite transmission is discussed...|$|R
40|$|An oestradiol-binding {{macromolecule}} {{was observed}} in the left Müllerian duct of the 15 -day female chick embryo. The embryonic receptor binds oestradiol with a high affinity and low capacity, having a Kd of 3. 2 X 10 (- 9) M and a maximal number of sites of 5. 45 fmol/ 10 (6) cells in the left Müllerian duct. The receptor is protein in nature, as suggested by its susceptibility to proteolysis; in addition, it is organ- and steroid-specific. Judging by glycerol-gradient analysis, the hormone receptors in the cytosol are present in 8 S and 4. 5 <b>S</b> <b>forms,</b> and the 8 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> could be dissociated into a 4. 5 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 M-KCl. A 4. 5 - 6 S receptor could be extracted from the nuclei. Under physiological salt conditions, the embryonic receptors bind to DNA-cellulose and can be eluted when the salt concentration is increased to 0. 5 M-KCl. Determination by isoelectric focusing indicates that the isoelectric point is 5. 8 for the 8 S and 6. 9 for the 4. 5 S receptor...|$|R
40|$|The Ghanaian National Malaria Control Programme has {{prioritized}} insecticide-treated {{materials as}} a key strategy for malaria control. We report on {{a survey of the}} distribution of the molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) and insecticide resistance (the kdr mutation), carried out by sampling mosquitoes from 11 locations in Ghana and one additional site in Burkina Faso. The molecular M and <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> of An. gambiae were found to occur in sympatry in southern Ghana. The <b>S</b> <b>form</b> predominated throughout its distribution in the coastal savannah, except at one location in the strand and mangrove zone where rice was cultivated. The M form was the only form collected in northern Ghana and was the predominant form (97. 5 %) in Burkina Faso. No M/S hybrids were detected. The kdr mutation was observed at very high frequencies (98 - 100 %) within the <b>S</b> <b>form</b> but reached a maximum of only 3. 38 % in the M form in one population at an irrigation scheme in the Ghanaian coastal savannah zone...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND In {{the city}} of Yaoundé in Cameroon malaria is predominately {{transmitted}} by the M and <b>S</b> molecular <b>forms</b> of Anopheles gambiae and both are resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides and DDT. Mutations in the target site of these insecticides, present at a high frequency in malaria vectors in this city, contribute to this resistance profile. To identify additional resistance mechanisms, the expression profile of multiple DDT-resistant field populations of M and <b>S</b> molecular <b>forms</b> was compared to laboratory-susceptible populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The prevalence of DDT resistance was highest in the <b>S</b> <b>form</b> population originating from the cultivated site of Nkolondom (mortality after WHO bioassay =  4...|$|R
40|$|Three {{molecular}} {{forms of}} acetylcholinesterase can be isolated by velocity sedimentation from extracts of electric organ from Torpedo marmorata. Their apparent sedimentation coefficients are 6 S, 13 S and 17 S. Characteristic differences are found {{with regard to}} their solubilization properties. The 13 S and 17 <b>S</b> <b>forms</b> are extracted only in the presence of high salt concentrations. At low ionic conditions {{only a fraction of the}} 6 <b>S</b> <b>form</b> is solubilized. Quantitative recovery of this form can be achieved in the presence of Triton X− 100 at concentrations of 0. 5 − 1 %. The relative ratio of the various forms changes during the development of the fis...|$|R
