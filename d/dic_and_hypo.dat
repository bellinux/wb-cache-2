40|$|Background Individuals {{diagnosed}} with bipolar 1 disorder (BP 1), bipolar 2 disorder (BP 2), or {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD) experience varying levels of depressive <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms. Clarifying symptom heterogeneity is meaningful, as even subthreshold symptoms may impact {{quality of life and}} treatment outcome. The MOODS Lifetime self-report instrument was designed to capture the full range of depressive <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> manic characteristics. Methods This study applied clustering methods to 347 currently depressed adults with MDD, BP 2, or BP 1 to reveal naturally occurring MOODS subgroups. Subgroups were then compared on baseline clinical and demographic characteristics and as well as depressive <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms over twenty weeks of treatment. Results Four subgroups were identified: (1) high depressive <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms (N= 77, 22 %), (2) moderate depressive <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms (N= 115, 33 %), (3) low depressive <b>and</b> moderate (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms (N= 82, 24 %), and (4) low depressive <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms (N= 73, 21 %). Individuals in the low depressive/moderate (hypo) manic subgroup had poorer quality of life and greater depressive symptoms over the course of treatment. Individuals in the high and moderate severity subgroups had greater substance use, longer duration of illness, <b>and</b> greater (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms throughout treatment. Treatment outcomes were primarily driven by individuals {{diagnosed with}} MDD. Limitations The sample was drawn from three randomized clinical trials. Validation is required for this exploratory study. Conclusions After validation, these subgroups may inform classification and personalized treatment beyond categorical diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Background. Previous work {{suggests}} that subthreshold depression <b>and</b> Subthreshold (<b>hypo)</b> mania are common, although {{little is known}} about the prognosis in terms of transition to clinical disorder. This paper presents data on the temporal relationship between subthreshold and clinical expression of mood phenotypes. Method. In a random general population sample of 7076 individuals, symptoms of depression <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> mania were measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) at baseline, after 1 year, and 2 years later. Results. At baseline, the lifetime prevalences of depressive <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> manic symptoms were 17 (.) 2 % and 1 (.) 2 % respectively. Predictive values of mood symptoms for a DSM-III-R mood disorder ranged from 14 (.) 3 % to 50 %. (Hypo) manic mood symptoms had much higher predictive values than unipolar manifestations, not only for bipolar disorder but also for major depression. Conclusions. The subthreshold expressions of depression <b>and</b> (<b>hypo)</b> mania are prevalent and continuous with more severe clinical states. The cross-prediction of mood symptoms may Support a continuum from depressive to (hypo) manic symptoms. The high predictive value of (hypo) manic symptoms for mood disorders {{suggests that}} the experience of (hypo) manic symptoms is a stronger indicator of vulnerability for mood dysregulation than the experience of depressive symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} in the inorganic carbon system in the Pearl River estuary are examined {{based on data from}} five surveys during the spring, summer, fall, and winter seasons. Both total dissolved inorganic carbon (<b>DIC)</b> <b>and</b> total alkalinity (TAlk) values in the freshwater end-members are high in the dry season (> 2700 mu mol kg(- 1) for <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> > 2400 mu mol kg(- 1) for TAlk) and substantially lower in the wet season (<b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> TAlk were similar to 1000 and 700 mu mol kg(- 1), respectively). Riverine <b>DIC</b> flux <b>and</b> drainage basin weathering rates, however, are significantly higher in the wet season (611 x 10 (9) mol yr(- 1) and 13. 6 x 10 (5) mol km(- 2) yr(- 1)) than in the dry season (237 x 10 (9) mol yr(- 1) and 5. 3 x 10 (5) mol km(- 2) yr(- 1)). in the estuarine mixing zone, <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> TAlk are generally conservative at salinities > 5, while in the low-salinity zone the carbonate system shows a much more complex distribution pattern. In the dry season, <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> TAlk show a decreasing pattern with salinity, while they have an increasing pattern in the wet season. This complex behavior is mainly a result of mixing between tributaries with distinct <b>and</b> seasonally variable <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> TAlk values. Distributions of inorganic carbon parameters, in particular pH and pCO(2), are however noticeably modified by local acid-generating biogeochemical processes in the upper estuary. Processes such as nitrification increase acidity during the dry season when freshwater discharge is low and NH 4 +-rich pollutant discharge from the neighboring metropolitan areas is relatively high.

However, plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels are normal or decreased in Hyper, <b>and</b> increased in <b>Hypo.</b> As yet cardiac sympathetic activities (CSA) in Hyper <b>and</b> <b>Hypo</b> {{have not been}} clarified. To evaluate CSA in patients with Hyper <b>and</b> <b>Hypo,</b> 9 patients with Hyper, 8 patients with <b>Hypo</b> before therapy <b>and</b> 10 normal control patients underwent 123 Imetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. Planar images were taken at 15 minutes and 4 hours after injection of MIBG.

Plasma NE was also measured, and echocardiography (UCG) was performed in all patients. Those patients with Hyper <b>and</b> <b>Hypo</b> in the euthyroid state after medical therapy were also evaluated in a similar manner. Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by UCG was not significantly different between the groups. In Hyper patients, NE, MU and MC did not differ, compared to controls, however MU increased after therapy. In contrast in <b>Hypo,</b> NE, MU <b>and</b> MC were significantly higher compared to controls and all parameters decreased after therapy. Before therapy MC was well correlated with NE in Hypo (r= 0. 86), therefore we conclude that CSA is inhibited in Hyper patients, but increased in Hypo patients...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHere we use {{observations}} and ocean models to identify mechanisms driving large seasonal to interannual variations in {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (<b>DIC)</b> <b>and</b> dissolved oxygen (O 2) in the upper ocean. We begin with observations linking variations in upper ocean <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> O 2 inventories with changes in the physical state of the ocean. Models are subsequently used to address {{the extent to which}} the relationships derived from short‐timescale (6 months to 2 years) repeat measurements are representative of variations over larger spatial and temporal scales. The main new result is that convergence and divergence (column stretching) attributed to baroclinic Rossby waves can make a first‐order contribution to <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> O 2 variability in the upper ocean. This results in a close correspondence between natural variations in <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> O 2 column inventory variations and sea surface height (SSH) variations over much of the ocean. Oceanic Rossby wave activity is an intrinsic part of the natural variability in the climate system and is elevated even in the absence of significant interannual variability in climate mode indices. The close correspondence between SSH <b>and</b> both <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> O 2 column inventories for many regions suggests that SSH changes (inferred from satellite altimetry) may prove useful in reducing uncertainty in separating natural <b>and</b> anthropogenic <b>DIC</b> signals (using measurements from Climate Variability and Predictability's CO 2 /Repeat Hydrography program) ...|$|R

40|$|To verify if {{the entity}} of the peak GH {{responses}} to the GHRH+arginine (ARG) test is able to show different degree forms of GH deficiency (GHD), we linked these responses {{with the number of}} other anterior pituitary deficits. These anterior pituitary deficits were also related with IGF-I levels. To this purpose, we studied a large cohort of lean patients with pituitary disease of different etiologies [86 males and 68 females; age: mean +/- SEM 41. 5 +/- 1. 2 yr, body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m 2]. The patients were subdivided into 4 groups according to the increasing number of hormone deficiencies: isolated GHD (HYPO 1, no. = 28) or GHD plus one, two or three additional hormones (gonadotrophin, ACTH, <b>and</b> TSH) deficiencies (<b>HYPO</b> 2, no. = 20; HYPO 3, no. = 15; HYPO 4, no. = 91). Peak GH {{responses to the}} GHRH+ARG test and IGF-I levels showed a clear difference among the groups (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 001, respectively). A significant difference was found between <b>HYPO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>HYPO</b> 4 for IGF-I levels (p < 0. 05), <b>and</b> between <b>HYPO</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>HYPO</b> 4 <b>and</b> between <b>HYPO</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>HYPO</b> 4 for the GHRH+ARG test (p < 0. 005). Considering only the patients who underwent both GHRH+ARG test and insulin tolerance test (ITT) (no. = 70), the pattern of the peak GH responses to the GHRH+ARG test was the same of the whole group of patients, while no statistical difference was found with ITT. Our data show that the peak GH responses to the GHRH+ARG test and the IGF-I levels are linked to the severity of hypopituitarism, expressed by the number of increasing anterior pituitary deficits. This association is lost if the evaluation of the GH status is performed by the ITT. In all, the GHRH+ARG test and measurement of IGF-I are able to evidence different degrees of GHD in adult patients with pituitary disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{stoichiometry}} of dissolved {{inorganic carbon}} (<b>DIC)</b> <b>and</b> nutrients during biological uptake is widely as-sumed to follow the Redfield ratios (especially the C / N ra-tio) in large river plume ecosystems. However, this assump-tion has not been systematically examined <b>and</b> documented, because <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> nutrients are rarely studied simultaneously in river plume areas and interpretation of ratios can be con-founded by strong river–ocean mixing as well as intense bi-ological activity. We examined stoichiometric ratios of <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> nutrients (NO− 3, PO 3 − 4 and Si[OH] 4) in the Mississippi River plume and adjacent continental shelf in June 2003 and August 2004 and calculated biological removal as the differ-ence between observed concentrations and those predicted from conservative mixing, as determined from a multi-end-member mixing model and observed salinity and total alka...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the carbon cycle in Lake Washington {{for the year}} 1980 using monthly measurements of the dissolved inorganic carbon (<b>DIC)</b> <b>and</b> its 13 C: r 2 C isotopic composition. Mass balances of <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> its 13 C: 12 C yield estimates of CO, gas exchange rates and net organic carbon production rates. Between 24 June and 13 August, the calculated CO, gas invasion rate of 0. 80 x lo 6 mol C d-l is nearly equal to the river DIC inflow rate. The calculated epilimnetic net organic carbon production rate is 0. 68 x lo 6 mol C d-l, about 20 - 30 % of primary productivity estimated from 14 C-fixation experiments and ETS-derived respiration rates. Metalimnetic <b>and</b> hypolimnetic <b>DIC</b> increase rates <b>and</b> porewater <b>DIC</b> gradients in hypolimnetic sediments indicate that remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) previously deposited in the sediments is a major (0. 5 x lo 6 mol C d-l) DIC source to the lake during summer.

On the seasonal scale, the NASPG is characterized by higher δ 13 C DIC values during summer than during winter with seasonal amplitude of 0. 77 ‰.

Moreover, we quantify the separate contributions of T, <b>DIC,</b> <b>and</b> TA changes to winter-to-summertime differences in pH, which are in the ranges of − 0. 0334 to − 0. 1237, 0. 0178 to 0. 1169, and − 0. 0063 to 0. 0234, respectively. The effects of <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> temperature are therefore largely compensatory, and are slightly tempered by changes in TA.
