5000|$|An English {{traveller}} of the 1830s has beautifully {{written that}} Ramgarh is singularly striking {{and seems to}} give reality to a vision drawn from eastern romance. The buildings are all constructed from <b>kunkur</b> gravel grey hardpan, …numerous handsome houses of the seths businessmen {{some of which are}} on a magnificent scale, ornamented and painted in various devices outwardly; the neat high wall and gateways and the cupolard chhutrees cenotaphs in the suburb in contrast with the desert around, altogether exhibit a scene deserving to be allied with enchantment." [...] But that was more than {{a century and a half}} back. Now the town clearly shows signs of aging. However, that doesn’t make Ramgarh less interesting; old is beautiful. and in any case, Ramgarh boasts of more paintings than any other town in Shekhawati.. Ramgarh was one of the richest towns of India till the 19th century and has most beautiful structures like opulent Havelies, Cenotaph(Chatri), Temples etc. which gives great example of ancient art and architect of India. But Ramgarh losing these beautiful structures due to many reasons, to save them and create an awareness a website http://www.ramgarhshekhawati.com/ created, which surly helps to save them.|$|E
30|$|In {{the late}} 1970 s, {{a group of}} {{residential}} remains of the Yangshao Period were discovered at the Dadiwan site in Qin’an County, Gansu Province, China [1]. One of these discoveries is named as “original palace” (number F- 901) in the archaeological world, and is the largest and top leveled residential site in prehistoric times. This site belongs to the middle Yangshao Period and was used for convocation, worshiping and religious ceremonies by tribes or tribe allies over 5000  years ago. When it was discovered, the site had a bright and clean house floor that was of exquisite workmanship. Preliminary research [2] indicates that the housing floor of the site was made by lightweight calcined <b>Kunkur</b> as aggregate and the powder of calcined ginger nut mixed {{with a small amount}} of laterite as bonding materials. After more than five thousand years, the compressive resistance of the floor is close to that of cement mortar No. 100. Moreover, the remains of kilns for burning light weight concrete and ginger nut were discovered nearby the site. The research shows that the calcinated temperature of ginger nut could reach up to 900 °C [3]. Ginger nut is a type of ginger stone (locally called as ginger nut) in quaternary loess and is composed of 60 - 80 % calcium carbonate and 10 - 20 % clay mineral. When ginger nut is calcinated at a temperature of 900 °C, it will produce 25.8 % β-CaSiO 3, 17.6 % Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 and 33.9 % CaO. β-CaSiO 3 and Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 are hydraulic binding materials, and CaO is a non-hydraulic binding material [4]. Therefore, the building materials of F- 901 floor in which manmade hydraulic binding materials had been used can be called as the earliest “concrete” in the world, which is a miracle in the history of architecture [3].|$|E
