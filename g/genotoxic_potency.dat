The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the blood dose after styrene exposure and to compare the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of styrene 7, 8 -oxide and g radiation in order to calculate the cancer risk by means of the rad-equivalence approach. Leucocytes of 20 individuals were exposed to 0, 0. 1, 0. 2 or 0. 3 mM styrene 7, 8 -oxide (1 h) or 1, 2 or 3 gray (5100, 200, 300 rad) g radiation. Genotoxicity was evaluated with the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Comparison of the two slopes of the regression lines between micronuclei and dose revealed a <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> for styrene 7, 8 -oxide of 37 rad/mMh, corresponding with a median value derived from mutagenicity studies (1, 37, 208 rad/mMh).

Nineteen chemicals covering {{a broad spectrum of}} genotoxic modes of action were tested in an in vitro MN test using TK 6 cells using the same study protocol. Several of these chemicals were considered to need metabolic activation, and these were administered in the presence of S 9. The Benchmark dose (BMD) approach was applied using the dose-response modeling program PROAST to estimate the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> from the in vitro data. The resulting in vitro BMDs were compared with previously derived BMDs from in vivo MN and carcinogenicity studies. A proportional correlation was observed between the BMDs from the in vitro MN and the BMDs from the in vivo MN assays. Further, a clear correlation was found between the BMDs from in vitro MN and the associated BMDs for malignant tumors. Although these results are based on only 19 compounds, they show that genotoxicity potencies estimated from in vitro tests may result in useful information regarding in vivo <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency,</b> as well as expected cancer potency. Extension of the number of compounds and further investigation of metabolic activation (S 9) and of other toxicokinetic factors would be needed to validate our initial conclusions.

" This remark gives us a starting point for the discussion of the purposes of measuring macromolecule adducts that originate from electrophilic compounds or metabolites in humans and animals. Historically, methods for adduct monitoring were developed as a means of determining target doses that, combined with measurements of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potencies,</b> could be used for risk assessment. With mass spectrometric methods, adducts can be quantified at levels that are thousands of times lower than those in which the cancer incidence associated with this exposure is detectable in disease-epidemiological studies. Furthermore, mass spectrometric techniques permit identification of the chemical structure of the adduct, particularly in the case of hemoglobin adducts. Adduct measurement therefore constitutes not only a means of risk estimation but it may be used as a complement of disease epidemiology in situations in which, for statistical reasons, the risk is too low to be detectable [...] which does not signify that the risk is acceptably low.

Combustion sources are most significant contributors to the urban air pollution. So far, toxicological research has focused predominantly on combustion generated particulate matter, thereby neglecting chemical complexity of combustion exhausts. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess toxic potential of ethylene combustion condensates, containing both particulate and gaseous combustion by-products, by means of a recombinant bacterial assay called the SWITCH (Salmonella Weighting of Induced Toxicity (Genotoxicity) and Cytotoxicity for Human Health) test. Thereby, the suitability of total organic carbon (TOC) as a parameter for toxicity assessment was also investigated. Ethylene was combusted in a low-pressure burner under controlled laboratory conditions by only varying the carbon/ oxygen ratio (C/O = 0. 63 – 0. 93). Ethylene combustion condensates were generated by drawing 10 l of combustion exhaust at constant flow rate (0. 4 l/min) and collecting it in condensated form in glass bottles cooled by liquid nitrogen. <b>Genotoxic</b> and cytotoxic <b>potency</b> of combustion condensates was analyzed with the SWITCH test, based on sequential measurements of luminescence, absorbance and fluorescence outputs of treated bacterial cultures. Our results show correlation between TOC content of combustion condensates and their genotoxicity/cytotoxicity. Moreover, combustion condensates of same TOC concentration exert the same toxic effect regardless of the used C/O ratios during their generation. Our results revealed that toxicologically relevant component(s) of the ethylene combustion exhausts is/are being produced during highly, mildly and non-sooting combustion conditions, only in different proportions.

40|$|The large {{majority}} of studies on the genotoxic hazard of PAHs polluted water widely applied the ENA assay as versatile tool in large number of wild and farmed aquatic species. Nuclear abnormalities are commonly {{considered to be a}} direct consequence of genotoxic lesions in DNA macromolecule, and such evaluation might be helpful in identifying the genotoxic damage induced by the most harmful PAHs such as B[a]P. Regarding at the fish species subjected to aquaculture, most of the toxicological data come from wild fish and mainly focus on freshwater fish, but very little is known for other marine major aquacultured species. The gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) is the most economically important sparid species cultured along the Mediterranean costs, and it has been proved a very sensitive species to acute B[a]P exposure. However, further investigation is needed on several other types of genotoxic assessments, especially for chronic effects. This work was totally based on an in vitro model for chronic toxicity, using long-term S. aurata hepatocytes in primary culture, continuously exposed to low levels of BaP, over a prolonged period of time, to provide evidences for latent toxicity response. We aimed to investigate the kind of nuclear damage in gilthead sea bream hepatocytes continuously exposed to B[a]P sublethal doses. Cells were exposed to several B[a]P concentrations (10 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 1 ng/mL, 1 pg/mL) for two exposure times (24 and 72 h), and then tested both for apoptosis induction and for nuclear abnormalities by immunofluorescence analysis. The presence of severe nuclear damage, revealed cells progressing towards abnormal genotypes, due to a series of aberrant mitosis followed by unequal distribution of chromosomal content. The nuclear atypia (NA) more frequently observed were: a) micronuclei (MN); b) nuclear buds or blebs (NBUDs); c) notched nuclei; d) lobed nuclei; e) nuclei with nucleoplasmic bridge (NPBs); f) nuclei squashed, with a residual nuclear membrane; g) open nuclei, with membrane tape unrolled; and h) apoptotic bodies. Our results showed at medium-low doses a sustained <b>genotoxic</b> response, whose <b>potency</b> increased with the exposure time, becoming apparent as apoptosis induction, both by cell surface and nuclear changes. At the lowest doses, the longer was B[a]P exposure, greater was the involvement on masses of replicating cells, establishing the connection between the escape from apoptosis and the selection of tumoral cell evolution.

40|$|Genotoxic {{agents are}} {{a major threat to}} the integritiy of {{chromosomes}} and viability of cells, specially if the damage is not repaired, because it can lead to chromosome instability, cell cycle arrest, cell dysfunction, induction of apoptosis or carcinogenesis. For genotoxicity, two main endpoints are gene mutations and chromosome aberrations; the latter can either be structural (clastogenic) or numerical (aneugenic). There are several in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests available. However, none of these tests are capable to detect both endpoints of genotoxicity simultaneously. The pUR 288 mouse model, carrying the lacZ transgene on a plasmid vector, used for this thesis, is in theory capable of detecting large deletions (> 500 base pairs) in addition to small deletions and point mutations. Since it was not previously demonstrated that the pUR 288 mouse model is indeed sensitive enough to detect clastogens, a second mouse model was used, the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice. This model has a defect in the repair of chromosomal aberrations, caused by clastogens. Determination of the lacZ mutant frequency (lacZ MF) as well as hybridization studies showed that the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice are only moderately more sensitive towards clastogens as compared to pUR 288 mice. It was concluded that, although still a promising test, both in vivo models were not sensitive enough to detect the effect of exposure to clastogens. In contrast to the in vivo studies, the in vitro studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from pUR 288 and Rad 54 /Rad 54 B mice, have shown a dose-dependent induction in the lacZ MF and the micronuclei frequency (for the MNT) after exposure to both mutagens as well as clastogens in both MEFs models. Moreover, MMC-treatment resulted in a higher lacZ MF in Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs compared to pUR 288 MEFs. This genotype effect after MMC-exposure, also shown in microarray studies, was due to an impaired DNA damage response in MMC-treated Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs. This will lead to a weaker DNA repair response and therefore a larger percentage of the cells will carry a lacZ mutation, hence a higher lacZ MF in the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs compared to pUR 288 MEFs. Since MMC induces predominantly DNA crosslinks, the obtained results suggests that the Rad 54 and/or Rad 54 B genes are involved in DNA crosslink damage recognition and repair. As a conclusion, the lacZ MF assay using pUR 288 MEFs is able to detect both mutagens as well as clastogens simultaneously. Using this in vitro test can be of great advantage, since this can lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} tests needed. The reduction in time and costs and the increase in the sensitivity make this in vitro lacZ assay a good alternative for existing tests for screening of genotoxic compounds. However, before this test can be used as a high-throughput screenings test, it needs to be validated with a wider range of genotoxic compounds, non-genotoxic compounds, non-carcinogens and most importantly also low <b>potency</b> <b>genotoxic</b> compounds. Then it can be assessed whether this assay is reproducible and whether the results obtained can replace existing genotoxicity assay...|$|R
40|$|The {{threshold}} of toxicological concern (TTC) is a pragmatic risk assessment tool {{that is based}} on the principle of establishing a human exposure threshold value for all chemicals, below which there is a very low probability of an appreciable risk to human health. The concept that there are levels of exposure that do not cause adverse effects is inherent in setting acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) for chemicals with known toxicological profiles. The TTC principle extends this concept by proposing that a de minimis value can be identified for many chemicals, {{in the absence of a}} full toxicity database, based on their chemical structures and the known toxicity of chemicals which share similar structural characteristics. The establishment and application of widely accepted TTC values would benefit consumers, industry and regulators. By avoiding unnecessary toxicity testing and safety evaluations when human intakes are below such a threshold, application of the TTC approach would focus limited resources of time, cost, animal use and expertise on the testing and evaluation of substances with the greatest potential to pose risks to human health and thereby contribute to a reduction in the use of animals. An Expert Group of the European branch of the International Life Sciences Institute - ILSI Europe -has examined the TTC principle for its wider applicability in food safety evaluation. The Expert Group examined metabolism and accumulation, structural alerts, endocrine disrupting chemicals and specific endpoints, such as neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, developmental toxicity, allergenicity and immunotoxicity, and determined whether such properties or endpoints had to be taken into consideration specifically in a step-wise approach. The Expert Group concluded that the TTC principle can be applied for low concentrations in food of chemicals that lack toxicity data, provided that there is a sound intake estimate. The use of a decision tree to apply the TTC principle is proposed, and this paper describes the step-wise process in detail. Proteins, heavy metals and polyhalogenated-dibenzodioxins and related compounds were excluded from this approach. When assessing a chemical, a review of prior knowledge and context of use should always precede the use of the TTC decision tree. The initial step is the identification and evaluation of possible <b>genotoxic</b> and/or high <b>potency</b> carcinogens. Following this step, non-genotoxic substances are evaluated in a sequence of steps related to the concerns that would be associated with increasing intakes. For organophosphates a TTC of 18 small mu, Greekg per person per day (0. 3 small mu, Greekg/kg bw/day) is proposed, and when the compound is not an OP, the TTC values for the Cramer structural classes III, II and I, with their respective TTC levels (e. g. 1800, 540 and 90 small mu, Greekg per person per day; or 30, 9 and 1. 5 small mu, Greekg/kg bw /day), would be applied sequentially. All other endpoints or properties were shown to have a distribution of no observed effect levels (NOELs) similar to the distribution of NOELs for general toxicity endpoints in Cramer classes I, II and III.

Methods We selected 2 types of cigarettes (TL and TW) as benchmark Korean cigarettes for this study, because they represent the greatest level of nicotine and tar contents among Korean cigarettes. Mutagenic potency was expressed as the number of revertants per μg of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) total particulate matter whereas <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> was expressed as a concentration-dependent induction factor. The CSC was prepared by the International Organization for Standardization 3308 smoking method. CHO-K 1 cells were used in vitro micronucleus (MNvit) and comet assays. Two strains of Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica; TA 98 and TA 1537) were employed in Ames tests. Results All CSCs showed mutagenicity in the TA 98 and TA 1537 strains. In addition, DNA damage and micronuclei formation were observed in the comet and MNvit assays owing to CSC exposure. The CSC from the 3 R 4 F Kentucky reference (3 R 4 F) cigarette produced the most severe mutagenic and genotoxic potencies, followed by the CSC from the TL cigarette, whereas the CSC from the TW cigarette produced the least severe mutagenic and genotoxic potencies.

In order to elucidate the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of a compound present in commercial preparations of malathion, the DNA damaging effect of the insecticide and its isomer isomalathion was investigated using alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated with 75 and 200 µM of the chemicals for 1 h. The concentrations from the range we used are relevant to that in blood following various nonlethal human exposure to pesticides. Malathion caused no significant changes in the comet length of the lymphocytes throughout the range of concentrations tested. Isomalathion introduced damage to DNA in a dose-dependent manner. Treated cells were able to recover within 60 min incubation in insecticide-free medium at 37 ºC. The reported genotoxicity of malathion might, therefore, be a consequence of its thermal and/or photo-chemical conversion to isomalathion and the presence of isomalathion as well as its oxidation products and other unspecified impurities in commercial formulations of malathion. In this regard, the results of our study indicate that malathion used as commercial product, i. e. containing isomalathion, can be considered as a genotoxic substance in vitro.

In this preliminary investigation, seven calcium-channel blockers have been examined either for their in vitro nitrosation according to the procedure recommended by the WHO, or for occurrence of liver DNA fragmentation, as detected by the Comet assay, in rats given by gavage 1 / 2 LD 50 of the drug and 80 mg/kg of sodium nitrite. After 6 h incubation the yields of NOC formed in vitro from nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine and nitrendipine ranged from 37 to 45 % of the theoretical one, whereas the yields of NOC formed from diltiazem, gallopamil and verapamil ranged from 2 to 5 %. In vivo, as compared with the effect of the same dose of the drug alone, a significant increase of both tail length and tail moment, indicative of an increased frequency of DNA single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites, was produced in rat liver DNA by the administration with nitrite of gallopamil, nifedipine, nimodipine and nitrendipine, the ratio [tail length of drug + NaNO 2 /tail length of drug alone] being 3. 2 for nimodipine, 3. 1 for gallopamil 2. 2 for nifedipine, and 2. 1 for nitrendipine. Even if present, the increase in the degree of DNA fragmentation did not reach the statistical significance in rats given with nitrite nicardipine, diltiazem and verapamil. Further studies should be performed to investigate the formation of NOC in conditions Simulating those occurring in the stomach of humans treated with a therapeutic dose, and to quantitate their <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{metabolite}} of {{a widely}} used pesticide, paraoxon, exerted a dramatic mutagenic synergistic effect in Salmonella typhimurium {{with a number}} of mammalian-activated or plant-activated aromatic amines and heterocyclic amines. The mutagenic synergy required an activated an aromatic amine, and was not attributable to the generation of new mutagenic products or to the modification of the stability of the activated aromatic amine products. Paraoxon modulated the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of dietaiy heterocyclic amines in human cells. The results of this study raise the concern of the environmental effects of organophosphorus ester insecticides. A clone of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, AS 52, was isolated, characterised and analysed under identical treatment conditions with the mutagens 2 -acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene (2 AAAF), ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS), and UV radiation. The genetic endpoints included acute DNA damage detected in the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, whole cell clastogenicity detected with laser beam flow cytometry and forward mutation at a target gene. There were statistically significant increases in DNA damage and forward mutation with all three mutagens. Statistically significant increases in chromosome damage were observed with 2 AAAF and EMS but not with UV. A non-uniform distribution of DNA damage throughout the genome was indicated with the chemical mutagens in the SCGE assay. Another type of modulation in genotoxic response was investigated whereby numerous commercial soybean processing products and by-products were analysed for their antimutagenic and antigenotoxic activities. Antimutagenic activity was detected in a soybean processing by-product, soybean molasses and in an ethanol extract, fraction PCC. PCC protected mammalian cells against direct DNA damage, clastogenic damage and point mutation induced by 2 AAAF. A fraction of PCC, PCC 100 was an effective antimutagen in mammalian cells and in human lymphocytes.

40|$|Heterocyclic {{aromatic}} amines (HAAs) are primarily produced during the heating of meat or fish. HAAs are mutagenic and carcinogenic, and their toxicity in model systems depend on metabolic activation. This activation is mediated by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes, in particular CYP 1 A 2. Some {{studies have indicated}} a role of human sulfotransferase (SULT) 1 A 1 and N-acetyltransferase (NAT) 2 in the terminal activation of HAAs. In this study, we conducted a metabolism/genotoxicity relationship analysis for 16 HAAs and related heterocyclics. We used the γH 2 AX genotoxicity assay in V 79 cells (deficient in CYP, SULT and NAT) and V 79 -derived cell lines genetically engineered to express human CYP 1 A 2 alone or in combination with human SULT 1 A 1 or NAT 2. Our data demonstrated genotoxic properties for 13 out of the 16 compounds tested. A clear relationship between metabolic bioactivation and genotoxicity allowed to distinguish four groups: (1) Trp-P- 1 genotoxicity was linked to CYP 1 A 2 bioactivation only—with negligible effects of phase II enzymes; (2) Glu-P- 2, Glu-P- 1, Trp-P- 2, APNH, MeAαC and AαC were bioactivated by CYP 1 A 2 in combination with either phase II enzyme tested (NAT 2 or SULT 1 A 1); (3) IQ, 4 -MeIQ, IQx, 8 -MeIQx, and 4, 8 -DiMeIQx required CYP 1 A 2 in combination with NAT 2 to be genotoxic, whereas SULT 1 A 1 did not enhance their genotoxicity; (4) PhIP became genotoxic after CYP 1 A 2 and SULT 1 A 1 bioactivation—NAT 2 had not effect. Our results corroborate some previous data regarding the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of seven HAAs and established the genotoxicity mechanism for five others HAAs.

40|$|In vitro cell based bioassays are {{commonly}} used in water and sediment quality assessment. Bioassays are often cell-based methods in which the cellular response to chemical exposure is measured in fluorescence, luminescence or absorbance after conversion of a substrate. The general toxicity endpoints measured with in vitro bioassay include cell viability, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency.</b> Such assays can be a valuable tool in assessing general toxicity endpoints including cell viability and genotoxicity as well as specific endpoints including adaptive stress response activation. Adaptive stress responses include the cellular reactions that occur to protect the cell, tissue or organism following among others genotoxic damage, oxidative stress and inflammation. Measuring these endpoints {{can be useful in}} screening chemicals and environmental samples because such effects occur prior to general toxicity endpoints. This review is focused on describing possible improvements to the current bioassay based water and sediment quality assessment. To improve the water and sediment quality assessment developing, validating and implementing headspace-free setups in bioassays is suggested. Measuring several adaptive stress response endpoints for samples is recommended for screening purposes, either in a test battery or multiplex setup (a multiplex assay is method used to measure multiple targets simultaneously). The development of a high-throughput screening multiplex method for adaptive stress responses would provide valuable data whilst saving time and valuable samples. Targets of interest for screening purposes include p 53, NF-κB, Nrf 2, XBP- 1 and GSH, which should be measured simultaneously with general markers of cell viability and mitochondrial activity. Although many specific single assays measuring adaptive stress response endpoints exist, improvements can be made by improving efficiency of the methods {{and the quality of the}} acquired data...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} genotoxicity {{of small}} particulate matter {{has been under}} investigation for the last 10 years. Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) are considered as "probably carcinogenic" (IARC group 2 A) {{and a number of}} studies show genotoxic effects of urban particulate matter (UPM). Carbon black (CB) is carcinogenic in rats. In this study the cytotoxic and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of these three particle types was investigated by exposing human cells (A 549 and THP- 1 cell lines) in vitro to CB, DEP (SRM 1650, NIST), and UPM (SRM 1648, NIST) for 48 hr. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the Alamar Blue assay, whereas genotoxicity was assessed using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). The particles were characterized with regard to their mean diameter in tissue culture medium (CB 100 nm, DEP 400 nm, UPM 2 microm), their total carbon content (CB 99 %, DEP 85 %, UPM 15 %), and their acid-soluble metal composition (UPM >> CB approximately DEP). The concentrations ranged from 16 ng/ml to 16 microg/ml for cytotoxicity tests and from 16 ng/ml to 1. 6 microg/ml for genotoxicity tests. In both assays, paraquat was used as a reference chemical. The CB, DEP, and UPM particles showed no significant cytotoxicity. However, all three particles were able to cause significant DNA damage, although to a different extent in the two cell lines. The genotoxicity of washed particles and dichloromethane extracts was also investigated. In THP- 1 cells CB washed particles and DEP extracts caused significant DNA damage. This difference in effect may be related to differences in size, structure, and composition of the particles. These results suggest that CB, DEP, and UPM are able to cause DNA damage and, therefore, may contribute to the causation of lung cancer.

40|$|Fine {{airborne}} respirable particulates {{less than}} 10 micrometer (PM 10) are {{considered one of}} the top environmental public health concerns, since they contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are among the major carcinogenic compounds found in urban air. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the genotoxicity of the ambient PM 10 collected at 11 urban sites in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The PM 10 extractable organic matter (EOM) was examined for its genotoxicity by the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) comet assay and the Salmonella mutagenicity (Ames) test. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify 16 PAH compounds in four sites. Samples from oil refinery and heavy diesel vehicles traffic sites showed significant DNA damage causing comet in 20 - 44 % of the cells with tail moments ranging from 0. 5 - 2. 0 compared to samples from petrol driven cars and residential area, with comet in less than 2 % of the cells and tail moments of < 0. 02. In the Ames test, polluted sites showed indirect mutagenic response and caused 20 - 56 rev/ m 3, mean while residential and reference sites caused 2 - 15 rev /m 3. The genotoxicity of the EOM in both tests directly correlated with the amount of organic particulate and the PAHs concentrations in the air samples. The PAHs concentrations ranged between 0. 83 ng/m 3 in industrial and heavy diesel vehicles traffic sites to 0. 18 ng /m 3 in the residential area. Benzo(ghi) pyrene was the major PAH components and at one site it represented 65. 4 % of the total PAHs. Samples of the oil refinery site were more genotoxic in the SCGE assay than samples from the heavy diesel vehicles traffic site, despite the fact that both sites contain almost similar amount of PAHs. The opposite was true for the mutagenicity in the Ames test. This could be due to the nature of the EOM in both sites.

40|$|The {{brominated}} trihalomethanes (THMs) are mutagenic and carcinogenic disinfection by-products frequently {{found in}} chlorinated drinking water. They can be activated to mutagens by {{the product of}} the glutathione S-transferase-Theta (GSTT 1 ++- 1) gene in Salmonella RSJ 100, which has been transfected with this gene. To evaluate this phenomenon in humans, we have examined the genotoxicity of a brominated THM, bromoform (BF), using the Comet assay in human whole blood cultures exposed in vitro. No differences were found in the comet tail length between cultures from GSTT 1 - 1 (+) versus GSTT 1 - 1 (-) individuals (1. 67 +/- 0. 40 and 0. 74 +/- 0. 54 microm/mM, respectively, P = 0. 28). The high variability was due to the relatively weak induction of comets by BF. Combining the data from both genotypic groups, the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of BF was 1. 20 +/- 0. 34 microm/mM (P = 0. 003). GSTT 1 - 1 is expressed in red blood cells but not in the target cells (lymphocytes), and expression within the target cell (as in Salmonella RSJ 100) may be necessary for enhanced mutagenesis in GSTT 1 - 1 (+) relative to GSTT 1 - 1 (-) cultures. To examine this, we exposed Salmonella RSJ 100 and a control strain not expressing the gene (TPT 100) to the most mutagenic brominated THM detected in Salmonella, dibromochloromethane (DBCM), either in {{the presence or absence of}} S 9 or red blood cells from GSTT 1 - 1 (+) or GSTT 1 - 1 (-) individuals. S 9 did not activate DBCM in the non-expressing strain TPT 100, and it did not affect the ability of the expressing strain RSJ 100 to activate DBCM. As with S 9, red cells from either genotypic group were unable to activate DBCM in TPT 100. However, red cells (whole or lysed) from both genotypic groups completely repressed the ability of the expressing strain RSJ 100 to activate DBCM to a mutagen. Such results suggest a model in which exposure to brominated THMs may pose an excess genotoxic risk in GSTT 1 - 1 (+) individuals to those organs and tissues that both express this gene and come into direct contact with the brominated THM, such as the colon. In contrast, those organs to which brominated THMs would be transported via the blood might be protected by erythrocytes. Such a proposal is reasonably consistent with the organ specificity of drinking water-associated cancer in humans, which shows slightly elevated risks for cancer of the colon and bladder but not of the liver...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the major}} areas for {{increasing}} the use of renewable energy is in traffic fuels e. g. bio-based fuels in diesel engines especially in commuter traffic. Exhaust emissions from fossil diesel fuelled engines are known to cause adverse effects on human health, but there is very limited information available on how the new renewable fuels may change the harmfulness of the emissions, especially particles (PM). We evaluated the PM emissions from a heavy-duty EURO IV diesel engine powered by three different fuels; the toxicological properties of the emitted PM were investigated. Conventional diesel fuel (EN 590) and two biodiesels were used[*]−[*]rapeseed methyl ester (RME, EN 14214) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) either as such or as 30 % blends with EN 590. EN 590 and 100 % HVO were also operated with or without an oxidative catalyst (DOC[*]+[*]POC). A bus powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) was included for comparison with the liquid fuels. However, the results from CNG powered bus cannot be directly {{compared to the other}} situations in this study. Results High volume PM samples were collected on PTFE filters from a constant volume dilution tunnel. The PM mass emission with HVO was smaller and with RME larger than that with EN 590, but both biofuels produced lower PAH contents in emission PM. The DOC[*]+[*]POC catalyst greatly reduced the PM emission and PAH content in PM with both HVO and EN 590. Dose-dependent TNFα and MIP- 2 responses to all PM samples were mostly at the low or moderate level after 24 -hour exposure in a mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7. Emission PM from situations with the smallest mass emissions (HVO[*]+[*]cat and CNG) displayed the strongest potency in MIP- 2 production. The catalyst slightly decreased the PM-induced TNFα responses and somewhat increased the MIP- 2 responses with HVO fuel. Emission PM with EN 590 and with 30 % HVO blended in EN 590 induced the strongest genotoxic responses, which were significantly greater than those with EN 590 [*]+[*]cat or 100 % HVO. The emission PM sample from the CNG bus possessed the weakest <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> but had the strongest oxidative potency of all the fuel and catalyst combinations. The use of 100 % HVO fuel had slightly weaker and 100 % RME somewhat stronger emission PM induced ROS production, when compared to EN 590. Conclusions The harmfulness of the exhaust emissions from vehicle engines cannot be determined merely on basis of the emitted PM mass. The study conditions and the engine type significantly affect the toxicity of the emitted particles. The selected fuels and DOC[*]+[*]POC catalyst affected the PM emission from the heavy EURO IV engine both qualitative and quantitative ways, which influenced their toxicological characteristics. The plain HVO fuel performed very well in emission reduction and in lowering the overall toxicity of emitted PM, but the 30 % blend of HVO in EN 590 was no better in this respect than the plain EN 590. The HVO with a DOC[*]+[*]POC catalyst in the EURO IV engine, performed best with regard to changes in exhaust emissions. However some of the toxicological parameters were significantly increased even with these low emissions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{convenient}} {{synthesis of}} a large set of (multiple) CP-PAH by Flash Vacuum Thermolysis (FVT), which have all been identified in combustion exhausts, allows their systematic assessment for mutagenicity in the bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames-assay, TA 98 ±S 9 -mix). Consequently, the physico-chemical characterization (1 H and 13 C NMR, cyclic voltammetry, etc.) is carried out to elucidate structure-activity relationships and to explain the high activity exhibited by some CP-PAH, on one hand, and the inactivity of others, on the other hand. To gain further insight in the mechanisms for positive mutagenicity response in the presence {{and in the absence}} of the exogenous metabolic activation mixture (± S 9 -mix), dihydro-CP-PAH derivatives are synthesised and assayed for mutagenic activity. Hence, the importance of the olefinic bond in the five-membered rings can be evaluated. Furthermore, the corresponding epoxides at the cyclopenta moieties are proposed as the ultimate mutagenic active forms of CP-PAH in the presence of the metabolic activation mixture. Their synthesis permits the evaluation of their contribution to the mutagenic activity or inactivity of the corresponding parent CP-PAH. In addition, FVT-pyrolysates are considered as partial mimics of combustion exhausts. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that the mutagenic activity of mixtures containing exclusively (CP) -PAH cannot be accounted for by the addition of the individual contributions of the constituents. However, in practice for general <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> screening of complex combustion mixtures, still only the 16 PAH listed by the US-EPA are generally taken into consideration and the global genotoxicity is commonly reported as equivalent to that exerted by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). The results presented in this Ph. D. thesis show that the assumption of only additive processes among the combustion mixture constituents is incorrect and cannot be maintained. Moreover, other compounds that are more active that B[a]P are shown to greatly contribute to the global genotoxicity of the mixture. Semi-empirical AM 1 calculations (MOPAC) of the proposed ultimate mutagenic active forms, i. e. epoxides and mono hydroxy-carbocations at the cyclopenta moieties, are employed to support the experimental results. In Chapter I a general introduction concerning the sources, environmental distribution, physico-chemical and genotoxic properties of CP-PAH is presented. The FVT method is also described. In Chapter II the bacterial mutagenicity some mono-CP-PAH is re-evaluated and compared to that exerted by their dihydro-derivatives and epoxide. The results are rationalized by semi-empirical AM 1 calculations. In Chapter III, the bacterial mutagenic activity of the three isomeric dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners is reported. Their mutagenic potency is markedly affected by the number and the topology of the cyclopenta moieties. The order in mutagenic potency can be explained by semi-empirical AM 1 calculations. Furthermore, dicyclopenta[cd,fg]- and diyclopenta[cd,mn]pyrene are identified as novel contributors to the direct-acting mutagenic activity found in the non-polar fraction of combustion exhausts. Chapter IV reports the synthesis and assessment for bacterial mutagenicity of the di-epoxides derived from the three isomeric dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners. All epoxides exert direct-acting mutagenicity response and high toxicity, which confirms their role as ultimate mutagenic active forms. Chapter V reports the global mutagenic activity exerted by FVT-pyrolysates of the dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners. In Chapter VI the bacterial mutagenic activity of the fluoranthene derivatives is determined. An FVT-pyrolysate containing all derivatives is also evaluated for mutagenic activity. In Chapter VII the experimental total 1 H and 13 C NMR assignments of the dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners are described and compared to those obtained by ab initio calculations using the CTOCD-PZ 2 method. This thesis concludes with a Summary and an Outlook and Perspectives sections. Furthermore, a summary in Dutch (Samenvatting) and in Spanish (Resumen) are also provided...|$|E
40|$|Il est admis aujourd'hui que la génotoxicité identifiée dans les extraits d'eau potable provient principalement de l'action du chlore sur la matière organique naturelle qui donne naissance à des dérivés organohalogénés. Dans le présent travail, nous avons comparé la sensibilité de trois essais de génotoxicité (SOS chromotest, test d'Ames-fluctuation et test micronoyau triton) lors de l'étude de composés organohalogénés, d'acides fulviques chlorés et d'échantillons d'eau (non concentrés) en cours de {{traitement}} de potabilisation. Les composés organohalogénés étudiés sont 4 trihalométhanes, 5 acétonitriles et 5 chloropropanones identifiés dans l'eau potable ou dans des solutions de substances humiques chlorées. Les résultats obtenus révèlent que le SOS chromotest est globalement le moins sensible des trois essais et que le test d'Ames-fluctuation et le test micronoyau triton permettent généralement de détecter les plus faibles concentrations de composés génotoxiques. Les essais ont également permis de démontrer que {{la nature}} des substituants halogénés (brome ou chlore), le nombre et la position des atomes de chlore influencent notablement la génotoxicité des composés organohalogénés. Toutefois, les résultats obtenus indiquent qu'aucun des trois tests réalisés n'est suffisant à lui seul pour détecter l'ensemble des produits génotoxiques. Ces observations confirment la nécessité de réaliser une batterie de tests qui mette en oeuvre divers types cellulaires et différents systèmes de métabolisation, et détecte divers évènements de génotoxicité. Les travaux portant sur les solutions concentrées d'acides fulviques chlorés montrent l'intérêt des essais sur bactéries (particulièrement le test d'Ames-fluctuation) pour la détection rapide de l'activité génotoxique de ces solutions. L'étude concemant les échantillons d'eau prélevés à différents niveaux d'une station de potabilisation, et analysés sans concentration préalable, indique que le test d'Ames- fluctuation est le seul capable de détecter une activité génotoxique dans les échantillons non concentrés étudiés. On montre, conformément à la littérature, que l'activité mutagène observée résulte de la chloration de l'eau. Since {{the identification of}} organohalides in drinking water in 1974, several investigators have detected genotoxic activity in drinking water concentrates. It is now widely admitted that the observed genotoxicity originates mainly from the reaction of chlorine on natural organic matter contained in the raw water, {{which leads to the}} formation of organohalogenated compounds. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the benefit of three short-term assays for the evaluation of the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of organohalogenated compounds and of complex mixtures. In a wider context, the purpose is to identify a test or a battery of tests that can contribute to the control of natural and drinking water genotoxicity. The three genotoxicity assays carried out during this work were:- the SOS chromotest, a primary DNA damage in vitro assay on Escherichia coli; - the Ames- fluctuation test, a point mutation in vitro assay on Salmonella typhimurium; - and the newt micronucleus test, a chromosomal aberration in vivo assay on the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl. These assays display a valuable advantage: the water samples under study can be analyzed without concentration prior to testing. Thus, the different concentration procedures, which may modify the original genotoxicity of the water samples, are avoided. A previous study on seven reference genotoxic chemicals had indicated that the SOS chromotest was never the most sensitive of the three tests (for a given chemical, the most sensitive assay is defined as the test which detects the lowest concentration inducing a significant genotoxic effect). On the contrary, the Ames-fluctuation test proved to be the most sensitive for compounds showing direct genotoxic activity, and the newt micronucleus test the most sensitive for chemicals with indirect genotoxic effects. None of the assays was the most sensitive for every substance analyzed. These observations suggested the need to implement a battery of tests using several cell types, different metabolization systems and detecting several genotoxicity events. This earlier study also showed, in accord with several results in the literature, that the Ames-fluctuation test (in liquid medium) demonstrated a better sensitivity than the Ames test (in agar solid medium). The first part of the present study involved testing the genotoxicity of 14 organo- halogenated compounds identified in drinking water samples or in chlorinated humic matter samples. The chemicals studied were four chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes (trichloro-, bromodichloro-, chlorodibromo- and tribromomethane), five chlorinated or brominated acetonitriles with one, two or three halogens (monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo- and dibromoacetonitrile) and five chlorinated propanones with one, two or three substitutions on one or two carbon atoms (monochloro-, 1, 1 -dichloro-, 1, 3 -dichloro-, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- and 1, 1, 3 - trichloropropanone). Although the SOS chromotest was the most sensitive for 3 of the 14 substances analyzed, the results confirmed that this test was globally the least sensitive; the Ames-fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test remained the most efficient assays. It is interesting to note that the Ames-fluctuation test appeared the most sensitive for all the chloropropanones tested and the newt micronucleus test, for all the haloacetonitriles analyzed. Moreover, several structure-activity relationships were demonstrated: the nature of the halogenated substituents (bromine or chlorine), the number and, above all, the position of chlorine atoms strongly influenced the genotoxicity of the organohalides studied. In the second part of the work we analyzed the effects of complex mixtures containing several organohalogenated compounds: the three tests were performed on two chlorinated fulvic acids of different origin. Pornic fulvic acid was extracted from a surface water reservoir used to produce drinking water in Vendée (France) and Pinail fulvic acid came from a forest pond near Poitiers (France). The total organic carbon was about 1 g/l in the solution subjected to chlorination and the molar chlorination ratio was 1. 5 Cl 2 /C. The results showed the advantage of tests using bacteria: the Ames fluctuation test was the only assay able to detect the genotoxicity of both chlorinated fulvic acids; the SOS chromotest detected the genotoxic effect of only one of the chlorinated fulvic acids (Pinail). In contrast, the newt micronucleus test did not show any genotoxicity of the chlorinated fulvic acids. However, it must be pointed out that, as insufficient fulvic acid was available, the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potency</b> of these solutions on the newt was not tested under adequate conditions (e. g., subchronic concentrations were not studied). Nevertheless, the concentrations of fulvic acid analyzed were very close to those found in the aquatic environment. The last part of the study attempted to approximate environmental and human exposure conditions: the three tests were performed on four water samples taken at several stages of a drinking water treatment plant. These samples were analyzed for genotoxicity in the three test systems without preconcentration. The plant studied is characterized by the following treatment steps: - coagulation-flocculation; - chlorination at 6 g Cl 2 /m 3; - sand filtration; - ozonation at 1. 9 g O 3 /m 3; - final chlorination at 1. 4 g Cl 2 /m 3 before sending the treated water into the distribution system. The four samples were taken: 1. before any treatment (raw water, 10 to 13 mg total organic carbon per liter), 2. between the sand layer filter and the ozonator (chlorinated water), 3. after the ozonator (ozonated water), 4. and at the end of the treatment process (treated water). The results obtained confirmed the advantage of the Ames fluctuation test, which was the only assay able to detect a genotoxic activity in the unconcentrated water samples studied. Regarding the influence of the different chemical treatments on the mutagenicity observed, it was demonstrated that the first chlorination step led to the formation of direct-acting mutagens. The treatment with ozone, at the rate used, did not significantly modify the mutagenicity of the samples that had previously been chlorinated. Similarly, the second chlorination step did not significantly increase the direct mutagenicity detected. Practically, our study indicated that the Ames-fluctuation test is the only assay, among the three performed that is able to contribute efficiently to the control of drinking water genotoxicity. In this context, the benefit of the SOS chromotest appears only in case of accidental pollution: indeed, it is the only test able to yield results within 24 hours. The implementation of the newt micronucleus test could be useful for the control of natural or drinking water genotoxicity in case of extensive pollution...|$|E
