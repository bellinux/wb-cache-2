40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a better understanding of suffusion characteristics of <b>glacial</b> <b>soils</b> and to present a simple yet reliable assessment procedure for determination of suffusion in the laboratory. Internal erosion by suffusion occurs in the core of an embankment dam when the ability of the soil to resist seepage forces is exceeded and voids are large enough to allow the transport of fine particles through the pores. Soils susceptible to suffusion are described as internally unstable. dams with core of broadly graded glacial moraines (tills) exhibit signs of internal erosion to a larger extent than dams constructed with other types of materials. The Suffusion behavior of <b>glacial</b> <b>soils</b> has been investigated through two different permeameter suffusion test have been employed, small scale permeameter and big scale permeameter. Details of the equipment along with its calibration, testing and sampling procedures are provided. The testing program were performed 9 test with different compaction degree in small scale permeameter and 2 test in big permeameter on internally stable categories of till soil. The categories are defined based on the soil grain size distribution and according to the methods developed by Kenney & Lau and Burenkova.

50|$|The {{agricultural}} {{richness of}} the valley {{is partly due to}} the Missoula Floods that inundated the valley approximately 40 times between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} last ice age.

Winchell’s Falls and Cathedral Gorge are relatively recent (past ten-thousand years) features. The newly uncovered till (<b>glacial</b> <b>soil)</b> was rocky and sterile, and much like northern Canada today. It was covered by tundra where feeding mammoths and other ice age mammals migrated along the un-crossable Esopus. As the climate continued to warm, the open landscape gave way to spruce and fir of the boreal forest. Mastodons and woodland caribou took over the trail blazing begun by earlier mammals. At some point during this time, the first people entered the area hunting the ice-age “mega-fauna”. Evidence of these first people is scant in this area, but they undoubtedly followed the game trails along the Esopus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlacial {{deposits}} {{are very}} common as foundation soils supporting road embankments in Ireland and are typically present {{in almost all}} road projects. Despite this there is limited research data linking the settlement performance of embankments to the compressibility and consolidation properties of such soils.

The paper presents the results of several case histories of foundations and monitored road embankments supported on glacial deposits located throughout Ireland. In situ field compressibility and consolidation parameters are back calculated from field performance and correlated to standard index properties such as liquid limit, plasticity index, particle size gradations and SPT N values. Some general conclusions plus recommended ways to predict embankment performance from commonly obtained geotechnical test data are suggested.

50|$|Silverton's {{elevation}} {{is between}} 200 and 250 ft above {{mean sea level}} with the steep-sided, heavily-wooded Waldo Hills to the south rising an additional 200 ft. The agricultural richness of the environs is due to massive and repeated floods from prehistoric Lake Missoula in western Montana. Beginning approximately 13,000 years before the present, repeated flooding from Lake Missoula scoured eastern Washington and Oregon, carved out the Columbia River Gorge, and periodically swept down the Columbia River; when floodwaters met ice jams in southwest Washington, the backed-up water spilled over and filled the entire Willamette Valley to a depth of 300 to 400 ft above current sea level, creating a body of water known as Lake Allison.

40|$|Allerthorpe Common is one {{of three}} {{remaining}} heathlands on sandy <b>glacial</b> <b>soil</b> in the Vale of York. During the 1960 Õs, Allerthorpe Common was extensively afforested with pine so that heathland communities are now largely confined to a 6 hectare nature reserve, and an unplanted area in the northeast corner of the common. Heather Calluna vulgaris, cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix, purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea, and cotton grass Eriophorum angustifolium form a mosaic of wet and dry heath communities, into which birch woodland has encroached in places as a result of seral succession. There is a small population of marsh gentian Gentiana pneumonanthe, a species which is uncommon nationally and now restricted to 38 localities mainly in the south of England.

In order to evaluate the relationships between acidifying factors (such as atmospheric deposition), buffering factors (such as bedrock and soil type), and surface water acidity, an exhaustive survey of streamwater acidity in the Vosges mountains (N-E France) was performed. A network of 11 measurement stations of atmospheric deposition was used to estimate and map deposition over the whole massif (total area ¬= 5000 km 2).

40|$|The {{recovery}} of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) from low permeability glacial soils (silts and clays) can be problematic due to low well yields. The use of {{high vacuum technology}} (including bioslurping, vacuum enhanced recovery and/or multi-phase extraction) has been used at these types of sites to improve LNAPL recovery rates in comparison to traditional pump and treat technologies. However, the use of high vacuum alone is limited to recovering LNAPL from relatively shallow depths (typically less than 25 to 30 feet (7. 6 to 9. 1 metres) due to the lift limitations of vacuum technology.

The {{purpose of the study}} was to quantify the relative importance of atmospheric vs. natural sources of H+ input to forest soil acidification, and to determine the role of N transformation processes in the overall H+ balance of soils with different N status. Rainwater samples had an avg pH of 4. 7 and annual H+ deposition via precipitation averaged 320 mol H+ ha– 1 yr– 1. This was modest compared to internal H+ production associated with HCO- 3 and NO- 3 formation. In the soil under alder cover, which was naturally enriched in N through symbiotic N 2 -fixation, nitrification released up to 4500 mol H+ ha– 1 annually to the solution percolating through the upper part of the soil profile. In the N-poor soil no nitrification could be observed and N transformation processes had a minor influence on the soil H+ balance. The main internal acidification source in this case was H 2 CO 3 dissociation releasing 420 mol H+ ha– 1 yr– 1. In both instances, soil solutions appeared well buffered against these external and internal acidification sources, and few H+ leached below the 40 -cm soil depth...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Dolní Vestonice loess {{section in}} the Czech Republic {{is well known for}} its {{high-resolution}} loess-palaeosol sequence of the last interglacial-glacial climatic cycle (Upper Pleistocene). The loess section is situated in a climatic transition zone between oceanic and continental climates and is therefore of great value in reconstructing past regional climate conditions and their interaction with climate systems, in particular that of the North Atlantic. Based on a combination of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, stratigraphic field observations and magnetic susceptibility measurements, a chrono-climatic interpretation of the Dolní Vestonice loess section is presented. To establish a reliable Upper Pleistocene chronology, a quartz OSL approach was applied for equivalent dose (De) determination. Monomineralic quartz extracts of three distinct grain sizes, fine (4 - 11 µm), middle (38 - 63 µm) and coarse (90 - 200 µm), were used and compared. Within error limits, the calculated OSL ages are the same for the different grain sizes, and the OSL ages are in stratigraphic order. The established OSL chronology is in agreement with a Weichselian litho- and pedostratigraphy. The Dolní Vestonice loess section is characterized by four pedosedimentary subsequences. At the base of the profile, subsequence I is characterized by a distinct Early <b>Glacial</b> <b>soil</b> complex, OSL-dated to c. 110 to 70 ka, representing one of the most complete records of environmental change in the European loess belt. Subsequence II is allocated to the Lower Pleniglacial and is characterized by laminated sandy loess. Middle Pleniglacial subsequence III is represented by a brown soil complex, and is followed by the uppermost subsequence IV, characterized by a thick body of laminated sandy loess, indicating strong wind activity and a high sedimentation rate of more than ~ 1 mm a- 1 during the Upper Pleniglacial. According to the OSL chronology, {{as well as to the}} sedimentological and palaeopedological investigations, it is likely that the sequence at Dolní Vestonice has recorded most of the climatic events expressed in the NGRIP d 18 O reference record between 110 and 70 ka. © 2012 The Authors.
