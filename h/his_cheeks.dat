5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b> The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, he voiced a {{portrayal}} of {{himself on the}} Warner Bros. animated series Freakazoid! (close friend Steven Spielberg was the executive producer); wherein he helped recount {{the origin of the}} titular hero; he also lectured about the movie ratings by using stickers of a family; and also made frequent reference to <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E

25|$|Three {{young men}} were {{observed}} on Sunday, 4 August 1907 at Westward Ho! station, swearing and fighting. A train was due and Mr. Loughlin, stationmaster, asked them to desist and take care, upon {{which one of the}} men caught him round the neck and punched both of <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b> The man was fined by the Bideford Magistrates and told that he was lucky to get away with a fine of 10s and costs of 7s 6d.|$|E
25|$|Edmund – 23 years old, {{the younger}} and more intellectually and poetically {{inclined}} son. He is thin and wiry. He looks like both his parents but more like his mother. He has her big dark eyes and hypersensitive mouth in a long narrow Irish face with dark brown hair and red highlights from the sun. Like his mother, he is extremely nervous. He is in bad health and <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> are sunken. Later he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He is politically inclined to have socialist leanings. He traveled the world by working in the merchant navy and caught tuberculosis while abroad.|$|E
25|$|Only in {{his early}} thirties, Captain Schofield is renowned for his level-headed {{demeanor}} and reflexes that afford him the ability {{to come out of}} devastating conflict alive. His callsign comes from two vertical scars that run from his eyebrows to <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> over his eyes, wounds he sustained while he was a Harrier pilot for the Marine Corps in Serbia. Although his rank is well below many others in the story, he frequently takes command of the entire United States military; the President personally agreeing to this due to Schofield having saved his life the preceding year. Often resorting to very dangerous strategies to win a battle, it has become the norm for any attempt on his life to end with him escaping while the surrounding environment is more or less demolished. He commands a recon unit of Marines called to aid the Russian government - a trap designed to lead to his death. Upon discovering M-12's plot to change world order, he embarks upon a campaign to ruin the Chameleon and Kormoran projects. He is the protagonist in four Matthew Reilly novels and a novella, Scarecrow being the third novel.|$|E

When he was asked about <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> Jackson answered: [...] "These cheekbones? No. My father has the same thing. We have Indian blood." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{characterized}} Sylvester as an [...] "absolute perfectionist". He {{was very}} self-conscious about his physical appearance, {{and when he}} obtained enough money from the successful Step II album, he spent part of it on cosmetic surgery to remove a bump on his nose, inject silicone into <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and have cosmetic work done on his teeth. He would also insist that all pictures of himself were meticulously airbrushed.|$|E
500|$|Joe Shishido as Goro Hanada, the Number Three Killer: a hitman with a fetish for {{the smell}} of boiling rice. He is gainfully {{employed}} by the yakuza until a butterfly lands on the barrel of his rifle during a [...] "Devil's job". He misses his target and is marked for death—then descends {{into a world of}} alcohol and paranoia. Shishido has been called the face of Suzuki's films, owing in part to their frequent collaborations, this being among the most prominent. After middling success in Nikkatsu melodramas he underwent plastic surgery, enlarging <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> several sizes. He returned to tremendous success as a heavy and, soon thereafter, a star.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the actors}} {{went before the}} cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied {{directly}} to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound; Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, [...] "I am acting {{the part of a}} nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." [...] Seiderman replied, [...] "You'd be surprised at what the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?" ...|$|E

Employees and regularspulled in by Dianeargue over the three newcomers in the billiard room. When three newcomers congratulate Sam for his support of Tom, Sam decides to not eject them and to avoid discriminating between his customers. Norm and the other regulars trick the three men into assuming that 7:00 pm is the last call for drinks at and escort them from the bar. Diane tells the regulars that the men they escorted out are not homosexual and that the two gay men are still present. The two men in question kiss Norm on <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E
500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce from October 1888. [...] His first two books {{promoted}} California. In California of the South (1888), described by David Fine as [...] "one of the earliest booster tracts" [...] Widney and Walter Lindley wrote: [...] "The health-seeker who, after suffering in both mind and body, after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida, after visiting Mentone, Cannes, and Nice, after traveling to Cuba and Algiers, and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh, and <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> have grown more sunken, his appetite more capricious, his breath more hurried, that his temperature is no longer normal,... turns with a gleam of hope toward the Occident"—by which they meant Southern California. Many people followed that gleam and found it something more than hope".|$|E

500|$|Although Kennedy was an {{accomplished}} legislator, {{his personal life}} was troubled during this time. His weight fluctuated wildly, he drank heavily at times– although not when it would interfere with his Senate duties– and <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> became blotchy. Kennedy later acknowledged, [...] "I {{went through a lot}} of difficult times over a period in my life where [...] may have been somewhat of a factor or force." [...] He chased women frequently, and also was in a series of more serious romantic relationships but did not want to commit to anything long-term. He often caroused with fellow Senator Chris Dodd; twice in 1985 they were in drunken incidents in Washington restaurants, with one involving unwelcome physical contact with a waitress. In 1987, Kennedy and a young female lobbyist were surprised in the back room of a restaurant in a state of partial undress.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the game, Vézina was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and advised to return home. He made a last trip into the Canadiens' dressing room on [...] to say a final goodbye to his teammates. Dandurand would later describe Vézina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with [...] "tears rolling down <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b> He was looking at his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [...] had arranged in Georges' corner. Then, he asked one little favour—the sweater he had worn in the last world series." [...] Vézina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie, where {{he died in the}} early hours on Saturday, March 27, 1926, at l'Hôtel-Dieu hospital. Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team honoured his entire $6,000 salary, a testament to how important Vézina had been to the team.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Myers as Austin Powers, {{receiving}} {{a call from}} his boss Basil Exposition (Michael York) who warns him against a dangerous spy describing her as a [...] "master of disguise". The screen of his car depicts five images of Madonna wearing different looks, and Exposition clarifies {{that she has been}} [...] "seducing our top agents". He also warns Powers [...] "whatever you do don't fall in love. We've already lost 007 and 008". As the video continues, Powers finds Madonna at a club performing in front of a crowd, which includes Verne Troyer in character as Mini-Me. As he watches her perform Powers finds himself fantasizing about the two of them dancing in front of a white background with psychedelic fluorescent whirls. He also visualizes them riding a car together, where Madonna dances suggestively and licks Powers' face while rubbing her crotch and bottom on <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E

500|$|On 13 May 1817, Pedro {{was married}} by proxy to Maria Leopoldina. When {{she arrived in}} Rio de Janeiro on 5 November, she {{immediately}} {{fell in love with}} Pedro, who was far more charming and attractive than she had been led to expect. After [...] "years under a tropical sun, his complexion was still light, <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> rosy." [...] The 19-year-old prince was handsome and a little above average in height, with bright dark eyes and dark brown hair. [...] "His good appearance", said historian Neill Macaulay, [...] "owed much to his bearing, proud and erect even at an awkward age, and his grooming, which was impeccable. Habitually neat and clean, he had taken to the Brazilian custom of bathing often." [...] The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy, occurred the following day. Seven children resulted from this marriage: Maria (later Queen Dona MariaII of Portugal), Miguel, João, Januária, Paula, Francisca and Pedro (later Emperor Dom PedroII of Brazil).|$|E
500|$|They {{passed a}} week that saw no action in Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds, hearing on 20 July that the Council in London had {{declared}} for Mary. Staying at Cambridge, Northumberland himself proclaimed Mary Tudor as queen at the market place. Warwick was {{with him as he}} threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> for grief." [...] The city that had welcomed the Duke splendidly was nervous to please the new queen. A large group of townsmen and university scholars surrounded King's College to arrest the Duke, who was with his son lodged on the premises. In contrast to his father, Warwick resisted arrest. A letter from the Council arrived that everyman could go his way, so the Duke asked to be set free, [...] "and so continued they all night [...] ". At dawn the Earl of Warwick [...] "was booted ready to have ridden in the morning", and escape. It was too late, however, as the Earl of Arundel arrived to again arrest the Duke and his entourage. The prisoners returned riding side by side through London, the guards having difficulties protecting them against the hostile populace.|$|E
500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he caught sight of him.|$|E
