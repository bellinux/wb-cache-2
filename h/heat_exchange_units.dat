40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are {{an important}} component in many industrial systems especially in process industries. So many commercial types of heat exchangers are available in market for exchange of heat {{as well as for}} recovery of waste heat. Improved heat transfer efficiency leads to decrease in energy consumption which then results in lower equipment operational and maintenance cost, lower emissions, and consequently also lower environmental impact. However, common enhancement approaches such as adding fins or tube inserts may not always be suitable or feasible – especially in case of heat recovery from streams having a high fouling propensity. Since heat transfer rate depends also on flow field characteristics, fluid distribution, and fouling which can all be greatly influenced by the actual shapes of flow system components, several simplified models for fast and accurate enough prediction of fluid distribution as well as applications for shape optimization based on these models were developed.

40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} (EA) {{were first}} {{introduced in the}} nineteen-seventies for optimizing technical devices. EA consist of operators simulating natural reproduction. According to biological principles, the reproduction consists of recombination and mutation {{as well as a}} selection process refered to as `survival of the fittest'. Rediscovered in the last decade, evolutionary algorithms proved their potential as global search algorithms with properties and qualities that can hardly be depicted by conventional gradient based methods. In multi-objective optimization, EA can be seen as superior to gradient based methods. For optimizing engineering relevant technical devices, as for instance flow geometry optimization, there is no analytical expression of the gradient available and also, a numerical approximation to the gradient is not appropriate due to its vast computational overhead. In this dissertation, EA are not only introduced as Simulated Annealing, but also used to determine system parameters necessary for setting up approximation models. These approximation models are able to depict the functional coherence between design variables and objective function and are thus able to answer the correct objective function value on even unseen design parameter combinations. As approximation models we consider the latest proposed and most capable neural network systems, the Bayesian regularization network and also the adaptive neuro-Fuzzy inference system. As an examplary problem, we consider a staggered channel, paramererized by Bezier splines. From a numerical simulation, we calculate the pressure drop of a number of distorted geometries. From these samples, the network systems are trained and, after training, used in an evolutionary algorithm where we then seek the optimum with the approximation model. As soon as an optimization problem has more than one objective function, and these are concurrenting, a set of solutions is seeked. This set of solutions can be discovered by evolutionary algorithms since they work on solution sets instead of a single solution only as most gradient based methods do. In this dissertation, we present configurations of <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>units</b> which are subject to optimization according to objectives like heating performance, pressure drop, flow velocity at control spots, and covered flow field.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford Klein, Douglas Reindl, and Doug Reinemann; 106 pp. Wisconsin continues to lead {{the nation in the}} production of cheese, providing about 30 % of the national supply. The industry is less secure than it once was, however, due to narrowing profit margins and competition from large plants in California and elsewhere. In 1994, the production of cheese consumed 87. 7 % of the milk produced in Wisconsin. Thus the success of the Wisconsin cheese industry is closely linked {{to the success of the}} Wisconsin dairy industry at large, which provides about three billion dollars per year in gross income. In this study, the utility use of two representative cheese plants is examined. Utility costs generally represent about 11 % of the total manufacturing cost of cheese. Utility use is one of the few variables that a plant manager can influence to improve plant profitability. The largest fraction of the energy used at a typical plant is devoted to processing whey, a byproduct of significant food value. Two types of equipment are commonly used to process or remove moisture from whey: evaporation systems and spray dryers. Through the course of this research project, models for both evaporation and spray drying equipment were developed. Pinch analysis has been applied to investigate heat recovery options such as open cycle heat pumps and <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>units.</b> Significant opportunities for reduction of utility use have been identified for both the evaporation system and the spray drying system examined. Making use of the low temperature vapor rejected from the evaporation system by preheating raw milk provides two simultaneous benefits. Steam use by the ii pasteurizer is decreased, and the cooling rejection load on the cooling tower (equipped with a 60 hp motor) is eliminated. Cost savings associated with these benefits are estimated to exceed $ 70, 000 per year. In the spray dryer system studied, outdoor air is heated to 240 �F before being introduced into the drying chamber. Exhaust air leaves the chamber at 155 �F. The use of either direct or indirect heat exchange between the supply air before it reaches the burner and the exhaust air is explored. Energy cost savings in the range of $ 40, 000 to $ 70, 000 are predicted for this opportunity. In addition to the heat recovery analysis just described, this study explores an alternative control strategy to reduce electricity costs related to maintaining a cold storage warehouse through demand shifting. By sub-cooling the stored cheese during the off-peak period, it is possible to meet all or most of the cooling load in the warehouse as the sub-cooled cheese returns to its normal storage temperature. In this way, operation of the cooling equipment during peak-time can be avoided or reduced significantly. This control strategy has been examined using a finite difference model of the warehouse. The model has demonstrated the approach to be feasible. It has been estimated to result in reduced annual electric costs of about $ 15, 000.

40|$|Elkem Materials is in {{the initial}} phase of {{developing}} rice husk combustion as a business strategy. By burning rice husk under controlled conditions the ash generated is amorphous silica in nature. This amorphous silica ash {{can be used as}} a substitute for micro silica in the concrete industry. Due to a growing demand for finely divided silica in the concrete industry, combustion of rice husk is an alternative method to generate this product. Elkem Materials and SN Power are considering to join forces in a power project based on rice husk. The idea is to install 20 MW power plants in designated Asian countries. The power will be generated from a steam cycle which heat exchanges with the rice husk combustion products. More insight is needed in order to understand how a general power plant based on rice husk can be put together. Today, two companies have developed different combustion technologies that can control the strict combustion conditions required. Still, more experimental data is needed to investigate under which conditions the reactors have to operate in order to meet the strict ash quality required by Elkem Materials. This thesis has carried out an evaluation of the major components in a 20 MW power plant facility based on rice husk. A central part has been to develop a model for how the energy content in rice husk can be utilized in a combustion process for further heat utilization. Another model is developed to estimate the surface area required to transfer a certain amount of heat from the combustion products. These models can be used for different rice husk samples and for different combustion conditions. All numbers calculated are guiding values. Lack of experiments and information has influenced their order of magnitude. Several assumptions and simplifications are carried out to be able to do some general estimations. The aim is to show the tendency, and more comprehensive calculations have to be done for further development of the project. The energy utilization of rice husk has been studied for four different combustion temperatures. In addition, five different samples of rice husk are analyzed in the combustion process to see how their characterizations influence the operation of the power plant. The results are also given an economical aspect. The greatest difference between each rice husk sample is the ash content. For the samples analyzed, this varies between 14 - 22 % (mass basis). The moisture content is low for all samples, about 9 %. Compared to other biomass fuels the carbon fraction is low and the oxygen fraction is high. This results in a low calorific value, between 12 - 14 MJ/kg. Lower ash content gives higher calorific value. Rice husk has a low bulk density, about 120 kg/m 3, and enormous volumes are necessary for generation of 20 MW electricity based on this fuel. The fuel feed varies between 480 - 580 ton/day, mainly depending on the calorific value. Different combustion temperatures have minor effect on the fuel feed. To generate a constant heat rate, a little increase in the fuel feed is necessary when the combustion temperature decreases. The ash product is a source for generating profit. Fuel with lower calorific value generates more ash. The fuel price is often decided by the calorific value, and in this case cheaper fuel will increase the profit. Between the two rice husk extremities analyzed, one sample generates 70 ton of ash per day, while the other 130 ton/day. A proximate and ultimate analysis of the different rice husk samples should be done prior to the decision of where to locate the power plant. The steam cycle is defined to operate with 55 bar and 530 °C into the turbine, while the outlet values are 0, 08 bar and 42 °C. This will generate about 21 MW. 1 MW is available for own internal demands, and 20 MW can be supplied to the local electricity grid. Operating under these conditions, the steam cycle requires 63, 25 MW of heat. Approximately 83 MW of thermal effect is needed to satisfy this need. Heat losses are not included. Depending on the size of the reactor, this amount requires several reactors in parallel where the generated flue gas is conveyed into a joint heat recovery steam generation system. The flue gas temperature has been taken down to 125 °C. The limited outlet temperature is decided by the amount of sulfur in the fuel, and by the SO 3 dew point temperature. To avoid degradation of the materials in lower temperature regions, the sulfur content and the corresponding dew point temperature have to be known. The most complex component in this power plant is the heat transfer unit. Because the flue gas heat transfer coefficient is low, large surface areas are needed to transfer the required amount of heat. In addition, since the majority of the ash is conveyed with the flue gas into the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>units,</b> several design restrictions have to be implemented in the boiler system. Extended surface area tubes (finned tubes) can not be used because of the impure flue gas. By installing smooth tubes, the required area will be enormous. Factors that have greater influence on the required surface area are the ash emissivity, the gas side fouling factor and the flue gas velocity. Heat transfer from radiation may contribute remarkably because of the high ash content in the flue gas. The flue gas velocity has to be strictly regulated because of the flue gas composition. This affects how efficient the heat transfer might be. Further investigations should focus on how to avoid too much reduction in the velocity. By implementing appropriate cleaning techniques, the velocity can probably be kept at higher levels. The fouling factor is the last critical parameter. This interacts with the velocity and can also be reduced by cleaning systems. Bullet cleaning is a suitable cleaning technique. When the combustion temperature decreases, the total surface area of the heat exchanger tubes will increase. Going from 850 °C to 770 °C the area increases about 1000 m 2. The areas calculated are instructive numbers. However, it is a clear relation between the combustion temperature and the required surface area. The evaluations are based on single units. Integration of the reactor and the boiler will probably increase the heat transfer efficiency and reduce the tube s surface area. To perfectly control the combustion temperatures, great amounts of oxygen are necessary. Seen from an energy utilization perspective, this is not a very efficient use of energy. A lot of air is used to reduce the temperature, and the flue gas energy content is low. Due to high excess of air in the flue gas, recycling the outlet oxygen is an important supplement for increasing the combustion efficiency. Depending on the rice husk sample and on the combustion temperature, the flue gas stream is approximately 80 kg/s. Secondary emission reduction measures are necessary to separate the fly ash from the flue gas stream. A recommended solution is to implement a cyclone to separate the larger particles (80 - 90 %) in combination with bag house filters that separate the smaller once. For these quantities of flue gas streams, the magnitude of the ash collectors have to be extraordinary large. Because the ash has an economical value, investment in this technology is important. An alternative separation method could be to locate a cyclone prior to the heat recovery system. This would simplify several challenges linked to the impure flue gas entering the water-tubes. Yet, commercialized solutions for this practice are not developed. From an economic perspective the project has great potential, though all numbers depend on future pricing, supply and demand. Realistic price estimates based on today s market justify investment in this type of power plant. The sold electricity will constitute 75 % of the income, while the amorphous silica ash constitutes the other 25 %. Though this project seems beneficial, the size of the plant should be reconsidered. Due to low bulk density, the power plant has to be located close to the rice husk suppliers. Calculations show that 53 trucks are necessary to supply the power plant. In general, the rice milling industry is characterized by smaller mills, and rice husk collected from several milling plants is necessary. A perfect industrial symbiosis would be to locate the plant on site with the mill. This presumes smaller power plants, operating with the amount of rice husk generated by the mill. Experience with controlled rice husk combustion and power generation is scarce. By operating smaller power plants, further experience will be gained. This will improve the possibility for successful design of larger power plants. </p...|$|E

The {{results indicated that the}} [`]Solasyphon' delivered solar heated water directly {{to the top of the}} HWC producing a stratified supply at a useable temperature. Under variable solar conditions the [`]Solasyphon' would transfer the heat gained by a solar collector to a HWC more efficiently and quickly than a traditional HWC. The [`]Solasyphon' system can reduce installation costs by 10 - 40 % and has a lower embodied energy content due to less material replacement.

5000|$|Geothermal {{heat pump}} technology, {{variously}} known as [...] "ground source," [...] "earth-coupled," [...] or [...] "direct exchange," [...] relies on circulating a refrigerant through buried copper tubing for <b>heat</b> <b>exchange.</b> These <b>units,</b> which are considerably {{more efficient than}} their air-source counterparts, rely on the constancy of ground temperatures below the frost zone for heat transfer.The most efficient {{ground source heat pumps}} use ACR, Type L or special-size copper tubing buried into the ground to transfer heat to or from the conditioned space. Flexible copper tube (typically 1/4-inch to 5/8-inch) can be buried in deep vertical holes, horizontally in a relatively shallow grid pattern, in a vertical fence-like arrangement in medium-depth trenches, or as custom configurations.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the thermodynamic {{characteristics of a}} prototype respiratory heat and moisture exchanger (HMS), particularly its ability to prevent cold injury to the face. The HME comprised a thermally insulated oro-nasal mask with a cylindrical heat and moisture exchanger protruding from {{the centre of the}} mask. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>unit</b> contained an aluminium “honeycomb ” structure providing a surface area of 478. 5 cm 2 for <b>exchange</b> of <b>heat</b> and moisture between the inspired and expired air. A breathing simulator was used to simulate the temperature and humidity of the expired air. The HME was strapped to the head of a manikin, whose mouth was connected to the respiratory simulator. The entire arrangement was placed in a climatic chamber. We evaluated the efficiency of the HME at two different rates of ventilation (11. 3 and 28. 0 L. min- 1), and at five different ambient conditions (- 24,- 14,- 4, 8, and 22 °C). The efficiency of the HME was evaluated by determining the performance coefficient (PC) under each condition: PC(%) = (Tin-Ta) /(Tex- Ta) x 100; where Tin, Tex, and Ta are the temperatures of the inspired, expired and ambient air, respectively. In all subzero ambient conditions, the HME was able to maintain the temperature within the oro-nasal mask above 20 °C. By maintaining mask temperature above 20 °C in subzero temperatures, the HME can effectively eliminate the risk of freezing cold injury (FCI) of the facia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{tropical}} climates, {{a rising}} demand for active air-conditioning {{leads to a}} strong increase of electricity consumption. Compared to the energy demand for the sensible cooling of air the high humidity (in the order of 20 g water per kg dry air) in the tropics results in a significantly high air-dehumidification load. Handling the dehumidification load and sensible cooling load separately can reduce the electricity demand for air-conditioning considerably if the dehumidification is driven by heat energy (e. g. solar thermal or waste heat) instead of electricity. At the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), an experimental two-stage air-dehumidification system consisting of a membrane unit and an adsorption based desiccant unit, has been installed and analysed. The membrane unit pre-dehumidifies the ambient air, which is then further dehumidified and simultaneous evaporatively cooled by an Evaporatively COoled Sorptive (ECOS) dehumidification and <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the dehumidification performance of the two-stage air-dehumidification system under tropical climate conditions and different operating parameters such as air flow rate and regeneration air temperature. A numerical model was developed for the ECOS and the membrane unit in MATLAB which was then coupled with TRNSYS software in order to create a model for the two-stage dehumidification system. The results of our investigations show that the two-stage system is able to dehumidify ambient air by 8 to 10 g water per kg of dry air under the warm and humid climate conditions of Singapore. Thermal COP of up to 0. 6 was obtained...|$|R
