The accuracy of any electrocardiogram waveform extraction plays {{a vital role in}} helping a better diagnosis of any heart related illnesses. We present a computer-aided application model for detection of cardiac arrhythmia in ECG signal, which consists of signal pre-processing and detection of the ECG signal components adapting Pan-Tompkins and Hamilton-Tompkins algorithms; feature extraction from the detected QRS complexes, and classification of the beats extracted from QRS complexes using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The application model was developed for ECG signal classification under ‘Normal ’ or ‘Abnormal ’ heartbeats to <b>detect</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> in the ECG signal. The model was trained with standard arrhythmia database of Massachusetts Institute of Technology Division of Health Science and Technology/Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH), and taking into account the Association for the Advance of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. The performance of the developed application model for classification of ECG signals was investigated using the MIT-BIH database. The accuracy of detection and extraction of the signal components and features (based only on the MIT-BIH database used) shows that the developed application model can be employed for the detection of heart diseases in patients...|$|E
40|$|Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the P, QRS, T wave {{indicating}} the electrical {{activity of the}} heart. Electrocardiogram is the most easily accessible bioelectric signal that provides the doctors with reasonably accurate data regarding the patient heart condition. Many of the cardiac problems are visible as distortions in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Normally ECG related diagnoses are carried out manually. As the abnormal heart beats can occur randomly it becomes very tedious and time-consuming to analyze say a 24 hour ECG signal, as it may contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} heart beats. In this work we propose computer based automated system to help the doctor to <b>detect</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> As reference, we have used the Normal, Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) and Fusion signals of the MIT-BIH Database. Then we have focused on the various schemes for extracting the useful features of the ECG signals for use with artificial neural networks. We extract the principal characteristics of the signal by means of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and other techniques such as Discrete Wavelet Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform. After signal pre-processing, they are applied to an Artificial Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (ANN MLP). The task of an ANN based system is to correctly identify the three classes the feature extraction schemes are discussed and compared with RBFN & Support Vector Machine in this work...|$|E

40|$|ECG is an {{important}} non-invasive clinical tool for the diagnosis of heart diseases. The detection of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> is a challenging task since the small variations in ECG signals cannot be distinguished precisely by human eye. The objective of this work is to <b>detect</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> with highest detection accuracy. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> are classified using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) technique. The DWT feature set comprises of statistical features extracted from the sub bands obtained after decomposition of QRS complex signals up to 5 scales whereas the DTCWT feature set comprises of wavelet coefficients extracted from the 4 th and 5 th scale decomposition of QRS complex signals. The two sets of features are appended individually by four other features (AC power, kurtosis, skewness and timing information) extracted from the QRS complex signal of each cardiac cycle. These feature sets are independently classified using a multi layered perceptron (MLP) neural network based on back propagation algorithm. In this work, five types of ECG beat (Normal (N), Paced (P), Right Bundle Branch Block (R), Left Bundle Branch Block (L) and Premature Ventricular Contraction (V)) are classified from the 48 files of MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCardiac arrhythmias {{are remarkably}} common and {{routinely}} go undiagnosed {{because they are}} often transient and asymptomatic. Effective diagnosis and treatment can substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> The Zio Patch (iRhythm Technologies, Inc, San Francisco, Calif) is a novel, single-lead electrocardiographic (ECG), lightweight, Food and Drug Administration–cleared, continuously recording ambulatory adhesive patch monitor suitable for <b>detecting</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in patients referred for ambulatory ECG monitoring. MethodsA total of 146 patients referred for evaluation of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> underwent simultaneous ambulatory ECG recording with a conventional 24 -hour Holter monitor and a 14 -day adhesive patch monitor. The primary outcome {{of the study was}} to compare the detection arrhythmia events over total wear time for both devices. Arrhythmia events were defined as detection of any 1 of 6 arrhythmias, including supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, pause greater than 3 seconds, atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. McNemar's tests were used to compare the matched pairs of data from the Holter and the adhesive patch monitor. ResultsOver the total wear time of both devices, the adhesive patch monitor detected 96 arrhythmia events compared with 61 arrhythmia events by the Holter monitor (P <. 001). ConclusionsOver the total wear time of both devices, the adhesive patch monitor detected more events than the Holter monitor.

40|$|Electrocardiogram (ECG), a {{non-invasive}} diagnostic technique, {{used for}} <b>detecting</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> From last decade industry dealing with biomedical instrumentation and research, demanding an advancement {{in its ability}} to distinguish different <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an irregular rhythm of the human heart. During AF, the atrial moments are quicker than the normal rate. As blood is not completely ejected out of atria, chances for the formation of blood clots in atrium. These abnormalities in the heart can be identified by the changes in the morphology of the ECG. The first step in the detection of AF is preprocessing of ECG, which removes noise using filters. Feature extraction is the next key process in this research. Recent feature extraction methods, such as Auto Regressive (AR) modeling, Magnitude Squared Coherence (MSC) and Wavelet Coherence (WTC) using standard database (MIT-BIH), yielded a lot of features. Many of these features might be insignificant containing some redundant and non-discriminatory features that introduce computational burden and loss of performance. This paper presents fast Conjugate Symmetric Sequency Ordered Complex Hadamard Transform (CS-SCHT) for extracting relevant features from the ECG signal. The sparse matrix factorization method is used for developing fast and efficient CS-SCHT algorithm and its computational performance is examined and compared to that of the HT and NCHT. The applications of the CS-SCHT in the ECG-based AF detection is also discussed.

According to the application, ECG data analysis consists of steps such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification aiming to <b>detect</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (i. e., <b>cardiac</b> rhythm abnormalities). Aiming to made a fast and accurate <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> signal classification process, we apply and analyze a recent and robust supervised graphbased pattern recognition technique, the optimum-path forest (OPF) classifier. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that OPF classifier is used to the ECG heartbeat signal classification task. We then compare the performance (in terms of training and testing time, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity) of the OPF classifier to the ones of other three well-known expert system classifiers, i. e., support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian and multilayer artificial neural network (MLP), using features extracted from six main approaches considered in literature for ECG arrhythmia analysis. In our experiments, we use the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the evaluation protocol recommended by The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. A discussion on the obtained results shows that OPF classifier presents a robust performance, i. e., there is no need for parameter setup, as well as a high accuracy at an extremely low computational cost. Moreover, in average, the OPF classifier yielded greater performance than the MLP and SVM classifiers in terms of classification time and accuracy, and to produce quite similar performance to the Bayesian classifier, showing to be a promising technique for ECG signal analysis...|$|R

40|$|Electrocardiogram (ECG), a noninvasive {{technique}} {{is used as}} a primary diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. A cleaned ECG signal provides necessary information about the electrophysiology of the heart diseases and ischemic changes that may occur. It provides valuable information about the functional aspects of the heart and cardiovascular system. The objective of the thesis is to automatic detection of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in ECG signal. Recently developed digital signal processing and pattern reorganization {{technique is}} used in this thesis for detection of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> The detection of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in the ECG signal consists of following stages: detection of QRS complex in ECG signal; feature extraction from detected QRS complexes; classification of beats using extracted feature set from QRS complexes. In turn automatic classification of heartbeats represents the automatic detection of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in ECG signal. Hence, in this thesis, we developed the automatic algorithms for classification of heartbeats to <b>detect</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in ECG signal. QRS complex detection is the first step towards automatic detection of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in ECG signal. A novel algorithm for accurate detection of QRS complex in ECG signal is proposed in chapter 2 of this thesis. The detection of QRS complex from continuous ECG signal is computed using autocorrelation and Hilbert transform based technique. The first differential of the ECG signal and its Hilbert transformed is used to locate the R-peaks in the ECG waveform. The autocorrelation based method is used to find out the period of one cardiac cycle in ECG signal. The advantage of proposed method is to minimize the large peak of P-wave and T-wave, which helps to identify the R-peaks more accurately. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmias database has been used for performance analysis. The experimental result shows that the proposed method shows better performance as compared to the other two established techniques like Pan-Tompkins (PT) method and the technique which uses the difference operation method (DOM). For detection of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> the extracted features in the ECG signal will be input to the classifier. The extracted features contain both morphological and temporal features of each heartbeat in the ECG signal. Twenty six dimension feature vector is extracted for each heartbeat in the ECG signal which consist of four temporal features, three heartbeat interval features, ten QRS morphology features and nine T-wave morphology features. Automatic classification of <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> is necessary for clinical diagnosis of heart disease. Many researchers recommended Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for automatic classification of heartbeats into following five beats: normal beat (N), supraventricular ectopic beat (S), ventricular ectopic beat (V), fusion beat (F) and unknown beat (Q). The beat classifier system is adopted in this thesis by first training a local-classifier using the annotated beats and combines this with the global-classifier to produce an adopted classification system.

Currently, {{three to four}} million Americans rely on CIEDs and this number is growing rapidly with approximately 400, 000 new device implantations each year. Worldwide, around one million new device implantations are performed annually. CIEDs consist of battery-powered pulse generators connected to the heart {{by one or more}} electrode wires, called "leads," embedded within a patient's vein. To achieve the maximum possible clinical benefit, modern CIEDs can automatically transmit data to the clinician's office through various media, such as email and text messaging, to allow for remote monitoring. This dissertation concentrates on improving the quality of care of patients with CIEDs, i. e., maximizing the expected lifetime of these patients, by focusing on three major challenges inherent to these devices: (i) cardiac leads fail stochastically and {{it is not clear whether}} to abandon them or to extract them, either immediately or at a later time; (ii) the average life span of CIED batteries is not as long as the average patient's expected lifetime and it is not clear when to replace the battery-powered pulse generators; (iii) the remote monitoring of CIEDs can adversely affect the battery's remaining lifetime and it is not clear how frequently the remote transmissions should be performed. We use methodologies including Markov decision processes as well as applied probability and statistics to formulate and analyze decision models that enable clinicians to provide patients with better quality of care. Using clinical data and expert opinion, we carefully calibrate the models concerning challenges (i) and (ii); for (iii), we provide insightful numerical examples for a stylized model.

To <b>detect</b> the <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> currently Holter is generally used to record 1 ~ 3 leads ECG (electrocardiogram) signals during 24 h to 72 h. However the use of Holter is limited among the population due to its form factor (not user-friendly) and cost. In this paper, we propose an integrated single chip wearable Holter named SoC-Holter, which enables to record 1 ~ 4 leads ECG. This single chip SoC-Holter is relied on adequation algorithm architecture design methodology. To minimize energy consumption, CMOS technology (0. 35 µm) is used to prototype the first implementation and test. The SoC-Holter has the following functions: signal conditioner and preamplifier, amplifier and filters, analog to digital converter, and Nano-controller. The low pass filter is composed of current division, degeneration and common-mode feedback circuits added to fulfill the required performance. The analog circuits are implemented, tested and validated. The digital bloc is simulated, implemented and tested.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death for men and women in the United States. Individuals with syncope, <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and cryptogenic stroke are at risk for CVD because of a {{suspected}} arrhythmia. These individuals may choose to have an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) inserted to <b>detect</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia’s</b> such as atrial fibrillation (AF). Little is known about self-care, quality of life (QOL) and the experiences of those with an ICM. The purposes of this dissertation were to understand the experiences of individuals who have an ICM inserted and to describe the effect on their self-care and QOL. In this qualitative descriptive study, maximum variety sampling was used to recruit a diverse sample. Participants (N = 12) ranged in age from 41 - 95, with half (n = 6) having the device because of syncope, infrequent AF (n = 1), and others (n = 5) for device insertion due to having a cryptogenic stroke. Manuscript 1 examined the decision-making process for ICM insertion in those with suspected arrhythmias. Understanding the influences that occur early in this process are important for the clinician when discussing options with this population. The purpose of this study was to describe how individuals make a decision to have an ICM inserted. The decision-making process to have an ICM inserted varied among participants. Three global categories emerged with data analyses: (a) pre-decision, (b) definitive decision, and (c) deliberated decision. Event symptoms, including physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms, and trust emerged as factors in the decision-making process. Finding from this study indicate that clinicians should explore loss and emotional symptoms when caring for those making the decision to have an ICM. Because the timing of the decision varied and was related to trust, further research is needed to address the qualities that are important in interactions between the individual and their clinician that influence trust. Manuscript 2 focused on understanding the experiences of those with an ICM to improve health outcomes and QOL. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of those with undiagnosed cardiac symptoms or post-cryptogenic stroke living with an ICM. Data analyses resulted in three global categories: (a) influences on self-care, (b) managing, and (c) monitoring. Findings indicate that communication by the remote monitoring staff is an important aspect for those with an ICM.

40|$|Catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (CPVT) is a difficult-to-diagnose cause of {{sudden cardiac death}} (SCD). We identified a family of 1400 individuals with multiple cases of CPVT, including 36 SCDs during youth. Objectives: We sought to identify the genetic cause of CPVT in this family, to preventively treat and clinically characterize the mutation-positive individuals, and to functionally characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of the mutation. Methods: Genetic testing was performed for 1404 relatives. Mutation-positive subjects were preventively treated with β-blockers and clinically characterized with a serial exercise treadmill test (ETT) and Holter monitoring. In vitro functional studies included caffeine sensitivity and store overload–induced calcium release activity of the mutant channel in HEK 293 cells. Results: We identified the p. G 357 S_RyR 2 mutation, in the cardiac ryanodine receptor, in 179 family members and in 6 SCD victims. No SCD was observed among treated mutation-positive subjects over a median follow-up of 37 months; however, 3 relatives who had refused genetic testing (confirmed mutation-positive subjects) experienced SCD. Holter monitoring did not provide relevant information for CPVT diagnosis. One single ETT was unable to <b>detect</b> complex <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in 72 % of mutation-positive subjects, though the serial ETT improved the accuracy. Functional studies showed that the G 357 S mutation increased caffeine sensitivity and store overload–induced calcium release activity under conditions that mimic catecholaminergic stress. Conclusion: Our study supports the use of genetic testing to identify individuals at risk of SCD to undertake prophylactic interventions. We also show that the pathogenic mechanisms of p.

40|$|BACKGROUND Diphtheria still endemic in many {{developing}} countries and is responsible for high case fatality. Myocardial involvement is a serious complication of diphtheria and diphtheria myocarditis frequently complicated by arrhythmias causes sudden death if not managed properly. So, early and adequate administration of Anti-Diphtheritic Serum (ADS) and frequent monitoring particularly 24 hrs. ECG monitoring is helpful to <b>detect</b> any serious <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> METHODS A prospective study on patients who were culture positive diagnosed on the basis of WHO definition were treated and analysed in respect to homographic details, immunisation strategy, and clinical features with particular attention to myocarditis. RESULTS In the study, common age group affected by diphtheria was 5 to 10 years. Incidence of myocarditis more in same age group. Out of 64 patients with myocarditis, 23 patients died. CONCLUSION Incidence of diphtheria has increased in the recent years. Commonly effected age group is 5 to 10 years {{and most of them are}} presented with asymptomatic myocarditis. Symptomatic diphtheritic myocarditis has high mortality rate even with aggressive management. Patient who presented with either LBBB alone are with combination of other conduction of abnormalities has high mortality rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to <b>detect</b> and quantify <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic tracings and arterial pressure were recorded for 24 hours in 14 normotensive subjects, 10 patients with established essential hypertension without left ventricular hypertrophy, and 16 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiographic criteria. Urinary excretion of norepinephrine was simultaneously measured over four successive four-hour and one eight-hour period. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy had significantly more ventricular (but not atrial) premature contractions than those without left ventricular hypertrophy or than normotensive subjects. Five patients with left ventricular hypertrophy had episodes of more than 30 premature ventricular contractions per minute. Higher-grade ventricular ectopic activity such as coupled premature ventricular contractions was seen in two, and multifocal premature ventricular contractions were seen in three in the group with left ventricular hypertrophy. No difference in urinary catecholamine excretion rates among the three groups was seen. Left ventricular hypertrophy {{has been shown to be}} an independent risk factor for sudden death and acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiographic monitoring of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy allows identification of those who have the highest risk and, therefore, require the most aggressive therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of cerebral {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) in acute stroke has increased during the last years. The presented papers focus on improvement of the diagnostic workup of specific MRI sequences for additional information in acute stroke and on detecting risk factors for cerebral ischemic lesions in marathon runners. The diagnostic impact of specific vessel signs on MRI for prognostic and therapeutic questions is increasingly discussed. We evaluated the association of distal cortical vessel signs on stroke FLAIR MRI (FLAIR vascular hyperintensities; FVH) with infarct size and morphology and the clinical impairment of 84 patients with symptomatic internal cerebral artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. FVH were detected in 75 (89. 3 %) patients with a median number of 4 [IQR 2 - 7]. Patients with FVH> 4 had larger initial DWI lesions (p= 0. 008), perfusion deficits (p= 0. 001) and final infarction volumes (p= 0. 005) than patients showing less or equal than 4 FVH on admission. The initial perfusion-diffusion-mismatch (“tissue-at-risk”) was larger (p= 0. 005). We calculated a “rescue ratio” Q, representing {{the part of the}} “tissue-at-risk” that becomes necrotic after the initial imaging up to the final infarction volume, to set the size of initial mismatch in relation to the infarct volume. There was a positive correlation between the number of FVH and the “rescue ratio” Q (r= 0. 404; p= 0. 016), possibly showing a protective effect of FVH on the infarct evolution, may be implicating FVH as collateral supply. Because of our small number of patients and without DSA control as gold standard for detection of collateral vessels, we can’t finally prove this hypothesis with our data. Patients with FVH> 4 and larger infarction volumes showed similarly higher NIHSS scores on admission and on discharge (p= 0. 021; p= 0. 093) implicating more severe strokes. In a second work we evaluated the validity of negative high-resolution DWI (hrDWI) in patients with TIA. The classical clinical definition of TIA has recently been challenged because of diffusion-restricted areas in MRI. A follow-up imaging 24 hours after admission showed 11 % (7 / 63 patients) false-negative hrDWI. Indication to follow-up imaging for detection of those infarctions can be guided by persistence of neurologic deficits, measured by NIHSS, longer than 24 hours after onset (OR 17. 5; 95 % CI 2. 83 - 108. 12; p= 0. 002). Concerning the Berlin Beat of Running study we examined 110 experienced marathon runners to <b>detect</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and associated silent brain lesions in context of the 38 th BMW Berlin marathon 2011. The final results are expected during 2013.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) {{is associated with}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> in a clinic-based population with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities and severe SDB. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 697 veterans who underwent polysomnography for suspected SDB. SDB was categorized according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) : none (AHI < 5), mild (5 ≥ AHI < 15), and moderate-severe (AHI ≥ 15). Nocturnal <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> consisted of: (1) complex ventricular ectopy, (CVE: non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy), (2) combined supraventricular tachycardia, (CST: atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia), (3) intraventricular conduction delay (ICD), (4) tachyarrhythmias (ventricular and supraventricular), and (5) any <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia.</b> Unadjusted, adjusted logistic regression, and Cochran-Armitage testing examined the association between SDB and <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> Linear regression models explored the association between hypoxia, arousals, and <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> RESULTS: Compared to those without SDB, patients with moderate-severe SDB had almost three-fold unadjusted odds of any <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> (2. 94; CI 95 %, 2. 01 - 4. 30; p < 0. 0001), two-fold odds of tachyarrhythmias (2. 16; CI 95 %, 1. 47 - 3. 18; p = 0. 0011), two-fold odds of CVE (2. 01; 1. 36 - 2. 96; p = 0. 003), and two-fold odds of ICD (2. 50; 1. 58 - 3. 95; p = 0. 001). A linear trend was identified between SDB severity and all <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> subtypes (p value linear trend < 0. 0001). After adjusting for age, BMI, gender, and cardiovascular diseases, moderate-severe SDB patients had twice the odds of having nocturnal <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> (2. 24; 1. 48 - 3. 39; p = 0. 004). Frequency of obstructive respiratory events and hypoxia were strong predictors of arrhythmia risk. CONCLUSIONS: SDB is independently associated with nocturnal <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk for any <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{unexpected}} {{death in}} epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 5 - 30 % of deaths {{in patients with}} epilepsy. Past research has attempted to reveal these mechanisms, but the specific risk factors and pathophysiology have not been established. Inherited lethal <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> can be erroneously diagnosed as epilepsy. A diagnosis of coexistent epilepsy cannot be completely excluded in the inherited <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> but the differential diagnosis is often challenged.
