60|$|I {{have just}} been {{witnessing}} a remarkable play, here at the Burg Theatre in Vienna. I do not know of any play that much resembles it. In fact, {{it is such a}} departure from the common laws of the drama that the name 'play' doesn't seem to fit it quite snugly. However, whatever else it may be, it is in any case a great and stately metaphysical poem, and deeply fascinating. 'Deeply fascinating' is the right term: for the audience sat four hours and five minutes without thrice breaking into applause, except at the close of each act; sat rapt and silent--fascinated. This piece is 'The Master of Palmyra.' It is twenty years old; yet I doubt if you have ever heard of it. It is by Wilbrandt, and is his masterpiece and the work which is to make his name permanent in German literature. It has never been played anywhere except in Berlin and in the great Burg Theatre in Vienna. Yet whenever it is put on the stage it packs the house, and the free list is suspended. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have seem it ten times; they know the most of it by heart; they do not tire of it; and they say they shall still be quite willing to go and sit under its spell whenever they get the opportunity.|$|E

[...] Ebert later placed the film on his list of [...] "The Best 10 Movies of 2000", writing: [...] "Tarsem, the director, is a visual virtuoso who juggles his storylines effortlessly; it's dazzling, the way he blends so many notes, styles and genres into a film so original." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four, writing: [...] "The Cell becomes the first serial killer feature in a long time to take the genre in a new direction. Not only does it defy formulaic expectations, but it challenges the viewer to think and consider the horrors that can turn an ordinary child into an inhuman monster. There are no easy answers, and The Cell doesn't pretend to offer any. Instead, Singh presents audiences with the opportunity to go on a harrowing journey. For those who are up to the challenge, it's worth spending time in The Cell." [...] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Tarsem uses the dramatically shallow plot to create a dream world densely packed with images of beauty and terror that cling to the memory even if you don't want them to." ...|$|E
5000|$|The fourth wave of {{feminism}} refers to various, conflicting assessments of recent developments within the feminist movement. The definition and {{boundaries of the}} term are currently much contested. In 2005, Pythia Peay first argued {{for the existence of}} a fourth wave {{of feminism}}, combining justice with religious spirituality. However, this spiritual component is not present in most other definitions for the term, which tend instead to focus on technological components. Jennifer Baumgardner identifies fourth-wave feminism as starting in 2008 and continuing into the present day. In her view fourth-wave feminism was inspired partly by Take Our Daughters to Work Days, incorporates online resources such as social media, in turn inspired the Doula Project for children's services and inspired after-abortion talk lines, pursuit of reproductive justice, plus-size fashion support, transgender support, and sex work acceptance; and led to developing media including Feministing, Racialicious, blogs, and Twitter campaigns. Researcher Diana Diamond defines fourth-wave feminism as a movement that [...] "combines politics, psychology, and spirituality in an overarching vision of change." [...] Kira Cochrane, author of [...] All the Rebel Women: The Rise of the Fourth Wave of Feminism, defines fourth-wave feminism as a movement that is connected through technology. In a 2009 interview with The New York Times, feminist author Jessica Valenti was asked whether or not she considered herself a third wave feminist, where she responded, [...] "I don’t much like the terminology, because it never seems very accurate to me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are considered third-wave feminists who are 20 years older than me." [...] After the interviewer's suggestion that perhaps feminism had moved forward into a fourth wave, Valenti stated that maybe the fourth wave was online.|$|E
