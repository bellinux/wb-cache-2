40|$|A {{simplified}} method for synthesizing spatially correlated earthquake ground motions is developed based on Hilbert transform and a reference earthquake record. In this method, one reference earthquake record {{is treated as}} the original ground motion, based {{on a series of}} generated ground motions. This procedure uses the instantaneous amplitude and the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> of the record obtained using Hilbert transform to achieve the nonstationarity of ground motion. To establish the coherency between generated ground motions, an incoherence model is employed to describe the relation between the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> at the present station and the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phases</b> at previous stations. This type of phase is defined as the <b>instantaneous</b> coherence <b>phase.</b> In addition, time lag is included in the <b>instantaneous</b> coherence <b>phase</b> to prescribe the wave passage effect. The proposed Hilbert-transform-based method is efficient and avoids cumbersome parameter estimations as well as other drawbacks involved in some traditional synthesizing methods.

40|$|A {{new method}} for <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> {{tracking}} of oscillatory signals {{in a narrow}} band frequency range is proposed. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD), as an adaptive and data-driven method for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary time series, is applied to a mixture of signals. Then, one of the resulted intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is used for estimating the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> of the signal in a certain frequency band. Since by applying EMD to the noisy signal the noise is distributed over the IMFs, the Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering (RBPF) is used to track the actual <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> from the noisy IMF. The formulated RBPF operates based on smoothing the instantaneous frequency traces in Hilbert domain and denoising the signal in time domain. Finally, the method is able to track the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phases</b> across consecutive time points. The method is applied to both simulated and real data. As an application, {{it can be used}} for mental fatigue analysis based on the changes in phase synchronization of different brain rhythms in different brain regions before and during the fatigue state...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDue to {{the limited}} {{resolution}} of seismic reflection data in imaging near vertical structures, structural models can have significant uncertainties related to fault geometries and position. These uncertainties can be reduced by performing a history matching analysis on {{a large number of}} structural models generated stochastically. This work investigates about the integration of vertical seismic profiling data as another way to constrain and reduce such uncertainties. Because travel-times are not sufficiently sensitive to fault geometry perturbations and because we cannot model amplitudes accurately, we rely on phase distortion of seismograms as they propagate through the faulted models. To extract <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> information from seismograms, we used the empirical mode decomposition algorithm. This approach offers several advantageous properties compared to computing the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> by analytic signal transformation. An <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> misfit was then defined as the L 2 norm of two <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> functions. A numerical experiment was carried out in which 60 fault networks were generated stochastically from a single 3 D interpretation of multiple cross sections; the 60 models were then ranked from the most similar up to the most dissimilar from a randomly chosen reference model.

40|$|The phase-locking value (PLV) is an {{important}} measure of synchronization when studying biosignals and especially electrical brain activities. Because the physical interpretation of the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> of broadband signals leads to difficulties, most applications using the PLV deal with narrowband signals. The paper presents a statistical analysis of the PLV {{under the influence of}} Gaussian, Uniform and Laplace noise when added to the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phases</b> and frequencies of mono- and two-component signals. We derive analytical expressions for the PLV values for these conditions and show that the PLV is rapidly dropping with increasing noise variance: broadening the frequency spectrum. We show that the noise influence on the instantaneous frequency is much more pronounced than on the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase.</b> We also introduce the concept of PLV-coherence time by analogy to optical coherence. Finally, we show that two signals with identical factitious instantaneous frequency as found in multicomponent signals can be phase locked leading to possible wrong interpretations of the PLV.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the blood flow velocities (BFV) in the middle cerebral arteries and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) recorded from a finger in healthy and post-stroke subjects during the quasi-steady state after perturbation for four different physiologic conditions: supine rest, head-up tilt, hyperventilation and CO_ 2 rebreathing in upright position. To evaluate whether instantaneous BP changes in the steady state are coupled with instantaneous changes in the BFV, we compare dynamical patterns in the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phases</b> of these signals, obtained from the Hilbert transform, as a function of time. We find that in post-stroke subjects the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> increments of BP and BFV exhibit well pronounced patterns that remain stable in time for all four conditions, while in healthy subjects these patterns are different, less pronounced and more variable. We propose a new approach based on the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> increments cross-correlation to quantify the coupling between BP and BFV. We find that the maximum correlation strength is different for the two groups and for the different conditions. For healthy subjects the amplitude of the cross-correlation between the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>phase</b> increments of BP and BFV is small and attenuates within 3 - 5 heartbeats. In contrast, for post-stroke subjects, this amplitude is significantly larger and cross-correlations persist up to 20 heartbeats. We compare the results of our approach with three complementary methods: direct BP-BFV cross-correlation, transfer function analysis and phase synchronization analysis.
