It {{was almost as}} lonely as that of Eustacia's grandfather, {{but the fact that}} it stood near a heath was {{disguised}} by a belt of firs which almost <b>enclosed</b> the <b>premises.</b> He journeyed on about a mile further to the village in which the owner lived, and, returning with him to the house, arrangements were completed, and the man undertook that one room at least should be ready for occupation the next day. Clym's intention was to live there alone until Eustacia should join him on their wedding day.|$|R
60|$|It {{had become}} quite dark {{when he reached}} the long wall that <b>enclosed</b> Demorest's <b>premises.</b> The wall itself excited his resentment, not only as {{indicating}} an exclusiveness highly objectionable in a man who had emigrated from a free State, but because he, Ezekiel Corwin, had difficulty in discovering the entrance. When he succeeded, he found himself before an iron gate, happily open, but savoring offensively of feudalism and tyrannical proprietorship, and passed through and entered an avenue of trees scarcely distinguishable in the darkness, whose mysterious shapes and feathery plumes were unknown to him. Numberless odors equally vague and mysterious were heavy in the air, strange and delicate plants rose dimly on either hand; enormous blossoms, like ghostly faces, seemed to peer at him from the shadows. For an instant Ezekiel succumbed to an unprofitable sense of beauty, and acquiesced in this reckless extravagance of Nature that was so unlike North Liberty. But the next moment he recovered himself, with the reflection that it was probably unhealthy, and doggedly approached the house. It was a long, one-storied, structure, apparently all roof, vine, and pillared veranda. Every window and door was open; the two or three grass hammocks swung emptily between the columns; the bamboo chairs and settees were vacant; his heavy footsteps on the floor had summoned no attendant; not even a dog had barked as he approached the house. It was shiftless, it was sinful--it boded no good to the future of Demorest.|$|R
40|$|Systems of defeasible {{reasoning}} {{are characterized}} by defeasible proofs, called arguments. I claim that sensible criteria of defeat among arguments in those systems are feasible, be it to a certain extent. As defeat eventually becomes unenforceable, the only option left is to pursue both arguments concurrently. This paper tries to confine the reach of defeat among arguments by means of several case studies, {{some of which are}} taken from the literature. 1. INTRODUCTION Reasoning beyond the information <b>enclosed</b> in the <b>premises</b> is a tempting but risky activity. It is tempting, because sheer deductive reasoning brings us no more than what was already recorded in the premises. And it is risky, because we might jump to the wrong conclusions. This is, very briefly, the issue of ampliative inference mechanisms. Ampliative inference can be defined as the result of rational non-deterministic non-monotonic reasoning (Loui, 1990). The term itself is suggested by the American philosopher Peirce (183 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In Seychelles, {{comprehensive}} {{tobacco control}} legislation enacted in 2009, and subsequent regulations, ban smoking in all enclosed places (defined as any area under a fixed or transient roof). A survey in October-November 2014 assessed i) the compliance to the Act and these regulations in 63 restaurants, bars or discotheques and ii) {{knowledge of the}} Tobacco control Act and these regulations of supervisors and managers of these hospitality premises; (47 agreed to answer). No person was found smoking in 92 % of all premises. However, "no smoking" signs did not conform to regulations in > 70 % of premises, and ashtrays were seen in 17 % of <b>enclosed</b> <b>premises.</b> All supervisors and managers (100 %) knew that smoking is banned in <b>enclosed</b> <b>premises</b> but < 15 % knew the fines liable to persons, respective owners of enclosed places, when a person smokes in an enclosed premise. Furthermore, 60 % of supervisors were not aware that no smoking signs must comply with a specific regulation and 40 % were not aware that ashtrays are not permitted in <b>enclosed</b> <b>premises.</b> In conclusion, the positive finding is that few persons smoke in restaurants, bars and discotheques, but the survey also showed that several aspects of regulations for tobacco control in <b>enclosed</b> <b>premises</b> are not well implemented. This calls for further information campaigns targeting {{both the public and}} the managers of hospitality premises, but also for strengthening enforcement measures, including fines for offenses. Scaling up comprehensive tobacco control measures, including full enforcement of clean air policy, is of paramount importance to meet the national target of 30 % reduction of the smoking prevalence between 2010 and 2025...|$|E
40|$|During {{proving ground}} tests there were {{revealed}} regularities of fire suppression in enclosed space by high expansion foam {{using the method}} of volumetric filling. It is shown that {{the structure of a}} dispersed phase, particularly of smoke, has a great influence on the resistance of foam to destruction. The impact mechanism of smoke components on the formation of high expansion foam basing on the condition of integrity preserving of foam agent water solution films is considered. A short description of the interaction of smoke components with foam is given. The influence of concentration and nature of surface-active substances (SAS), concentration and nature of smoke is investigated, as well as electrokinetic parameters of foam on the foam forming process with receiving the foams of a specified structure and with control of such parameters as frequency rate, dispersion, thickness of foam films, capillary pressure in a Plateau Gibbs channels. The results of proving ground tests are presented. It is shown that application of the compositions with the highest fatty alcohols (HFA) additives as stabilizers of foam leads to increase of its stability. It is also shown that increase of foam expansion rate and dispersion of foamy bubbles leads to increase of viscoelastic properties of foam. The analysis of the material balance of high expansion foam supplied for fire suppression in <b>enclosed</b> <b>premises,</b> without account for smoke existence in it, is carried out. It is shown that the given formula includes the balance of foam accumulated and destroyed under the influence of flame and hydrostatic pressure of a solution in foamy channels...|$|E
40|$|Pokladna događanja u Zagrebu, u razdoblju od početka 20. st. do kraja Prvoga svjetskog rata, razmotrena su u njihovu javnom aspektu, tj. opisane su zabave i druga zbivanja koja su se održavala na javnim gradskim, otvorenim i zatvorenim, prostorima. Opisom su obuhvaćena zbivanja uobičajena od Epifanije do Čiste srijede. Ishodom analize ustanovljeno je da su zagrebačka događanja dijelom široko rasprostranjene (srednjo) europske tradicije urbanih poklada; istodobno su i ukorijenjena u višestoljetno vlastito lokalno postojanje i obilježena lokalnom zbiljom. In this paper, a {{description}} is given of Carnival events {{as they were}} practised in Zagreb {{during the period from}} the beginning of the 20 th century until the end of World War I, that is, at a time when Zagreb (and Croatia) were part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Since daily newspapers from that time (Obzor and Novosti, and some others) have served as the basic source of the material, the Carnival events are described from their public aspect. These were entertainments and other events that were held in public city spaces, both in <b>enclosed</b> <b>premises</b> and out in the open. Zagreb Carnival events were made up of three parts. The first was a prolonged prologue that lasted from Epiphany (January 6) until Shrove Tuesday, which was crammed with numerous jocular get-togethers, held and attended by all the social strata. The second part represented the culmination of the events; it took place on Shrove Tuesday, when masked balls were organised, along with masked processions and mock street battles with the throwing of sugar-coated almonds. The symbolic conclusion on Ash Wednesday, the third part, was expressed in a twofold manner: by the physical "burial" of the Carnival Prince, who was drowned in the Sava River, and by the metaphysical farewell at the so-called herring feasts. Further on in the text a considerably summarised comment is given on the Carnival events that took place in the wartime era (1914 - 1918). The result of analysis has shown that the Zagreb Carnival events during the period in question were composed partly from the broadly disseminated pattern of (Central) European urban Carnivals, while, at the same time, being rooted in the centuries of their local existence, thus being marked by local reality...|$|E
40|$|Smoking {{has been}} {{prohibited}} by law {{in virtually all}} enclosed and substantially enclosed work and public places throughout the United Kingdom since July 2007. Smokefree legislation in England forms part of the Health Act 2006. Implementation followed {{the introduction of a}} similar law in Scotland in 20061, 2 and regulations in Wales and Northern Ireland (April 2007). Under the Health Act, “substantially <b>enclosed</b> ” means <b>premises</b> or structures with a ceiling or roof (including retractable structures such as awnings) and where there are permanent openings, other than windows or doors, which in total are {{less than half of the}} area of the walls. So, for example, bus stops can be required to be smokefree if the shelter is substantially enclosed. The law also applies to workplace vehicles which are used by more than one person at any time. Full details of the law including the detailed regulations can be accessed at: www. smokefreeengland. co. uk Exemptions to the Health Act 2006 There are very few exemptions to the law and where they do exist they do not apply to the entirety of the premises but to “designated rooms”. These include...|$|R
