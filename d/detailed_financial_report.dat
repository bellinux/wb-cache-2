Federal investigations into the company's billing practices, particularly those related to Medicare, began late in 2002, leading {{to a decline in}} Tenet’s stock price of about 70%. In 2003, Trevor Fetter became CEO of Tenet and started Commitment to Quality, an initiative to improve the “quality, safety, service and outcomes of the care and services” provided by Tenet. To rebuild its ethics and compliance programs, Tenet hired a chief compliance officer to report directly to the company’s board of directors In 2003, Tenet sold or closed 14 hospitals and closed more than 20 facilities in 2004 to achieve its financial performance goals. Also in 2004, Tenet moved its headquarters from Santa Barbara, CA to Dallas, TX. In 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million to the Justice Dept. to settle allegations of unusually high Medicare payments to Tenet hospitals in 2000 to 2002. Tenet also entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that required the company to provide <b>detailed</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> on its patient mix, collection rates and accounts receivables.

40|$|This paper investigates whether debt quality {{matters and}} the role of debt {{maturity}} choice. At the corporate level, the mismatch between debt maturity and other performance drivers results in widespread unexpected risks. Shortening maturity incentivizes more liquid investments, usually those that are less productive. At the same time, the shorter the maturity of debt the higher the probability of corporate default, given a fixed duration of the assets. At the financial level, longer maturity tends to increase the cost of debt, but has no clear impact on the probability of default. Corporate structure, namely dimension and private status, may exert a strong impact on such a trade-off. This paper presents an empirical analysis of a sample of Italian unlisted companies, examining the entire set of <b>detailed</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> for the five year period 2005 – 2009. Two subsets are identified, having separated out the companies which disappeared in the source database in 2011. Comparing the results from the two subsets contributes to better insulation of endogenous bankruptcy phenomena as proposed by Leland and Toft (1996). We find: (i) proof of L&T approach but that the creditors (rather than the shareholders) seem to be the generators of the endogenous default; (ii) evidence of impacts from debt maturity on business performance, particularly as a value driver of growing options; (iii) significant relations between debt maturity and company size; (iv) a specific contribution of debt maturity to the value of the tax shield...|$|R

The view is that comparability between companies’ <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> will result in greater transparency and more efficient capital markets and will improve the quality of the <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> A major step in this harmonization work is that more than 120 countries now follow International <b>Financial</b> <b>Reporting</b> Standards (IFRS). The fact that many countries today follow the same set of accounting standards means that harmonization has taken place at a de jure level, but it is unclear whether harmonized standards have also led to harmonization in practice (de facto harmonization). The aim of comparable financial information will be achieved only when the standards are applied consistently. The study investigates the factors that influence how individuals apply <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> standards in practice and whether conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> vary between individuals. The investigation consists of a study of annual reports from the years 1930 to 2012, as well as interviews with a number of individuals responsible for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> within the Volvo Group. The interviews were then analyzed using the phenomenographic research method with a view to identifying the different qualitative conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> The areas of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> that were the focus of the study are revenue and provisions. In addition to factors identified in prior literature, a finding of the study is that a significant factor in the application of the {{standards is}} individuals’ conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> For example, this includes views on who is the primary user of financial information, the fundamental principles that form the basis for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting,</b> how standards have been designed and how individual transactions are to be reflected in the <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> Five qualitatively different ways of looking at <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> are identified, indicating that conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> have not developed in harmony with the standards.
