25|$|Methane was {{discovered}} and isolated by Alessandro Volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from Lake Maggiore. It {{is the major}} component of natural gas, about 87% by volume. The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields, with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source (see Coal bed methane extraction, a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit, while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams). It is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels, and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by anaerobic <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil.|$|E
2500|$|Coal mining {{releases}} methane, {{a potent}} greenhouse gas. Methane is the naturally occurring {{product of the}} <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> as coal deposits are formed with increasing depths of burial, rising temperatures, and rising pressure over geological time. A portion of the methane produced is absorbed by the coal and later released from the coal seam (and surrounding disturbed strata) during the mining process. Methane accounts for 10.5 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions created through human activity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has a global warming potential 21 times {{greater than that of}} carbon dioxide over a 100-year timeline. [...] The process of mining can release pockets of methane. These gases may pose a threat to coal miners, as well as a source of air pollution. This is due to the relaxation of pressure and fracturing of the strata during mining activity, which gives rise to safety concerns for the coal miners if not managed properly. The buildup of pressure in the strata can lead to explosions during (or after) the mining process if prevention methods, such as [...] "methane draining", are not taken.|$|E

50|$|Natural gas {{has been}} a viable source {{of energy in the}} world. Consisting of mostly methane, natural gas is {{produced}} using two methods: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas comes from methanogenic organisms located in marshes and landfills, whereas thermogenic gas comes from the anaerobic <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> deep under the Earth's surface.

50|$|Strip tillage {{has some}} {{similarities}} with no-till systems because {{the surface is}} protected with residue. However, strip-till also has a similar effect on soil properties as conventional tillage systems because the farmer still breaks the soil’s crust which allows aerobic conditions to speed the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> A two-year study found that strip-till {{did not affect the}} amount of soil organic carbon or its extractable phosphorus.|$|E

50|$|A {{reduction}} in deep-water circulation will {{eventually lead to}} a serious decrease in deep-water oxygen concentrations due to biochemical oxygen demand associated with the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> that sinks into the deep-sea {{as a result of}} export production from surface waters. Oxygen depletion in bottom waters then favours the enhanced preservation of the sinking organic matter during burial in the sediments. Organic-rich sediments may also form in well-ventilated settings that have highly productive surface waters; here the high surface demand simply extracts the oxygen before it can enter the deep circulation currents so depriving the bottom waters of oxygen.|$|E

50|$|Acids {{released}} from plant roots include acetic and citric acids. During the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> Phenolic acids are {{released from}} plant matter and humic and fulvic acids are released by soil microbes. These organic acids speed up chemical weathering by combining {{with some of}} the weathering products in a process known as chelation. In the soil profile, the organic acids are often concentrated at the top while carbonic acid plays a larger role towards the bottom or below in the aquifer. As the soil column develops further into thicker accumulations, larger animals come to inhabit the soil and continue to alter the chemical evolution of their respective niche. Earthworms aerate the soil and convert large amounts of organic matter into rich humus, improving soil fertility. Small burrowing mammals store food, grow young and may hibernate in the pedosphere altering the course of soil evolution. Large mammalian herbivores above ground transport nutrients in form of nitrogen-rich waste and phosphorus-rich antlers while predators leave phosphorus-rich piles of bones on the soil surface, leading the localized enrichment of the soil below.|$|E

50|$|This fungus usually {{occurs as}} a mold present in {{numerous}} {{different types of}} soil as well as various <b>decaying</b> types <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Microascus brevicaulis has a world-wide distribution, and occurs chiefly as a soil saprotroph.

Besides the typical soil life of a decomposer, this fungus is also known to live within the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis. This relationship seems to be highly adapted but not as a classic host-parasite interaction. Studies have shown M. brevicaulis inhabits its host as an endosymbiont, and may provides protection against the insect-pathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae.|$|R

30|$|One {{possible}} {{source of}} the high bicarbonate in groundwater is the soil zone, by dissociation of carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3) generated by the reaction of CO 2 with H 2 O. CO 2 may be generated by the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the soil zone (Ganyaglo et al. 2010). The intense farming activities {{in the study area}} generate a lot of organic matter. This results in the enrichment of CO 2 in the soil zone, which is leached to the groundwater zone as HCO 3 −. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could also contribute to the high HCO 3 − values in the area.|$|E
30|$|The {{concentration}} of bicarbonate in shallow and deep tube wells {{was found with}} an average of 245.30 and 188.36  mg/L, respectively (Table  2).

However, it should not exceed 300  mg/L in the potable water, as it may lead to kidney stones {{in the presence of the}} higher {{concentration of}} Ca, especially in dry climatic regions. The elevated values suggest that the groundwater system was open to soil CO 2, resulting from the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and root respiration, which in turn, combines with rainwater to form bicarbonate (Matthess and Harvey 1982).|$|E
