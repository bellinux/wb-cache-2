50|$|Tensiomyography is {{a simple}} to use {{selective}} and non-invasive method for detecting skeletal muscle contractile parameters using the linear <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor.</b> It assesses skeletal muscle thickening and low frequency lateral oscillations of active skeletal muscle fibers during twitch contractions. Future directions should be multidimensional: further validation especially with muscle force; increasing the research power of established theories; determining the trends of physiological processes and adaptations through longitudinal designs; characterizing muscle fatigue, and developing its application in dynamic muscle contractions. Tensiomyography was originally designed {{to be used by}} medical professionals but has transitioned from medicine, through sports medicine and is now being utilized in sports training programs and post trauma rehabilitation.

40|$|This paper investigates if the {{relative}} displacement measurements from newly developed relative <b>displacement</b> <b>sensors</b> {{can be used}} to detect the damage of shear connectors in composite bridges under operational conditions. The relative displacements between slab and girders in composite bridges are measured when the bridge subjects to moving vehicle loads and used for condition monitoring. Continuous Wavelet Transform and Hilbert-Huang Transform are applied to analyze the measured dynamic responses and to identify the damage of shear connectors in the composite bridge model.
