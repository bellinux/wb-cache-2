5|$|Leofric survived William the Conqueror's 1068 {{siege of}} Exeter unscathed, {{although}} {{there is no evidence that}} he was present in the city during the siege. Whether Leofric had originally supported King Harold against William or if he supported William from the start is unclear. The fact that he survived William's purge of the native English bishops in 1070 is evidence that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have been too outspoken against William. Leofric remained bishop until he died on 10 February or 11 February 1072. He was buried in the crypt of his cathedral. When the cathedral was rebuilt, his remains were moved to the new church, but the location of the tomb has been lost. The current tomb only dates from 1568 and does not mark Leofric's resting place.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E

25|$|He {{was granted}} bail on July 12, after $10,000 was paid by two sureties, {{one of which}} was the Québec provincial deputy Amir Khadir, from the Québec Solidaire Party. In {{addition}} to this bail, $75,000 more, guaranteed this time by Amir Khadir and two other people whose identities were not revealed, will be charged if Singh breaks his release conditions, which are the following: house arrest at the home of one of the garantors; handing in his passport to the authorities; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> use a cellular phone; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have any contact with the 16 other activists charged with conspiracy in connection with the G20 protests.|$|E
25|$|The wild {{worship of}} {{lawlessness}} and the materialist worship of law {{end in the}} same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy {{in the land of}} nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> grasp anything, and the other because <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.|$|E

25|$|The series {{begins with}} the arrival of Kal-El's {{spacecraft}} in Smallville during a massive meteor shower that affects the rural town for years to come. Jonathan and Martha Kent find the child and adopt him with the help of Lionel Luthor. The Kents raise Clark and instruct him that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> reveal his powers to anyone. Clark initially becomes friends with Lex Luthor, but Lex's obsession with learning Clark's secret drives them to become enemies.|$|E
25|$|The way a DP can bind {{given this}} domain {{depends on the}} kind of that DP that is being bound. Anaphors (reflexives pronouns like herself and reciprocals like each other) must be bound in their domain, meaning they must have a c-commanding {{antecedent}} in their domain. Pronouns (such as she or <b>he)</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be bound in their domain, meaning they cannot have a c-commanding antecedent in their domain. Finally, R-expressions (such as proper names, descriptions, or epithets) must not be bound, meaning they must not have a c-commanding antecedent at all.|$|E

Once he goes to the past, however, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> just resist accepting slavery as the normal state of affairs, but dissociate himself from the unrestricted power white males enjoy as their privilege.His prolonged stay in the past transforms him from a naive white man oblivious about racial issues into an anti-slave activist fighting racial oppression.|$|E
25|$|If a {{responder}} begins rendering aid, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> {{leave the}} scene {{until it is}} necessary to call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This {{can be as simple as}} a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.|$|E

25|$|Mounted on his horse, Luna then charged {{into the}} {{battlefield}} leading his main force in a counterattack. As they advanced, the American forces began firing upon them. Amidst the fire, Luna's horse was hit {{and he fell}} to the ground. As he recovered, Luna {{realized that he had}} been shot in the stomach. Seeing the Americans coming towards him and deciding that <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> let himself be captured, he attempted to kill himself with his revolver. He was saved, though, by the actions of a Filipino colonel named Alejandro Avecilla who, having seen Luna fall, rode towards the general to save him. Despite being heavily wounded in one of his legs and an arm, with his remaining strength Avecilla carried Luna away from battle to the Filipino rear. Upon reaching safety, Luna realized that his wound was not very deep as most of the impact of the bullet had been taken by a silk belt full of gold coins that his parents had given him, which he had been wearing. As he left the field to have his wounds tended, Luna turned over the command to General Venacio Concepción, the Filipino commander of the nearby town of Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The two {{met again}} in July at Fremland in Essex. Garnet told Catesby that he [...] "wished {{him to look}} what he did if he {{intended}} anything. That he must first look to the lawfulness of the act itself, and then <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have so little regard of Innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for the Commonwealth." [...] When Catesby offered to tell the priest more, Garnet declined: [...] "I told him what charge we all had of quietness and to procure the like in others." [...] Garnet also spoke with William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, asking him [...] "if Catholics {{were able to make}} their part good by arms against the King", but Monteagle's reply was vague. [...] Author Alan Haynes suggests that Garnet may at that point have become marginalised.|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] also touches {{upon the}} issue of euthanasia, and whether it is morally or {{ethically}} wrong to commit suicide. The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience {{it would be for}} Stan. This is most strongly illustrated {{at the end of the}} episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of [...] "natural causes", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, [...] "Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a bright, though strange {{flickering}} {{of pleasure}} and pain over Cilla's face, and her eyelids quivered as she said, 'Yes--yes--of course; but <b>he</b> <b>must</b> not--he <b>must</b> <b>not</b> do it! <b>He</b> cannot afford it! I cannot let him!' ...|$|R

500|$|Giles' truth, {{according}} to Whedon, {{is that he}} realizes <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> [...] "fight my kid's battles or my kid will never grow up", which he sings in [...] "Standing" [...] while he throws knives at Buffy {{as part of her}} training. Whedon remarked that this touch [...] "is the kind of complete turnaround that is a staple of the Buffy universe". Tara's heartfelt love song also has an ironic subtext; although she appears to mean that she is fulfilled by her relationship with Willow, the lyrics include multiple allusions to Willow working her manipulative will over Tara, overlaid with Tara's euphoric singing about her pleasure in their union. In , Lorna Jowett calls the song between Willow and Tara the transformational event in their relationship, from Tara's subservient bearing towards Willow, into a relationship of equals. Two Buffy essayists note that Willow and Giles sing together {{at the start of the}} episode, but later Tara and Giles share a duet to express the diminished part each plays in their respective relationships.|$|E
500|$|Crowley was bisexual, and {{exhibited}} a sexual preference for women, with his homosexual relationships being fewer and clustered {{in the early}} part of his life. In particular he had an attraction toward [...] "exotic women", and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that [...] "when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived". Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma. During homosexual anal intercourse, he usually played the passive role, which Booth believed [...] "appealed to his masochistic side". Crowley argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation, commenting that a person [...] "must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise." [...] On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.|$|E
500|$|However, {{close friends}} of Grant {{saw that his}} public support was slipping. John Russell Young took Grant aside {{and told him that}} he would lose the election, and should {{withdraw}} to avoid embarrassment. Young argued that Grant was being heavily attacked by opponents, who were against the concept of a presidential third term. Young also criticized the handling of the campaign and told Grant that if he won the election, he would be indebted to the [...] "triumvirate". Grant felt that his Stalwart friends had been of great assistance in his election bid, and they deserved political patronage in his administration. Grant, nonetheless, listened to Young's advice and wrote a letter to J. Donald Cameron, authorizing his name to be withdrawn from the nomination contest after consultation with his other Stalwart backers. Upon hearing of his letter, Julia Grant was insistent that her husband should not withdraw his name from the contest. She said, [...] "If General Grant were not nominated, then let it be so, but <b>he</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> withdraw his name – no, never." [...] Young delivered the letter to the [...] "triumvirate" [...] in Chicago on May 31, but no action was taken to remove Grant's name.|$|E

5000|$|Brabin {{ruled in}} the case R v Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, ex parte Blackburn on {{the duty of the}} Crown to prosecute. The case was {{described}} as follows: [...] "A and B are alleged to have committed a crime. A is charged with the crime, convicted and sentenced. B is not charged. At the trial of A there is evidence which suggests that B may have committed or been a participant to the crime. Can the prosecution be compelled to prosecute B?" [...] In 1968, the Court of Queen's Bench of Widgery CJ, Melford Stevenson and Brabin issued judgment that [...] "to prosecute must indisputably be a matter of discretion", and that [...] "No minister of the Crown can tell (the Commissioner) that <b>he</b> <b>must,</b> or <b>must</b> <b>not,</b> keep observation on this place or that; or that <b>he</b> <b>must,</b> or <b>must</b> <b>not,</b> prosecute this man or that one. Nor can any police authority tell him so. The responsibility for law enforcement lies on him. He is answerable to the law and to the law alone." ...|$|R
