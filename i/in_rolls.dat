25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, <b>in</b> <b>Rolls</b> Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the circulated coinage, investors wanted the new 1964 pieces (especially the half dollar) and a lively market <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> and large canvas bags of coins developed {{in the pages of}} Coin World, with the advertisements examined at congressional hearings. Some banks were offered ample quantities of coin at a premium, or the exchange of bags of old coinage for the new; most refused, and bank employees who cooperated with would-be accumulators were fired. [...] Numismatic writer David Lange pointed out that the collecting of recent coins <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> peaked in 1964, and believed the coin collecting hobby's blame for the shortage unfair.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{embarked}} on her Drowned World Tour in 2001, [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] was added {{as the second}} song in the setlist. The costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and had varied accessories like spiked dog collars, Swarovski crystal-encrusted bracelets and tattered tops. Michael Schimdt {{was responsible for the}} accessroies; he was sought out by Madonna and her stylist Arianne Phillips, to help with finishing touches for many of the outfits. Madonna opened the show with the punk section, wearing tattered black garments and a tartan kilt and belting out the first song, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love". As the song ended, Madonna started with [...] "Impressive Instant", accompanied by her dancers wearing gas masks and encased <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> of black mesh, chasing the singer around the stage. In the middle of the song, she was carried around by her dancers. According to Stuart Lenig, author of the book The Twisted Tale of Glam Rock, Madonna merged choreography with narrative in the performance, as she and her dancers crossed the stage. The 1984-style robotic movements denoted fascism with the dancers stalking and then trying to grope Madonna; in the end one dancer dressed as a robot grabbed a big hosepipe and thrust it between Madonna's legs, as it emitted fog towards the audience. Lenig deduced that this could denote both an act of achieving orgasm or urination towards the crowd. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, {{one of the authors of}} the book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, found similarities with Madonna's exploration of lesbian cultural references from her earlier works, with the performance of [...] "Impressive Instant". The placement of the fogging machine between Madonna's legs were seen as symbols for the phallus and ejaculation, and was deduced as an example of the singer's insistence on masculinity as [...] "performance". The dancers ultimately get subdued by Madonna, who finish off singing the song and takes up a Gibson Les Paul electric guitar to perform the next track, [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{possible}} origin {{for serving}} the sausages <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> is the pieman Charles Feltman, at Coney Island in New York City. In 1867 {{he had a}} cart made with a stove on which to boil sausages, and a compartment to keep buns fresh {{in which they were}} served. In 1871 he leased land to build a permanent restaurant, and the business grew, selling far more than just the [...] "Coney Island Red Hots" [...] as they were known.|$|E
2500|$|Others are {{credited}} with first serving hot dogs on rolls. A German immigrant named Feuchtwanger, from Frankfurt, in Hesse, allegedly pioneered {{the practice in}} the American midwest; there are several versions of the story with varying details. According to one account, Feuchtwanger's wife proposed {{the use of a}} bun in 1880: Feuchtwanger sold hot dogs on the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, and provided gloves to his customers so that they could handle the sausages without burning their hands. [...] Losing money when customers did not return the gloves, Feuchtwanger's wife suggested serving the sausages in a roll instead. In another version, Antoine Feuchtwanger, or Anton Ludwig Feuchtwanger, served sausages <b>in</b> <b>rolls</b> at the World's Fair– either at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, or, earlier, at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, in Chicago– again, allegedly because the white gloves provided to customers to protect their hands were being kept as souvenirs.|$|E

[...] This feature made it easier to identify the source of an individual, used stamp and track down production problems. The codes evolved further in the year 2010 when a year code was included as well. For instance MBIL/M11L means that the stamp came from a Business Sheet in 2011. The source codes are as follows: MBIL- From Business Sheets, MCIL- From Custom Retail Books with four Machins and two Special or Commemorative Stamps, MFIL- From Books of Four, MPIL- From Prestige Books, MRIL- From Coil Stamps <b>in</b> <b>Rolls,</b> MSIL- From Books of Six, MTIL- From Books of Twelve, and No source codes at all for Machin Stamps from Counter Sheets, though these do carry year codes.|$|E
