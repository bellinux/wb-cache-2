25|$|The {{flat-headed cat}} was {{initially}} {{placed in the}} genus Felis by Vigors and Horsfield, who first described the cat in 1827 from Sumatra. In 1951, Ellerman and Morrison-Scott grouped Felis planiceps with Felis viverrina, the <b>fishing</b> <b>cat,</b> as being distributed in Lower Siam, the Malay States, Sumatra and Borneo, and recorded from Patani. In 1961, it was subordinated to the genus Prionailurus by the German biologist Weigel who compared fur pattern of wild and domestic felids. In 1997, researchers from the National Cancer Institute confirmed this taxonomic ranking following their phylogenetic studies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>cats</b> are {{threatened}} by destruction of wetlands, which are increasingly being polluted and converted for agricultural use and human settlements. In Andhra Pradesh, target killing is prevalent in some areas where there is human/animal conflict.

25|$|Including Sri Lankan elephant, 44 {{species of}} mammals are {{resident}} in Yala National Park, {{and it has}} one of the highest leopard densities in the world. 25 individual leopards are estimated to roam in Block I. The elephant herd of Yala contains 300350 individuals. The sloth bear, leopard, elephant, and wild water buffalo are all threatened species that Yala is harbouring. Although water buffaloes are indigenous to Sri Lanka, most populations contain genes of the domestic stock or have descended from feral populations. Toque macaque, golden palm civet, red slender loris, and <b>fishing</b> <b>cat</b> are among the other mammals that can be seen in Yala. The elephant population of the park varies seasonally.|$|E

25|$|The thick fur is reddish-{{brown on}} top of the head, dark roan brown on the body, and mottled white on the underbelly. The face is lighter in color than the body, and the muzzle and chin are white. Two {{prominent}} buff whitish streaks run {{on either side of the}} nose between the eyes. The ears are rounded. The eyes are unusually far forward and close together, compared with other cats, giving the felid improved stereoscopic vision. The teeth are adapted for gripping onto slippery prey, and the jaws are relatively powerful. These features help the flat-headed cat to catch and retain aquatic prey, to which it is at least as well adapted as the <b>fishing</b> <b>cat.</b> Legs are fairly short. Claws are retractable, but the covering sheaths are so reduced in size that about two-thirds of the claws are left protruding.|$|E

500|$|Jarre {{struggled}} with classical piano studies, although he later changed teachers {{and worked on}} his scales. A more general interest in musical instruments was sparked by his discovery at the Saint-Ouen flea market, where his mother sold antiques, of a Boris Vian trumpet violin. He often accompanied his mother to Le Chat Qui Pêche (The <b>Fishing</b> <b>Cat),</b> a friend's Paris jazz club, where saxophonists Archie Shepp and John Coltrane, and trumpet players Don Cherry and Chet Baker were regular performers.

In the summer, elephants {{can be seen in}} herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurgii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) {{are found in}} the rivers. Butterflies [...] and birds of the region include red Helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar avatar), jungle babbler, tawny-bellied babbler, great slaty woodpecker, red-breasted parakeet, orange-breasted green pigeon and chestnut-winged cuckoo.

2500|$|There are 10 {{recorded}} {{species of}} mammals inhabiting the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. The Asian Small-Clawed Otter (Aonyx cinerea) [...] and the Smooth-coated Otter (Lutra perspicillata) are {{both on the}} IUCN Red List as Vulnerable species and <b>Fishing</b> <b>Cat</b> (Prionailurus viverrinus) is presently listed as Endangered. Aonyx cinerea are considered ‘bioindicators’ of wetland ecosystems, therefore declining populations within Thale Noi are concerning and indicates deteriorating ecological conditions that threatens the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem. The most significant threat to these species are the loss of habitat and population fragmentation due to land conversion into rice paddies and shrimp farms (Mukherjees et al. 2010). [...] Over-fishing and trapping may {{also contribute to the}} declining <b>Fishing</b> <b>Cat</b> population in the region, due to a reduction of food availability and increased risk of being killed by farmers protecting their stock or being sold in the illegal pet trade. A recent study in 2013 [...] found that Fishing Cats in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area were almost completely nocturnal, making recording individual numbers difficult to establish.|$|E
