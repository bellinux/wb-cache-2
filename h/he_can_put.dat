500|$|Other themes {{prevalent}} in the episode include Lori's pregnancy. After getting into a heated argument, Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy. Although he didn't question who the biological father was, Robert Kirkman felt that Rick was [...] "smart {{enough to know that}} the kid's either his or Shane's and there may not be any way of ever finding out that definitively." [...] He continued: [...] "Bringing that up to his wife, who he loves, is only going to be painful for her. I think that’s him being a good husband and him showing his tremendous leadership ability in that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> his self aside for the betterment of someone else." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{joining the}} Marlins in 2006, Ross {{was forced to}} shave his beard, in order {{to comply with the}} Marlins' no facial hair policy. Manager Joe Girardi quipped, [...] "Maybe <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> it on top of his head." [...] He was used as a backup outfielder but got many starts at all three outfield {{positions}} throughout the year, especially from June 10 through 30, July 21 through August 8, and September 11 {{through the end of the}} season. On September 11, Ross hit a three-run home run against David Williams and a pair of two-run home runs against Heath Bell and Royce Ring in a 16–5 win over the New York Mets. His three home runs and seven RBI in the game tied Marlins records. Ross's five home runs and 14 RBI in September were more than he had in any other month that season. In 91 games (250 at bats) with the Marlins in 2006, Ross batted [...]212 with 53 hits, 11 doubles, 11 home runs, and 37 RBI.|$|E
60|$|He can do two things--he can revenge himself {{upon the}} author of his ruin, and he be bold enough, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> an end to his {{existence}} and his sorrows at a blow.|$|E
6000|$|And again, {{after an}} interval, Armine spoke of Jock, saying, [...] "You'll help him, Johnny. You know {{sometimes}} <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>put</b> in mind—-" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Mr. Hawkyard. 'I {{think that}} sounds promising; I think that sounds hopeful. And <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>put</b> by {{himself in a}} ward, for a night or two, you say?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Aristotle also {{mentions}} {{two other}} possibilities that <b>he</b> argues <b>can</b> be <b>put</b> aside: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hired the}} man to drive me. I suppose <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> up here, and go back to-morrow. Your husband will no doubt set me {{on my way to}} the railroad, when I go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{always think}} when I see her that I'm {{sitting down to}} dinner with my own housemaid. I never saw such a woman. How <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> up with it! But I don't suppose he cares for anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear me {{the young}} man is only putting off the evil day. His skin {{will have to be}} tough indeed if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> up with [...] . . . well! with what he will get when this {{business}} becomes known." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think he}} (Benito Mussolini) must do something, if he cannot make a graceful dive he {{will at least}} have to jump in somehow; <b>he</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>put</b> on his dressing-gown and walk down the stairs again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're {{generally}} built loose, of split-rails, and not nailed. An energetic man {{can pull}} off a bar or two and stride over. If it's necessary, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> afterward <b>put</b> them up again, and there's no harm done." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mad! Does {{he think}} he can shirk his {{responsibility}} to his wife because she is my daughter? Does he think, because his mother's father was a baronet, that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> Henrietta aside the moment her society palls on him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's being none {{whatever}} is just why I {{can afford to}} speak. It's so much less my business than any one's else that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> me off with anything he chooses. But it will be {{by the way he}} does this that I shall know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as you say, Clem," [...] {{her father}} assented. [...] "Why not Brother Osson, he'a?" [...] he {{suggested}} with a {{pleasure in the}} joke, whatever it was, that the minister's relation to Clementina involved. [...] "I guess <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> off his visit to Boston long enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Maybe I do,” was Mallory’s slow answer. “Yes, I am sure I do,” <b>he</b> added. “You <b>can</b> <b>put</b> {{the puzzle}} {{together}} {{yourself if you}} wish, Porter—because, you see, I hate to accuse anybody.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose he}} will first try if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> lift the great stone a, and if <b>he</b> <b>can,</b> <b>he</b> will <b>put</b> it very simply on {{the tops of}} the two pillars, as at A.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he looked}} as if he didn't!" [...] went on Mr. Fyshe. [...] "That's the deuce of it. That man when <b>he</b> wants to <b>can</b> <b>put</b> on a look, sir, that simply means nothing, {{absolutely}} nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If my wife desires you to go, certainly," [...] he replied. [...] "But Fenella," [...] he added, [...] "I am {{not very}} busy myself. Is it {{absolutely}} necessary that you lunch with your brother? Perhaps, {{even if it}} is, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> up with my society for once." ...|$|E
60|$|To anybody {{not used}} to {{scenarios}} this looks a large order. Eighteen years seems difficult {{to put on the}} screen. In reality this is exactly where the trained movie man sees his chance. Here <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> in anything and everything that he likes, bringing in, in a slightly mediaeval form, all his favourite movie scenes.|$|E
60|$|When a banker, in {{addition}} to his other functions, is also an issuer of paper money, he gains an advantage similar to that which the London bankers derive from their deposits. To the extent to which <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> forth his notes, he has so much the more to lend, without himself having to pay any interest for it.|$|E
50|$|Ease of learning: Physical Etoys {{reduces the}} {{complexity}} of code abstraction letting the kid experiment with virtual objects which are closely related with the real objects and vice versa. Physical Etoys also proposes a gradual programming learning curve: when the kid has the maturity <b>he</b> <b>can</b> automatically <b>put</b> his first step on Smalltalk and go into more complex topics.|$|R
50|$|The game's opening {{cinematic}} shows {{a spaceship}} crashing onto a mining colony. The ship's occupant dies {{shortly after the}} crash. The space-traveler's brain is saved and it is transplanted into cyborg body. His memory is erased so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>put</b> to work. The memory wipe fails and the player, as the unwilling cyborg, must escape.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{really does}} ask him,' said Aunt Jane. 'Your cousin David, I mean. He says that <b>he</b> and Harry <b>can</b> <b>put</b> {{up all the}} three boys between them, {{and that they will}} be very useful in the Christmas festivities of Coalham.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And if I was,' he went on, 'you {{might have}} con-jectured, miss, {{it was for}} our mutual advantage. A {{business}} man don't go {{out of his way}} unless he expects to turn an honest dollar; and he don't reckon on other folks going out of theirs, unless he knows <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> them in the way of turning an honest dollar with him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon, miss,' he said, {{awakening}} from his abstraction, 'but, however submissive to you, I have my position, though a servant. Mr. Copperfield and you, miss, are different people. If Mr. Copperfield wishes {{to know anything}} from me, I take the liberty of reminding Mr. Copperfield that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> a question to me. I have a character to maintain.' ...|$|E
60|$|An education, {{when it is}} all {{written out}} on foolscap, covers nearly ten sheets. It takes about six years of severe college {{training}} to acquire it. Even then a man often finds that he somehow hasn't got his education just where <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> his thumb on it. When my little book of eight or ten pages has appeared, everybody may carry his education in his hip pocket.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he must not enforce {{whatever}} he thinks best; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as best <b>he</b> <b>can</b> to <b>put</b> into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hartwell, who {{has your}} district, {{is as good}} a man as <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>put</b> with. <b>He</b> is a careful officer, though perhaps a little slow; but he will be a good man for Reuben to serve under, and I know the chief will put him with him if I ask him, as it can't make any {{difference}} where he goes first." ...|$|R
50|$|Rosario has {{the height}} and build {{to play as}} a power forward or even a center and he’s also mobile and {{athletic}} {{enough to be a}} small forward. He has also developed a decent outside shot extending to the three-point area which makes him a tough cover considering that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> also <b>put</b> the ball on the floor and score on the low block.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell Mr. Wright that I've {{got through}} with his company, an' <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> {{a man in}} my place {{whenever}} it suits him," [...] the miner said to the messenger, and the latter had hardly reached the store before a workman from Blacktown arrived with the startling intelligence that the four who {{had been accused of}} the robbery had purchased a large tract of land on the mountain, and were about to open a mine.|$|E
6000|$|... 'True, quite true. It is a {{desirable}} {{position for a}} rich man, or a rich man's eldest son, or even for a poor man, if by getting into Parliament <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> himself {{in the way of}} improving his income. But, my dear Tudor, you are in none of these positions. Abandon the idea, my dear Tudor--pray abandon it. If not for your own sake, at any rate do so for that of your wife and child.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home" [...] {{is another}} example. It is the lyricist's staff of life. But {{all he can}} do is to roam across the foam, if he wants to use it. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> in [...] "Nome," [...] of course, as a pinch-hitter in special crises, but very seldom; with the result that his poetic soul, {{straining}} at its bonds, goes and uses [...] "alone," [...] "bone," [...] "tone," [...] and [...] "thrown," [...] exciting hoots of derision.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind that. What {{kind of a}} show <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> up? You've been {{conditioning}} and training fighters all your life. I take off my hat to your judgment. <b>Can</b> <b>he</b> give the public a run for its money?" ...|$|R
50|$|An attacking {{player is}} offside {{if he is}} in front of the ball: if he {{is in front of}} a ball which is then kicked, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be <b>put</b> onside if the kicker {{subsequently}} moves ahead of him before the ball is caught. If not, he must stand 10m away from the player who catches the ball (as if he were the acting half-back at a play-the-ball) or be penalised.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} to get away as far as <b>he</b> <b>can</b> before <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> up for the night," [...] said Andy. [...] "I do not believe we will catch him until we reach the place at which he is stopping." ...|$|R
