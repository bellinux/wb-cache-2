5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel <b>gas</b> <b>pipe</b> and mild steel rods.|$|E

25|$|For {{the murders}} of his final three victims, Christie {{modified}} the gassing technique he had first used on Muriel Eady; he simply used a rubber tube connected to the <b>gas</b> <b>pipe</b> in the kitchen which he kept closed off with a bulldog clip. He seated his victims in the kitchen, released the clip on the tube, and let gas leak into the room. The Brabin Report pointed out that Christie's explanation of his gassing technique was not satisfactory because {{he would have been}} overpowered by the gas as well. Nevertheless, it was established that all three victims had been exposed to carbon monoxide. The gas made his victims drowsy, after which Christie strangled them with a length of rope.|$|E

However, the relationship between father and sons continued to be tempestuous; Gallagher said that [...] "because we were always arguing we'd still be working at nine o'clock every night". Having left his father's building company, he took a job at another building firm sub-contracted to British Gas. There he sustained an injury when a heavy cap from a steel <b>gas</b> <b>pipe</b> landed on his right foot. Following a period of recuperation, Gallagher was offered a less physically demanding role in the company's storehouse, freeing up time for him to practise guitar and write songs. He claimed to have written at least three of the songs on Definitely Maybe in this storehouse (including [...] "Live Forever" [...] and [...] "Columbia"). He later called the storehouse [...] "The Hit Hut" [...] and claimed the walls were painted gold. Much of the late 1980s found Gallagher unemployed and living in a bedsit, occupying his time with recreational drug use, songwriting, and guitar playing. He is left-handed, but plays right-handed.|$|E
500|$|According to the Comisión Federal de Electricidad, 4,000 {{customers}} lost {{electric power}} in the Monterrey metropolitan area, as did 61,000 people statewide. 18 wells lost power, leaving 110,000 without water service in the municipalities of Santa Catarina and García. Heavy flooding occurred along the Santa Catarina River in Monterrey, normally a dry river bed that flows into the Rio Grande, causing it to reach a record flow of [...] The flooded stream washed away multiple parked vehicles, a popular flea market, and sport facilities built within a riverside greenway. The Santa Catarina River also destroyed about [...] of Monterrey's main arterial streets. Multiple washouts caused {{the closure of the}} divided highway between Monterrey and Saltillo, Coahuila. In San Nicolás de los Garza, the Arroyo Topo Chico exceeded its banks, forcing multiple street closures. An explosion and fire occurred on a bridge in the Guadalupe municipality when a transformer fell on an old <b>gas</b> <b>pipe.</b> No injuries were reported due to the fire. In Linares, the rainfall from Alex's remnants caused a wing of the municipal townhouse, which was built in 1896, to collapse. The building was listed as a protected historic building. A bridge on the Pilón River collapsed in Montemorelos, rupturing a 24-inch oil pipeline in the process. However, the valves on both ends of the pipeline section were closed, minimizing the leak over the river, and the leak was not expected to adversely impact drinking water supplies in El Cuchillo Dam. Hurricane Alex affected the infrastructure of 1,077 schools in the state, 60 of which were severely damaged and 552 held intermediate damage. Nationwide disruption in Internet connection and cell phone services was caused by damage to optical fibers, backbone nodes and telephonic central stations in Monterrey. Additionally, Telefónica reported damage to its network in Monterrey and Saltillo, causing intermittent unavailability of telecommunication services. Preliminary estimates of the damage in the state rose to $10 billion (2010 MXN; $762 million USD); final damage estimates released on August 5 totaled $16.9 billion (2010 MXN; [...] 1.35 billion USD) statewide.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} damage {{distribution}} of buried pipes due to recent earthquakes in Japan. First, various damage datasets, e. g. water <b>pipes,</b> low-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>pipes,</b> mid-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>pipes,</b> sewage lines, collapsed houses, liquefaction occurrences, are integrated on Geographic Information System (GIS). Using the datasets, {{spatial distribution of}} damages is investigated with respect to geomorphological land classification and altitude. Then, the damage ratios of lifeline systems are compared under various conditions. Finally, the minimum dis-tances among the damaged locations are measured and the spatial correlations of damages to the lifeline systems are evaluated. The {{results of this study}} suggest that the damage incidents to low-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>pipes</b> are often found near those to water distribution pipes. Hence, the interac-tions among functional losses of lifeline systems are expected to be taken into consideration in the restoration process after urban earthquakes...|$|R

However, a masked marauder, the [...] "Blue Spirit", helps Aang escape from his imprisonment, fighting off the Fire Nation soldiers under Zhao's command until the blue spirit realises they will be overwhelmed, at which point he takes Aang hostage to negotiate their way out. During the prison break, Zhao realizes that Zuko is the masked vigilante. He arranges to kill the prince, first by having a crossbowman fire a bolt over a huge distance that shatters the lower half of Zuko's mask and knocks him out, however Aang uses his skills to bend a cloud across the bridge connecting the prison {{to the other side of}} the valley, causing the Fire Nation soldiers in pursuit to stop in fear. With the cloud covering their escape, Aang escapes with an unconscious Zuko into a nearby forest and watches over Zuko until morning, when he leaves to reunite with Sokka and Katara. Zhao tries again to kill Zuko, this time by rupturing a <b>gas</b> <b>pipe</b> running through Zuko's quarters on Iroh's ship. Noticing the danger, Zuko manages to survive the attempt on his life with Iroh's help.

Upon arriving, Aang's group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe. Sokka quickly befriends the Northern Water Tribe princess, Yue. After a few agreements, a waterbending master, Pakku, teaches Aang waterbending. Katara also becomes a much stronger and more powerful waterbender due to her training with Master Pakku.|$|E
