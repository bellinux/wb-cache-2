This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations.

However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

However, some have criticized the song for failing to accurately represent South Korean culture. Oh Young-Jin, managing editor of The Korea Times, wrote that the dance has more to do with Americans than Koreans.|$|E

When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved.

For Robbie, {{this is a guy who}} has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one.

Duke responded on his personal website by saying that he had not actually endorsed Trump.

Duke claimed that [...] "Trump <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> clear that he's 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?" [...] In December 2015, Duke said Donald Trump speaks more radically than he does, advising that Trump's radical speech is both a positive and a negative. In February 2016, Duke urged his listeners to vote Trump, saying that voting for anyone besides Donald Trump “is really treason to your heritage.” In 2016, someone claiming to be David Duke filed a lawsuit in a federal court attempting to bar Trump from the Florida presidential primary. The real Duke referred to the hoax as [...] "the biggest, dirtiest trick I've seen recently".|$|E

Mr. Howells somewhere beautifully says that when he is most intimate in the disclosures of his own feelings he finds himself most widely responded to--or something like that. I really am eager to do this play. It has increased my wonder of your powers. I really begin to feel that I know only part of you. First Lillian's Duty taught me some of your stern Scotch morality. Then Enid's Choice revealed to me your conception of the integrity of a good woman's soul--that nothing can debase it. Alessandra disclosed your learning and your imaginative power.

Alessandra is a bitter and ironical concession. The Morning makes its splendor almost tawdry. It hurt me to go to rehearsal to-day. Westervelt's presence was a gloating presence, and I hated him.

60|$|We {{would gladly}} have stayed much longer; {{but it was}} drawing towards sunset, and the evening, though bright, was unusually cool, so we drove home; and on the way, Mr. Story told us of the horrible {{practices}} of the modern Romans with their dead,--how they place them in the church, where, at midnight, they are stripped of their last rag of funeral attire, put into the rudest wooden coffins, and thrown into a trench,--a half-mile, for instance, of promiscuous corpses. This is the fate of all, except those whose friends choose to pay an exorbitant sum to have them buried under the pavement of a church. The Italians have an excessive dread of corpses, and never meddle with those of their nearest and dearest relatives. They have a horror of death, too, especially of sudden death, and most particularly of apoplexy; and no wonder, as it gives no time for the last rites of the Church, and so exposes them to a fearful risk of perdition forever. On the whole, the ancient practice was, perhaps, the preferable one; but Nature <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{difficult for us to}} do anything pleasant and satisfactory with a dead body. God knows best; but I wish he had so ordered it that our mortal bodies, when we have done with them, might vanish out of sight and sense, like bubbles. A person of delicacy hates to think of leaving such a burden as his decaying mortality to the disposal of his friends; but, I say again, how delightful it would be, and how helpful towards our faith in a blessed futurity, if the dying could disappear like vanishing bubbles, leaving, perhaps, a sweet fragrance diffused {{for a minute or two}} throughout the death-chamber. This would be the odor of sanctity! And if sometimes the evaporation of a sinful soul should leave an odor not so delightful, a breeze through the open windows would soon waft it quite away.|$|E
