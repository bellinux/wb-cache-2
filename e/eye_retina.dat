For example, to see [...] "stygian blue": staring at bright yellow causes {{a dark blue}} afterimage, then on looking at black, the blue is seen as blue against the black, but {{due to lack of}} the usual brightness contrast it seems to be as dark as the black. The <b>eye</b> <b>retina</b> contains some neurons that fire only in the dark.|$|E
50|$|Putscher's {{retinopathy}} is {{a disease}} where part of the <b>eye</b> (<b>retina)</b> is damaged. Usually associated with severe head injuries, it may also occur {{with other types of}} trauma, such as long bone fractures, or with several non-traumatic systemic diseases. However, the exact cause of the disease is not well understood. There are no treatments specific for Purtscher's retinopathy, and the prognosis varies. The disease can threaten vision, sometimes causing temporary or permanent blindness.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eye's</b> <b>retina</b> in MS is also damage. Given that retina {{cells have}} no myelin, damage must be {{different}} from the autoimmune attack of the brain. The underlying condition in the retina produces pure neurodegeneration.|$|R

5000|$|Information for pre-attentive {{processing}} {{is detected}} through the five senses. In the visual system, the receptive fields {{at the back}} of the <b>eye</b> (<b>retina)</b> transfer the image via axons to the thalamus, specifically the lateral geniculate nuclei. [...] The image then travels to the primary visual cortex and continues on to be processed by the visual association cortex. At each stage, the image is processed with increasing complexity. Pre-attentive processing starts with the retinal image; this image is magnified as it moves from retina to the cortex of the brain. [...] Shades of light and dark are processed in the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus. [...] Simple and complex cells in the brain process boundary and surface information by deciphering the image's contrast, orientation, and edges. [...] When the image hits the fovea, it is highly magnified, facilitating object recognition. The images in the periphery are less clear but help to create a complete image used for scene perception.|$|E
5000|$|His {{research}} involves {{trying to}} understand how humans and other animals are able to perceive our surroundings and translate that into brain function which in turn leads to some action. For example, an animal identifying a predator and fleeing. Consequently, his research involves studying the retina, the visual system, {{and the development of}} visual perception. Using a combination of physiological, anatomical and molecular techniques his research has helped redefine {{the way we think about}} the visual system, [...] by demonstrating how genetic and environmental factors play complementary roles in shaping the proper wiring of the visual system. Specifically, his work has shown that neuronal activity does not instruct the formation of specific connections in the developing visual system, a view widely held in the field of developmental neurobiology. [...] This involved performing the first ever recordings from the primate fetal retina [...] and the manufacture of a novel neurotoxin [...] that selectively depletes cholinergic neurons from the developing retina.He is a co-editor of Development and Organization of the Retina: From Molecules to Function (1998), The Visual Neurosciences Vol. 1&2 (2004), <b>Eye,</b> <b>Retina,</b> and Visual System of the Mouse (2008), and Cerebral Plasticity: New Perspectives (2011) ...|$|E

5000|$|In general, GAPs tend to {{be pretty}} {{specific}} for their target G proteins. The exact mechanism of target specificity is not fully known, but {{it is likely that}} this specificity comes from a variety of factors. At the most basic level, GAP-to-G protein specificity may come simply from the timing and location of protein expression. RGS9-1, for example, is specifically expressed in the rod and cone photoreceptors in the <b>eye</b> <b>retina,</b> and is the only one to interact with G proteins involved in phototransduction in this area. [...] A certain GAP and a certain G protein happen to be expressed in the same time and place, and that is how the cell ensures specificity. Meanwhile, scaffold proteins can also sequester the proper GAP to its G protein and enhance the proper binding interactions. [...] These binding interactions may be specific for a particular GAP and G protein. Also, GAPs may have particular amino acid domains that recognize only a particular G protein. Binding to other G proteins may not have the same favorable interactions, and they therefore do not interact. GAPs can, therefore, regulate specific G proteins.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to design and {{implement}} a program capable of automatically generating synthetic images of eye retinas. The generated images should be {{similar to those of}} real retinas, which are hard to obtain, so they could be used for development of various algorithms, which work with <b>eye</b> <b>retina</b> images in their place. This thesis describes anatomic properties of the <b>eye</b> <b>retina,</b> ways to take images of it and also usage of <b>eye</b> <b>retina</b> recognition in biometric and medicinal applications. Design of the program {{and the way in which}} individual parts of the retina are assembled together into the final image is also explained in this thesis. These individual parts are created using procedural textures in separate layers of the image. Next chapter of this work describes implementation details of the program. The conclusion then experimentally verifies suitability of the generated images for algorithmic processing...|$|E

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is associated with}} a low level of macular carotenoids in the <b>eye</b> <b>retina.</b> Only two carotenoids, namely lutein and zeaxanthin are selectively accumulated in the human <b>eye</b> <b>retina</b> from blood plasma where more than twenty other carotenoids are available. The third carotenoid which is found in the human retina, meso-zeaxanthin is formed directly in the retina from lutein. All these carotenoids, named also macular xanthophylls, play key roles in eye health and retinal disease. Macular xanthophylls are thought to combat light-induced damage mediated by reactive oxygen species by absorbing the most damaging incoming wavelength of light prior to the formation of reactive oxygen species (a function expected of carotenoids in nerve fibers) and by chemically and physically quenching reactive oxygen species once they are formed (a function expected of carotenoids in photoreceptor outer segments). There are two major hypotheses about the precise location of macular xanthophylls in the nerve fiber layer of photoreceptor axons and in photoreceptor outer segments. According to the first, macular xanthophylls transversely incorporate in the lipid-bilayer portion of membranes of the human retina. According to the second, macular xanthophylls are protein-bound by membrane-associated, xanthophyll-binding proteins. In this review we indicate specific properties of macular xanthophylls that could help explain their selective accumulation in the primate retina with special attention paid to xanthophyll-membrane interactions...|$|E
