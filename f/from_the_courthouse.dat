25|$|The case arose {{after the}} {{picketing}} of a segregated restaurant on December 14, 1961, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, {{led to the}} arrest of 23 student protesters from Southern University, a black college. The next day, B. Elton Cox, a minister, arranged a protest of 2,000 people at the courthouse where the students were being held.

25|$|In 1916, an African American {{teenager}} named Jesse Washington was tortured, mutilated, {{and burned}} {{to death in the}} town square by a mob that seized him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> where he had been convicted of murdering a white woman. About 15,000 spectators, mostly citizens of Waco, were present. The commonly named Waco Horror drew international condemnation and became the cause célèbre of the nascent NAACP's anti-lynching campaign. In 2006, the Waco City Council officially condemned the lynching, which took place without opposition from local political or judicial leaders.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{appealed the}} COJ's ruling to the Supreme Court of Alabama on December 10, 2003. A special panel of retired judges and justices was {{randomly}} selected {{to hear the}} case. Moore argued that the COJ did not consider the underlying legality of the federal courts' order that the monument be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> The Alabama Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that the COJ {{did not have the}} authority to overrule the federal courts, only to determine whether Moore violated the Canons of Judicial Ethics. Therefore, the Court reasoned, it was enough to show that a procedurally-valid order was in place against Moore. Moore also argued that the COJ had imposed a religious test on him to hold his office, and that the COJ's actions had violated his own rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

500|$|A lifelong {{baseball}} fan, Landis often {{slipped away}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> for a White Sox or Cubs game.

In 1915, the upstart league brought suit against the existing leagues and owners under the Sherman Act and the case was assigned to Landis. Baseball owners feared that the reserve clause, which forced players to sign new contracts only with their former team, and the 10-day clause, which allowed teams (but not players) to terminate player contracts on ten days notice, would be struck down by Landis.|$|E

In November 2015, a committee, the Urban County Arts Review Board’s, voted to recommend removal of both the Breckinridge statue and the John Hunt Morgan statue <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Courthouse</b> grounds.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June 1966, Lamb {{appeared}} without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was [...] "hyperactive and agitated"; {{he was unable to}} sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.|$|E
500|$|On 18 September 1867, Kelly and Deasy {{were being}} {{transferred}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> to Belle Vue Gaol on Hyde Road, Gorton. They were handcuffed and locked {{in two separate}} compartments inside a police van escorted by a squad of 12mounted policemen. The van contained six prisoners: a 12-year-old boy who was being taken to a reformatory, three women convicted of misdemeanours, and the two Fenians. As it passed under a railway arch, a man darted {{into the middle of}} the road, pointed a pistol at the driver and told him to stop. Simultaneously, a party of about 30–40men leaped over a wall at the side of the road, surrounded the van and seized the horses, one of which they shot. The unarmed police were described by O'Meagher Condon, who organised the attack on the police van, as [...] "a miscellaneous lot, apparently embracing the long and short and the fat and lean of the Manchester force"; they offered little resistance and soon fled.|$|E

500|$|The {{hardest hit}} area during {{the storm was}} the Guadalupe River basin and its tributaries. A sign of the {{oncoming}} problem was a wall of water witnessed cascading down the Leona River in Uvalde. Like with Graham, Uvalde was ultimately flooded up to a block away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> [...] The Guadalupe River became heavily flooded, rising [...] in one hour. The rapid rise covered a bridge on U.S. Route 281, [...] north of San Antonio and prompted evacuations in a [...] area near the flood plains. The overflowing river was responsible for ten total deaths in Kendall and Kerr Counties and submerging Comfort under seven feet of water, killing four people there. The towns of Welfare and Center Point were also reported to be flooded. In nearby Hunt, a group of military personnel who entered the region to assist with rescues got stranded themselves. After receding, the Guadalupe steadily became filled again, prompting re-evacuations. Near Stonewall, the Pedernales overflowed its banks, covering the area in up to [...] of water and swamping the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. The only overflow to emanate from Mexico was from the Rio Conchos, which dumped its overflowing water into the Rio Grande and subsequently damaged the international bridge between Mexico and the United States in Presidio.|$|E
500|$|M-69 {{starts at}} the {{intersection}} of 5th Street and Superior Avenue in Crystal Falls, where it meets US2/US141. The Iron County Courthouse is located at the head of Superior Avenue and overlooks a steep hill headed east through downtown. The City of Crystal Falls states that the courthouse offers [...] "a view of the main street of the City and the scenic panorama of the valley at its feet". On a clear day, Iron Mountain can be seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> tower. It is from this starting point that M-69 descends Superior Avenue through downtown toward the Paint River in Iron County. The highway crosses the river on a historic bridge built in 1929 that features decorative lamp posts and railings. The bridge was rehabilitated for five months in 2002. This rehabilitation involved replacing the bridge deck, repairing the bridge's substructure, and restoring the lighting and railings to original designs. Because this bridge is listed on Michigan's list of historic bridges, the construction work had to preserve the original historic character of the bridge. Final construction was completed at a cost of $1,130,545 (equivalent to $ in [...] ). A complete bridge replacement would have cost 25% more without saving the historic bridge.|$|E
500|$|Knights of Pythias/Tyner Building [...] Designed by A. W.

[...] (See photo herein) [...] The three-story building also has decorative limestone elements that resemble flames — possibly in tribute to the Gas Boom. [...] "K of P" [...] can be found on a western tablet, while [...] "W.H. Tyner" [...] {{can be found in the}} eastern panel. Among the offices in this Main Street building in the early 1900s were a confectioner, a doctor, and an attorney. [...] The Knights of Pythias, Fraternal Order of Eagles, and Maccabees all held meetings in this building in the early 1900s. [...] During a tumultuous period in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had an office on the third floor of the building. Three events helped drive the Klan out of Hartford City — including one that happened in the Tyner building, and one that happened about four blocks away. First, a disturbing murder case against the state Klan leader disgusted many members. [...] (Charles E. Cox, uncle of local newsman and Cox Building owner Edward E. Cox, assisted in the prosecution of this case.) [...] Second, a safe in the Tyner Building was broken into, and the names of local Klan members were revealed. Third, violence that occurred at an event a few blocks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> caused the Hartford City mayor to order the local Klan leader out of town in 1926.|$|E

500|$|During the Troubles, Irish republican prisoners {{had escaped}} from custody en masse on several occasions. On 17 November 1971, nine prisoners dubbed the [...] "Crumlin Kangaroos" [...] escaped from Crumlin Road Jail when rope ladders were thrown over the wall. Two prisoners were recaptured, but the {{remaining}} seven managed {{to cross the}} border into the Republic of Ireland and appeared at a press conference in Dublin. On 17 January 1972, seven internees escaped from the prison ship HMS Maidstone by swimming to freedom, resulting in them being dubbed the [...] "Magnificent Seven". On 31 October 1973, three leading IRA members, including former Chief of Staff Seamus Twomey, escaped from Mountjoy Prison in Dublin when a hijacked helicopter landed in the exercise yard of the prison. Irish band The Wolfe Tones wrote a song celebrating the escape called The Helicopter Song, which topped the Irish popular music charts. 19 IRA members escaped from Portlaoise Jail on 18 August 1974 after overpowering guards and using gelignite to blast through gates, and 33 prisoners attempted to escape from Long Kesh on 6 November 1974 after digging a tunnel. IRA member Hugh Coney was shot dead by a sentry, 29 other prisoners were captured within a few yards of the prison, and the remaining three were back in custody within 24 hours. In March 1975, ten prisoners escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> in Newry while on trial for attempting to escape from Long Kesh. The escapees included Larry Marley, who would later be one of the masterminds behind the 1983 escape. (Marley was shot dead by loyalists in 1987.)
