However, the Fossdyke needed much maintenance to keep it clear of silt. Henry I had overseen the scouring of its channel, and there were inquiries in 1335, 1365 and 1518 to consider {{the state of the}} Fossdyke and to compel the inhabitants of the region to maintain it. Lincoln was a centre for the collection of business taxes, but this came at the cost of maintaining the waterways, and having finally decided it was too large a cost, James <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> the Fossdyke to the City of Lincoln.|$|E

Louis-Philippe, in his turn, presented it to his wife, Marie Amélie, who refurbished the gardens and reappointed the house.

25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman {{defeat at}} the Battle of Ankara in July 1402 and the {{subsequent}} disappearance of Sultan Bayezid <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> {{an opportunity for the}} Serbian magnates {{to take advantage of the}} turmoil and wield more autonomy in their political decision making. Having fought on the side of the Ottomans, they returned from Ankara through Byzantine-held territory. The new political landscape made for closer Byzantine–Serbian cooperation, and in August 1402, at Constantinople, Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos awarded one of the Serbian magnates, Stefan Lazarević, the very high title of Despot. Second only to imperial dignity, the title brought the bearer great honor. From Constantinople, Lazarević was hoping to pave the way for an independent Serbia. While staying there, he came to quarrel with another Serbian magnate, his nephew Đurađ Branković. Although the reasons remain unknown, fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini attributes the quarrel to Lazarević's suspicions that Branković wanted to join forces with Süleyman Çelebi, Bayezid's oldest son, who held power in Rumelia. The historian Dimitris Kastritsis notes that the rivalry between Branković and Lazarević dated back to the time of Bayezid, who had expelled Branković's father from his lands and granted some of them to Lazarević. Although Lazarević aimed to induce Emperor John VII to imprison Branković, it is not certain if he succeeded. In 1402, Lazarević ordered Branković imprisoned, but the latter spent little time in captivity, as he was freed with the help of a friend in September of that year. Branković immediately went to Süleyman Çelebi, whom he asked for troops to fight Lazarević.|$|E

The rapid prototyping capability of standard polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices has put the design and optimization of these innovative new tools directly {{into the hands of}} the microbiologists who are using them. This has caused a dramatic surge in the utilization of these devices by biological researchers in the past several years. In this dissertation <b>I</b> <b>present</b> original research in which microfluidic technologies were used to advance quantitative microbiology.

"When <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> my {{results at}} a meeting of the American Physical Society in 1923," [...] Compton later recalled, [...] "it {{initiated}} the most hotly contested scientific controversy that I have ever known." [...] The wave nature of light had been well demonstrated, and the idea that it could have a dual nature was not easily accepted. It was particularly telling that diffraction in a crystal lattice could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Compton and Alfred W. Simon developed the method for observing at the same instant individual scattered X-ray photons and the recoil electrons. In Germany, Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger independently developed a similar method.|$|E
500|$|Family lore {{said that}} the Cabrais were {{descendants}} of Caranus, the legendary first king of Macedonia. Caranus was, in turn, a supposed 7th-generation scion of the demigod Hercules. Myths aside, the historian James McClymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to the true origin of Cabral's family. According to that tradition, the Cabrais derive from a Castilian clan named the Cabreiras [...] (cabra is Spanish for goat) who bore a similar coat of arms. The Cabral family rose to prominence during the 14th century.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} <b>I</b> <b>present</b> a novel, physically-based {{approach to}} digital painting. With the interactive simulation techniques <b>I</b> <b>present,</b> digital painters {{can work with}} digital brushes and paints whose behavior is similar to real ones. Using this physically-based approach, a digital painting system can provide artists with a versatile and expressive creative tool, {{while at the same}} time providing a more natural style of interaction enabled by the emulation of real-world implements. I introduce several specific modeling techniques for digital painting. First, <b>I</b> <b>present</b> a physically-based, 3 D, deformable, virtual brush model based on non-linear quasi-static constrained energy minimization. The brush dynamics are computed using a skeletal physical model, which then determines the motion of a more complex geometric model. <b>I</b> also <b>present</b> three different models for capturing the dynamic behavior of viscous paint media, each offering a different trade-off between speed and fidelity—from 2 D heuristics, to 3 D partial differential equations. Accurate modeling of the optical behavior of paint mixtures and glazes is also important, and for this <b>I</b> <b>present</b> a real-time, physically-based rendering technique, based on the Kubelka-Munk equations and an eight-sample color space. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>present</b> techniques for modeling the haptic response of brushes in an artist’s hand, and demonstrate that all these techniques can be combined to provide the digital painter with an interactive, virtual painting system with a working style similar to real-world painting...|$|R
