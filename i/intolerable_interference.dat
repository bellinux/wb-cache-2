In November, residents {{in the community of}} Ribeira da Areia in the civil parish of Norte Grande, Velas (which also pertained to the neighboring municipality of Calheta) appeared at the town council in Calheta. These inhabitants protested to the council officials that they were being intimidated, while others were arrested, by men sent by the sheriff of Velas. This was considered an <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> in the municipal independence of Calheta: the magistrate and Captain-major in Calheta immediately ordered a squadron of soldiers to expel the invaders.|$|E

30|$|Basic {{cognitive}} radio {{systems can be}} divided into three paradigms [2, 11, 12]: overlay, underlay, and interweave. In the overlay model, secondary users employ the same spectrum concurrently with primary users if the interference to the primary users can be offset via channel coding or network coding. In the underlay model, secondary users are allowed to access the channel only if their transmissions do not cause <b>intolerable</b> (accumulated) <b>interference</b> at the primary receivers. In the interweave model, secondary users can only access the spectrum where the primary users are not active, known as spectrum holes, through periodically monitoring the radio spectrum. Since the overlay model needs the facilitation of sophisticated signal process and coding techniques [11], and the interweave model requires secondary users to have high sensing accuracy, our research focuses on the underlay model, in which concurrent transmissions may occur between the secondary and primary users as long as the interference generated by the secondary users at the primary receivers is below a certain acceptable threshold.|$|R
30|$|In {{view of a}} {{potential}} massive deployment of FAP’s, a special attention has to be devoted to RRM. In fact, different from MBSs, FAPs are typically installed by the subscribers and maintained without global planning, with no special consideration about traffic demands or interference with other cells, either femto or macro cells. Hence, a dense deployment of FAPs might induce an <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> from FUE’s to MUE’s or to other FUE’s. Interference management is then arguably {{one of the major}} challenges to be faced in femtocell networks.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} spectral-efficient {{design and}} develop novel schemes to improve spectral {{efficiency of the}} modern wireless communications networks. Nowadays, more and more spectrum resources are required to support various high-data-rate applications while spectrum resources are limited. Moreover, static allocation and exclusive access in current spectrum assignment policy {{caused a lot of}} licensed spectrum bands to be underutilized. To deal with the problem, cognitive radio (CR) has been developed, which allows unlicensed/secondary users to transmit with licensed/primary users as long as the former ones do not generate <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> to the latter ones. The coexistence of users and networks requires careful and dynamic planning to mitigate interference. Otherwise, the network performance will be severely undermined. We study both spectrum sensing and spectrum access techniques and propose several transmit schemes for different types of cognitive ratio networks, including spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay systems. The proposed algorithms can improve spectral efficiency of the networks efficiently and have potentials to be used in future wireless communications networks. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of dense {{wireless sensor networks}} in industrial plants is mandatorily paired {{with the development of}} methods and tools for connectivity prediction. These are needed to certify the quality (or reliability) of the network information flow in industrial scenarios which are typically characterized by harsh propagation conditions. Connectivity prediction must account for the possible coexistence of heterogeneous radio-access technologies, as part of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm, and easily allow postlayout validation steps. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide a practical evaluation of relevant coexistence problems that may occur between industrial networks employing standards such as WirelessHART IEC 62591, IEEE 802. 15. 4, and IEEE 802. 11. A number of coexistence scenarios are experimentally tested using different radio platforms. For each case, experimental results are analyzed to assess tolerable interference levels and sensitivity thresholds for different configurations of channel overlapping. Finally, the problem of over-the-air spectrum sensing is investigated in real scenarios with heterogeneous industrial networks to enable a cognitive resource allocation that avoids <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|In future {{scenarios}} of heterogeneous and dense networks, randomly-deployed small star networks (SSNs) become a key paradigm, whose system performance {{is restricted to}} inter-SSN interference and requires an efficient resource allocation scheme for interference coordination. Traditional resource allocation schemes do not specifically focus on this paradigm and are usually too time consuming in dense networks. In this article, a very efficient graph-based scheme is proposed, which applies the maximal independent set (MIS) concept in graph theory to help divide SSNs into almost interference-free groups. We first construct an interference graph for the system based on a derived distance threshold indicating for any pair of SSNs whether there is <b>intolerable</b> inter-SSN <b>interference</b> or not. Then, SSNs are divided into MISs, and the same resource can be repetitively used by all the SSNs in each MIS. Empirical parameters and equations are set in the scheme to guarantee high performance. Finally, extensive scenarios both dense and nondense are randomly generated and simulated to demonstrate the performance of our scheme, indicating that it outperforms the classical max K-cut-based scheme in terms of system capacity, utility and especially time cost. Its achieved system capacity, utility and fairness can {{be close to the}} near-optimal strategy obtained by a time-consuming simulated annealing search...|$|R
40|$|Time and {{frequency}} offsets can cause severe degradation {{in the performance}} of any OFDM-based System. Therefore synchronization procedures are necessary for the proper function of a receiver. In OFDMA, where different users share the available subcarriers, synchronization becomes an arduous task. Synchronization errors as far as the uplink transmission is concerned may cause <b>intolerable</b> Multiple Access <b>Interference</b> (MAI) as the signals are produced by different mobile users and propagate through different channels with various Carrier Offsets and Doppler shifts. The receiver must estimate a number of parameters and compensate for the produced intercarrier (ICI) and intersymbol (ISI) interference.

President Franklin Roosevelt's [...] "New Deal" [...] had prompted many U.S. Supreme Court challenges, among which were challenges regarding {{the constitutionality of the}} National Industry Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA). In 1936, as a part of its ruling in Carter v. Carter Coal Co. the Court ruled against mandatory collective bargaining, stating: [...] "The effect, in respect to wages and hours, is to subject the dissentient minority ... to the will of the stated majority .... To ‘accept’ in these circumstances, is not to exercise a choice, but to surrender to force. The power conferred upon the majority is, in effect, the power to regulate the affairs of an unwilling minority. This is legislative delegation in its most obnoxious form; for it is not even delegation to an official or an official body ... but to private persons .... A statute which attempts to confer such power undertakes an <b>intolerable</b> and unconstitutional <b>interference</b> with personal liberty and private property. The delegation is so clearly arbitrary, and so clearly a denial of rights safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, that it is unnecessary to do more than refer to decisions of this Court which foreclose the question." ...|$|R
30|$|Usually, {{subchannel}} allocation {{and power}} control are jointly considered in literatures. In [10], a resource allocation scheme was proposed {{to maximize the}} total data rate of cognitive small cells without causing <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> to macrocell users, in which femtocell user equipments (FUEs) could estimate the interference channel through the pilot signals broadcasted by macrocell base station (MBS). Moreover, the proposed algorithm could ensure the fairness with only a tiny reduction in throughput performance. In [11], a decentralized approach for dynamic subchannel and power allocation was considered. Reinforcement learning-based algorithm was applied to solve the uncoordinated spectrum sharing problems. The spectrum allocation was based on reinforcement learning algorithm, while the power allocation applied convex optimization algorithm which was decided by each femtocell independently. Besides, game theory is also a feasible solution which has been widely investigated in existing researches to jointly investigate the subchannel and power allocation in femtocell networks. In [12], a cooperative Nash bargaining game model was developed to study the subchannel allocation and power control problem jointly for cognitive small cell networks with the consideration of cross-tier interference mitigation, outage limitation, imperfect CSI, and fairness.|$|E
30|$|As a {{fundamental}} problem, the achievable transmission {{capacity of a}} cognitive radio network over the underlay spectrum sharing model has been extensively studied [7 - 9], in which the secondary users are allowed to access the channel only if their transmissions do not cause <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> at the primary receiver. Our prior work [10] indicates that secondary users could only work at a low transmission power over the underlay spectrum sharing model to guarantee the normal communications of the primary users, especially when the direct transmission from a primary transmitter to its receiver is severely damaged due to path loss and channel fading; thus secondary users can successfully receive signals only with a low reception threshold, leading to a low transmission capacity. Motivated {{by the idea of}} cooperative relaying, in this paper, we aim to study whether cooperative communications can help the secondary users to achieve a higher transmission capacity constrained by the outage probabilities from both the primary and the secondary users compared to the cognitive network without cooperative relaying under the physical interference model, in which a transmission is successful if and only if the corresponding signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver is higher than a threshold.|$|E
40|$|The core aim of {{this work}} is the {{maximization}} of the achievable data rate of the secondary user pairs (SU pairs), while ensuring the QoS of primary users (PUs). All users {{are assumed to be}} equipped with multiple antennas. It is assumed that when PUs are present, the direct communication between SU pairs introduces <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> to PUs and thereby SUs transmit signal using the cooperation of one of the SUs and avoid transmission in the direct channel. In brief, an adaptive cooperative strategy for MIMO cognitive radio networks is proposed. At the presence of PUs, the issue of joint relay selection and power allocation in underlay MIMO cooperative cognitive radio networks (U-MIMO-CCRN) is addressed. The optimal approach for determining the power allocation and the cooperating SU is proposed. Besides, the outage probability of the proposed system is further derived. Due to high complexity of the optimal approach, a low complexity approach is further proposed and its performance is evaluated using simulations. The simulation results reveal that the performance loss due to the low complexity approach is only about 14 %, while the complexity is greatly reduced...|$|E

In particular, P 2 P video streaming system has become popular among Internet users in recent years. This thesis studies two critical issues and proposes new solutions to P 2 P content distribution: copyright protection and jitter-free streaming.; Studies show that playback jitter {{is one of the}} most important indications of the Quality of Service in P 2 P video streaming systems. This thesis presents a queuing model applicable to general online video streaming and derives a lower bound of jitter-free probability. Applying this model in P 2 P network architecture leads to a design methodology for P 2 P video streaming systems with high jitter-free probability.; Content poisoning is normally treated as a security threat, but some researchers and commercial efforts have attempted to use it against P 2 P piracy with mixed results. This thesis proves that the underlying chunking schemes and hashing mechanisms ultimately determine the effect of content poisoning. A proactive content poisoning scheme using identity-based signature is proposed. This scheme selectively targets content poisoning to pirates while legitimate peers are unaffected. Such a completely distributed copyright protection mechanism is highly resistant to security breaches at individual peers.; One of the unique security challenges facing P 2 P file-sharing networks is called index poisoning attacks. Unlike content poisoning, index poisoning attacks threat the stability of the entire P 2 P network. The proposed P 2 P network design for copyrighted content distribution is also highly resistant to index poisoning attacks. Both theoretical modeling and experimental results prove that peers applying our design are immune to index poisoning attacks. Further more, the severity of index poisoning attacks is drastically reduced if majority of the peers in the network are immune.; This thesis pushes two frontiers in P 2 P content networking. These findings will enable the construction of cost-effective P 2 P video streaming networks. These new generation P 2 P networks provide legitimate clients with jitter-free services and penalize pirates with <b>intolerable</b> jitter <b>interferences.</b> Such type of P 2 P video streaming network paves the road for legitimate and large scale commercial application of P 2 P technology in digital content industry...|$|R
30|$|For the {{underlay}} spectrum sharing, {{the concurrent}} transmissions of PUs and SUs will cause mutual interferences between them. In order {{to guarantee the}} interference constraint of primary system, the transmit powers of SUs should be conservatively set, especially when they are close to PUs, so the transmission requirements of SUs can be hardly satisfied [8, 9]. It becomes more difficult to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements of multiple SUs under the interference temperature constraint [10]. By introducing a secondary relay (SR) between a secondary source (SS) and a secondary destination (SD), the distance of each hop can be shortened and the communication reliability can be enhanced [11 – 14]. Both SS and SR should strictly control their transmit powers to avoid causing <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> to the primary system, so the cooperative diversity is lost [15, 16]. Either the interference-alignment or the beamforming technique can be adopted by PUs and SUs to mitigate the mutual interference [17, 18]. An adaptive power allocation scheme was proposed in [19], where SUs can access the power control signaling of PUs and control their powers in both the long-time and short-time scales to improve the capacity of secondary system while guaranteeing the QoS of PUs [19]. Since the underlay mode will result in low transmission efficiency due to restricted power, to maximize the throughput of secondary system, researchers have proposed dynamic overlay-underlay and interweave-underlay spectrum sharing schemes based on the statuses of PUs [20 – 23].|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 37 - 38). A novel {{frequency reuse}} scheme is proposed for a hierarchical cellular network using the long-term evolution (LTE) technology. Universal frequency reuse (UFR) is targeted for future generation multi-cellular wireless networks. However, current research have proved that actual implementation of UFR is undesirable for LTE {{due to the}} <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> levels experienced by user equipments {{in the vicinity of}} the cell edge. In this Thesis work, we specifically address the above issue. In the proposed frequency reuse architecture, all available subcarriers are partitioned into three bands and the cell is divided into two major parts, cell center and cell edge. The edge of the cell is further divided into three regions Interior Edge Band (IEB), Intermediate Band (IB) and Exterior Edge Band (EEB). Cell center uses all three bands with low power and cell edge uses one of three bands. Each band is divided into three sub-bands and allocated at the cell edge with different power levels. As the proposed architecture contains well defined boundaries for the sub-bands, it is easy to deploy more femtocells at the cell edge and exploits all other frequency sub-bands that are not used. The herein proposed frequency reuse scheme is an effective inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) technique for the next-generation wireless networks. Simulation results shows that the proposed scheme can perform better on cell-edge, reduce transmission power, improve network capacity and cell throughput in comparison with the standard frequency reuse techniques like Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) and Partial Frequency Reuse (PFR) ...|$|E
40|$|Femtocell {{networks}} offer {{a series}} of benefits with respect to conventional cellular networks such as better frequency reuse, improved coverage, higher data rates and extended battery life. However, a potential massive deployment of femto-access points (FAPs) poses a big challenge in terms of Radio Resource Management (RRM), which requires proper radio resource allocation techniques. Differently from macro base stations, FAP’s are typically installed by the subscribers and maintained without global planning, with no special consideration about traffic demands or interference with other cells, either femto or macro cells. Hence, a dense deployment of FAP’s might induce an <b>intolerable</b> <b>interference</b> to macro users or to other femto users. Having that in mind, in this work we develop several algorithms under the common root of the “Bayesian” approach. First, assuming static femto-to-femto interference we establish local coordinating schemes between FAP’s {{in order to maximize}} a network social welfare (or conversely, to minimize a social cost). Then, once having incorporated a model for the macro interferers’ activity, we extend such schemes in the time-frequency domain. On the latter case we start considering a single FAP accessing the radio channel {{in the presence of a}} dynamical interference environment. Then, with the support of Game Theory (GT), we extend the formulation to a multi-FAP scenario where nearby FAP’s react to the strategies of the other FAP’s, still within a dynamical interference scenario. The multi-user case is first approached using a strategic non-cooperative game formulation. Then we propose a coordination game based on the introduction of a pricing mechanism that exploits the backhaul link to enable the exchange of parameters (prices) among FAP’s. The numerical simulations show the worthiness of the joint effect of local coordination and interference estimation...|$|E
