40|$|Background Lone {{parents have}} worse health than couple parents, which is largely {{explained}} by {{higher levels of}} poverty. Many high income countries have attempted to address poverty by introducing mandatory requirements to actively seek employment or participate in training for welfare recipients, including lone parents. However, employment might not reduce poverty or improve the health of lone parents. To assess experiences of <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and gain insight into possible mechanisms linking interventions with health and wellbeing, this study systematically reviewed qualitative data from studies of lone parents’ experiences of mandatory <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Methods 21 bibliographic databases were searched (appendix) for articles published between July 16, 2009, and July 6, 2013, with no language restrictions; search-term sets {{were used for the}} topics, lone parent and <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Studies that met the criteria of focusing on lone parents, mandatory <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> interventions, and health or wellbeing were imported into NVivo (version 10) for coding. Two reviewers independently screened references, assessed study quality for clarity and appropriateness of methods, and developed the coding framework. Thematic synthesis, a method to facilitate transparency when identifying analytical themes between studies, was used to guide line-by-line coding of the data. Findings From 4703 papers identified, 16 studies (724 participants) from five high income countries were included. Although the balance of evidence was on negative findings—ie, linking <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> negative health effects, such as stress, fatigue, and depression—there were some positive reports of improved self-worth. Available employment was often precarious and poorly paid. The demands of parenting were frequently in direct conflict with employment and <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> obligations, and affected parents’ control over major life decisions and everyday routines. Therefore, the concepts of conflict and control seemed <b>to</b> encapsulate how <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> affected health. Social support allowed some parents to manage these conflicts, allowing greater control over their circumstances, and for some mediating the adverse health effects of <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Interpretation Participation in mandatory <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> can result in increased conflict and reduced control for lone parents, leading to negative effects on mental health. The potential benefits of <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> are dependent on access to adequate social support and suitable employment opportunities; however these are often unavailable to lone parents in <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{programmes}} {{directed at}} increasing the employment chances {{of people with}} a disability or a chronic illness are a controversial aspect of welfare reform {{in countries such as}} the UK. There has been considerable public debate about their effectiveness and appropriateness. What evidence is there about the effects of these programmes on employment outcomes? This paper adapts the methodology of systematic review to inform the evidence-base for <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as it applies to people with a disability or a chronic illness in the UK. Quantitative and qualitative studies of <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> programmes directed at people with a disability or a chronic illness were identified using electronic databases, hand searches of the relevant literature, searches of the world wide web, citation follow-up, and contacts with authors. 5399 abstracts were identified and 17 studies were included and critically appraised. Three of the included studies were qualitative, two used mixed-methods and twelve were quantitative. The results suggested that <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> programmes increase the uptake of employment among people with a disability or a chronic illness. However, as the majority of the studies were retrospective and only three were controlled, it was difficult to determine if the evidence of increased employment was due to the effectiveness of the <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> interventions themselves or attributable to more general upward labour market trends.

40|$|Excerpt] This paper explores <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{policy in}} the UK and sets out {{ways in which the}} {{delivery}} of that policy could become more efficient and effective by making small but significant changes to the approach. Employers and intermediaries must reposition disability from an issue to do with incapacity, doctors, damage and cost – to one concerned with capability, the workplace and investment in human potential. Employers, disabled people and intermediaries must all engage – and have high expectations of each other. We set out the case for an employer engagement strategy that supports <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and maximises impact on employer behaviour by: • Repositioning the employer from ‘problem’ and ‘target’ (i. e. people whose attitudes must be changed) to valued ‘end user’, customer and potential partner. • Streamlining the ‘disability <b>to</b> <b>work</b> supply chain’ so that it more efficiently delivers suitable disabled candidates to employers equipped and supported to hire them {{on the basis of their}} capability, to retain them and to develop their potential. We believe it is necessary <b>to</b> reframe the <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> challenge as a supply chain challenge and outline 6 fundamental principles that should underpin any <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> policy...|$|R
50|$|Under {{the years}} of the Blair Administration, {{expenditure}} on social services was increased, while various anti-poverty measures were introduced. From 2001 to 2005, public spending increased by an average of 4.8% in real terms, while spending on transport went up by 8.5% per annum, health by 8.2% per annum, and education by 5.4% per annum. Between 1997 and 2005, child poverty was more than halved in absolute terms as a result of measures such as the extension of maternity pay, increases in child benefit, and by the growth in the numbers of people in employment. During that same period, the number of pensioners living in poverty fell by over 75% in absolute terms as a result of initiatives such as the introduction of Winter Fuel Payments, the reduction of VAT on fuel, and the introduction of a Minimum Income Guarantee. To reduce poverty traps for those making the transition <b>from</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> a minimum wage was established, together with a Working Tax Credit and a Child Tax Credit. Together with various tax credit schemes to supplement low earnings, the Blair Government's policies significantly increased the earnings of the lowest income decile. In addition, under the Working Time Regulations of 1998, British workers gained a statutory entitlement to paid holidays.|$|E
50|$|Proponents {{of welfare}} reform argued that {{encouraging}} maternal employment will enhance children’s cognitive and emotional development. A working mother, proponents assert, provides a positive role model for her children. Opponents, on the other hand, argued that requiring women to work at low pay puts additional stress on mothers, reduces the quality time spent with children, and diverts income to work-related expenses such as transportation and childcare. Evidence is mixed {{on the impact of}} TANF on child welfare. Duncan & Chase-Lansdale (2001) found that the impact {{of welfare reform}} varied by age of the children, with generally positive effects on school achievement among elementary-school age children and negative effects on adolescents, especially with regards to risky or problematic behaviors. Another study found large and significant effects of welfare reform on educational achievement and aspirations, and on social behavior (i.e. teacher assessment of compliance and self-control, competence and sensitivity). The positive effects were largely due to the quality of childcare arrangement and afterschool programs that accompanied the move <b>from</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for these recipients. Yet another study found that substitution from maternal care to other informal care had caused a significant drop in performance of young children. In a program with less generous benefits, Kalili et al. (2002) found that maternal work (measured in months and hours per week) had little overall effect on children’s antisocial behavior, anxious/depressed behavior or positive behavior. They find no evidence that children were harmed by such transitions; if anything, their mothers report that their children are better behaved and have better mental health.|$|E
