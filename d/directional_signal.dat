25|$|In June 1987, Elting {{signed on}} {{broadcast}} translator W269AR on 101.7MHz {{in order to}} bolster coverage in downtown Charlottesville. The 102.3MHz facility is {{what is known as}} a rimshot station – a station licensed to a suburb or outlying area that attempts to serve a larger market. Due to its relatively low transmitter height and the hilly terrain between Crozet and Charlottesville, 102.3 has spotty coverage in the city itself, even with its highly <b>directional</b> <b>signal</b> pointed east. Most Charlottesville stations broadcast from the highest peak overlooking the city, the 1,573-foot Carter Mountain, which provides good coverage of Albemarle County.|$|E
500|$|The crew of [...] spotted Force Z at 02:20, {{reported}} their position, and fired five torpedoes, {{all of which}} missed. Based on this report the Japanese launched 11 reconnaissance aircraft before dawn to locate Force Z. Several hours later 86 bombers from the 22nd Air Flotilla based in Saigon were launched carrying bombs or torpedoes. The crew of a Mitsubishi G3M [...] "Nell" [...] reconnaissance bomber spotted the British at 10:15 and radioed in several reports. The pilot was ordered to maintain contact and to broadcast a <b>directional</b> <b>signal</b> that the other Japanese bombers could follow.|$|E
2500|$|After launch, {{the bomber}} {{turned away from}} the target. The missile would climb from the launch {{altitude}} to [...] Video providing radar imaging of the target would be transmitted back to the bomber. As the missile approached the target the detail in the radar video transmitted from the missile improved. The missile began a terminal dive about 20 miles from the target. The command guidance system did not send a <b>directional</b> <b>signal</b> and was not encrypted which made it susceptible to detection and jamming.|$|E
40|$|The B-Format {{microphone}} {{has been}} used since more than 20 years for recordings of natural 3 -dimensional sound fields. It outputs one pressure <b>signal</b> and three <b>directional</b> <b>signals.</b> Acoustical measurements carried out in this contribution show some systematic quality limitations of <b>directional</b> <b>signals.</b> A simulation environment is verified against these realworld measurements. It is used then to vary the design parameters of the B-Format microphone. Technical possibilities for quality improvements of the <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> are identified and discussed. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Moving to San Francisco, California, Richard Spikes {{eventually}} {{received a}} patent pertaining to automobile <b>directional</b> <b>signals,</b> which he installed on a Pierce-Arrow car in 1913. However, contrary to many sources, Spikes {{was not the}} original inventor of this pivotal device, as Percy Douglas-Hamilton was awarded [...] in 1906 for his creation of the first <b>directional</b> <b>signals,</b> six years before Spikes developed {{his version of the}} device. While he was working on his brake testing machine a few years later, the Oakland, California Police Department was interested enough to give it a tryout.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{possible}} exception to that general {{rule on the}} Canadian side was CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, {{across the river from}} Detroit. Originally licensed as a Class II-B (now Class B) station and always operating in full compliance with the technical specifications and operating rules of its CRTC licence (i.e., protection of the entire Mexican border nights and protection of co-channel Canadian stations days and nights), CKLW's 50,000-watt <b>directional</b> <b>signal</b> blanketed much of Michigan and northern Ohio east to Cleveland days and nights, and south to Toledo, Lima and Dayton in the daytime. [...] American-owned until 1970 as part of the RKO General chain (along with such other top 40 powerhouses as KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco), it functioned essentially as a Detroit-market station during the 1960s and 1970s. Its Motown-flavored personality Top 40 format made {{it one of the most}} highly rated stations in the Midwestern US. The decline of AM radio as a music source in the 1970s, combined with new Canadian government rules imposing minimum domestic music content, made it difficult for CKLW to continue to compete for listeners with Detroit-based, US-licensed FM music stations, which offered clean stereo sound and faced no program content or music playlist restrictions. CKLW abandoned the Top 40 format and its efforts to compete in the Detroit market in the 1980s. Today it is a news/talk station aimed specifically at an Ontario audience, though still containing a significant amount of American syndicated talk.|$|E

2500|$|Drivers {{will often}} want to cease to travel a {{straight}} line and turn onto another road or onto private property. The vehicle's <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> (commonly known as [...] "blinkers" [...] or [...] "indicators") are often used {{as a way to}} announce one's intention to turn, thus alerting other drivers. The actual usage of <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> varies greatly amongst countries, although its purpose should be the same in all countries: to indicate a driver's intention to depart from the current (and natural) flow of traffic well before the departure is executed (typically 3 seconds as a guideline).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper uses {{a market}} based {{approach}} {{to assess whether}} exchange rates follow a random walk pattern. A risk-adjusted yield differential (RAYD) model is used to obtain <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> on exchange rate movements. These signals are then compared to the signals obtained by the random walk model. The {{results indicate that the}} RAYD performs significantly better than the random walk model for obtaining <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> on exchange rate movements. Furthermore, when the RAYD model focuses only upon significant signals as well as different threshold levels, the results further improve. These results strengthen the argument that the theoretical signals obtained from the RAYD model are not validated due to chance alone. ...|$|R

5000|$|Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR), systems (used by aircraft), have {{an antenna}} array that transmits two signals simultaneously. A <b>directional</b> <b>signal</b> rotates like a {{lighthouse}} {{at a fixed}} rate. When the <b>directional</b> <b>signal</b> is facing north, an omnidirectional signal pulses. By measuring the difference in phase of these two signals, an aircraft can determine its bearing or radial from the station, thus establishing a line of position. An aircraft can get readings from two VORs and locate its position {{at the intersection of}} the two radials, known as a [...] "fix." ...|$|E

40|$|National audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{estimating}} the azimuths of multiple sound sources accurately even {{in the presence of}} diffuse noise. MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) for the estimation of the azimuths of multiple sources is robust against spatially white noise but the estimation performance degrades in the presence of diffuse noise. Based on a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix of <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> and the assumption that the covariance matrix of diffuse noise belongs to a subspace in a matrix space, the proposed method estimates the covariance matrix of the <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> and applies MUSIC to the estimated matrix. The subspace model on the covariance matrix of diffuse noise includes as special cases noise models such as spatially uncorrelated noise, noise with a given coherence matrix, and isotropic noise observed with a crystal array. We showed through experiments with real-world noise recordings that the proposed method estimated the azimuths of multiple sources more accurately than the conventional MUSIC...|$|R

40|$|Most neurons migrate with an elongated, bipolar morphology, {{extending}} a long leading process that explores the environment. However, when immature projection neurons enter the intermediate {{zone of the}} neocortex they become multipolar. Multipolar cells extend and retract cytoplasmic processes in different directions and move erratically - sideways, up and down. Multipolar cells extend axons while {{they are in the}} lower half of the intermediate zone. Remarkably, the cells then resume radial migration: they reorient their centrosome and Golgi apparatus towards the pia, transform back to bipolar morphology, and commence locomotion along radial glia fibers. This reorientation implies the existence of <b>directional</b> <b>signals</b> in the intermediate zone that are ignored during the multipolar stage but sensed after axonogenesis. In vivo genetic manipulation has implicated a variety of candidate <b>directional</b> <b>signals,</b> cell surface receptors, and signaling pathways, that may be involved in polarizing multipolar cells and stabilizing a pia-directed leading process for radial migration. Other signals are implicated in starting multipolar migration and triggering axon outgrowth. Here we review the molecules and mechanisms that regulate multipolar migration, and also discuss how multipolar migration affects the orderly arrangement of neurons in layers and columns in the developing neocortex...|$|R
