50|$|Continued {{reinforcement}} {{and extension}} of the existing 275 kV systems was examined as a possible solution. However, {{in addition to the}} technical problem of very high fault levels many more lines would have been required to obtain the estimated transfers at 275 kV. As this was not consistent with the Central Electricity Generating Board's policy of preservation of amenities a further solution was sought. Consideration was given to both a 400 kV and 500 kV scheme as the alternatives, either of which gave a sufficient margin for future expansion. The decision in favour of a 400 kV system was made for two main reasons. Firstly the majority of the 275 kV lines could be uprated to 400 kV, and secondly it was envisaged that the operation at 400 kV could commence in 1965 compared with 1968 for a 500 kV scheme. Design work was started and {{in order to meet the}} programme for 1965 it was necessary for the contract engineering for the first projects to run concurrently with the design. One of these projects was the West Burton 400 kV <b>Indoor</b> <b>Substation,</b> the first section of which was commissioned in June 1965. From 1965, the grid was partly upgraded to 400 kV, beginning with a 150-mile (241 km) line from Sundon to West Burton, to become the Supergrid.|$|E

50|$|Substations {{may be on}} {{the surface}} in fenced enclosures, underground, or located in {{special-purpose}} buildings. High-rise buildings may have several <b>indoor</b> <b>substations.</b> <b>Indoor</b> <b>substations</b> are usually found in urban areas to reduce the noise from the transformers, for reasons of appearance, or to protect switchgear from extreme climate or pollution conditions.|$|R
50|$|Outdoor, {{above-ground}} {{substation structures}} include wood pole, lattice metal tower, and tubular metal structures, although other variants are available. Where space is plentiful and {{appearance of the}} station is not a factor, steel lattice towers provide low-cost supports for transmission lines and apparatus. Low-profile substations may be specified in suburban areas where appearance is more critical. <b>Indoor</b> <b>substations</b> may be gas-insulated switchgear (at high voltages), or metal-enclosed or metal-clad switchgear at lower voltages. Urban and suburban <b>indoor</b> <b>substations</b> may be finished on the outside so as {{to blend in with}} other buildings in the area.|$|R

The research showed that the region with low noise requirement, the ventilation could be set on the outer wall or {{on the door of the}} main transformer room, while the region with high noise requirement, air inlet muffler or ventilation through the cable interlayer under the main transformer room must be used. All of the four kinds of ventilation schemes, ventilation through the cable interlayer is the best in cooling and noise reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{magnetic}} shielding arrangement for an <b>indoor</b> <b>substation</b> is considered. The aim of the intervention {{is to reduce the}} magnetic field intensity inside a room above the substation. Stray fields are mitigated by using metallic screens and by rearranging LV cables in order to limit intervention costs. A three-dimensional electromagnetic analysis of stray fields is performed by means of an original integral code, whereas a two-dimensional FEM software is used for assessing the shielding performance locally, in proximity of LV cables. Simulations show that the highest field attenuation levels are attained when phases of conductors and transformers are arranged in optimised configurations. The developed procedure is then applied to design a magnetic shield for a MV/LV substation. It is shown that measured and computed field r. m. s. values of the magnetic flux density are in good agreement...|$|E

40|$|The Smart Grid (SG) is {{conceived}} as {{the evolution of}} the current electrical grid representing a big leap in terms of efficiency, reliability and flexibility compared to today’s electrical network. To achieve this goal, the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are considered by the scientific/engineering community {{to be one of the}} most suitable technologies to apply SG technology to due to their low-cost, collaborative and long-standing nature. However, the SG has posed significant challenges to utility operators—mainly very harsh radio propagation conditions and the lack of appropriate systems to empower WSN devices—making most of the commercial widespread solutions inadequate. In this context, and as a main contribution, we have designed a comprehensive ad-hoc WSN-based solution for the Smart Grid (SENSED-SG) that focuses on specific implementations of the MAC, the network and the application layers to attain maximum performance and to successfully deal with any arising hurdles. Our approach has been exhaustively evaluated by computer simulations and mathematical analysis, as well as validation within real test-beds deployed in controlled environments. In particular, these test-beds cover two of the main scenarios found in a SG; on one hand, an <b>indoor</b> electrical <b>substation</b> environment, implemented in a High Voltage AC/DC laboratory, and, on the other hand, an outdoor case, deployed in the Transmission and Distribution segment of a power grid. The results obtained show that SENSED-SG performs better and is more suitable for the Smart Grid than the popular ZigBee WSN approach...|$|R
40|$|Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (QMS) {{has been}} used to {{validate}} the condition of the operating gas in a SF 6 GIS 150 kV <b>indoor</b> power <b>substation,</b> running under periodic maintenance for almost 30 years. The switches of the examined system were of the dead tank, single phase, double pressure type. The employed analyzer head enabled detection of positive ions having maximum mass to charge ratio 200 and a minimum detectable concentration 0. 5 ppm. According to the experimental results, before the periodic maintenance process the 34 S concentration had been increased by a factor of 2 (natural abundance of isotope 34 S is 4. 5 %). Additionally significant amounts of CO 2 could be detected in gas volumes enclosing the current transformers. One month after the periodic maintenance process, i. e. gas dehydration, chamber cleaning and filter substitution, the S isotopic ratios were back to normal and the CO 2 concentration was not detectable. In the event of permanent damage of solid insulants (i. e. presence of aluminum fluorides diffused in the epoxy resin) CO 2 concentration was still increased at higher concentrations than the CO 2 in atmosphere while the dew point measurements did not reveal the weakness. Other SF 6 by-products and their concentrations could also be detected with the above measuring instrument (i. e. SF 5 +, SF 4 +, SF 3 +, SF 2 +, SF+, S+, F+, H 2 O+, HO+, SOFx+, SO 2 Fx+) and therefore it may be used as a quality control tool of GIS power plants...|$|R
