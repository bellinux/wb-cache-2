25|$|The legend {{continues}} that, as the seer foretold, Olaf {{was attacked}} {{by a group of}} mutineers upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the Haakon Jarl was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> from the rebels in a pig sty.|$|E

25|$|Pintarić was {{captured}} on 20 January 1974. The police learned of his whereabouts and surrounded {{the house in}} which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding.</b> After brief negotiations, Pintarić surrendered without resistance. He was tried for two murders, an attempted murder, and endangering his neighbors by shooting at their homes. He admitted the crimes, but pleaded not guilty, arguing that he was provoked into murder while intoxicated. On 18 November 1974 he was pronounced guilty and sentenced to death, an outcome Pintarić had feared the most. However, to his relief, this was quickly commuted to 20 years imprisonment, the maximum prison term under the law.|$|E

25|$|Provenzano {{was finally}} {{captured}} on 11 April 2006 by the Italian police {{near his home}} town, Corleone. A spokesman for the Palermo police, Agent Daniele Macaluso, said Provenzano had been arrested during the morning near Corleone, 60 km south of Palermo and was being driven back to the Sicilian capital. The police were able to pinpoint Provezano's exact location by the simplest of connections; they tracked a delivery of clean laundry from his family to the farmhouse <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> out in. His arrest briefly pushed the climax of Italy's general election from the main headlines on Italian news stations.|$|E

25|$|When the Abarcas left Iguala {{after the}} mass {{kidnapping}} in September 2014, law enforcement began an investigation to locate all the properties {{owned by the}} couple and their families. Abarca had several properties in Guerrero and in other states, but authorities believed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> in Mexico City or Monterrey, Nuevo León. After ruling out Monterrey as a possible hideout, authorities concentrated on three properties in Iztapalapa where they believed the couple was hiding. Through the couple's real estate businesses, authorities were also able to link Berumen to the family once more and locate her properties in Iztapalapa. In one of the properties, investigators noticed something unusual: they regularly saw a woman (now known to be Berumen) {{going in and out}} of a property that was thought to be abandoned. Authorities then mounted an investigation and surveillance operation on Berumen before finally entering the property and arresting Abarca and Pineda.|$|E

After again being drugged, Havens drifts {{in and out of}} consciousness between their capture and escape from Quintana's men, and Miller brings her to an island that is off-the-grid, which Miller uses as a safe house. Accepting a call from her sister after leaving in frustration, Havens accidentally leads Quintana's men straight to the hideaway. They try to kill Miller and Havens with an unmanned aerial vehicle. Before they escape by helicopter, Havens is knocked-out by Miller since she is afraid of flying.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Constitutional Court {{recognised}} {{same-sex couples}} as a family. In May 2012, the Constitutional Court issued a ruling {{in favour of}} the adoption of two children to the American, Chandler Burr, {{who was about to}} lose custody because the ICBF (the institution responsible for carrying out the procedures of adoption) considered that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> his sexual orientation. Since then, the ICBF cannot ask the sexual orientation of a person when they wish to adopt individually. From 2014, LGBT individuals can adopt the biological child of their partner. On 4 November 2015, the Constitutional Court ruled 6–2 in favour of full same-sex adoption rights, the Court instructing adoption agencies not to discriminate against same-sex couples when providing adoption services. Opponents of the ruling said they would appeal. By 31 March 2016, a campaign wanting to force a referendum on adoption rights for same-sex couples had gathered 1.8 million signatures, including 45 members of Congress. The campaign aimed to repeal the ruling the Constitutional Court issued in November 2015, which allowed adoption of children by same-sex couples. However, the signatures had to first be accepted by Colombia's Registrar then the proposal would go to Congress where it had to be debated and passed by a majority in both its chambers, twice. Finally, the proposal had to also be approved by the Constitutional Court, the very court who's authority it sought to challenge. In May 2017, a Congress committee decided, in a 20-12 vote, to shelve the proposal. The move was applauded by President Juan Manuel Santos, who had previously announced his opposition to the proposal.|$|E

On his last day in Chicago, Hines had to avoid discovery by Union soldiers inspecting the home <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> in by crawling into a mattress upon which the homeowner's wife lay ill with delirium. The Union soldiers inspected the house he was in, and even checked to see if Hines was the one lying on the bed, but did not discover Hines in the mattress. The soldiers established a guard by the door of the house. As it rained the next day, visitors were encouraged to visit the sick woman. The soldiers never looked at the faces under the umbrellas, and as a result, Hines sneaked {{out of the house and}} left Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Biblical {{scholars}} believe Bethlehem, {{located in}} the [...] "hill country" [...] of Judah, may {{be the same as}} the Biblical Ephrath, which means [...] "fertile", as there is a reference to it in the Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephratah. The Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the [...] "City of David". It is first mentioned in the Tanakh and the Bible as the place where the matriarch Rachel died and was buried [...] "by the wayside" [...] (Gen. 48:7). Rachel's Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where Ruth of Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with Naomi. It was the home of Jesse, father of King David of Israel, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> in the cave of Adullam.|$|E
500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> his resumed addiction. [...] "Warped" [...] directly faced Kiedis's distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: [...] "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me." [...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from my more than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap me before I start to rust/before I start to decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E
