40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the training and}} accreditation programs developed to support the promotion of a skilled workforce of small wind turbine (SWT) installers in Australia. The analysis contrasts the nascent Australian experience against the more mature SWT markets in the UK and USA. This research suggests that Australian SWT <b>installer</b> <b>training</b> and accreditation programs have the necessary institutional structures required to promote skill development essential to support growth, and importantly prevent the SWT industry from creating {{its own version of}} the ‘Australian home insulation fire safety debacle’. Despite existing government capital subsidies and availability of accredited training programs for SWT installers, the major limiting factor in delivery of programs has been the minor market demand for SWTs in Australia. The small demand for SWTs and training courses offered by accredited institutions in Australia is in stark contrast to concurrent SWT developments in the UK and USA, where there is greater market demand. Given the right policy support to create demand for both SWT products and installers, the training programs in Australia can develop further with the use of experienced certified trainers, units with strong practical components, and material that covers both stand-alone and grid-connected small wind systems...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in ‘middle actors’ as influences on energy use in the built environment. This paper reports on novel research with four focus groups of meter installers, employed by three major energy suppliers, two in Great Britain and one in Northern Ireland. All the participants {{have been involved in}} installing smart meters or semi-smart keypad meters in homes. The Smart Metering Installation Code of Practice requires installers to be trained to communicate to householders the uses of, and potential benefits from, smart metering, along with any health and safety issues. Installers are also required to demonstrate how to use the in-home display that is offered to all customers, {{and to be able to}} give basic advice on energy efficiency. The smart meter rollout thus offers an opportunity for a representative of the supplier to go into every customer’s home and talk about energy with household members. Using transcripts from the focus groups, we analyse what the installers have to say about their work in terms of training, support, challenges, rewards, household priorities and concerns, and organisational issues. This material illustrates the social learning that can take place during and around the time of installation, for the utility and the installers themselves, as well as among households and their social networks. It highlights issues for policymakers when planning and evaluating smart metering programmes in terms of customer benefits from demand reduction, particularly those relating to <b>installer</b> <b>training</b> and working arrangements. To set the focus group material in context, the paper draws on findings from the UK Smart Metering Early Learning Project, published in 2015, which included a large-scale household survey...|$|E

Many {{studies have shown that}} there a circular and bidirectional relation between narration and mentalization and several narrative devices can be adopted in order to foster reflexive function with students in late. Consistent with these studies, we have adopted and testes the Narrative Mediation Path (NMP), a training narrative methodology which consists of four narrative modes and media: metaphorical, iconographic, writing and bodily. We discuss the utility of the NMP in promoting different levels/dimensions of mentalization in training contexts with specific references to the European <b>INSTALL</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R

50|$|Truck (lorry) horns may be {{electrically}} operated and similar to car horns, but are often air horns driven by air from an air compressor, which many trucks have {{in order to}} operate the air brakes. The compressor forces air past a diaphragm in the horn's throat, causing it to vibrate. Such air horns are often used as trim items, with chromed straight horns mounted {{on top of the}} cab. This design may also be installed on customised automobiles, using a small electrical compressor. Usually two or more are used, some drivers {{go so far as to}} <b>install</b> <b>train</b> horns. The frequencies vary to produce a variety of different chords, but in general are lower than those of automobile horns—125-180 Hz (approximately C₃-G₃). Sound levels are approximately 117-118 decibels.|$|R
