5|$|The {{demolition}} crew {{took control}} of the site by erecting scaffolding on 6 December 2006, and demolition commenced on 12 December. Workers took down the clock mechanism and clock face, leaving a gaping hole, and then proceeded to lift the clock tower off in one piece. After the protesters had been dispersed, the remainder of the pier was completely dismantled, away from the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> publicity.|$|E
5|$|But if {{you were}} here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis. It would mean such a serious loss to him in money and {{influence}} {{not to have the}} March article come out—Everyone would think he was beaten and scared out, for the articles are under such a <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> publicity and such a fire of criticism. I {{had nothing to do with}} the January article remember, my work begins to appear in February. Mr. McClure is ill from worry and anxiety...|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> {{celebrity and}} the tribulations {{of the season}} forced Bradman to reappraise his life outside the game and to seek a career away from his cricketing fame. Harry Hodgetts, a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control, offered Bradman work as a stockbroker if he would relocate to Adelaide and captain South Australia (SA). Unknown to the public, the SA Cricket Association (SACA) instigated Hodgetts' approach and subsidised Bradman's wage. Although his wife was hesitant about moving, Bradman eventually agreed to the deal in February 1934.|$|E
60|$|Such panting and blowing! Such {{spreading}} and contracting {{of the red}} equine nostrils, and <b>glaring</b> <b>of</b> {{the wild}} equine eye! But was the imperial beast subjugated? Indeed he was not.|$|R
6000|$|... "No more kin I, Massa Nadgel," [...] {{answered}} the negro, {{with one of}} those shakes of the head and <b>glares</b> <b>of</b> solemn perplexity with which he was wont to regard matters that were too deep for him.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} flee: but, once outside the church, he sank exhausted, and lay upon the steps, {{watching}} with stupid horror the <b>glaring</b> <b>of</b> the fire, and the mob who leaped and yelled like demons round their Moloch sacrifice.|$|R
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, would be {{difficult}} to detect due to the strong <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the nearby Sun, and ground-based searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E
5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{that is one}} mood, {{and there}} is the other. Perhaps we fear too much. Even before our lives run out we may feel the dawn of a greater age {{perceptible}} among the black shadows and artificial <b>glares</b> <b>of</b> these unhappy years.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Written, I presume you mean, in the Anacreontic {{measure of}} three feet and a half--spondees and iambics?' said a gentleman in spectacles, glancing round, and giving {{emphasis}} to his inquiry by causing bland <b>glares</b> <b>of</b> a circular shape to proceed from his glasses towards the person interrogated.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} hour, talking little, Davies and Wemple {{stumbled}} along the apology for {{a road that}} led through the jungle to the lodge. They did discuss the <b>glares</b> <b>of</b> several fires to the east along the south bank of Panuco River, and hoped fervently that they were dwellings and not wells.|$|R
25|$|At the start, Dylan {{was more}} {{interested}} in Baez's younger sister Mimi, but under the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> media scrutiny that began to surround Baez and Dylan, their relationship began to develop into something more.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of sex was also important. People had {{to avoid the}} <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the sun, moon or stars, the interior of shrines, proximity to temples, wells, stoves and privies, and the vicinity of graves or coffins.|$|E
25|$|Night {{driving is}} {{difficult}} and dangerous due to the blinding <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> headlights from oncoming traffic. Headlamps that satisfactorily illuminate the road ahead without causing glare have long been sought. The first solutions involved resistance-type dimming circuits, which decreased {{the intensity of the}} headlamps. This yielded to tilting reflectors, and later to dual-filament bulbs with a high and a low beam.|$|E
40|$|In {{the formal}} study <b>of</b> <b>glare,</b> a major {{distinction}} {{has been made}} between subjective and objective effects <b>of</b> <b>glare</b> (referred to as discomfort glare and disability glare, respectively). Recently, both anecdotal reports and formal experiments have indicated that headlamp size and spectral power distribution affect discomfort glare, but no assessment {{has been made of}} whether these two factors also affect disability <b>glare.</b> Models <b>of</b> disability <b>glare</b> suggest that they shoul...|$|R

5000|$|I focused at {{intervals}} {{as the great}} dome loomed up through the smoke. <b>Glares</b> <b>of</b> many fires and sweeping clouds of smoke kept hiding the shape. Then a wind sprang up. Suddenly, the shining cross, dome and towers stood out like a symbol in the inferno. The scene was unbelievable. In that moment or two I released my shutter. Herbert Mason ...|$|R
25|$|Formerly {{located between}} and {{parallel}} to Queen Street and Victoria Street, and bisected by Ophir Road, Johore Road was the less well-known cousin of its glamorous counterpart, Bugis Street, just a stone's throw away. It was the seedy haunt of transgender prostitutes who solicited sex from locals, {{away from the}} <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> Western tourists. No photographs or media attention were focused on this street of ill-repute; only a no-frills approach to an economic exchange.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Italian {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat {{more than a}} month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time {{were not able to}} extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.|$|E
25|$|Every move of Rowe's basic {{training}} at Puckapunyal {{took place in}} the full <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the media spotlight. He was shipped off to Vietnam in January 1969, and he served his tour of duty there with distinction, rising to the rank of Corporal and was Crew Commander of his own armoured personnel carrier. He was discharged from the army in February 1970. His Vietnam experiences left a deep impression on him, and since that time he has worked extensively on behalf of other Vietnam veterans.|$|E
60|$|About the dawning {{of the day}} he {{was awakened}} by the sound of voices and the <b>glaring</b> <b>of</b> lights. He craned his neck and looked down, and there he saw a sight that filled him with amazement: three old men riding each upon a milk-white horse and each bearing a lighted torch in his hand, to light the way through the dark forest.|$|R

25|$|Astronomers have {{discovered}} some stars that seemingly orbit around an empty space. Astrometric binaries are relatively nearby stars {{which can be}} seen to wobble around a point in space, with no visible companion. The same mathematics used for ordinary binaries can be applied to infer the mass of the missing companion. The companion could be very dim, so that it is currently undetectable or masked by the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> its primary, or it could be an object that emits little or no electromagnetic radiation, for example a neutron star.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of physical changes {{is still not}} clear. Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere. The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds. Other changes in the southern polar region {{can be explained by}} changes in the lower cloud layers. The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by a changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.|$|E
25|$|NSG commandos {{based in}} Mehram Nagar, Palam Airport, Delhi took 10 hours {{to reach the}} sites. They were ready at 01:00, but had to wait three hours (until 03:15) for an {{aircraft}} to arrive from Chandigarh when the policy was that a plane be at Palam permanently. The NSG commandos landed at Mumbai Airport at 05:15, but had to wait an hour for the Bombay police to arrange BEST buses for them. They reached the Taj Mahal Hotel and the Oberoi Trident Hotel at 07:00, but initially were not given detailed maps of the buildings. The operations in the Taj Mahal hotel and Nariman House were conducted under the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the media, which may have assisted the terrorists by removing the element of surprise.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increasing}} focus on electric energy consumption as well as ecology in relation to human health. It is crucial to maintain the so called lighting comfort which is influenced by {{a wide range of}} lighting parameters, including illuminance, brightness, balance <b>of</b> illuminance, and <b>glare.</b> Thanks to all these parameters we can design lighting systems {{in such a way as}} to prevent energy waste and far too rapid deterioration of eyesight. This study therefore focuses on <b>glare</b> evaluation <b>of</b> indoor and outdoor lighting systems. In order to comprehend the issue thoroughly, a detailed description of human eyes and their functions is provided, followed by definitions <b>of</b> <b>glare</b> and types <b>of</b> <b>glare.</b> An overview <b>of</b> different calculations for indoor and outdoor glare is provided, considering the evaluation <b>of</b> daylight <b>glare</b> in terms <b>of</b> complex lighting systems. The study mentions several options involving unconventional methods for measuring glare (brightness). In the analytical part of the study, outdoor glare on Kolejní Street and indoor glare at the Prof. Brauner Hall at VUT measurements were obtained using brightness analyzer (an unconventional method). The thesis is concluded with a comparison of the conventionally and unconventionally obtained measurements, considering their respective advantages...|$|R

60|$|A shriek {{from the}} woods {{announced}} its approach. For an instant Burke the Slogger saw the <b>glaring</b> <b>of</b> a red lamp. The ground trembled. The train was going with fearful rapidity. Another second and it had reached the bank. Burke the Slogger uttered a fiendish laugh. But the next moment the train leaped across the chasm, striking the rails exactly even, and dashing out the life of Burke the Slogger, sped away to Sloperton.|$|R
25|$|Proteus is {{the second}} largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 {{kilometres}} in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes {{because it is so}} close to Neptune that it is lost in the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark—its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2μm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
25|$|After honing their live set at Slattery's, {{they played}} two concerts, {{afternoon}} and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan {{was in the}} audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performanceat the Hangar in Galwaywas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through the <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> the stage lights, was worried that the crowd {{might be on the}} verge of rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E
