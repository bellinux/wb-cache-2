500|$|The {{presence}} of the character in prime time television sparked discussion {{of the nature of}} bisexuality in a number of outlets where normally it is dismissed or overlooked. Channel4.com cites Jack as a positive role model for gay and bisexual teenagers, where little had been present for this audience in years gone by and subsequently leading to a greater culture of tolerance. Dr Meg-John Barker writes for the Journal of Bisexuality that although [...] "the b word does not actually get used during the show", Jack {{is one of the first}} positive and clearly bisexual characters on British television. She does point out however that Jack retains some elements of bisexual stereotyping, particularly in his [...] "flamboyant" [...] promiscuity. Jack has also been cited in America to contrast the portrayals of non-heterosexual characters in mainstream television in the US and the UK. Gary Scott Thompson, producer of the 2008 revival of Knight Rider, said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> Jack in Torchwood as a role model—I would absolutely use him as a role model—I love his conflictedness about ... everybody".|$|E
500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview. He said, 'You didn't have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture. I ought to beat you up.' I said, 'Go ahead – <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the money.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would like to hear it so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E

2500|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{was well}} known for his {{trademark}} [...] "skyhook", a hook shot in which he bent his entire body (rather than just the arm) like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height——the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without goaltending. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him {{even more difficult to}} defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was [...] "the only shot <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> that didn't get smashed back in my face".|$|E

2500|$|Allen {{was said}} to be {{sensitive}} about having one green eye and one blue eye (heterochromia), and some speculation existed that plans to film the eighth season of The Burns & Allen Show in color prompted her retirement. However, this seems unlikely, since a one-time-only color episode was filmed and broadcast in 1954 (a clip of which was seen on a CBS anniversary show). The reason she retired in 1958 was her health; George Burns noted more than once that she stayed with the television show as long as she did to please him, in spite of her health problems. In later years, Burns admitted that he had a very brief affair. Stricken by guilt, he phoned Jack Benny and told him about the indiscretion. However, Allen overheard the conversation and Burns quietly bought an expensive centerpiece. Nothing more was said. Years later, he discovered that Allen had subsequently told one of her friends about the episode, finishing with, [...] "You know, I really wish George would cheat on me again. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a new centerpiece." ...|$|E

[...] Max Tundra found it difficult to write lyrics as well, saying [...] "I'm getting to grips with writing lyrics, but it is somewhat more difficult than anything I've done before... The lyrics themselves are taking ages to write-- it's something I'm not used to." [...] The other vocalist on the album is Becky Jacobs who is Max Tundra's sister. The album's title is literal; it was mastered by Guy Davie at a studio named The Exchange.|$|E
2500|$|Bowery {{used his}} body and {{manipulation}} of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. [...] Freud said, [...] "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: [...] "I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact I sometimes felt as if I had been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me he {{is interested in the}} underbelly of things." [...] Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him [...] "perfectly beautiful", and commented, [...] "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use,</b> especially those extraordinary dancer's legs." [...] Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defense.|$|E
