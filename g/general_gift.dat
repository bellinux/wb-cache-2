And, in fact, {{much of the}} {{apparently}} harmful influence of hills on {{the religion of the}} world is nothing else than their <b>general</b> <b>gift</b> of exciting the poetical and inventive faculties, in peculiarly solemn tones of mind. Their terror leads into devotional casts of thought; their beauty and wildness prompt the invention at the same time; and where the mind is not gifted with stern reasoning powers, or protected by purity of teaching, it is sure to mingle the invention with its creed, and the vision with its prayer. Strictly speaking, we ought to consider the superstitions of the hills, universally, as a form of poetry; regretting only that men have not yet learned how to distinguish poetry from well-founded faith.|$|E

The young monarch Romulus Augustulus was, on September 4, compelled to abdicate before the Senate. That body requested that the Eastern Roman Emperor, Zeno, reunite his realm with the West, with Odoacer as his governor. The auxiliary commander, now master of Ravenna, encouraged the senators in this effort. [...] The emperor was somewhat hesitant to give Odoacer what would be relative autonomy, citing {{the fact that his}} wife's nephew Julius Nepos, still alive and recognized as caesar in Dalmatia, should be restored to the throne. Zeno, however, did not want to use force to support his relation, so, while still urging Odoacer to recognize Nepos's claim, granted the general the rank of Patrician and accepted the <b>general's</b> <b>gift</b> of the Western imperial standards.|$|R
6000|$|January 3d, 1858.--On Thursday {{we had the}} {{pleasure}} of a call from Mr. Coventry Patmore, to whom Dr. Wilkinson gave me a letter of introduction, and on whom I had called twice at the British Museum without finding him. We had read his Betrothal and Angel in the House with unusual pleasure and sympathy, and therefore were very glad to make his personal acquaintance. He is a man of much more youthful aspect than I had expected, [...] . a slender person to be an Englishman, though not remarkably so had he been an American; with an intelligent, pleasant, and sensitive face,--a man very evidently of refined feelings and cultivated mind. [...] . He is very simple and agreeable in his manners; a little shy, yet perfectly frank, and easy to meet on real grounds. [...] . He said that his wife had proposed to come with him, and had, indeed, accompanied him to town, but was kept away. [...] . We were very sorry for this, because Mr. Patmore seems to acknowledge her as the real [...] "Angel in the House," [...] although he says she herself ignores all connection with the poem. It is well for her to do so, and for her husband to feel that the character is her real portrait; and both, I suppose, are right. It is a most beautiful and original poem,--a poem for happy married people to read together, and to understand by the light of their own past and present life; but I doubt whether the generality of English people are capable of appreciating it. I told Mr. Patmore that I thought his popularity in America would be greater than at home, and he said that it was already so; and he appeared to estimate highly his American fame, and also our <b>general</b> <b>gift</b> of quicker and more subtle recognition of genius than the English public. [...] . We mutually gratified each other by expressing high admiration of one another's works, and Mr. Patmore regretted that in the few days of our further stay here we should not have time to visit him at his home. It would really give me pleasure to do so. [...] . I expressed a hope of seeing him in Italy during our residence there, and he seemed to think it possible, as his friend, and our countryman, Thomas Buchanan Read, had asked him to come thither and be his guest. He took his leave, shaking hands with all of us because he saw that we were of his own people, recognizing him as a true poet. He has since given me the new edition of his poems, with a kind rote.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "From fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2008, the military services received about $ 295 million in monetary and nonmonetary gifts from individuals and organizations wishing to donate gifts to the Department of Defense (DOD). Section 2601 (a) of Title 10, U. S. Code is a long-standing authority under which the secretaries overseeing DOD, the military services, and the Coast Guard may accept a gift {{on the condition that}} the gift be used for the benefit of or in connection with the establishment, operation, or maintenance of schools, hospitals, libraries, museums, cemeteries, or other institutions or organizations {{under the jurisdiction of the}} secretary concerned. In 2008, gifts to benefit such institutions or organizations included a monetary gift to construct an education center and nonmonetary gifts of a bronze statue and granite benches. In 2006, Congress enacted additional authority, under 10 U. S. C. 2601 (b) to allow the acceptance of gifts and services to benefit certain members of the armed forces and civilian employees of DOD who incurred a wound, injury, or illness in the line of duty and to benefit the dependents and survivors of those who are killed or wounded. For example, an Army official stated that the Army had recently accepted Internet services for wounded servicemembers who are recovering in a military hospital. Under 10 U. S. C. 2601, DOD and the military services are bound by certain limitations on both the acceptance and appropriate use of gifts accepted into the <b>general</b> <b>gift</b> funds [...] individual accounts established within the Department of the Treasury into which proceeds from monetary and nonmonetary gifts are deposited. In addition, DOD and the military services have established rules that are intended, among other things, to ensure that monetary and nonmonetary gifts that are accepted into these funds do not reflect unfavorably on the ability of the department to carry out its responsibilities in a fair and objective manner. DOD's policy establishes requirements for accepting, reporting, and monitoring gifts so that the department has the information necessary to conduct effective oversight of the <b>general</b> <b>gift</b> funds. Oversight of the <b>general</b> <b>gift</b> funds is essential to ensure that proceeds from monetary gifts and the disposal of nonmonetary gifts are properly accounted for and used in accordance with DOD and military service policies. In May 2004, we reported instances in which the military services did not have effective oversight of nonmonetary gifts accepted under the <b>general</b> <b>gift</b> fund authority for the renovations of general officer quarters, and we concluded that the military services had no assurance that the nonmonetary gifts were still in their possession. Under 10 U. S. C. 2601 (h), the Comptroller General is required to make periodic audits of gifts, devises, and bequests accepted under section 2601 (a) or (b) and to submit a report of the results of such audits to Congress. As agreed with Congressional offices, we addressed this requirement by focusing our review on evaluating the extent to which the military services have implemented DOD's policy for (1) accepting, (2) reporting, and (3) monitoring gifts accepted under the <b>general</b> <b>gift</b> fund authority. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} how gifts are {{connected}} with the sanskars, rites of transition or rite of passage. I have discussed how gifts are connected culturally {{in the context of}} rites of transitions, in order to systematically search for the different contexts that influence those who act out these events, where people are obliged to give gift as well as oblige to receive, if one does not receive it becomes insult of giver and develops conflicting relationship. Giving gift in this context follows the generalized reciprocity, and flows in a certain direction, but its latent meaning is to keep strong social bond between kin groups and ancestors. Obligation for giving gift and return are closely associated with distance of kinship. Gift is obliged to give and receive sometimes not necessarily return immediately, which also depends upon kin ties. Most obligatory gift should be made to sister and their children. Rites of passage is not only associated with liminality and unstructure social status also with flow of gift. Giving gift in ritual context is to avoid inauspiciousness. Important dimension of gift giving, receiving and returning all are matter of morality, honor, and prestige.

Moreover, this norm seems to be dominating for gifts to middle- and high-income households. Even though poor households receive to the same extent, norms of both impure altruism and reciprocity tend to be important. Hence, although the poor may not reciprocate gifts to the same extent as the rich, they still receive, since there is a social norm to give, especially to the poor...|$|R
40|$|In {{theoretical}} part I primarily focused on <b>general</b> <b>gifts</b> of the pupils. I tried to identify all crucial methods {{that are important}} for work with them.

In the empirical part I focused on implementation of learning process of art education with differentiation of artistically gifted pupils. I was interested in methods of work with artistically gifted pupils to keep them active, curious and motivated. I implemented three leassons in the first class of primary school. I started with identifiying four pupils who, based on their artistic makings, stood out as most artistically gifted. Then I prepared additional ativities for them during the normal class hours and analized how this additional activities influenced their motivation for learning, their originality and their self dependence when solving the artistic tasks. This enabled me to understand in more detail the effect of additional activities on artistically gifted pupils and possibilities of their additional engagement during lessons. The general impression regarding {{the effects of the}} additinal activities is positive since the pupils that were involved in the project responded actively and were succesfull in solving the artistic tasks.

I also interviewed academic painter Ivan Rob about his experience as artistically gifted pupil in primary school and about his opinion on artistic talent.
