40|$|In the future, the <b>Global</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Regulation</b> (GTR) on {{pedestrian}} safety may {{be adopted}} as an Australian Design Rule. Eventually, this would require all new vehicles {{to meet a}} certain level of performance in pedestrian impact tests. This paper discusses the likely effects of such an ADR on vehicle design, and estimates the effect of the requirements on real world crash performance. This is done by analysing vehicles whose GTR performance could be estimated from prior testing conducted by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP). The resulting performance estimates give an indication of what proportion of vehicles would be likely to pass the GTR, and what characteristics might cause them to fail the requirements. A method is presented for relating headform test requirements to real world performance, taking into account the distribution of speeds in real crashes. The results show that compulsory compliance with the GTR would improve the current situation, but ideally the requirements of the GTR would become stricter in the future. D. J. Searson and R. W. G.

Currently, selected new vehicles are tested by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) for pedestrian protection; the GTR testing procedure is similar, but has different test conditions. The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate how many vehicles tested by ANCAP might be expected to pass the headform testing requirements of the GTR based on the vehicles ANCAP performance. Initially, three popular vehicles were tested to the specifications of the GTR. The resulting data was used to validate a theoretical relationship that predicts the change in Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for a given change in headform mass and impact speed. This relationship was used to predict the best-case and worst-case results for 60 vehicles previously tested by ANCAP, 33 of which are current models. The results indicate that a relatively small number of vehicles would be expected to unequivocally pass the GTR requirements, however many more may pass with little to no modifications.

40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the key topics of discussion in the area of vehicle safety legislation in Europe and Japan. Leg injuries are the most common injuries found in nonfatal pedestrian accidents. The EC regulation and Euro NCAP are evaluating pedestrian leg protection performance in current vehicles. The TRL legform impactor is specified by the EC regulation, where Phase 1 took effect during 2005 and a draft phase 2 is scheduled to take effect in 2013. The <b>global</b> <b>technical</b> <b>regulation</b> (GTR) pedestrian protection test protocol was made basically using the TRL legform impactor.

Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of pedestrian leg protection performance of the frontal area of current vehicles using the TRL legform impactor and the flexible legform impactor. Different types of vehicles (sedan, sport utility vehicle (SUV), height wagon, and 1 box car) were used.

The draft <b>Global</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Regulation</b> (GTR) on pedestrian protection specifies a minimum level of protection that must be met {{in order for a}} vehicle design to be approved by regulatory bodies. This GTR may be adopted as an Australian Design Rule under a 1998 UNECE agreement. One possible implication of this is that many vehicles may require significant redesign {{in order to meet the}} GTR requirements. The GTR testing protocol is similar to the ANCAP tests, but differs in some respects. The individual impact tests are conducted under less severe conditions: the impact speed is lower, the child headform mass is higher, and the adult headform mass is slightly lower. This paper examines three {{new vehicles}}, and assesses their likelihood of meeting the requirements of the GTR, based on their ANCAP test results. A method for scaling the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for different masses and velocities is used to predict GTR performance from a corresponding ANCAP test result. Among the vehicles considered, the areas tested would produce a significantly lower HIC by the GTR test method than by the ANCAP test method.

The peripheral areas of the head impact test zone defined in the draft GTR produced the most severe impacts, with the most challenging areas being {{in the rear of the}} test zone (in the area of the hinges, cowl, and wiper spindles) and the lateral edges of the test zone adjacent to the fenders. A smaller number of vehicles produced high-severity impacts at the front edge of the test zone. The challenging areas at the periphery of the test zone did not exceed the GTR requirements in every vehicle. Deformable hood hinges with adequate crushable space between the hood panel and fender, coverage of the cowl by the back edge of the hood, and flanges under the fender edge all resulted in significant HIC reductions from those areas in vehicles without these countermeasures. The range of performance in the vehicles tested indicates that while there is room for improvement in current head impact protection in US vehicles, countermeasures exist to improve the worst areas of the test zone.

40|$|AbstractIn 2014 the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) {{adopted the}} <b>global</b> <b>technical</b> <b>regulation</b> No. 15 {{concerning}} the Worldwide harmonized Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP). Having significantly contributed to its development, the European Commission is now aiming at introducing the new test procedure in the European type-approval legislation for light duty vehicles {{in order to}} replace the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) as the certification test. The current paper aims to assess the effect of WLTP introduction on the reported CO 2 emissions from passenger cars presently measured under the New European Driving Cycle and the corresponding test protocol. The most important {{differences between the two}} testing procedures, apart from the kinematic characteristics of the respective driving cycles, is the determination of the vehicle inertia and driving resistance, the gear shifting sequence, the soak and test temperature and the post-test charge balance correction applied to WLTP. In order to quantify and analyze the effect of these differences in the end value of CO 2 emissions, WLTP and NEDC CO 2 emission measurements were performed on 20 vehicles, covering almost the whole European market. WLTP CO 2 values range from 125. 5 to 217. 9 g/km, NEDC values range from 105. 4 to 213. 2 g/km and the ΔCO 2 between WLTP and NEDC ranges from 4. 7 to 29. 2 g/km for the given vehicle sample. The average cold start effect over WLTP was found 6. 1 g/km, while for NEDC it was found 12. 3 g/km. For a small gasoline and a medium sized diesel passenger car, the different inertia mass and driving resistance is responsible 63 % and 81 % of the observed ΔCO 2 between these two driving cycles respectively, whereas the other parameters (driving profile, gear shifting, test temperature) account for the remaining 37 % and 19 %...|$|E
