5|$|In October 2012 {{the state}} {{government}} announced that the freeway's diamond interchange with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights. The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the volume of traffic using local roads to avoid the interchange. The longer term plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> near the freeway interchange, including a second overpass bridge. The <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> works are scheduled for construction in 2014–15.|$|E
5|$|The road then {{bypasses}} Ilchester and RNAS Yeovilton and widens to <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> again. Between Ilchester and Shores Bridge (over the River Parrett, east of South Petherton) {{the road}} follows {{the course of}} the Roman Fosse Way. At Yeovilton the road becomes dual two lane again, and connects with the A37 which joins it until it reaches the end of the bypass. This final section of <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> ends at South Petherton. It runs north of Ilminster as a three-lane road where it meets the A358, providing access to the M5 motorway.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>carriageways</b> or expressways in Croatia (...) are non-tolled roads with 2 or more lanes in each direction, {{but without}} {{emergency}} lanes. The main highways/motorways in Croatia are also <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways,</b> {{but they have}} emergency lanes and tolls.|$|R
30|$|The expressways {{are mostly}} 3 -lane <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways,</b> except at certain {{locations}} {{where they are}} upgraded to 4 -lane <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways.</b> The expressways have on-ramps and slip lanes that allow the vehicles to enter or exit, respectively. All the arterial roads are 2 -lane <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways.</b> The lane widths are 3.7  m for expressways and 3.4  m for other roads. The speed limits vary from 80 to 90  km/h for expressways and 60 to 70  km/h for arterials roads.|$|R
5|$|When the Glynneath bypass {{was built}} in the 1970s, the canal was culverted above Ysgwrfa lock, to allow the road to be straightened, and reduced in width beyond that, to allow the road to be widened. Above Pentremalwed lock, the road was built over the canal bed, and all traces have gone. This road was {{superseded}} by the A465 <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> when it opened in 1996, and has become the B4242 road. The part which covered the final section of the canal is no longer a road, although the <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> runs over the site of the Glynneath basin.|$|E
5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes <b>dual</b> <b>{{carriageway}}</b> from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single carriageway road, {{coming out of the}} valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E
5|$|Further {{works in}} the 1990s saw a second {{carriageway}} constructed from Mundaring to Sawyers Valley, and then extended to The Lakes {{at the edge of}} Perth. A <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> was also constructed in Kalgoorlie, and a long overtaking lane was built near Clackline.|$|E
50|$|In Belgium, {{motorways}} {{but also}} some <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways</b> have numbers preceded by an A. However, those that also have an E-number are generally referenced with that one. City ring and bypasses have numbers preceded by an R, these also can be either motorways or <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely uninterrupted <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, {{the state}} {{government}} has been committed to constructing and upgrading the Perth Bunbury Highway, a route along coastal roads, including Old Coast Road south of Mandurah.

5|$|The A666 <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Devil's Highway because of its numeric designation), is a spur from the M61/M60 motorway interchange through the town centre to Astley Bridge, Egerton, Darwen and Blackburn. The M61 has three dedicated junctions serving the borough.|$|E
5|$|The South Circular Road starts {{just south}} of the ferry {{terminal}} where the A2204 Ferry Approach meets the main east-west road through Woolwich, the A206. It heads south, climbing up John Wilson Street, a section of <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway,</b> until it meets Grand Depot Road and becomes single carriageway through Woolwich Common and Academy Road past the former Royal Military Academy. The route continues south to the A2 at a grade separated junctionone of only two on the routeand continues southwesterly as a <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway,</b> crossing Eltham Road (A210) and Sidcup Road (A20). At the junction with Burnt Ash Hill the road becomes urban single carriageway again, which it remains the case for most of the remainder of the route.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s {{several other}} {{improvement}} projects were planned across {{the length of}} the highway, including between Bedfordale and North Bannister, through Mount Barker, and between Narrikup and Albany. Closer to Perth, the section along Bedfordale Hill (south-east of Armadale) was upgraded to a four-lane <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway,</b> with work completed in June 1999.|$|E

5|$|Shrewsbury {{has been}} an {{important}} centre for road traffic. In 1815, Thomas Telford designed a new coaching route from London to Holyhead in order to improve communications with Ireland. He routed the new road via Shrewsbury, which opened in 1830. The road is now the A5. The road connects the town northwest to Oswestry, and east towards Telford, where it joins the M54. The A5 once ran through the town centre, until a bypass was built in the 1930s. Subsequently, in 1992, a 17-mile (27km) <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> was completed at a cost of 79 million pounds to the south of the town, and was made to form part of the A5 route. This <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> was built further out of the town to act as a substantial link to Telford, as well as a bypass for the town.|$|E
5|$|The M54 is a 23-mile (37km) east-west {{motorway}} in the English {{counties of}} Shropshire and Staffordshire. It is {{also referred to}} as the Telford Motorway, after the road's primary westbound destination, the new town of Telford. The motorway cost £65million to construct, and is two-lane <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> for the majority of its length, with sections of three-lane.|$|E
5|$|While Old Coast Road's <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> was {{advancing}} {{north from}} Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment {{would result in}} a traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, Main Roads began planning for a new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The Roads Act 2007 {{was passed}} {{into law in}} mid-2007. This Act makes {{provision}} for the redesignation of suitable <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways</b> to motorway status. The National Roads Authority made formal applications under Section 8 of the Act to the Minister for Transport on 16 October 2007 regarding <b>dual</b> <b>carriageways</b> which the authority believed to be suitable for redesignation as motorways.|$|R

The average house price across Angus has risen by 14.9% in the past year (to November 2006) and now stands at £124,451. Angus Council suggests the recent upgrading of the A92 between Arbroath and Dundee to <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> has lured Dundonians to Arbroath and this may be driving up house prices.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 and 1992 {{construction}} of Sceneway Garden and Laguna City, respectively, increased the traffic congestion in the Lam Tin area, mainly near Sai Tso Wan. One {{of the new}} arteries built to relieve the problem is Wai Fat Road, a four-lane <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> which serves as an interchange between Route 2 and Route 7 and an outlet from Kwun Tong Bypass to Kwun Tong Industrial Area.|$|E
5|$|The road's design {{varies from}} six lane <b>dual</b> <b>carriageway</b> to urban streets, {{the latter of}} which {{contribute}} to traffic congestion in London and are regularly featured on local traffic reports, particularly at Henlys Corner and Bounds Green in Northwest London. The uncertainty of development has caused urban decay and property blight along its route, and led to criticism over its poor pollution record. Several London Borough Councils have set up regeneration projects to improve the environment for communities surrounding the North Circular.|$|E
