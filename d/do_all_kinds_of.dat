Levine explained that the acoustics and vocals are all recorded with the 87 and the Manley, the basses and electric guitars via DI, adding that [...] "the acoustic guitar that we use is a $150 cheap Fender". He runs most of the keyboards and the MPC through the 02R, and uses a Mackie Big Knob as an interface. He often uses Pro Tools. Despite MIDI being already incorporated in Pro Tools, he doesn't use it extensively. [...] "We’re not making dance songs, so we don’t need the synths to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> crazy stuff. And I fairly quickly render MIDI tracks to audio in Pro Tools". In 2011 {{he was thinking about}} purchasing a Minimoog.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Ai sat on {{the jury}} of an {{international}} initiative to find a universal Logo for Human Rights. The winning design, combining {{the silhouette of a}} hand with that of a bird, was chosen from more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries. The initiative's goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement. In 2013, after the existence of the PRISM surveillance program was revealed, Ai said [...] "Even though we know governments <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> things I was shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation, Prism. To me, it's abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights." ...|$|E

People <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} {{of being in the}} movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E

Every ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands in the pockets, rolls in his gait, talks slang, and is an embryo Coachey.|$|E

This girlish figure filled his eyes with pictures of unforgetable grace and charm. The swing of her skirts as she leaped for the ball, the free sweep of her arm (she had been well instructed), and the lithe bending of her waist brought the lover's sweet unease. When they came to the net now and again, he studied her fine figure with frank admiration. [...] "You are a corker!" [...] was his boyish word of praise. [...] "I don't go up against many men who play the game as well as you do. Your 'form' is a whole lot better than mine. I am a bit lucky, I admit.

60|$|Only the men did this; {{the women}} were too busy. The women <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> work on the continent. They dig, they hoe, they reap, they sow, they bear monstrous burdens on their backs, they shove similar ones long {{distances}} on wheelbarrows, they drag the cart {{when there is no}} dog or lean cow to drag it--and when there is, they assist the dog or cow. Age is no matter--the older the woman the stronger she is, apparently. On the farm a woman's duties are not defined--she does a little of everything; but in the towns it is different, there she only does certain things, the men do the rest. For instance, a hotel chambermaid has nothing to do but make beds and fires in fifty or sixty rooms, bring towels and candles, and fetch several tons of water up several flights of stairs, a hundred pounds at a time, in prodigious metal pitchers. She does not have to work more than eighteen or twenty hours a day, and she can always get down on her knees and scrub the floors of halls and closets when she is tired and needs a rest.|$|E
6000|$|For, Mr. Mopes, by {{suffering}} {{everything about}} {{him to go to}} ruin, and by dressing himself in a blanket and skewer, and by steeping himself in soot and grease and other nastiness, had acquired great renown in all that country-side--far greater renown than he could ever have won for himself, if his career had been that of any ordinary Christian, or decent Hottentot. He had even blanketed and skewered and sooted and greased himself, into the London papers. And it was curious to find, as Mr. Traveller found by stopping for a new direction at this farm-house or at that cottage as he went along, with how much accuracy the morbid Mopes had counted on the weakness of his neighbours to embellish him. A mist of home-brewed marvel and romance surrounded Mopes, in which (as in all fogs) the real proportions of the real object were extravagantly heightened. He had murdered his beautiful beloved in a fit of jealousy and was doing penance; he had made a vow under the influence of grief; he had made a vow under the influence of a fatal accident; he had made a vow under the influence of religion; he had made a vow under the influence of drink; he had made a vow under the influence of disappointment; he had never made any vow, but [...] "had got led into it" [...] by the possession of a mighty and most awful secret; he was enormously rich, he was stupendously charitable, he was profoundly learned, he saw spectres, he knew and could <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> wonders. Some said he went out every night, and was met by terrified wayfarers stalking along dark roads, others said he never went out, some knew his penance to be nearly expired, others had positive information that his seclusion was not a penance at all, and would never expire but with himself. Even, as to the easy facts of how old he was, or how long he had held verminous occupation of his blanket and skewer, no consistent information was to be got, from those who must know if they would. He was represented as being all the ages between five-and-twenty and sixty, and as having been a hermit seven years, twelve, twenty, thirty,--though twenty, on the whole, appeared the favourite term.|$|E
