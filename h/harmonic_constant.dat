Several numerical experiments, including different model dimensions (two-dimension or three-dimension), prescribed open boundary conditions (without or with mean sea surface elevation), astronomical tidal forcing, stratifications (without or with baroclinic effect) and wind forcing, are carried out. The resulted time series of surface elevation data are stored to yield <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants</b> for the four most significant constituents, M- 2, S- 2, K- 1 and O- 1, and the computed <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants</b> are compared with the observed ones. It is shown that the predicted tidal <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants</b> by the three-dimensional model are better than those by the two-dimensional one; with astronomical tidal forcing and mean sea surface elevation at the open boundary, the predicted accuracy could be improved and {{it is recommended that}} the baroclinic effect and wind forcing are also included in the modeling.

40|$|Postnatal {{development}} of the mustached bat's cochlea was studied by measuring cochlear microphonic and compound action potentials. In adults, a cochlear resonance is involved in enhanced tuning to the second <b>harmonic</b> <b>constant</b> frequency component (CF 2) of their echolocation calls at ~ 61 kHz This resonance is present immediately after birth in bats that do not yet echolocate. Its frequency is lower (46 kHz) and the corresponding threshold minimum of cochlear microphonic potentials is broader than in adults. Long-lasting ringing of the cochlear microphonic potential after tone stimulus offset that characterizes the adult auditory response close to CF 2 is absent in newborns. In {{the course of the}} first 5 postnatal weeks, there is a concomitant upward shift of CF 2 and the frequency of cochlear threshold minima. Up {{to the end of the}} third postnatal week, sensitivity of auditory threshold minima and the Q value of the cochlear resonance increase at a fast rate. Between 2 and 4 wk of age, two cochlear microphonic threshold minima are found consistently in the CF 2 range that differ in their level-dependent dynamic growth behavior and are 1. 5 ¿ 5. 7 kHz apart from each other. In older animals, there is a single minimum that approaches adult tuning in its sharpness. The data provide evidence to show that during maturation of the cochlea, the frequency and the sensitivity of the threshold minimum associated with CF 2 increases and that these increases are associated with the fusion of two resonances that are partly dissociated in developing animals...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{auditory}} cortex (AI) {{of adult}} Pteronotus parnellii features a foveal {{representation of the}} second <b>harmonic</b> <b>constant</b> frequency (CF 2) echolocation call component. In the corresponding Doppler-shifted constant frequency (DSCF) area, the 61 kHz range is over-represented for extraction of frequency-shift information in CF 2 echoes. To assess to which degree AI postnatal maturation depends on active echolocation or/and reflects ongoing cochlear maturation, cortical neurons were recorded in juveniles up to postnatal day P 29, before the bats are capable of active foraging. At P 1 - 2, neurons in posterior AI are tuned sensitively to low frequencies (22 - 45 dB SPL, 28 - 35 kHz). Within the prospective DSCF area, neurons had insensitive responses (> 60 dB SPL) to frequencies < 40 kHz and lacked sensitive tuning curve tips. Up to P 10, when bats do not yet actively echolocate, tonotopy is further developed and DSCF neurons respond to frequencies of 51 - 57 kHz with maximum tuning sharpness (Q(10 dB)) of 57. Between P 11 and 20, the frequency representation in AI includes higher frequencies anterior and dorsal to the DSCF area. More multipeaked neurons (33 %) are found than at older age. In the oldest group, DSCF neurons are tuned to frequencies close to 61 kHz with Q(10 dB) values < or = 212, and threshold sensitivity, tuning sharpness and cortical latencies are adult-like. The data show that basic aspects of cortical tonotopy are established before the bats actively echolocate. Maturation of tonotopy, increase of tuning sharpness, and upward shift in the characteristic frequency of DSCF neurons appear to strongly reflect cochlear maturation...|$|E

The model {{is based on}} the major regional inundation factors - spring tides and warm-water mass, integrated with the digital elevation. Nineteen years of sea level data from tide gauge and satellite altimetry are analyzed to predict regional flooding. Harmonic analysis is used in analyzing tidal variations to determine the major astronomical tidal constituent <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants.</b> Tidal variation prediction can be performed with these <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants.</b> The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is then applied to the sea level data derived from altimetry for extracting warm-water mass variation. Ninety percent of sea level data points are used for analysis, and the remaining 10 % are used for testing the prediction accuracy. The sea level data derived from along-track satellite altimeter near Tuvalu is decomposed into eight modes and one local trend using the EMD method. The EMD mode periods found by fast Fourier transform (FFT) include monthly, intra-seasonally, half-yearly, yearly, bi-annually, and inter-annually oscillations. We apply these periods to harmonic analysis to predict the variations in warm-water mass. The sea level tide and warm-water mass combination predictions are compared to field measurements.

40|$|A 1 / 12 °, 2 -D {{barotropic}} tide {{model was}} used to examine the characteristics of barotropic tides and to improve the accuracy of predicting tidal sea levels and currents in the seas around Taiwan. The form ratio suggests that tides are predominantly semidiurnal in the northern reaches of the Taiwan Strait and mixed of diurnal and semidiurnal elsewhere around Taiwan. When the dominant M 2 wave enters the Strait from the north, its amplitude is magnified to ~ 2 m in the middle, and then decreases rapidly toward {{the south end of the}} Strait. The predominance of diurnal tides along the southwest to the south coast of Taiwan is attributed to the quasi-resonance of diurnal waves in the South China Sea. The tidal range is small and tidal currents are weak off the east coast of Taiwan. Barotropic tidal energy is mostly dissipated on the shallow banks of the southwestern Strait. Results summarized from sensitivity tests on the bottom drag coefficient (CD) and horizontal eddy viscosity (AM) indicate that CD = 0. 0015 - 0. 00175 and AM = 150 m 2 s- 1 lead to the best model-data fit when compared to the observed tidal sea levels at ten reference tide-gauge stations around Taiwan. The averaged root-mean-squared (RMS) differences of the simulated tidal sea level for the six principal constituents of O 1, P 1, K 1, N 2, M 2, and S 2 are significantly reduced to 1. 3, 0. 7, 2. 0, 1. 6, 5. 1, and 3. 1 cm, respectively, compared to that calculated from a 0. 5 ° resolution global tide <b>harmonic</b> <b>constant</b> database, NAO. 99 b (Matsumoto et al. 2000).

By employing a Kalman filter to estimate the harmonic parameters recursively, the estimates can be adapted contineously to chaning conditions.

This model consists of two submodels: the POD reduced order forward model is used to simulate the tides, while its adjoint model is used to optimize the control variables. Numerical experiment is carried out to assimilate the <b>harmonic</b> <b>constants,</b> which are derived from TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter data, into the 2 D tidal model through optimizing the initial values and the temporally and spatially varying open boundary conditions (OBCs). The absolute mean difference between the model results and observations is 3. 2 [*]cm and 2. 9 ∘ for amplitude and phase-lag, respectively, better than the results of Lu and Zhang (2006), suggesting that {{the construction of the}} POD reduced order model and the inversion of control variables are successful...|$|R
40|$|The time {{evolution}} of the coherent forward scattering of Synchrotron radiation for resonant nuclei in Brownian motion is studied. Apart from target thickness, the appearance of dynamical beats also depends on α which is the ratio of <b>harmonic</b> force <b>constant</b> to the damping force <b>constant</b> of a <b>harmonic</b> oscillator undergoing Brownian motion.

Assuming the same relative strengths of each harmonic, as the fundamental frequency changes, the relative position of these <b>harmonics</b> remains <b>constant.</b> This can make identification of instruments much easier. The constant Q transform {{can also be used}} for automatic recognition of musical keys based on accumulated chroma content.|$|R
