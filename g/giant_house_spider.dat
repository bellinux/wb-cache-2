50|$|Eratigena is a genus of spider in the Agelenidae family. Most of its {{species were}} {{moved from the}} genus Tegenaria in 2013. Two species that {{frequently}} build webs in and around human dwellings are now placed in this genus. Eratigena agrestis is the hobo spider, native to Europe and Central Asia, introduced to North America. Eratigena atrica is the <b>giant</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider,</b> native to Europe and also introduced into North America.|$|E

5000|$|A {{population}} of giant house spiders is popularly {{thought to be}} a deterrent to the establishment of Eratigena agrestis, known in North America as the [...] "hobo spider", and considered by some to be more likely to bite humans. Giant house spiders may compete with hobo spiders for the same resources.Hobo spiders grow no more than a body size of 15 mm long whereas the larger female <b>giant</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> can have a body size of 18 mm, but has proportionately much longer legs.|$|E

50|$|House spiders of {{the genus}} Tegenaria are fast-running {{brownish}} funnel-web weavers that occupy much of the Northern Hemisphere except for Japan and Indonesia. Of all agelenids, Tegenaria possesses the largest species of funnel weavers: the Cardinal spider (T. parietina), whose species' females reach 18 mm in body size. Up until very recently, the genus contained several more species which have now been removed into different genera; in particular, the recently described genus Eratigena, which now contains both the <b>giant</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> (Eratigena atrica) and the infamous hobo spider (Eratigena agrestis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider,</b> {{now with}} the {{scientific}} name Eratigena atrica, {{is one of the}} biggest spiders of Central and Northern Europe. It was previously placed in the genus Tegenaria, where in addition to Tegenaria atrica, it was also documented as Tegenaria duellica, Tegenaria gigantea and Tegenaria saeva, among others, all thought to be different species. It is now a member of the newly described genus Eratigena. The bite of this species does not pose a threat to humans or pets, and it is generally reluctant to bite, preferring to escape.|$|E

50|$|The webs {{built by}} the <b>giant</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> are flat and messy with a funnel at one end. They do not contain sticky threads. The spider lurks in the funnel until a small {{invertebrate}} happens to get trapped in the web, {{at which point the}} spider runs out and attacks it. They usually build their webs in corners (on both the floor and ceiling), between boxes in basements, behind cupboards, in attics, or any other area that is rarely disturbed by large animals, or humans. Often found near window openings.|$|E
5000|$|The two sexes do {{not differ}} in {{coloration}} or markings. Its coloration is mainly dark brown. On its sternum is a lighter marking, with three light spots on each side. The opisthosoma features a lighter middle line with six [...] "spots" [...] on each side. The <b>giant</b> <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> has the same coloration as the domestic house spider, Tegenaria domestica; it has earthy tones of brown and muddy red or yellow. They also have conspicuously hairy legs, palps and abdomen. Despite its English name, this species is not the largest species in the genus (that being Tegenaria parietina). The female body size can reach 18.5 mm in length, with males having a slightly smaller body at around 12 to 15 mm in length. The female leg span is typically around 45 mm. The leg span of the male is highly variable, with spans between 25 to 75 mm being common.|$|E
25|$|The common <b>house</b> <b>spider</b> (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), {{referred}} to internationally as the American <b>house</b> <b>spider,</b> is a spider {{species of the}} genus Parasteatoda that is mainly indigenous to the New World, with P. tepidariorum australis (common gray <b>house</b> <b>spider)</b> also encountered {{in some parts of}} Myanmar and Pakistan. American <b>house</b> <b>spiders</b> are synanthropic and build their tangled webs in or near human dwellings, often in secluded areas such as between loose walls and behind open doors and attic windows. Statistically, they are the most often encountered spider by humans in North America, and least likely to adopt defensive behavior in their vicinity. Their prey mechanism {{is similar to that of}} the other cobweb spiders: the spider follows disturbances transmitted along the web to entangle and then paralyze its prey, which usually consists of household insects and other invertebrates (often considered as pests).|$|R
