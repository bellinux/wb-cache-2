60|$|But {{there was}} another new factor in the {{situation}} which was of greater local importance. The British Prime Minister had perceived that the conclusion of hostilities might soon bring with it the break-up of the political bloc upon which he was depending for his personal ascendency, and that the domestic difficulties which would be attendant on demobilization, the turn-over of industry from war to peace conditions, the financial situation, and the general psychological reactions of men's minds, would provide his enemies with powerful weapons, {{if he were to}} leave them time to mature. The best chance, therefore, of consolidating his power, which was personal and exercised, as such, independently of party or principle, to an extent unusual in British politics, evidently lay in active hostilities before the prestige of victory had abated, and in an attempt to found on the emotions of the moment a new basis of power which might outlast the inevitable reactions of the near future. Within a brief period, therefore, after the Armistice, the popular victor, {{at the height of his}} influence and his authority, decreed a General Election.

40|$|The free {{movement}} of workers enshrined in Article 45 TFEU {{is one of the}} fundamental principles of the European Union. Although Article 45 TFEU contains clear references to specific rights for workers, which have been implemented in several pieces of secondary legislation (e. g. Directive 2004 / 38, Regulation (EU) No 492 / 2011 as well as Regulations (EC) No 883 / 2004 and (EC) No 987 / 2009), the key concepts regarding the scope of application of the {{free movement}} of workers derive from case law. Article 45 TFEU applies to migrant workers, i. e. persons performing services for and under the direction of another person in return for which they receive remuneration, provided their activity is not marginal and ancillary. This includes full-time workers, part-time workers (no matter how many hours worked), seasonal workers, frontier workers, working students and jobseekers. Article 45 TFEU does not apply to non-remunerated work including voluntary work and care work within the family unit. It is open to debate whether it should apply to internships and other forms of non-remunerated work which are aimed at facilitating access to the paid labour market. Migration exists whenever the worker has moved between EU Member States: this includes migration to another Member State to work there; returning to the home State after having worked abroad; and living in one Member State and working in a different one. Article 45 TFEU can be invoked also by employers to challenge restrictions on the possibility to hire workers. The family of the worker is also protected by both primary and secondary provisions of EU law. In order to be protected by the Treaty {{free movement of}} workers provisions a claimant must fall within the personal scope of the Treaty, i. e. he or she must fall within the definition of worker. Even though the concept of worker has been interpreted broadly, there are some grey areas, in particular in relation to employment which pursues an ulterior aim, such as social reintegration schemes. For the claimant, being classified as a worker is of paramount importance since the status carries a wealth of rights (non-discrimination, access to benefits, unconditional right to reside in the host State). Work also needs to be remunerated, but the concept of remuneration is flexible so that a quid pro quo (such as board and lodging) might count as remuneration. However, certain work (internships, apprenticeships etc) is often of economic value for the employer, and of value to the person performing it; and yet, the fact that such activity attracts no remuneration might leave a vulnerable section of workers devoid of protection in European law. Next to that, Member States may police the definition of worker rather rigidly, so that those who work are in fact treated as economically inactive, and so subject to indirectly discriminatory rules that would not be justified if applied to workers. The Commission should be ready to challenge any restrictive practices in defining migrant work, which may result in significant detriment to part-time workers. The same should be said in relation to atypical work contracts, such as zero-hours contracts, and there are also problems with the status of compulsory work placements in order to receive benefits. Therefore, given the changed landscape of the labour market, in order to determine whether there is an employment relationship the focus should be on whether the worker is able to refuse work offered (useful guidelines could be provided by national laws on the application of minimum terms and wages and similar), rather than on the remuneration. The Commission should also be alive to measures that discriminate against migrant workers once they have become unemployed, challenging restrictive approaches to the retention of worker status which can result in sudden loss of social protection, and arguing that such restrictions defy the broad approach to be taken to defining workers under Article 45 TFEU. Where possible, it would be advisable to characterise migrants as workers in order to trigger the strongest obligations with regard to both indirect discrimination and obstacles to movement. Measures that appear to be directed at the economically inactive can have significant effects upon migrant workers, increasing the disadvantages of becoming unemployed, even though many migrant workers move between jobs, and so making their work more precarious. The use of Article 45 TFEU in the context of access to the labour market, and an empirically evidenced, broad approach to benefits necessary to subsist, and so make access to the labour market possible, could help to avoid {{a situation in which the}} biggest obstacles to the free movement of workers are obstacles that prevent migrants from becoming migrant workers in the first place, or from regaining worker status having become unemployed. This could be combined with contesting indirect discrimination, wherever the measures in question can be framed as restricting access to benefits that facilitate access to the labour market. Measures that make it more difficult for own state nationals to seek work having worked elsewhere in the EU should be identified and challenged. Finally, the Commission has a role to play, both through case work, and through awareness-raising activities, in stressing to national legislatures and judiciaries the importance of the prohibition of obstacles to movement. This is especially important in the light of the new Enforcement Directive; Member States need to appreciate and implement the principles contained therein if they are to effectively enforce them. Article 45 TFEU prevents national rules that discriminate directly on grounds of nationality, e. g. only Italians can work for the Ministry of Defence. These rules can be justified by relying on the Treaty derogations. It is also directed towards measures that discriminate indirectly on grounds of nationality, e. g. in order to be employed in a school the worker needs to be fluent in Italian. These rules can be justified on imperative <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> provided they are necessary and proportionate. Finally, Article 45 precludes obstacles/barriers/restrictions to the worker’s ability or desirability to move or access the market, e. g. a worker returning to Italy after having worked abroad will not be eligible for certain benefits; or a worker cannot be employed by more than one employer, or in more than one Member State. These rules can also be justified on imperative <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> as above. Although there are numerous studies and doctrinal contributions on the development from a discrimination approach toward an obstacle approach and all the consequences this has, it should be stressed that most free movement of persons cases could be treated using a discrimination approach, albeit ‘discrimination based on migration’ rather than pure nationality discrimination. The language of obstacles is in itself perhaps a bit misleading, since the cases predominantly deal with obstacles to movement rather than mere obstacles to market access experienced after movement. The construct of discrimination on grounds of movement might also help with making ‘obstacle’ arguments more accessible in national courts, by framing them as a familiar, hard legal concept (discrimination), and accepting inherent limits hinted at by the Bosman case law, that only measures penalising the exercise of free movement rights be caught. Discrimination on grounds of migration has the advantage of creating clearer boundaries (therefore making it easier to apply law) to the free movement of persons, whilst at the same time being less intrusive to national regulatory autonomy. The classification as ‘discrimination’ or ‘obstacles/restrictions/barriers’ in the case law should not be considered excessively rigid. What really matters is whether the rule has an effect on intra-Union migration. If such an effect is found through either discrimination or a barrier to movement or an obstacle, then the rule will have to be justified. In order to claim indirect discrimination it is sufficient that the rule might affect more foreigners or migrants than nationals and no particular evidence is required. In order to claim an obstacle it is sufficient to show that the rule might deter or discourage the free movement of workers, or that it might constitute a barrier to market access. Again no particular evidence is required. For this reason, it is advisable to claim both discrimination and obstacle in litigation. There are nonetheless some manifest differences between the discrimination and the obstacle approach. If a finding of discrimination can be supported by statistical data, then it will be very difficult for the Member State to defend such discrimination. A finding of discrimination is then again politically less problematic. This is so because if the CJEU finds discrimination the Member State might amend the rules simply to remove that discrimination, whilst if the CJEU finds that the rule is an unjustified obstacle to free movement the Member State will have to remove the rule for all economic operators. This might be very important should governments seek to introduce new restrictions on, for instance, the possibility to claim benefits or social advantages. Once discrimination is established the Graf doctrine (effect of rule too remote and indirect) cannot be invoked: no matter how minimal the discrimination is, it always needs to be justified. On the other hand, the Member State might attempt to reverse a claim of discrimination with statistical data (albeit this would not be conclusive). There are also inherent limits to the definition of ‘obstacle’, as a rule is not to be considered an obstacle if it is inherent in the organisation of the employment concerned or if the effect of the rule is too uncertain and indirect to be qualified as a barrier to movement. Finally, it can be observed that the justification of indirect discrimination and obstacles runs along similar lines. In several cases the CJEU does not carry out a separate assessment of necessity and proportionality, so that it would simply look at whether the measure is ‘appropriate’ and necessary to achieve the purported aim. In more recent times, the scrutiny as to the necessity of measures has also focused on issues such as the coherence of the rule within the legal system. Case law suggests that where both are established, indirect discrimination may be more readily justified by a Member State than obstacles to movement, where the former typically affect non-nationals and the latter own nationals. The more traditional proportionality assessment, on the other hand, focuses very much on whether the restriction on the person’s freedom is out of proportion with the policy aim pursued. ‘Proportionality proper’ is a very useful tool in the armoury of private claimants, especially in those cases where the rule itself might be legitimate but the application of the rule to that particular claimant is disproportionate because of the hardship it would cause. ‘Proportionality proper’ is less useful in relation to the abstract review of legislation (as it is carried out in Commission proceedings) where rules can only be declared either compatible or incompatible with Union law without there been any possibility for an individual assessment. In those cases, the analysis would focus on whether the measure is appropriate and necessary as detailed above...|$|E
40|$|In this {{extract from}} his new book, JOHN WARHURST looks at {{the rise and fall}} of the Hawke {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s Lobbyists Registration Scheme. Professor Warhurst 2 ̆ 7 s book, Behind Closed Doors: Politics, Scandals and the Lobbying Industry, describes the growing importance of the lobbying industry and looks at proposals for reform. THE scandal that prompted Australia’s first and only national registration scheme for lobbyists came to be known as the Combe-Ivanov affair. The principal Australian participant was a long-serving Labor Party employee, David Combe, who had served as its national secretary from 1973 to 1981. When Combe left the Labor Party he set himself up in Canberra as a lobbying firm, David Combe and Associates. Following the election of the Hawke government in 1983, Combe, who was regarded as a pre-eminent Labor insider with very good contacts in the new government, found that his clientele grew to such an extent that he was overwhelmed with business. He began to share some of his clients with an established Canberra lobbying firm, Australian Public Affairs Consultants, whose principals included David Barnett, former press secretary to the Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Fraser. So, with cross-party connections, Combe was a mainstream, uncontroversial figure in Australian public affairs. In the course of business life in the national capital, Combe had established a relationship with Valeri Ivanov, first secretary at the Soviet embassy. Ivanov was being closely watched by the security service, ASIO, which suspected he was a KGB spy. Shortly after coming to office following a campaign in which Hawke had lightheartedly debunked Fraser’s “reds under the beds” campaign, the Hawke government accepted ASIO’s case and Ivanov was expelled from Australia. For Labor, the case was an unwelcome return of the cold war security issues that usually operated to the electoral advantage of the Coalition parties. The issue widened into a royal commission into the Australian security agencies by Justice Robert Hope, and eventually led to the resignation of the special minister of state, Mick Young, who was accused of leaking confidential cabinet information about the affair to another lobbyist with Labor connections, Eric Walsh (once press secretary to Gough Whitlam), in a motel carpark. The government accepted that Combe, an intimate acquaintance of most of its front bench and one of Hawke’s close friends, was a security risk and denied him any further access to its ministers. His career as a lobbyist was destroyed in an instant. But there was considerable sympathy for him in the labour movement, with many people considering that he had been treated unfairly or at least harshly. Sometime later Combe was partially restored to grace and to his livelihood when the government offered him the position of Australian trade commissioner to Vancouver. A government career in several senior postings in the trade service followed. The major government response to the issues surrounding the Combe affair was its move to regulate the lobbying industry, which was made suddenly in the middle of an unaccustomed glare of publicity. The government’s general intentions were announced when the special minister of state’s department published a discussion paper, Lobbyists and the Australian Government and Parliament, in September 1983. The paper canvassed various options, including regulation by legislation, maintenance of a register of lobbyists and self-regulation by means of a code of conduct. Consultation about how best to proceed took place with an informal group of Canberra lobbyists. In December 1983 the government chose to establish the Lobbyists Registration Scheme by executive decision rather than by legislation. In introducing the scheme, which the Coalition parties opposed, the responsible acting minister, Kim Beazley, argued that it was a major step forward. “These lobbyists would be given the importance and significance that they are assuming in the democratic process in this country,” he told parliament, “something which is entirely appropriate at this stage. ” But the government really had no intention of making this scheme either important or significant. It was driven by public relations concerns. The key question for the government was who should be considered a lobbyist. The options included commercial lobbyists, professionals such as lawyers and accountants whose activities were often indistinguishable from lobbyists’, associations and pressure groups, and corporations whose staff lobbied on their own behalf. The commercial lobbyists themselves favoured a broad, inclusive definition of lobbyist like the one used in the US Regulation of Lobbying Act 1946, in order to avoid being the centre of attention. But they eventually opted, for pragmatic reasons or under pressure from the government, for the narrowest of definitions that exactly described their part of the industry: “a person (or company) who, for financial or other advantage, represents a client in dealings with Commonwealth Government ministers and officials. ” This definition excluded the majority of lobbying and lobbyists (as broadly defined), including owners, directors and employees of corporations and directors and staff of national associations and pressure groups. It also excluded some potential targets, including backbenchers, who were certainly on the receiving end of the political lobbying of the day, and remain so. Because the government did not control the Senate, members of the upper house also became important targets. Equally importantly, the definition of “dealings” was also very narrow. Mainstream lobbying activities that did not need to be registered included “inquiries about publicly available information; requests for clarification of current legislation, guidelines or policies; requests for rulings pursuant to existing legislation, guidelines or policies; applications for decisions within existing legislation, guidelines or policies other than those applying to the award of contracts and tenders. ” Yet such dealings were part of the normal business of commercial lobbyists, perhaps the main part in many instances. The “registrable” activities were those representations undertaken for financial or other advantage which involved efforts “to make or amend legislation of the Commonwealth or territories other than the Northern Territory; to make or change Government guidelines or policies; to influence Government decisions on awarding contracts and tenders, or appointments to public office; and on other significant matters determined from time to time by the minister. ” The registers created by the scheme would not be on public display. Instead the government set up two confidential registers: a special one for lobbyists representing foreign clients and a general one for lobbyists representing domestic clients. The whole scheme began operating in March 1984. Applications from lobbyists for their activities to be placed on the special register were to be “checked to see if they adversely affect the national interest or national security. ” Access to the information contained in the two registers was to be made available only to “ministers and government officials who have a need to know. ” Later, a responsible minister found that this was interpreted strictly and that he was expected to visit the department personally to inspect the register; only after pressure was applied to the department was the register brought to his office. One shadow minister was refused access under any conditions. Lobbyists had to apply to register each time they accepted a brief or a new client. The application form required a brief description of the activity to be undertaken. Once registered, lobbyists were expected to produce the letter of acceptance from the registrar whenever contacting ministers or officials about this activity. Lobbyists were quite content to comply with the requirements because they were not onerous. Indeed, it has been argued that the “legitimacy conferred” by the registration scheme was “the most important factor improving the standing of the lobbyist” in the years following. At the same time that the registration scheme was introduced a complementary extension of the ministerial code of conduct for dealing with lobbyists was also introduced. Ministers were advised to avoid granting special access or privileges to any lobbyist because of his or her background. This was a clear warning to ministers to be wary of advantaging lobbyists who, like Combe, had Labor Party connections. They were also asked to insist that, where possible, lobbyists were accompanied by the clients they were representing when they visited their offices. The only sanction for lobbyists who broke these rules was that ministers and officials were advised not to deal with unregistered lobbyists and to report any who came to their notice. Experience would show that this was not enough. Compliance depended on registration becoming an accepted part of the culture of the lobbying relationship, taken seriously by ministers, officials and lobbyists. This did not occur. The Liberal-National Coalition, in opposition from 1983 to 1996, was never enamoured of the scheme. It did not support registration when it was first introduced because it saw the scheme as an unconvincing attempt to distract attention from relations between government ministers and certain lobbyists. The Coalition opportunistically called for “a register of trustworthy ministers” rather than a register of lobbyists. If there was to be a register, it wanted a broader scheme that encompassed national associations and other lobbyists, but its preference was for self-regulation. Later, during the 1987 election campaign, the Liberal Party earmarked the scheme for abolition. For their part, the responsible ministers encouraged their ministerial colleagues and departmental officers to adhere to the scheme. But a 1985 review, which led to minor changes to the paperwork, alerted the government to the fact that the scheme was already honoured more in the breach than in the observance. In particular, it appeared that lobbyists were only rarely asked to show their letters of registration when dealing with ministers and their offices. Few enquiries were directed to the registrar. Subsequently the responsible minister, usually a junior member of the front bench, regularly and formally requested all ministers to alert their staff and their departments to the requirements of the scheme. One minister went further than this. Senator Nick Bolkus, Labor’s minister for administrative services, 1990 - 93, was attracted to the idea of strengthening the scheme after learning of US and Canadian regulations during a trip to Washington. He was particularly impressed by the thinking behind the 1989 Canadian scheme, which had been introduced after the Australian scheme was created. He was also sensitive to media criticism that Canberra’s scheme was a sham. He judged that, despite his best efforts (and those of his predecessors), the scheme was often ignored. Bolkus took a submission to cabinet in mid 1991 for a new legislative scheme to be introduced during the August 1991 budget sittings of parliament. This legislation would have made the registration scheme more comprehensive, established the register as a public document and introduced penalties for non-compliance. The coverage of lobbyists would have been extended to employees of organisations such as associations and corporations. MPs would also have been included among those targets to be registered. The initiative was justified on the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and public accountability. There was some increased expenditure, but within the departmental budget allocation. The submission was unsuccessful and the idea died. It had few strong supporters anywhere in cabinet, the bureaucracy or the parliamentary party. The economic departments were opposed. It appears that the government saw few obvious benefits and feared criticism from the lobbying industry. Six months after the Howard government took office in March 1996, lobbyists with an active entry on the register received a letter from the registrar. Following a review of the operation of the registration scheme, he wrote, the government had decided to abolish it. The decision had been made, according to the registrar, after the government had taken into account “both changes which have taken place in the lobbying industry since 1984 and the general changes which have evolved in government processes and the role of parliament to ensure that relevant community and business interests are consulted in the decision making process” - hardly an informative explanation. The responsible minister, David Jull, was more candid on 21 November when he gave a brief answer to a friendly question from a government backbencher in the House of Representatives. “[F]rankly,” he said, “it was a toothless tiger and its provisions were really unenforceable. ” He gave three reasons for abolition in addition to the general rationale given by the registrar. First, “the requirements of the scheme were just not being adhered to. ” This certainly appeared to be true of one aspect of the scheme: in the three years prior to the government’s coming to office only eight enquiries had been made to the registrar. Second, there had been “quite a bit of criticism that the register was not available for public scrutiny. ” This could easily have been rectified. Third, “the scheme was an unnecessary hindrance to the business sector. ” The first two reasons go to the heart of the matter. In its existing form the scheme was a dead letter. Given that reality, then Jull’s third reason was nonsense, as an unenforceable scheme puts no strain on anyone, though as an explanation it was perhaps superficially appealing to the government’s business clientele. The scheme either had to be strengthened, perhaps along the lines proposed earlier by Senator Bolkus, or dropped. The Liberal Party had never supported it. The incoming government was seeking public sector cuts and aiming to remove “red tape. ” The Department of Administrative Services had little enthusiasm for the scheme which was administered, ironically, from within its awards and national symbols division. Public reporting was confined to the annual reports of the relevant departments: the Department of the Special Minister of State until 1987, then the lowly ranked Department of Administrative Services. Only a few lines in the annual report of the relevant department were devoted to the scheme each year, and over the decade the trickle of information virtually dried up. Until 1987 the department provided the number of lobbyists and clients registered each year; after 1987 it provided only the number of lobbyists; and after 1991 it ceased to provide any figures at all. This apparently suited the government, the opposition, the department and the lobbyists themselves. Advocates of open government seem not to have been concerned to pressure the government for more information. The number of registered lobbyists on the general register grew from 151 at 30 June 1985 to 238 in July 1991, while the number on the special register of lobbyists representing foreign clients grew from 22 to 33 over the same period. We do not know the extent of overlap, but it was possibly extensive. The number of clients for about the same period, 1985 - 91, increased on the general register from 601 to 917 and on the special register from 31 to 49. This indicates an independent commercial lobbying industry of a size in keeping with public knowledge and expectations. Most of these lobbyists were consultants, with a small number of lawyers, accountants and customs agents. The special register included 27 individual foreign countries represented by lobbyists. The only other figures available were those for the number of enquiries to the registrar, which the minister, David Jull, provided in November 1996. The eight enquiries made by ministers, ministerial staff or departmental officers over three years from 1993 to 1995 were tabled as evidence that the “requirements of the scheme were just not being adhered to. ” Yet they can also be seen as evidence of a limited scheme operating according to expectations. Officeholders would only contact the register if they were taking the scheme seriously or if something was amiss. Given the purpose of the scheme, this was unlikely. The registrar himself, in 1995, argued that the idea of registration was to “erect a watch-tower but for the time being to leave it open. ” There is no evidence that the national interest provisions of the special register were ever acted on. Since the scheme was abandoned there has been little expressed interest in the regulation of lobbying. In March 2004, however, the new Labor opposition leader, Mark Latham, did propose a new transparent scheme involving a register of lobbyists and their clients and a code of conduct for lobbyists, with all of the information available to the public on the internet. In this case, there had been no scandal to focus attention on the growing industry. The government’s problems had centred instead on the conduct of its ministers and parliamentary secretaries, several of whom had been dismissed over conflicts of interest and the misuse of travel entitlements. Attention was focused on ministers themselves rather than on those who lobbied them, so Latham’s proposal excited little public interest and no response from the Howard government. The public interest would have to wait for another scandal. • John Warhurst is professor of political science at the Australian National University.
