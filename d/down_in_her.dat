25|$|Lange {{was born}} in Cloquet, Minnesota, on April 20, 1949. Her father, Albert John Lange (1913–1989), was a teacher and {{traveling}} salesman, and her mother, Dorothy Florence (née Sahlman; 1913–1998), was a housewife. She has two older sisters, Ann and Jane, and a younger brother, George. Her paternal ancestry originates in Germany and the Netherlands, while her maternal ancestry originates in Finland. Due {{to the nature of}} her father's professions, her early home life was chaotic. Her family moved over a dozen times to various towns and cities in Minnesota before settling back <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hometown, where she graduated from Cloquet High School.|$|E
25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> letter withdrawing her nomination, she pointed to the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
25|$|Claire (Kathryn Reynolds)—Chester's {{secretary}} and mistress in Season 1. She {{had been with}} Chester as his secretary for twelve years, and had been his mistress for almost as long. During the first season, she blackmails Chester, ordering him to divorce his wife or go to prison for Securities Fraud. During one of her lunchtime dates with Chester, Jessica saw them kissing and cuddling and she finally realizes that Chester {{was not to be}} trusted (upon seeing the two, Jessica breaks <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sister, Mary's arms). Chester later dumps and then fires Claire to support Jessica during the trial, which sends Claire into a screaming rage in the restaurant, trashing their meal in the process. She made good on her threat to call the Securities and Exchange Commission and blows the whistle on Chester.|$|E
50|$|Samsaengi {{is set in}} the 70's in Seoul {{and tells}} the story of a woman (played by Hong Ah-reum) who becomes a {{promising}} oriental herbal doctor after going through many ups and <b>downs</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life. It is also about innocent, yet desperate love of four different people who have different ways of love.|$|R
30|$|Despite the participants’ anxiety {{variations}} in different situations, {{we can also}} find {{a certain amount of}} stability within students’ own conditions. For example, Sarah’s attitude toward learning English and also speaking is positive; thus, she experienced lower levels of anxiety than the other participants in most situations despite observed ups and <b>downs</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> anxiety trend.|$|R

25|$|In 1948, Faut {{missed the}} spring {{training}} camp {{to be held}} in March and reported to the Blue Sox after her postnatal period. She recovered her old form in mid-June, determined to adjust her arm angle on her pitching deliveries. This change to overhand pitching did not mean that a pitcher could not drop <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> delivery. Occasionally, Faut threw a pitch below sidearm to keep opposing hitters off balance with an array of five quality pitches. She still produced a fine season, fashioning a 16–11 record with 165 strikeouts and a 1.44 ERA in 34 games, hurling 250 innings, ranking seventh among pitchers with at least 45 or more innings, ending seventh in ERA and eighth in strikeouts. The smaller ball and overhand delivery made her curveball pitch more effective. That season, Grand Rapids' Alice Haylett went 25–5 with a league-best 0.77 ERA, while Racine's Joanne Winter finished 25–12 and led in strikeouts (248). On September 4, Faut pitched her first no-hitter, beating the host Racine Belles, 7–0. Her teammate Lillian Faralla had thrown a no-hitter against Racine on May 11, so two Blue Sox pitchers defeated the Belles with two no-hitters in the same season.|$|E
25|$|Baltacha {{began her}} 2008 season by {{qualifying}} for the ASB Classic, beating compatriot, Melanie South, along the way. She faced two-time ASB Classic champion and number 7 seed, Eleni Daniilidou, {{in the opening}} round and was beaten. She then progressed to round two of the qualifying tournament for the Australian Open when her first round opponent, Virginie Pichet, retired when down one set. She was beaten {{in the second round}} of qualifying by Zhang Shuai. In February she tried to qualify for Doha (tier I) and Dubai (tier II) but was unsuccessful in both. She then returned to action on the ITF circuit and won her next two consecutive tournaments: Jersey ($25,000) and Torhout ($75,000). In May she again lost in the first round of the qualifying tournament for the French Open and in June she again received a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic where she was beaten in round one by Ekaterina Makarova. Another wild card granted her entry into the qualifying rounds of the International Women's Open where she won her first match against Naomi Cavaday before retiring at one set <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> second match against Tsvetana Pironkova. She then played in the main draw of Wimbledon (again courtesy of a wild card) where she beat Angelique Kerber in the first round. She was defeated in the second round by China's eventual semifinalist Zheng Jie in straight sets.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{began her}} 2017 {{season at the}} ASB Classic, winning her opening match against local {{wildcard}} Jade Lewis before withdrawing due to a right arm pain. Seeded 13th at the Australian Open, Venus defeated Kateryna Kozlova, qualifier Stefanie Vögele, Duan Yingying and qualifier Mona Barthel in the opening four rounds respectively in straight sets {{to advance to the}} quarterfinals. She defeated 24th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for her 50th win at the Australian Open, the first time Williams won a quarterfinal match in Melbourne since defeating Daniela Hantuchová in 2003. Coming back from a set <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> semifinal match, Williams defeated rising American star Coco Vandeweghe 6–7(3–7), 6–2, 6–3 to advance to her first Grand Slam final since Wimbledon 2009 and her first Australian Open final since 2003. In doing so, she set the Open Era record for the longest span (20 years) between grand slam singles final appearances, having first reached a grand slam singles final at the 1997 US Open. In a closely fought final, she lost 6–4, 6–4 to her younger sister Serena Williams, who made history by winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, surpassing the mark set by Steffi Graf. The following week, Venus competed in the St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy, but lost in the second round to eventual champion Kristina Mladenovic. At the Indian Wells Masters, Venus came back from 1–6, 1–4 down and saved three match points in the second round to defeat Jelena Jankovic, tying their head-to-head record at seven-all. This was her first win at Indian Wells since 2001. She defeated Lucie Safarova and qualifier Peng Shuai in the third and fourth rounds respectively, avenging her previous losses to both players. She lost to the eventual champion, Elena Vesnina, in the quarterfinals. The following week, Venus scored her first top-ten win since 2015, against Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round of the Miami Open. She defeated World No. 1 Angelique Kerber in the quarterfinals, becoming the oldest player to beat a current World No. 1. She lost for a third consecutive time to eventual champion Johanna Konta in straight sets in her first semi-final in Miami since 2010. This marked her fourth consecutive loss to eventual champions.|$|E

500|$|Hannah Levin of the Seattle {{publication}} The Stranger {{analyzed the}} lyrics to the track [...] "Mrs. Jones", calling it a [...] "particularly rattling sketch of {{what appears to be}} a rape scene, with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives: the ugly attacker ("Look into the bloodrot, you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live"), the vengeful victim ("The abortion left an abscess / Don't ever talk to me like that again"), and the supportive narrator ("Just like a pro, she takes off her dress / And she kicks you <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> snow white pumps")." [...] The song also makes direct references to The Ballad of East and West, a poem by Rudyard Kipling, with the line: [...] "East is east and west is west, and mine was you and mine was best", which is a partial quote from the poem.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B+', {{feeling that the}} series was [...] "getting better with each new episode, and now that it’s been picked up for a full season, I’m {{genuinely}} excited {{to see where the}} show goes from here. “Eye Spy” is a big step in the right direction, delving further into the history of these characters while laying groundwork for future stories. S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t need superheroes to be a captivating TV series, and making sure the human elements are developed {{is the best way to}} guarantee the show’s success." [...] He felt that Armand [...] "does impressive work depicting the mental toll of Akela’s experience, and her intensity early in the episode makes for a poignant final moment when she lays <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> prison cell, finally at peace after years of torment." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode 7.9 out of 10, praising the [...] "darker and edgier elements" [...] of the episode, the Akela/May fight, and Ward's storyline, pointing out that [...] "some viewers have found [...] to be dull. I actually quite enjoyed Ward’s material in the pilot, and this episode was an especially nice spotlight for him ... He got some nice action beats along the way and one of the funnier moments of the episode". He did, however, criticize the fact that half of the team members are unready for combat, stating [...] "3 out of 6 team members being unready for combat is 2 too many." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Paige's {{mother told}} a {{reporter}} that he was 55 rather than 53, saying she knew this because she wrote it <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> Bible. Paige wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Seems like Mom's Bible would know, but she ain't ever shown me the Bible. Anyway, {{she was in her}} nineties when she told the reporter that, and sometimes she tended to forget things." ...|$|E

50|$|Rasher {{departed}} Midway 23 June 1945 to take lifeguard station off southern Formosa. No Allied {{planes were}} <b>downed</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> area before orders arrived {{to proceed to}} the Gulf of Siam. While she was en route the war ended, and Rasher returned to the Philippines. She departed Subic Bay on 31 August arriving New York on 6 October, via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal. Following deactivation overhaul, she was decommissioned 22 June 1946 and {{was placed in the}} Atlantic Reserve Fleet at New London, Connecticut.|$|R
2500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times’ Roger Ebert {{responded to}} these criticisms by saying: Terrence Malick's [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] has been praised for its painterly images and evocative score, but criticized for its muted emotions: Although passions erupt in a deadly love triangle, all the {{feelings}} are somehow held at arm's length. This observation is true enough, {{if you think}} only about {{the actions of the}} adults in the story. But watching this 1978 film again recently, I was struck more than ever with the conviction that {{this is the story of}} a teenage girl, told by her, and its subject is the way that hope and cheer have been beaten <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> heart. We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion: It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.|$|E
2500|$|After the Liberals Gerry Phillips and Gerald M. Butts accused Eves {{of having}} no plan {{to pay for}} his $10.4 billion in promises, Eves {{stumbled}} when he could not provide his own cost for his promises. [...] "I couldn't tell you {{off the top of my}} head," [...] he admitted. Then came a story on the front of the Globe and Mail saying that Ontarians would have to pay [...] "millions" [...] in extra premiums because the election call had delayed implementation of new auto insurance regulations promised by Eves on the eve of the campaign. On Wednesday the government was broadsided when - days after a raid at a meat packing plant exposed the sorry state of public health at some abattoirs - leaked documents showed the PC government had been sitting on recommendations to improve meat safety, leading to calls for a public inquiry by the opposition parties. The issue was made worse when Agriculture Minister Helen Johns refused all media calls and had to be literally tracked <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> riding by reporters.|$|E

50|$|A close {{collaboration}} with saxophone player Wouter Kiers {{led to the}} release of the concept album Comes love in 2005. All of the songs deal with different aspects of love and relationships.After a period of extensive touring in Europe, Mackintosh released the album About crazy. This 2008 album is an intimate portrait of an artist who has seen significant ups and <b>downs</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> personal life. Mackintosh also used the classic Hammond organ to create a distinctive moody and melancholic sound. The album coincidentally marked the start of her long term {{collaboration with}} the Dutch saxophone player Clous van Mechelen.|$|R
