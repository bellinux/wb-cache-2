5|$|Overnight on 25–26 June, {{tensions}} flared at the factory, {{leading to}} a <b>full-blown</b> ethnic brawl between Uyghurs and Han. As {{a result of the}} fighting, 2 Uyghurs died and 118 people were injured, 16 of them seriously. Of the injured, 79 were Uyghurs and 39 were Hans. 400 police and 50 anti-riot vehicles were mobilised.|$|E
5|$|Her hip-hop fluency {{gave her}} an {{advantage}} in the pop-star arms race, helping her to become the presiding voice in an increasingly rap-dominated musical landscape. Her evolution, from rap-adjacent R star (appearing as early as 1998 in a Geto Boys video) to reluctant hip-hop shareholder to <b>full-blown</b> rapper, {{played a role in}} slowly shifting the sound of pop radio.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a <b>full-blown</b> mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} no {{contemporary}} Byzantine account of the Tabuk expedition, {{and many of the}} details come from much later Muslim sources. It has been argued that there is in one Byzantine source possibly referencing the Battle of Mu´tah traditionally dated 629, but this is not certain. The first engagements may have started as conflicts with the Arab client states of the Byzantine and Sassanid empires: the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids of Al-Hirah. In any case, Muslim Arabs after 634 certainly pursued a <b>full-blown</b> invasion of both empires, resulting in the conquest of the Levant, Egypt and Persia for Islam. The most successful generals were Khalid ibn al-Walid and 'Amr ibn al-'As.|$|E
5|$|L'Empire des Mille Planètes (Empire of a Thousand Planets) premiered in Pilote in 1969 {{and marked}} a further {{development}} for the Valérian series and for Mézières art. This story was the series' first <b>full-blown</b> attempt at space opera and it {{set out for the}} first time the two main signature elements of Valérian: the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds. The follow-up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières' art into the style that became prevalent in the Valerian stories of the 1970s and 1980s, with the first realistic renderings of Valérian and Laureline, as opposed to the caricatures of the earlier stories.|$|E
5|$|The Ateneo de Manila University {{left the}} league in 1978 after the {{championship}} series against San Beda College where the final game was held behind closed doors. In September 1980, De La Salle University withdrew from the league after an August 17 game against Colegio de San Juan Letran turned into a <b>full-blown</b> riot {{which led to the}} game being called off. The league ordered the game to be replayed behind closed doors but the then-FIBA recognized basketball association, the Basketball Association of the Philippines, ordered the league to cancel the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} <b>full-blown</b> style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|Upon completion, {{the team}} felt that Alien Crossfire was somewhere between an {{expansion}} and a <b>full-blown</b> sequel. In {{the months leading}} {{to the release of}} Alien Crossfire, multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote the 9episodes of Centauri: Arrival, introducing the Alien Crossfire factions. The game initially had a single production run. Electronic Arts bundled Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire in the Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack in 2000 and included both games in The Laptop Collection in 2003. In 2000, both Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire were ported to Classic Mac OS by Aspyr Media and to Linux by Loki Software.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the Nassau–Suffolk Regional Planning Board {{brought up}} plans to convert CR78 into a six-lane {{expressway}} with new service roads. A similar project was {{planned for the}} nearby four-lane NY347 through Islip. To aid this, ownership and maintenance of CR78 {{was transferred to the}} New York State Department of Transportation on March29, 1972, receiving the designation of NY454. The state immediately expanded NY454 to six lanes, with three in each direction from Holbrook to the terminus of NY347. In 1977, the state designated the portion of the highway in Hauppague as both NY454 and NY347 after {{it became clear that the}} Hauppauge Spur of the Long Island Expressway would not be constructed. The plans to expand NY454 and NY347 into <b>full-blown</b> freeways were discarded by the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{took place}} {{several days after}} a violent {{incident}} in Shaoguan, Guangdong, where many migrant workers are employed {{as part of a}} programme to alleviate labour shortages. According to state media, a disgruntled former worker disseminated rumours in late June that two Han women had been raped by six Uyghur men. Official sources later said they found no evidence to support the rape allegation. Overnight on 25–26 June, tensions at the Guangdong factory led to a <b>full-blown</b> ethnic brawl between Uyghurs and Hans, during which two Uyghur co-workers were killed. Exiled Uyghur leaders alleged the death toll was much higher. While the official Xinhua News Agency reported that the person responsible for spreading the rumours had been arrested, Uyghurs alleged that the authorities had failed to protect the Uyghur workers, or to arrest any of the Han people involved in the killings. They organised a street protest in Ürümqi on 5 July to voice their discontent and to demand a full government investigation.|$|E
5|$|Woodlea's {{exterior}} {{was designed}} in an Italian Renaissance Revival style. The house {{is said to}} have been modeled after Kimberley Hall in Kimberley, Norfolk. Its classical devices of 18th-century English architecture include urns, pediments, columns, and balusters. The house also is a <b>full-blown</b> expression of the American Renaissance. Woodlea incorporates characteristics of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture– the exterior dictates the use of the interior, with family and guest rooms on the third floor. At the north end of the house, situated farthest from the main entrance, and of a size larger than most houses, is the service wing, which contains the servant quarters. Compared to the rest of the house, this wing has lower ceilings, smaller windows, and less exterior trim. In the early 1900s, the wing was clad in ivy.|$|E
5|$|When Harith {{arrived at}} Marw in early July 745, however, the {{situation}} had changed: Yazid was dead, a <b>full-blown</b> civil war had erupted in Syria, and Nasr ibn Sayyar, although still occupying the position of governor, lacked authority. Although he recognized Marwan II (r. 744–750), most of his own followers did not accept Marwan as Caliph. Harith was quick {{to distance himself from}} Nasr: he refused the offer of a district governorship, and distributed the gifts he received among his supporters. Harith vocally denounced Marwan II, and was soon joined by 3,000 of his fellow Tamimis, while his secretary, Jahm ibn Safwan, drummed up further support. Within a short time, he had become a graver threat to Nasr than al-Kirmani. After attempts to negotiate an agreement proved fruitless, Nasr attacked Harith's forces in March 746, and scored a first victory over them, in which Jahm ibn Safwan fell. At this point, al-Kirmani joined forces with Harith, and together they forced Nasr to abandon Marw and withdraw to Naysabur. The two allies entered the capital of Khurasan, but within days fell out and began fighting each other. In these clashes, Harith was killed, leaving al-Kirmani the master of the city. The conflict between Nasr and al-Kirmani continued, but was soon overtaken by events: exploiting the conditions of civil war, the Abbasids under Abu Muslim launched their own anti-Umayyad revolt in Khurasan. Nasr ibn Sayyar tried to conclude an alliance with al-Kirmani, but failed when the latter was murdered by one of Harith's sons in revenge. Abu Muslim managed to exploit the situation to his advantage, and in early 748, his men entered Marw, {{the first step in a}} war that would lead to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement with the Abbasids two years later.|$|E

25|$|An {{article on}} the Victorian Web argues that Rosamond Vincy, in George Eliot's Middlemarch (1871–72), is a <b>full-blown</b> narcissist {{as defined by the}} DSM.|$|E
25|$|However, injuries, weak bench play, and <b>full-blown</b> public {{tension between}} Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, {{and they were}} beaten {{in the second round}} of the 2003 NBA Playoffs by the {{eventual}} champion San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
25|$|The chronic {{recurrent}} phase may {{be marked}} by repeated bouts of uveitis, but is more commonly a chronic, low-grade, often subclinical, uveitis {{that may lead}} to granulomatous anterior inflammation, cataracts, glaucoma and ocular hypertension. <b>Full-blown</b> recurrences are, however, rare after the acute stage is over. Dysacusia may occur in this phase.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} {{there is a}} growing understanding {{of the importance of the}} natural ecology in urban forests. There are numerous projects underway aimed at restoration and preservation of ecosystems, ranging from simple elimination of leaf-raking and elimination of invasive plants to <b>full-blown</b> reintroduction of original species and riparian ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|In the 1983 {{edition of}} his book, Vaillant {{required}} four positive answers to questions on his Problem Drinking Scale (PDS) to indicate alcohol abuse. To diagnose <b>full-blown</b> alcoholism—i.e. alcohol dependence—he used DSM III, which requires either physical tolerance or physiological withdrawal. For the 1995 edition he abandoned the PDS and used the DSM definitions of both abuse and alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|Jenner inoculated Phipps in {{both arms}} that day, {{subsequently}} producing in Phipps a fever and some uneasiness, but no <b>full-blown</b> infection. Later, he injected Phipps with variolous material, the routine method of immunization at that time. No disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again {{showed no sign}} of infection.|$|E
25|$|From {{his diary}} and other {{unpublished}} sources, {{it appears that}} Gauss knew the rules for the cubic and quartic residuacity of integers by 1805, and discovered the <b>full-blown</b> theorems and proofs of cubic and biquadratic reciprocity around 1814. Proofs of these were found in his posthumous papers, {{but it is not}} clear if they are his or Eisenstein's.|$|E
25|$|There were {{isolated}} protests among the population against the draft {{implemented by the}} Sandinista government, which even resulted in <b>full-blown</b> street clashes in Masaya in 1988. However, polls showed the Sandinista government still enjoyed strong support from Nicaraguans. Political opposition groups were splintered and the Contras began to experience defections, although United States aid maintained them as a viable military force.|$|E
25|$|The Touvre {{emerges as}} a <b>full-blown</b> river {{from the head of}} the valley at Ruelle. A trout fishery is located at the source and a pumping station {{supplies}} the drinking water needs of Angoulême. Most of the paper mills are situated on the banks of watercourses in the neighbourhood of the town. Cardboard for packaging, as well as fine vellum for correspondence, have been produced in quantity.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{treatment}} of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either a mood stabilizer (valproate, lithium, or carbamazepine) or an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole). Although hypomanic episodes may respond to a mood stabilizer alone, <b>full-blown</b> episodes are treated with an atypical antipsychotic (often {{in conjunction with a}} mood stabilizer, as these tend to produce the most rapid improvement).|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, {{a series}} of tit-for-tat killings {{culminating}} in a Phalangist massacre of Palestinian civilians, prompted <b>full-blown</b> fighting in Beirut. In August 1975, Jumblatt declared a program for reform of the Lebanese political system, and the LNM openly challenged the government's legitimacy. In October 1975, {{a new round of}} fighting broke out, and quickly spread throughout the country: the Lebanese Civil War had begun.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of mania are the following: heightened mood (either euphoric or irritable); flight {{of ideas and}} pressure of speech; and increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and hyperactivity. They are most plainly evident in fully developed hypomanic states; in <b>full-blown</b> mania, however, they undergo progressively severe exacerbations and {{become more and more}} obscured by other signs and symptoms, such as delusions and fragmentation of behavior.|$|E
25|$|The Transvaal Boer {{republic}} was forcefully annexed by Britain in 1877, during Britain's {{attempt to}} consolidate the states of southern Africa under British rule. Long-standing Boer resentment turned into <b>full-blown</b> rebellion in the Transvaal and the first Anglo-Boer War, {{also known as the}} Boer Insurrection, broke out in 1880. The conflict ended almost as soon as it began with a decisive Boer victory at Battle of Majuba Hill (27 February 1881).|$|E
25|$|By 1896, the {{rebellion}} fomented by the Katipunan, a militant secret society, {{had become a}} <b>full-blown</b> revolution, {{proving to be a}} nationwide uprising. Rizal had earlier volunteered his services as a doctor in Cuba and was given leave by Governor-General Ramón Blanco to serve in Cuba to minister to victims of yellow fever. Rizal and Josephine left Dapitan on August 1, 1896, with letter of recommendation from Blanco.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the crisis sent mixed messages, with falling interest rates doing nothing to support confidence in the rupiah, and the rupiah continued to be sold, as companies who had been borrowing heavily in dollars had to meet their obligation. By 4 October, the currency had collapsed a further 19%, falling to 3,690 per dollar. It had now lost {{a third of its}} value, and there was now a <b>full-blown</b> 'crisis' in Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century came another turn toward {{nationalist}} politics with Solidaridad Gallega (1907–1912) modeled on Solidaritat Catalana in Catalonia. Solidaridad Gallega failed, but in 1916 Irmandades da Fala (Brotherhood of the Language) developed {{first as a}} cultural association but soon as a <b>full-blown</b> nationalist movement. Vicente Risco and Ramón Otero Pedrayo were outstanding cultural figures of this movement, and the magazine Nós ('Us'), founded 1920, its most notable cultural institution, Lois Peña Novo the outstanding political figure.|$|E
25|$|However, these did {{not have}} the erotic context which characterizes modern omorashi media, since they predated the first <b>full-blown</b> anime pornography, which was not {{available}} until 1984, when the advent of the first H anime OVAs such as Wonder Kids' Lolita Anime were made possible by the widespread availability of home video. One example of this later erotic context is the 1994 H anime OVA Vixens, which features scenes of incontinence in a setting that is overtly sexual.|$|E
25|$|A second platform, for an {{extension}} of the siding, or a <b>full-blown</b> second track, was originally planned for the station. The pedestrian bridge is wide enough for this extra construction, and the bridge's stairway {{on the far side of}} the station has a landing on the same level as the unbuilt outbound platform, symmetrical with the landing on the other side which is part of the existing platform. A ticket window was proposed to be established but it has yet to occur.|$|E
25|$|Stress {{is known}} to {{contribute}} to and trigger psychotic states. A history of psychologically traumatic events, and the recent experience of a stressful event, can both {{contribute to the development}} of psychosis. Short-lived psychosis triggered by stress is known as brief reactive psychosis, and patients may spontaneously recover normal functioning within two weeks. In some rare cases, individuals may remain in a state of <b>full-blown</b> psychosis for many years, or perhaps have attenuated psychotic symptoms (such as low intensity hallucinations) present at most times.|$|E
25|$|A simple mission {{led by an}} inexperienced but ambitious {{physician}} unfolded into a major blunder for the Company. Kaumualii, {{who sought}} outside help in his domestic rivalry with King Kamehameha, invited Schäffer to his island and manipulated him into believing that the RAC could easily take over and colonize Hawaii. Schäffer soon planned a <b>full-blown</b> naval assault on the Hawaiian islands. His actions were not sanctioned by RAC governor Alexander Andreyevich Baranov, who gave no instructions beyond either regaining the lost company items or compensation for them in sandalwood.|$|E
25|$|Some {{morphological}} and post-cranial {{data has}} linked the earliest farming populations at Fayum, Merimde, and El-Badari, to Near Eastern populations. However, the archaeological data {{also suggests that}} Near Eastern domesticates were incorporated into a pre-existing foraging strategy and only slowly developed into a <b>full-blown</b> lifestyle, contrary to what would be expected from settler colonists from the Near East. Finally, the names for the Near Eastern domesticates imported into Egypt were not Sumerian or Proto-Semitic loan words, which further diminishes {{the likelihood of a}} mass immigrant colonization of lower Egypt during the transition to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, <b>full-blown</b> war erupted between Japan and China, and Ikeda's eldest brother, Kiichi, {{was drafted}} into {{military}} service. Within a few years, Ikeda's three other elder brothers were drafted as well. In 1942, {{while all of}} his older brothers were overseas in the Asian theatres of World War II, Ikeda's father, Nenokichi, fell ill and was bedridden for two years. To help support his family, {{at the age of}} 14, Ikeda began working in the Niigata Steelworks munitions factory as part of Japan's wartime youth labor corps.|$|E
25|$|While American {{diplomacy}} averted {{the escalation}} of the West New Guinea dispute into <b>full–blown</b> war between Indonesia and the Netherlands, Washington failed to win over President Sukarno. Buoyed by his success in the West New Guinea campaign, Sukarno {{turned his attention to}} the former British colony of Malaysia, resulting in the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation which induced a deterioration of Indonesia's relations with the West. Ultimately, President Sukarno was overthrown during the Indonesian coup attempt of 1965 and subsequently replaced by the pro-Western Suharto. In addition, the American mining company Freeport-McMoRan was interested in exploiting Western New Guinea's copper and gold deposits.|$|E
