However, Norman would still wear his Green Goblin costume in battle.|$|E
5|$|Steam Whistle – An {{industrial}} {{steam whistle}} has been present on Georgia Tech's campus {{ever since the}} early industrial shop years.

5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E

The protagonist plans to {{transport}} Yumemi out of the city after her battery runs out {{and find a way to}} reactivate her. A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab, due to its design, is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came from, and he devises a plan to destroy it armed with only a grenade launcher. After his initial plan fails and he is forced to face the machine front on, Yumemi tries to protect the protagonist, but <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> in half by the war machine's machine guns.|$|E
5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of electronic deer whistles in scaring away sika deer {{that are likely to}} run onto roads, resulting in accidents. These whistles have been used in the U. S. A. and other countries. In this study, two types of deer whistles were tested: one that has a continuous tone with a fixed frequency (Whistle A) and the other that has an intermittent tone with a modulated frequency (Whistle B). To assess {{the effectiveness of}} the whistles in alerting deer, the deer's reactions to the whistles <b>were</b> observed by <b>blowing</b> the whistle from a fixed place that is visible to the deer when they appear by the roadside. For the control sample, deer's behavior when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>was</b> observed. When no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 51 % of the deer were on alert about the observers. When Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 67 % of the deer were on alert; this figure increased to 95 % when Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown.</b> The time durations for which the deer were alert when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> and Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>were</b> 20 %, 42 %, and 73 %, respectively. These results indicated that the deer whistles are effective in alerting deer, and that Whistle B is more effective than Whistle A. Vehicles can be equipped with deer whistles to alert deer about on-coming vehicles so as to prevent them from crossing roads, and consequently reduce deer-vehicle collisions. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|During a rainy night, Jake tells Finn a {{story about}} a {{supposed}} vampire that used to live in their tree fort. Finn, scared by the sounds outside the house, goes downstairs to talk to Jake. Suddenly, their window <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> open and the lights go out. Finn and Jake soon discover that Marceline the Vampire Queen has snuck into their house. Both Finn and Jake are terrified that Marceline will kill them and drink their blood, but she reveals that she has no intentions of killing them, noting that she really only eats the color red. However, she explains that the tree house used to belong to her, and she promptly evicts them from their residence.|$|E
5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover <b>is</b> <b>blown,</b> bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E

25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} air sources. Conventional flutes <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> by bellows or fans.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to measure wind direction, such as the windsock and wind vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance. The way a weather vane is pointed by prevailing winds indicates the direction from which the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> The larger opening of a windsock faces the direction that the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from; its tail, with the smaller opening, points in the direction the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|R

Doggett and Reyes turn to The Lone Gunmen when Fletcher provides an alleged photo of the super soldier, whom The Lone Gunmen recognize as Yves Adele Harlow (Zuleikha Robinson), a fellow hacker who went missing a year ago. The Gunmen refuse to believe the evidence, especially when they find that Fletcher provided it, although the agents continue to pursue the trail.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} filming {{was carried}} out at Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios and Twickenham Studios in London.

Mereworth Castle in Kent {{was used as the}} home of Sir James Bond, which <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> up {{at the start of the}} film. Much of the filming for M's Scottish castle was actually done on location in County Meath, Ireland, with Killeen Castle, Dunsany, as the focus.

5|$|The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's cinder cones have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above their surroundings.

5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
