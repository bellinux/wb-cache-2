40|$|Invertebrate macrofaunal {{biodiversity}} within intertidal seagrass meadows {{was investigated}} over a salinity gradient of < 5 – 35 in the Knysna estuarine system (Garden Route National Park, South Africa). Rather than the classic gradual decline in species richness with {{distance from the}} mouth there were zones of considerable <b>faunal</b> <b>stability</b> separated by relatively sharp discontinuities. At the point upstream at which salinity regularly falls below 30, the rich, diverse and highly spatially variable downstream faunal assemblage changed to a less rich, less diverse and more uniform one that dominated the upstream stretch without any further upstream reduction in richness. Nevertheless, without loss of overall richness, assemblage composition changed, again rapidly, in the upper region of the upstream stretch to a zone dominated by the microgastropod Hydrobia, which otherwise occurs in the Knysna system only in highly sheltered regions of the downstream stretch where it is also dominant. The upstream faunal assemblage was a subset {{of that in the}} marine-influenced downstream region not a different replacing one. Position along the estuarine gradient accounted for 29 % of total assemblage variation. Overall faunal abundance declined with distance upstream until the Hydrobia zone where it rose sharply, but {{there was no evidence of}} increase in density of those species remaining on putative release from competition...|$|E
40|$|A new {{previous}} termmiddle Pleistocenenext term vertebrate {{fossil record}} from eastern Australia, dated by U disequilibrium series, records the first Quaternary {{record of an}} Australian tropical rainforest fauna. This exceptionally rich fauna underwent extinction after {{a long period of}} relative <b>faunal</b> <b>stability,</b> spanning several glacial cycles, and persisted probably until 280 000 years ago. Some time between 280 000 and 205 000 years ago the rainforest fauna was replaced by a xeric-adapted fauna. Since that time, the xeric-adapted fauna was replaced by a mesic-adapted fauna which was established by the Holocene. This is the first vertebrate faunal evidence in Australia of the previous termmiddle Pleistocenenext term Mid-Brunhes Climatic Event (MBE), a major climatic reorganisation that led to increased aridity in northern Australia from around 300 000 years ago. Several independent palaeoclimate proxies suggest that the climatic shift to aridity was due to increased climatic variability and weakened northern monsoons, which may be manifested in the extinction of the aseasonal rainforest fauna and its replacement by an arid-adapted fauna. We extend the temporal ranges of several taxa from the Pliocene into the previous termmiddle Pleistocene. next term We also reveal a longer palaeobiogeographic connection of rainforest taxa and lineages shared between New Guinea and Australia than was previously thought and show that their extinction on mainland Australia occurred sometime after 280 000 years ago...|$|E
40|$|Conservationists have {{proposed}} methods for adapting {{to climate change}} that assume species distributions are primarily explained by climate variables. The key idea {{is to use the}} understanding of species-climate relationships to map corridors and to identify regions of <b>faunal</b> <b>stability</b> or high species turnover. An alternative approach is to adopt an evolutionary timescale and ask ultimately what factors control total diversity, so that over the long run the major drivers of total species richness can be protected. Within a single climatic region, the temperate area encompassing all of the Northeastern U. S. and Maritime Canada, we hypothesized that geologic factors may take precedence over climate in explaining diversity patterns. If geophysical diversity does drive regional diversity, then conserving geophysical settings may offer an approach to conservation that protects diversity under both current and future climates. Here we tested how well geology predicts the species diversity of 14 US states and three Canadian provinces, using a comprehensive new spatial dataset. Results of linear regressions of species diversity on all possible combinations of 23 geophysical and climatic variables indicated that four geophysical factors; the number of geological classes, latitude, elevation range and the amount of calcareous bedrock, predicted species diversity with certainty (adj. R 2  =  0. 94). To confirm the species-geology relationships we ran an independent test using 18, 700 location points for 885 rare species and found that 40 % of the species were restricted to a single geology. Moreover, each geology class supported 5 – 95 endemic species and chi-square tests confirmed that calcareous bedrock and extreme elevations had significantly more rare species than expected by chance (P< 0. 0001), strongly corroborating the regression model. Our results suggest that protecting geophysical settings will conserve the stage for current and future biodiversity and may be a robust alternative to species-level predictions...|$|E
40|$|River valleys in the Cibao Valley Basin, {{located in}} the {{northern}} Dominican Republic, expose three fossiliferous Neogene-aged strata (the Cercado, Gurabo, and Mao formations) that show evidence for shifting marine paleo-habitats. This study system is ideal for analyzing the relationships between environmental changes and <b>faunal</b> community <b>stability</b> through time. A new database was developed from the published literature to examine changing diversity patterns and {{to determine if the}} Cibao Valley communities exhibited stasis over a 3 My time span (6. 5 Ma to 3. 5 Ma) across shallow- to very deep-water environments. This database includes spatio-temporal occurrence data for 179 species of gastropods, bivalves, and corals. Analyses of diversity patterns reveal a high diversity of species in shallow- to deep-water depths, and a low diversity of species in very deep-water depths, as well as a low similarity of species through time across the different paleoenvironmental settings. An R-mode hierarchical cluster analysis illustrates two major clusters that were based mostly on the different paleoenvironments in which these species lived, while a Q-mode cluster analysis shows two major clusters, one consisting mostly of mollusk and the other of corals. Finally, a detrended correspondence analysis indicates higher species richness in intermediate-water depths and lower species richness in very deep-water depths. In total, these results indicate faunal instability though changing habitats across time in this study system...|$|R
40|$|Oligotrophic tropical-subtropical oceanic regimes {{constitute}} {{the largest and}} most ancient ecosystem on earth, with these enormous areas being characterized by high <b>faunal</b> diversity. The <b>stability</b> and age of the ecosystem have enabled the evolution of many similar species niches where there is considerable overlap in niche parameters such as food and space, resulting in high species packing, especially in the epi- and mesopelagic zones. Competition for limited resources undoubtedly exists and has been described by MacArthur (1972; Geographical ecology, Harper and Row, New York) as diffuse competition where each species is impacted by many other species sharing the environment. Most studies of resource partitioning in the oceanic pelagial have been restricted to specific taxonomic groups, such as copepods, fishes, shrimps, or cephalopods, and intergroup relationships have not been examined. The 2 dominant (numbers and biomass) components of low latitude midwater micronekton communities, based on trawl catches, are fishes and shrimps, and the present study reveals that species from each of these 2 assemblages occur in the same feeding guilds and hence potentially compete for food resources. However, as additional niche parameters are included in the analysis, such as food size and predator vertical distribution, groups of species with matching niche characteristics become increasingly smaller. Results {{of this study suggest that}} as additional information on individual life histories is obtained, such as data on seasonality of reproduction and population dynamics, the same pattern will emerge as we have found for fishes and shrimps considered separately, i. e. that resource partitioning occurs at the species level despite the pressures of diffuse intra- and intergroup competition. This minimizes competitive exclusion and enables the maintenance of a high-diversity fauna in resource-poor low latitude ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} uses of fossil insects, {{particularly}} Coleoptera (beetles) and Chironomidae (non-biting midges) from ancient deposits to inform the study of wetland ecosystems and their ecological and restoration processes. In particular, we focus on two contrasting ecosystems, drawing upon research undertaken by us on British raised mire peats and shallow lake systems, one an essentially terrestrial ecosystem, the other aquatic, but in which wetland insects play an important and integral part. The study of raised mire peats suggests that <b>faunal</b> <b>stability</b> is a characteristic of these wetland systems, over {{what appear to be}} extensive periods of time (up to several millennia), whilst studies of shallow lake ecosystems over recent timescales indicates that faunal instability appears to be more common, usually driven by increasing eutrophication. Drawing upon a series of fossil Coleoptera records spanning several thousand years from HatWeld Moors, south Yorkshire, we reconstruct in some detail the mire’s ontogeny and Xuctuations in site hydrology and vegetation cover, illustrating the intimate association between substrate, topography and peat development. A comparison between fossil and modern beetle populations indicates that the faunal characteristics of this mire and its adjacent neighbour, Thorne Moors, become established during the early phases of peat development, including its rare endemics, and that the faunal biodiversity on the sites today is dictated by complex site histories. The over-riding characteristic of these faunas is of stability over several thousand years, which has important implications for the restoration of degraded sites, especially those where refugial areas are limited. In contrast, analyses of fossil Chironomidae from shallow lakes allow researchers to track changes in limnological status and while {{attempts have been made to}} reconstruct changes in nutrient levels quantitatively, the chironomids respond indirectly to such changes, typically mediated through complex ecosystem dynamics such as changes in Wsh and/or macrophyte communities. These changes are illustrated via historic chironomid stratigraphies and diversity indices from a range of shallow lakes located across Britain: Slapton Ley, Frensham Great Pond, Fleet Pond, Kyre Pool and Barnes Loch. These sites have shown varying degrees of eutrophication over recent timescales which tends to be associated with a decline in chironomid diversity. While complex functional processes exist within these ecosystems, our evidence suggests that one of the key drivers in the loss of shallow lake chironomid diversity appears to be the loss of aquatic macrophytes. Overall, while chironomids do show a clear response to altered nutrient regimes, multi-proxy reconstructions are recommended for a clear interpretation of past change. We conclude that if we are to have a better understanding of biota at the ecosystem level we need to know more of the complex interactions between diVerent insect groups as well as with other animal and plant communities. A palaeoecological approach is thus crucial in order to assess the role of insect groups in ecosystem processes, both in the recent past and over long time scales, and is essential for wetland managers and conservation organisations involved in long term management and restoration of wetland system...|$|E
