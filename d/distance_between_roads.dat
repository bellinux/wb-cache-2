40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems [© Taylor & Francis]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] research on map matching algorithms for land vehicle navigation has been based on either a conventional topological analysis or a probabilistic approach. The input to these algorithms normally comes from the global positioning system (GPS) and digital map data. Although the performance of some of these algorithms is good in relatively sparse road networks, they are not always reliable for complex roundabouts, merging or diverging sections of motorways, and complex urban road networks. In high road density areas where the average <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>roads</b> is less than 100 m, there may be many road patterns matching the trajectory of the vehicle reported by the positioning system at any given moment. Consequently, {{it may be difficult to}} precisely identify the road on which the vehicle is travelling. Therefore, techniques for dealing with qualitative terms such as likeliness are essential for map matching algorithms to identify a correct link. Fuzzy logic is one technique that is an effective way to deal with qualitative terms, linguistic vagueness, and human intervention. This article develops a map matching algorithm based on fuzzy logic theory. The inputs to the proposed algorithm are from GPS augmented with data from deduced reckoning sensors to provide continuous navigation. The algorithm is tested on different road networks of varying complexity. The validation of this algorithm is carried out using high precision positioning data obtained from GPS carrier phase observables. The performance of the developed map matching algorithm is evaluated against the performance of several well-accepted existing map matching algorithms. The results show that the fuzzy logic-based map matching algorithm provides a significant improvement over existing map matching algorithms both in terms of identifying correct links and estimating the vehicle position on the links...|$|E

30|$|Poor user {{experience}} {{is caused by}} the current unstable operation of the two-wheel self-balancing vehicle control system, the high failure rate, and the poor accuracy and sensitivity of the control system (prone to deviation). Therefore, the work studied the two-wheel self-balancing vehicle system with the visual recognition of vehicle attitude. Kalman filtering and PID control algorithm were adopted to reduce the high frequency interference of the accelerometer and the low frequency error of the gyroscope, improve the response speed and control precision of motor to error, and ensure vertical control. The road images were acquired by a charge-coupled device vision sensor with the edge information extracted by the Laplacian operator, which ensures autonomous navigation control of a balance car. Based on the calculation of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>road</b> axis and the existence detection of forward obstacles, the early warning mechanism was established through the calculation of the group agent to improve the safety performance of a balance vehicle. Experiments showed the improved control system has good stability, fast walking speed, strong anti-interference, and high security.|$|R

Sound levels increased as the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>road</b> maintenance activity and microphone locations decreased, regardless of stimulus type or habitat type. Concomitantly, the amount of sound energy within the middle frequency range decreased substantially with increasing stimulus distance from microphone locations.

40|$|As an {{important}} part of urban public transportation systems, the feeder bus fills a service gap left by rail transit, effectively extending the range of rail transit’s service and solving the problem of short-distance travel and interchanges. By defining the potential demand of feeder bus services and considering its relationship with the traffic demands of corresponding staging areas, the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>road</b> and rail transit, and the repetition factor of road bus lines, this paper established a potential demand model of roads by opening feeder bus services and applying a logit model for passenger flow distribution. Based on a circular route model, a route starting and ending at urban rail transit stations was generated, and a genetic algorithm was then applied to solve it. The Wei-Fang community of Shanghai was selected as the test area. Per the model and algorithm, the feeder route length was conformed to a functional orientation of short-distance travel and the feeder service of a feeder bus; the route mostly covered where conventional bus lines were fewer, which is a finding that is in agreement with the actual situation; the feasibility of the model and algorithm was verified...|$|R

30|$|The {{control system}} of {{existing}} balance vehicles has unstable operating conditions, high failure rate, and low accuracy and sensitivity during handling (prone to deviation), {{which results in}} poor user experience [1 – 3]. The work studied the two-wheel self-balancing vehicle system with the visual recognition of vehicle attitude, which solves accurate vertical control, visual autonomous navigation, and early warning mechanism. Kalman filtering and process identifier (PID) control algorithm are used to reduce the high frequency interference of the accelerometer and the low frequency error of the gyroscope, improve the response speed and control precision of the motor to error, and ensure good vertical control. Road images were obtained by the charge-coupled device (CCD) vision sensor of the balancing vehicle, performing grayscale equalization enhancement, median filtering, binarization, and the extraction of Laplacian operator edge information. It ensured autonomous navigation of balancing vehicle. Existence detection was performed by the calculation of <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>road</b> edgy and axis and the frontal obstacles with gray feature. The early warning mechanism of the system was established by group agent calculation, which improved the safety of balance vehicle. It is expected that the market acceptance will be improved. Experiments showed the improved control system can stably control the balance vehicle, with fast traveling speed, strong anti-interference, and high safety.|$|R
25|$|When the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) reconstructed {{the highway}} to {{encourage}} development {{in the area and}} limit congestion, three lanes were added to the road to create a four-lane highway with turn lanes at the intersection.

They also erected a modernized traffic signal to ensure traffic cleared the crossing in front of an approaching train. These actions increased the chances of a train impacting a school bus, but were not leading causes.|$|R
50|$|Consider the {{apparent}} motion {{of a line}} of telephone poles beside a road as seen from a car. At long distances they appear to have no motion, but they grow larger as the car approaches. At closer distances they appear to begin moving to the side, away from the car. The angular velocity of any one of the poles is a function of its distance in front the car, the speed of the car, and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the roadway and the poles. Thus, any particular angular velocity corresponds directly to a distance. In the case of an aircraft, one of the poles represents the target, the speed of the car is the aircraft's airspeed, and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>road</b> and the poles is the aircraft's altitude.|$|R

40|$|The {{interpolation}} of link-based traffic data is {{an important}} topic for transportation researchers and engineers. In recent years the kriging method {{has been used in}} traffic data interpolation from the viewpoint of spatial analysis. This method has shown promising results, especially for a large-scale road network. However, existing studies using the Euclidean distance metric, which is widely used in traditional kriging, fail to accurately describe the spatial distance in a road network. In this article we introduce road network distance to describe spatial <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>road</b> links, and we propose an improved distance metric called approximate road network distance (ARND), based on the isometric embedding theory, for solving the problem of the invalid spatial covariance function in kriging caused by the non-Euclidean distance metric. An improved Isomap algorithm is also proposed for obtaining the ARND metric. This study is tested on a large-scale urban road network with sparse road-link travel speeds derived from approximately 1200 'floating cars' (GPS-enabled taxis). Comparison was conducted on both the Euclidean distance metric and the ARND metric. The validation results show that the use of the ARND metric can obtain better interpolation accuracy in different time periods and urban regions with different road network structures. Therefore, we conclude that the improved distance metric has the ability for improving kriging interpolation accuracy for link-based traffic data within real situations, providing more reliable basic traffic data for various traffic applications. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Prevention and {{estimation}} of soil erosion from forest roads {{requires an understanding}} of how road design and maintenance affect sediment production. Seventyfour plots were installed on forest roads in the Oregon Coast Range {{to examine the relationship between}} sediment production and road attributes such as <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> culverts, <b>road</b> slope, soil texture, and cutslope height. An additional comparison was made <b>between</b> <b>road</b> segments with cutslopes and ditches freshly cleared of vegetation and segments with established vegetation on cutslopes and in ditches. All road segments were 5 m wide and insloped with aggregate surfacing, light traffic, and no overhanging forest cover. Sediment production was correlated to the product of segment length times road slope squared. Sediment production from aggregate covered roads on a silty clay loam was about 9 times greater than that from roads constructed on a gravelly loam. Sediment production was not correlated to the cutslope height. Road segments where vegetation was cleared from the cutslope and ditch produced about 7 times as much sediment as road segments where vegetation was retained, showing the potential reduction in erosion by revegetation following construction and the potential impact of ditch cleaning during maintenance. Relationships and estimates from this study provide a basis for improved erosion estimates by commonly used empirical procedures. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Building {{vehicular}} {{networks in}} roads and highways is a challenging research topic {{with a large}} number of applica-tions ranging from the prevention of traffic jams and car colli-sions to efficient route planning. Analyzing the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> vehicles in <b>roads</b> is a key factor in, e. g., designing vehicular networks protocols or planning a supporting infrastructure to improve connectivity. This work proposes a Gaussian-exponential mixture model to characterize the time <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> vehicles in a highway lane, based on measurements collected at different locations in several highways of the city of Madrid. The model arises from the observed behavior that some vehicles travel very close together, like in a burst mode, showing Gaussian inter-arrival times, while other vehicles are isolated, showing exponentially distributed inter-arrival times. The experiments show that such a Gaussian-exponential mixture model accurately characterizes inter-vehicle times as observed from real traces. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} the Ile-de-France region {{surrounding}} Paris, which is both the biggest conurbation in France and a large agricultural area. In areas such as these, airborne pollutants from road traffic may adversely affect the quality of the food produced by farms close by. This raises questions about the spatial compatibility of farming and road networks, although there is currently no scientific consensus concerning potential health risks for producers and consumers. Some actors in agricultural supply chains have tried to limit potential risks by producing technical guidelines, including isolation <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> major <b>roads</b> and fields farmed under contract. This paper analyses these "isolation distances", using approaches from the agricultural and social sciences: surveys on stakeholders in agribusiness and on farmers, and a cartographic simulation submitted to the surveyed farmers for discussion. The results show that isolation distances serve to create market opportunities in a context of market segmentation, or are applied as a precautionary principle. Though not a widespread practice, safety distances could have considerable impacts on farms in terms of both technical management and total farm area, thus calling for further scientific research on this issue...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and tracking algorithms of road barrier including tunnel and guardrail are proposed to enhance performance and reliability for driver assistance systems. Although the road barrier {{is one of}} the key features to determine a safe drivable area, it may be recognized incorrectly due to performance degradation of commercial sensors such as radar and monocular camera. Two frequent cases among many challenging problems are considered with the commercial sensors. The first case is that few tracks of radar to road barrier are detected due to material type of road barrier. The second one is inaccuracy of relative lateral position by radar, thus resulting in large variance of <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> a vehicle and road barrier. To overcome the problems, the {{detection and}} estimation algorithms of tracks corresponding to road barrier are proposed. Then, the tracking algorithm based on a probabilistic data association filter (PDAF) is used to reduce variation of lateral <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> vehicle and <b>road</b> barrier. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated via field test data and their performance is compared with that of road barrier measured by lidar...|$|R
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into a toll-free highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the toll <b>road</b> and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938.

40|$|Comparing two {{geometric}} graphs {{embedded in}} space {{is important in}} the field of transportation network analysis. Given street maps of the same city collected from different sources, researchers often need to know how and where they differ. However, the majority of current graph comparison algorithms are based on structural properties of graphs, such as their degree distribution or their local connectivity properties, and do not consider their spatial embedding. This ignores a key property of road networks since similarity of travel over two road networks is intimately tied to the specific spatial embedding. Likewise, many current street map comparison algorithms focus on the spatial embeddings only and do not take structural properties into account, which makes these algorithms insensitive to local connectivity properties and shortest path similarities. We propose a new path-based distance measure to compare two planar geometric graphs embedded in the plane. Our distance measure takes structural as well as spatial properties into account by imposing a <b>distance</b> measure <b>between</b> two <b>road</b> networks based on the Hausdorff <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the two sets of travel paths they represent.

The proposed visual-based guidance control system also provides two experimental results to validate the performance. One is on the straight road and the other is on the curved road. Both experimental results are satisfactory. Recently, 3 D techniques were taken into the design for vehicle guidance to improve the performance of vehicle control with satisfactory performance [8, 9]. On the other hand, the real time issue also played an important role due to the rapid changing of the environment [10]. Therefore, the proposed control scheme for vehicle guidance not only provides the vehicle control based on the visual feedback via the Internet but also considers the real time issue.|$|R
