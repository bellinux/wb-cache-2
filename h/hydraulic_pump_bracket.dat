30|$|The <b>{{hydraulic}}</b> <b>pump</b> is {{the heart}} of a hydraulic system, which determines whether the whole system can run normally or not. Therefore, performance assessment and fault diagnosis of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> is of great importance. Usually, when a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> is under an abnormal state, it will be revealed by changes of vibration. Because most mechanical faults are reflected by vibration[33], the vibration signals of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> are collected and analyzed in this experiment for performance assessment and fault diagnosis.|$|R

Afterwards, the analytical form of the natural frequency and the numerical solution of the steady-state response were deduced for a <b>hydraulic</b> plunger <b>pump.</b> Then, a method for the vibration analysis of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> was proposed. Finally, the dynamic responses of a <b>hydraulic</b> plunger <b>pump</b> are obtained through numerical simulation...|$|R

Power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

A duty cycle of 3 minutes on and a cooling period of 20 minutes off is required to avoid overheating the pump motor.|$|R
40|$|MILS ? ???? ?? ?? ????? ????. ??? ?? ????? ??? ?? ?? ????? ??? ??? ?? ???? ????. An {{electric}} excavator consumes battery {{energy to}} drive {{an electric motor}} attached to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> to generate <b>hydraulic</b> power. In a conventional hydraulic excavator, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> is controlled by regulators, which are used to optimize the diesel engine efficiency. Because {{of a lack of}} battery energy capacity, an electric excavator controller should consider not only the electric motor efficiency but also the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency. Thus, electric motor and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency maps were constructed. An optimal operating map (OOM) was created based on the most efficient operating points under each input condition. An integrated control algorithm controlled the speed of the electric motor and displacement of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> according to the OOM. To confirm the utility of this algorithm, a model-in-the-loop simulator for the algorithm with an electric excavator was established. The simulation results showed that the integrated control algorithm improved the energy efficiency of an electric excavator...|$|R

In this article, a novel method based on high-frequency harmonic local characteristic-scale decomposition sub-signal separation and discrete cosine transform high-order singular entropy is proposed. In order to reduce noises and other disturbances, the vibration signal is processed by the local characteristic-scale decomposition modified by the high-frequency harmonic. Sub-signal with sensitive information is obtained by blind source separation of the selected intrinsic scale components. Furthermore, the discrete cosine transform high-order spectral analysis algorithm is proposed to extract singular entropies of Shannon and Tsallis to be the degradation features of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b> Analysis of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> experiment demonstrates that the proposed method is feasible and effective in indicating the performance degradation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
