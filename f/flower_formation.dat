Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between “June-bearing” strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and “ever-bearing” strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season. Research published in 2001 showed that strawberries actually occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of temperature on <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> in Cryptomeria japonica, the following experiments were carried out. i) Disposing of materials under different constant temperatures such as 15 ℃, 20 ℃, 25 ℃, 30 ℃, 33 ℃ and natural temperature condition during the whole period from May 10 to September 30. ii) Spraying materials with GA_ 3 under the same condition mentioned above. iii) Dividing the whole period mentioned above into three periods, May 10 -June 24, June 27 -August 11 and August 14 -September 30; and treating with different constant and alternating temperatures during the divided period. Results obtained from these experiments are as follows: 1. The effect of constant temperatures on <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> varied with temperatures. Most flower buds were produced at 30 ℃ and 25 ℃, and decreased as temperature falls. Female flower buds were formed mostly at 20 ℃ and 25 ℃, and decreased when the temperature was higher or lower than those. 2. Both treatment of constant temperature and GA_ 3 promoted significantly the male <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> at natural temperature condition, 30 ℃ and 25 ℃, but female <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> at 20 ℃ and followed by natural temperature condition. 3. The promoting effect of GA_ 3 on <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> varied with constant temperatures, and it was distinctly shown at the natural temperature condition, 20 ℃ and 15 ℃ on both {{the male and female}} <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation.</b> 4. The thermal influence on male and female <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> was highly exerted within a period from May 10 to June 24. 5. In the treatment with alternating temperatures, when the average of day and night temperature was close to 30 ℃, many male flower buds were formed; but when it was close to 20 ℃, female <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> was promoted. When night temperature was lower than the day temperature of 33 ℃ or it was higher than the day temperature of 15 ℃, the male and female <b>flower</b> bud <b>formation</b> was promoted. 6. Flower buds were formed by treatment with constant and alternating temperature of 33 ℃ in the short period. However, no flower bud was produced by the treatment of constant temperature of 33 ℃ during the whole period. スギの花芽分化に関与する期間の温度が花芽着生におよぼす影響と,この期間の温度によるGA_ 3 の効果を調べるため,および,この期間のある時期の温度が花芽着生におよぼす影響を調べるために, 5 月 10 日から 9 月 30 日までの間,自然日長下で,クモトオシクローンを用いて,前者に対しては全期間を,後者に対しては全期間を初期,中期,および後期の 3 時期に分け,それぞれ温度別処理を行なつた結果,次のことが明らかとなつた. 1. 雄花芽の着生は 30 ℃から 25 ℃の恒温で最も多く,それから温度が低くなるほど少なくなる傾向にあり,雌花芽は 20 ℃から 25 ℃で最も多く,それより低い場合,高い場合のいずれも少なくなる傾向にあつた. 2. 花芽の着生量におよぼす恒温とGA_ 3 の併用処理の効果は雄花芽の場合,自然条件, 30 ℃, 25 ℃で最も多く,雌花芽の場合は 20 ℃が最も多く,ついで自然条件下であつた. 3.

50|$|The {{first step}} of the {{transition}} is {{the transformation of the}} vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia.

Germination characteristics of seeds obtained from different genotypes grown under greenhouse without pollinators, were analyzed. Reproductive phenology, from the beginning of flowering to seed maturity, have been studied and the numbers of corymbs quantified for every genotype. Pollinators’ diversity and abundance have been quantified over the whole flowering period. In Central Italy the flowering stage spans from beginning of September to the end of October, whereas seed formation and maturity lasts until the end of November. <b>Flowering</b> and seed <b>formation</b> overlap each other.

Seed germination rate and mean energy time differed among the genotypes. Further differences were found in the seed quality as consequence of pollinator abundance and spectrum.

50|$|Before {{a flower}} can be {{produced}} the plant must undergo floral induction and initiation. Floral induction involves physiological processes in the plant that result in the shoot apical meristem becoming competent to develop flowers. It involves biochemical changes at the apex, particularly those caused by cytokinins and the processes can be reversed. Floral initiation is the morphological transformation of an induced growing point from a vegetative to a floral primordium and involves the plant hormone florigen. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favourable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce {{a number of different}} physiological and morphological changes. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the <b>flower</b> <b>formation</b> event was dependent of some environmental cue.

50|$|Cannabis {{plants are}} broadly covered with sessile glands, and other hairs {{throughout}} above-ground {{portions of the}} plant. There is a particularly high concentration of glands on the bracts of the female plant. After <b>flower</b> <b>formation</b> begins, some of the glands, especially on bracts near the flowers, develop stalks projecting them outward from the plant surface. The glands consist of a layer of disk cells, whose outer surface splits to create a large secretory cavity lined by cell wall and cuticle components. Together the disk cells and secretory cavity form a round head atop the narrow stalk. These cavities come to contain large amounts of cannabidiol in hemp-producing strains, or tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in marijuana-producing strains. These compounds appear to be produced beginning in specialized plastids called lipoplasts. These produce spheres of oily secretions, including terpenes, which pass through the cell membrane and wall to accumulate as vesicles in the secretory cavity. Final reaction to cannabinoids appears to occur outside the disk cell cyctoplasm. The glands gradually darken as they mature, with loss of cannabinoids over time (perhaps to evaporation) and eventually undergo abscission from the plant.|$|E
