40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of polytetramethylene glycol (PTMG, Mn= 2900) based polyurethane (PU), along with four different weight contents (such as 0. 25, 0. 50, 1. 0, and 2. 5 wt%) of functionalized multiwalled nanotube (MWNT) reinforced PUs are studied in air {{as well as}} in nitrogen atmosphere.

However, the influence of MWNT content on thermal stability is unclear. At 0. 25 and 0. 50 wt% of MWNT content, thermal stability declined and a further increase of MWNT improved the thermal stability of PU.

The LEO was extracted, chromatographed, and complexed in β-cyclodextrin. The complex was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and <b>thermogravimetry</b> <b>derivative</b> (TG/DTG). Male Swiss mice (2 - 3 months) were treated with LEO-CD (50 – 200 [*]mg/kg,[*]p. o.), vehicle (distilled water, p. o.), or standard drug (i. p.) and subjected to the orofacial nociception formalin-, capsaicin-, and glutamate-induced. After the formalin test, the animals were perfused and the brains subjected to immunofluorescence for Fos. The rota-rod test (7 [*]rpm/min) was carried out. Geraniol (37. 57 %) was the main compound of LEO. DSC and TG/DTG proved the complexation. The orofacial nociceptive behavior was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced.

The data obtained from <b>thermogravimetry</b> <b>derivative</b> curves at different relative humidities were used to determine the adsorption–desorption isotherm of MX- 80.

Furthermore, the heats released upon adsorption and desorption are not completely similar. Moreover, the analysis of DTA signals obtained at various hydration states provides insights about three types of water behavior in MX- 80. Therefore, the surface area of DTA curves was taken into account to determine the dehydration enthalpy per mole of water; the values do not correlate with the amount of adsorbed water in MX- 80, and the maximum enthalpy was approximately 12 kJ/mol for the adsorption and desorption studies.

The composites obtained was characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectra, and X-ray diffraction. The thermal stability of the composites was investigated by thermogravimetry and <b>derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetry.</b> Finally, the comparative analysis on the electrochemical properties of PANI/Pr 6 O 11 composites electrodes, such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and constant current charge-discharge test, was conducted under similar conditions. Scanning electron microscope, infrared, and X-ray diffraction results show that interaction exists between PANI and Pr 6 O 11, and the composites are more crystalline than pure PANI. Thermogravimetry and <b>derivative</b> <b>thermogravimetry</b> analyses indicate that PANI/Pr 6 O 11 composites and pure PANI have similar thermal stability. Moreover, the studies regarded to capacitive properties show that the electrochemical performance of the composites is improved greatly when Pr 6 O 11 is added in small amount. However, with increasing the amount of Pr 6 O 11, the electrochemical performance of the composites become worse, which indicates a large amount of Pr 6 O 11 has a negative effect on the capacitance. These results suggest that PANI is still in the conductive form after inserting the Pr 6 O 11, and the capacitance performance of PANI can be improved only by a low percentage of Pr 6 O 11.
