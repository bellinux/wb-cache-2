Zhuge Zhan died at the Battle of Mianzhu Pass along with his eldest son Zhuge Shang, Huang Chong and others while helplessly outnumbered by Deng Ai's forces.|$|E

25|$|Schuck {{received}} a letter in early 1937 {{that he had been}} accepted by the Luftwaffe. Prior to enlisting he had to complete his six months of the Reich Labour Service, which he began on 3 April 1937. His recruit training began in November 1937 with the 2. Fliegerersatzabteilung 24 (2nd Flier Replacement Unit 24) in Quakenbrück. On 1 April 1938 he was transferred to the Flughafenbetriebskompanie (Airport Operation Company) of Kampfgeschwader 254 (KG 254—254th Bomber Wing) to Gütersloh. Initially Schuck was tasked with security guard duties before he was assigned to help a fellow soldier, a truck driver, haul material around the airbase. Schuck did not possess a drivers license, but he was unofficially taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> the 3-tonne Mercedes truck. This impressed his commanding officer, Hauptmann (Captain) Schneiderberger, who transferred him to the glider pilot school at Schüren, near Meschede in the Sauerland, after the Sudeten Crisis.
