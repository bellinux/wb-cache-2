40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation is to determine extrusion die shapes, which minimize distortion during axisymmetric and 3 D extrusion. An axisymmetric upper bound model with a flexible <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is developed in a spherical coordinate system. The flexible streamlined <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is described by a Legendre polynomial series, where the higher order coefficients are selected based upon optimization. Four criteria to minimize distortion {{are used in the}} upper bound model to determine optimal die shapes. Analysis of the optimal die shapes with FEM confirms two robust criteria: average effective strain and volumetric effective strain rate deviation. ^ When average effective strain is minimized with the axisymmetric upper bound model, die shapes are obtained which minimize the average effective strain in the extrudate, but do not minimize distortion. When volumetric effective strain rate deviation is minimized with the upper bound model, die shapes are obtained which minimize the deviation of the effective strain rate distribution in the deformation zone. Such a die is called a controlled strain rate die. The axisymmetric results show that minimizing the volumetric effective strain rate deviation produces controlled strain rate die shapes, which form product with minimum distortion. ^ The axisymmetric upper bound model in spherical coordinates is extended to the 3 D extrusion from round to square and round to rectangle and is used to obtain die shapes which produce minimum distortion in the extrudate by minimizing the volumetric effective strain rate deviation. The 3 D streamlined <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is characterized by a Legendre polynomial series where the higher order coefficients are either constants or functions of the rotational coordinate, 2 ̆ 6 phiv;. FEM is used to compare the average distortion along the rectangle symmetry planes for two optimal die shapes. ^ When the optimal <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is described by the Legendre coefficients as function of 2 ̆ 6 phiv;, the difference in the average distortion between the symmetry planes decreases. Such a <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> causes material in the deformation zone to speed up or slow down, creating a more uniform distortion distribution in the finished product. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the design}} of preform die shapes in a high temperature multistage forging processes. The approach combines the backward deformation method, [1] and a fuzzy logic decision making algorithm, [2]. In the backward deformation method, proposed in e. g. [1], the final component shape is taken as the initial condition. The die is then moved in the reverse direction with boundary nodes being released as the die is raised. A fuzzy decision making approach is developed to specify new boundary condition for each backward time increment based on geometrical features and the plastic deformation of the workpiece. The optimum <b>die</b> <b>shape</b> is thereby determined by taking the optimum reverse path. Such a path will maximise the component life by avoiding local stress concentrations which can lead to premature failure. To maximise the life of the die itself a criteria {{based on the work of}} friction during forging is implemented. The die cavity dimensions can then be designed based on the friction work done on the die surface and the maximum allowable die wear tolerance.

A steady-state numerical model of wavelength converters based on cross-gain SOAs is developed. In this model, {{a new model}} of the gain coefficient is applied. Each physical variable, such as the carrier density, gain coefficient, differential gain, and internal loss, spatially varies across the SOA cavity and is numerically calculated throughout the device. Increased accuracy over previous studies is achieved by including such spatial variations. This model predicts wavelength-dependent characteristics of a wavelength converter of the SOA in both large and small signal regimes. Some key performance factors of SOA wavelength converters.
