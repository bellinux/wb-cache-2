50|$|Remy International {{announced}} on January 13, 2014 {{that it would}} acquire the assets of USA Industries. USA Industries is a worldwide distributor of remanufactured and new alternators, starters, CV axles, and <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>calipers.</b> It was founded in 1985 in Bay Shore, New York. Today, USA Industries has over 300 employees with warehousing and distribution centers across the United States.|$|R
50|$|The next board made {{available}} was the GP-X, which {{came with a}} silver anodized aluminium frame, blue anodized deep V rims, fully integrated calf brake with moulded plastic lever, increased ground clearance, <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> lugs on the frame, and disc hub on the rear wheel for easy conversion to disc brake use.|$|E
5000|$|Brake by wire is now {{a mature}} concept in its {{application}} to vehicle parking brakes. The electronic parking brake (EPB) {{was introduced in the}} early 2000s by BMW and Audi on their top line models (the 7-series and A8 respectively) to dispense with the traditional cable operated system (operated via a lever between the seats or via a foot pedal) which commonly acted on the rear wheels of a car. Such systems use a motorized mechanism built into the rear <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>caliper,</b> and is signalled via a switch on the centre console or dashboard. The electric parking brake is normally integrated with the vehicle's other systems via a CAN bus network, and can provide additional functionality such as ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{correctly}} secured {{quick release}} {{is unlikely to}} be ejected from the fork end in normal use where rim brakes are in use, although recently there has been some evidence, notably from James Annan, a British scientist working in Japan, suggesting that the moments in disc brake systems can cause quick-release front wheels to be ejected past the lawyer tabs. A small number of serious crashes have been attributed to this cause. This is controversial, and the fork manufacturers have not admitted a fault, although {{there is some evidence that}} they may accept the principle, and advice on checking quick release tension has been strengthened. [...] A complete solution to ejection risk would involve mounting the front <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> in front of the fork blade rather than behind, as the reaction force on the disc would then be into, rather than out of, the fork-end. However, this would involve major retooling by fork and brake manufacturers, though at least one manufacturer has placed the disc caliper mounts on the front of the right fork blade. This allows standard disc brakes to be used, and also makes it easier to mount mudguards.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> {{were located}} {{in front of the}} fork leg on top of the disc. This {{position}} placed the caliper in an area of high air flow for better heat removal. Calipers on most modern motorcycles are mounted {{to the rear of the}} fork leg. This has the advantage of reducing the angular momentum of the fork assembly and improving low speed handling. Radial mounted calipers.|$|R

5000|$|The split pivot {{design is}} a special case of linkage-driven single pivot in {{which one of the}} four-bar's pivot points coincides with the rear axle. This allows for the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> to be mounted on the {{floating}} linkage (also called coupler) instead of on the swingarm. As a result of this the braking torque now interacts with the suspension via the floating linkage. The linkages can be designed such that this has a positive effect on suspension performance under braking, typically reducing brake jack. Furthermore, the relative rotation between brake disc and brake caliper as the suspension goes through its travel is different from that in single pivot designs. The four linkages in a split pivot design influence how braking torque is transmitted, how the brake caliper moves in relation to the disc and influence the leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock travel. Since these influences may have a different optimum linkage design, the bike's design has to strike a balance. Dave Weagle designed a split pivot which he named [...] "Split Pivot". Trek Bicycle Corporation also released a version of the split pivot design called [...] "Active Braking Pivot" [...] (ABP) in early 2007. Cycles Devinci has released a licensed implementation of the [...] "Split Pivot" [...] design which Dave Weagle managed to patent.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{automotive}} <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> use MMCs. Early Lotus Elise models used aluminum MMC rotors, {{but they}} have less than optimal heat properties and Lotus has since switched back to cast-iron. Modern high-performance sport cars, such as those built by Porsche, use rotors made of carbon fiber within a silicon carbide matrix because of its high specific heat and thermal conductivity. 3M developed a preformed aluminum matrix insert for strengthening cast aluminum <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>calipers,</b> reducing weight by half compared to cast iron while retaining similar stiffness. 3M has also used alumina preforms for AMC pushrods.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{standards}} for mounting <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>calipers.</b> I.S. (International Standard) is different for 160mm and 203mm rotor and differs between forks with a QR and 20mm through axle. The post-mount standard also differs by disc size and axle type. Many incompatible variants were produced over the years, mostly by fork manufacturers. The mount {{used on the}} Rockshox Boxxer is the most typical of these specialty mounts, but most fork manufactures now use either the IS or post-mount standard for their current forks. As a point of reference, Hayes currently sells no fewer than 13 different adapters to fit their brakes to various mounting patterns.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{other changes}} Toyota {{included}} in the new Tundra are optional tow mirrors, a [...] fuel tank, available 22 in alloy wheels, backup camera, Bluetooth, large center console (big enough to fit a 15 in laptop), extra-large <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> and <b>calipers,</b> and the aforementioned 6-speed sequential automatic transmission.|$|R
40|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> are {{subjected}} to complex mechanical loading and interaction of individual components in a typical brake assembly makes design improvement very challenging. To analyse caliper behaviour, complex Finite Element models were created and successfully validated {{using a variety of}} experimental techniques, including exceptionally suitable Digital Image Correlation. A novel methodology to optimise caliper design was developed, using non-linear contact Finite Element Analysis and topology optimisation, to generate lightweight, high performance <b>brake</b> <b>calipers.</b> The method was used on a Formula 1 brake assembly and significant improvement in structural design was achieved, with the new caliper being lighter and stiffer than the original. The same approach was used on more conventional 4 pistons calipers using various boundary conditions with particular focus on mass reduction and considerably lighter designs were achieved. The influence of specific features of the optimised calipers on the structural performance was also successfully investigated...|$|R
50|$|The car's 75 hp engine {{combined}} with its lightweight construction was {{unusual for the}} time, especially when considering the price. Front wheels were equipped with <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> with four-pot <b>calipers</b> while rear <b>brakes</b> were alloy drums.|$|R
40|$|A <b>Disc</b> <b>brake</b> is {{a device}} that retards/halts the {{rotation}} of a shaft/ wheel. A <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> system consists of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> a <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> and <b>brake</b> pad. When the brake pedal is applied, pressurized hydraulic fluid squeezes the brake pad friction material against {{the surface of the}} rotating <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> The result of this contact produces friction which enables the vehicle to slow down or stop. Due to this friction, heat will be generated and the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> gets heated up which affects the performance of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> under different braking conditions. In this paper focus is primarily emphasized on the comparative performance of <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> having different profiles, by determining the von-misses stress & Deformation developed in the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> for different braking conditions using ANSYS 14. ...|$|R

5000|$|The new Hurst Olds {{shared with}} all 1973 GM A body cars, the most {{extensive}} redesign in their 10-year history The chassis was as new as the bodies -Wheelbase dimensions were a sporty 112 inches for coupes and 116 inches for sedans and station wagons on an all-new sturdier perimeter frame with increased front and rear suspension travel, larger 8½ inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings and new shock absorber location, new body mounts and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Power <b>brakes</b> with front <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> were now standard on all '73 Cutlasses.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{changes were}} {{in store for}} the Plymouth Duster. Simpler single-piston slider-type <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> were {{introduced}} for 1973 (standard on 318-powered cars and with power-assist on 340 models), replacing the Kelsey Hayes four-piston calipers. Disc brake-equipped Dusters now had the more-common 5-lugs on 4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. All 340 and some 318 engine-equipped cars received the simplified 8.25" [...] rear axle assembly (with wheel bearings riding directly on the axle shaft and endplay being taken by C-clips); these axles also featured the 5-on-4.5" [...] wheel bolt pattern. (This axle assembly replaced the 8.75" [...] "drop-out" [...] arrangement seen on some 1966-1972 A-bodies). The 225-powered cars retained the 5-lugs on 4" [...] pattern on vehicles with the standard drum brakes. A three speed Torque Flight automatic along with a manual transmission was offered with the 225 slant six. All models received larger front wheel bearings and increased spindle diameter. Electronic ignition became standard across the board.|$|R
50|$|The IS 350 shares larger <b>braking</b> <b>discs</b> and <b>calipers</b> {{borrowed}} from the GS 430; the IS 350's larger calipers are four-piston rather than the two-piston front calipers of the IS 250.|$|R
50|$|Often used in <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> {{assembly}} {{consists of}} one to two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel pistons (<b>caliper</b> pistons). <b>Brake</b> <b>calipers</b> {{are one of the}} most important parts of a vehicle and are essential for your car's ability to stop.The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels using the friction they create with metal disks (rotors). They work by taking the pressure given by the master cylinder to force the pistons against the rotor. The development and use of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902. In a disc-braking system the rotors are attached to the car's wheels and spin together.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame of}} the FJ1200 is {{manufactured}} from mild steel box-section and uses a perimeter layout, the fairing and upper rear section use separate cylindrical tubing sub-frames. The rear shock absorber is placed vertically behind the engine and connects to a swinging arm made from extruded aluminium alloy (note: later 3XW models have mild steel swinging arm) via several forged aluminium rocker arms. The 17-inch front wheel is held between 41 mm spring and oil damped forks. The FJ1100 and early FJ1200 models featured adjustable anti-dive units and a smaller diameter 16-inch wheel.The FJ1100 and early FJ1200 used twin ventilated <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> for the front wheel with a single ventilated disc at the rear. FJ1200 models, 3CV & 3XW, used solid front discs but retained the rear ventilated <b>disc,</b> front <b>brake</b> <b>calipers</b> were upgraded to a four-piston design.An anti-lock braking system was used on the FJ1200A. A full fairing protects the rider, varying height fixed windscreens were available as options.|$|R
50|$|The R-100 models {{received}} a double <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> {{in the front}} wheel. For 1976 to 1979 models the front brake was a pivot caliper ATE disc actuated from the controls via cable to a brake master cylinder under the tank. From 1980 models onwards front brakes were changed to a Brembo fixed <b>caliper</b> <b>brake,</b> and the master cylinder was moved from undertank to the right handlebar. With the introduction of Monolever models in 1986, the Brembo fixed calipers were mounted on the fork tubes. The back brake was initially a drum brake. Starting in the 1978 model year (September 1977), the R 100 RS and RT and S models {{received a}} Brembo rear <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> with fixed <b>caliper</b> on the rear wheel, and from model year 1986 the drum brake returned.|$|R
50|$|The P6 was steered by a {{lightweight}} {{rack and pinion}} designed by Bowin, with an energy absorbing steering column surmounted by a leather-covered steering wheel. It had 9.75 in <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> with alloy <b>caliper</b> assemblies. The twin braking system was adjustable for length and had an adjustable-ratio balance control. The rear brakes were mounted inboard on the gearbox to reduce unsprung weight. The wheels were magnesium, with 10 x 13 in in front and 12 x 13 in or 14 x 13 in in the rear.|$|R
50|$|Colin Chapman hired a {{young and}} talented gearbox engineer, Keith Duckworth, to solve this problem, but the {{priority}} needed to be on Lotus 16 for Grands Prix, which shared the Queer Box problem, so a newer version Series 2 was born while the update was in development in July, 1958 with BMC B-series four speed gearbox attached directly behind the engine, and a conventional differential housing with <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> <b>calipers</b> mounted on the sides.|$|R
50|$|Braking systems combine higher {{performance}} <b>brake</b> {{pads and}} <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> with multi-piston <b>calipers</b> that clamp onto oversized vented rotors. Suspension systems are advanced {{in terms of}} adjustments and materials for increased stability and durability. Front and rear tires are larger and wider than tires found on other types of motorcycles to allow higher cornering speeds and greater lean angles. Fairings {{may or may not}} be used on a sport bike; when used, fairings are shaped to reduce aerodynamic drag as much as possible and provide wind protection for the rider.|$|R
50|$|The P8 was steered by a cam-adjustable {{magnesium}} {{rack and}} pinion designed by Bowin, with an energy absorbing steering column surmounted by a leather-covered steering wheel.

50|$|From 1991, {{the rear}} drum brake was {{replaced}} by a 240 mm <b>disc</b> <b>brake,</b> with a single-piston <b>brake</b> <b>caliper.</b>|$|R
50|$|AUTOart was {{established}} in 1998 (AUTOart website). Other lines of diecast vehicles formerly associated with AUTOart were Gateway, Gate and UT Models. The latter was originally a German company with diecast cars made in China and associated with Paul's Model Art which produces Minichamps. AUTOart makes diecast model cars, slot racing cars, and diecast motorcycles. A line of Radio controlled cars is also planned. AEROart is another division producing aircraft models.AUTOart Design offers offbeat automobilia like 'shock absorber' pens, carbon fiber tissue boxes, or ashtray and clock {{in the form of}} a <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> rotor with <b>caliper.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{the rear}} {{suspension}} was now redesigned to a semi-trailing arm layout, {{and the track}} of the car was widened to 55 inches (1395 mm). 5 speed gearboxes and [...] "four pot" [...] front <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> <b>calipers</b> were other updates. The new models countered the earlier criticism {{that had been made}} in some quarters of tail-happy handling, with the prominent UK motoring magazine [...] "Autocar and Motor" [...] remarking in 1988 that the new 136 Rapid model [...] "handles like a Porsche 911".|$|R
50|$|For the 2005 model year, the Ford Super Duty {{trucks were}} given {{exterior}} and interior updates. For the exterior, a new grille, front bumper, and headlights were introduced alongside {{the introduction of a}} locking tailgate for all pickup trucks. Under the skin (with thicker frame rails), updated Triton gasoline engines were introduced with higher engine output and larger alternators; in response to the increased power, all trucks were given 4-wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> (with two-piston <b>calipers).</b> To accommodate the larger brakes, 17-inch wheels became standard, with 18-inch wheels optional (on single rear-wheel trucks); forged Alcoa wheels were an option. The long-running Twin I-Beam front suspension continued on two-wheel drive trucks.|$|R
