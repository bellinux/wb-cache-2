So far, prospective studies comparing the time course of nutritional status in new hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients have not been published. The aims of this study were to compare the time course of nutritional status in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> were <b>starting</b> HD or PD and to identify the baseline determinants of that time course. In this prospective multicenter cohort study, data were collected from 3 (baseline) to 24 mo after the start of dialysis, Repeated measures ANOVA was used to establish the time course of nutritional status. Differences were adjusted for baseline characteristics. A total of 250 consecutive new patients were included: 132 started on KD, and 118 started on PD. A univariate analysis demonstrated a decrease in serum albumin (SA) in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> on KD and an increase in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> on PD. Body fat increased in PD; LBM did not change. The protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance normalized to ideal weight decreased in PD after I yr, In a multivariate analysis, SA at 2 yr was 2. 0 g/L (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 3 to 3. 8) higher in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> on PD compared with <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> on HD.

40|$|International audienceWe {{explored}} {{the impact of}} transient cART started during the primary HIV-infection (PHI) on the long-term immunologic and virologic response on cART resumption, by comparison with treatment initiation during the chronic phase of HIV infection (CHI). We analyzed data on 1450 patients enrolled during PHI in the ANRS PRIMO cohort between 1996 and 2013. "Treatment resumption" was defined as at least 3  months of resumed treatment following interruption of at least 1  month of treatment initiated during PHI. "Treatment initiation during CHI" was defined as cART initiated ≥ 6  months after PHI. The virologic response to resumed treatment and to treatment initiated during CHI was analyzed with survival models. The CD 4 cell count dynamics was modeled with piecewise linear mixed models. 136 <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> resumed cART for a median (IQR) of 32 (18 - 51) months were compared with 377 <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> cART during CHI for a median of 45 (22 - 57) months.

However, after 12  months, <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> cART during CHI had a better immunological response than those who resumed cART (p[*]=[*] 0. 01); therefore, at 36  months, the gains in √CD 4 cells/mm(3) and CD 4 % were significantly greater in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> treatment during CHI.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} weight changes in schizophrenia patients taking risperidone {{as part of}} a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial. Methods: A total of 374 <b>patients</b> with schizophrenia <b>who</b> had been clinically stabilized following an acute episode were randomly assigned to a no-dose-reduction group (initial optimal therapeutic doses continued throughout the study), a 4 -week group (initial optimal therapeutic doses continued for 4 weeks followed by a half dose reduction that was maintained {{until the end of the}} study) or a 26 -week group (initial optimal therapeutic doses continued for 26 weeks followed by a half dose reduction until the end of the study). Participants were assessed monthly using standardized assessment instruments during the first 6 months, and then every 2 months until the last recruited patient completed the 1 -year follow-up. Weight gain was defined as gaining at least 7 % of initial body weight, weight loss as losing at least 7 % of initial body weight. A BMI < 18. 5 kgm 2 was defined as underweight, 18. 524. 9 kgm 2 as normal range, and 25 kgm 2 as overweight or obese. Results: At the end of follow-up, of the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> within the underweight range (n= 22), 77. 3 % gained weight, whereas 4. 5 % lost weight. The corresponding figures were 39. 6 % and 4. 8 % in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> at normal weight (n= 273), respectively, and 17. 7 % and 17. 7 % in <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> at overweight (n= 79), respectively. At the same time, 59. 1 % of the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>started</b> at underweight range went into the normal weight and 13. 6 % into the overweight/obese range, respectively, while 24. 5 % of those <b>who</b> <b>started</b> at normal weight went into the overweight/obese range, and 1. 1 % into underweight range, respectively; 20. 3 % of those <b>who</b> <b>started</b> at overweight range went into normal weight at the end of the follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that being underweight or normal weight at study entry predicted weight gain compared to being overweight, whereas being overweight at entry was associated with a higher likelihood of weight loss compared to being normal weight. No correlation was found between weight change and dose reduction. Conclusions: Weight change is a common, long-term, but heterogeneous side effect in risperidone maintenance treatment for stable schizophrenia patients. Special attention should be paid to fluctuations in weight that may occur throughout the course of treatment with risperidone. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
