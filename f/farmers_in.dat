Of the 7,900families adversely affected by the hurricane, 4,325required assistance from the American Red Cross. <b>Farmers</b> <b>in</b> Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell. The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.|$|E

Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|By September6, <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> {{southern}} {{areas of}} the country requested aid from the government. In South Jeolla Province, ₩35billion (US$31.1million) was allocated for post-storm recovery. Of this, about half went to repairing public facilities. Across the province, repairs were expected to be completed by October or November 2012. On September11, the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister announced that residents severely affected by the typhoon were eligible for up to ₩50million (US$44,000) in construction assistance. Economically, Typhoons Bolaven and Tembin contributed to a 6.6% decrease in construction investment, the largest drop since January 2003.|$|E

5|$|European pioneer <b>farmers</b> <b>in</b> the prairies of North America, {{where there}} is no wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a {{covering}} over the entrance.

5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. <b>Farmers</b> <b>in</b> Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding {{compensation for the damage}} caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E
5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats.
