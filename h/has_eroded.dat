5|$|In modern medicine, any {{distinction}} between the M.D. and the D.O. professions <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> steadily; diminishing numbers of D.O. graduates enter primary care fields, fewer use OMT, and increasing numbers of osteopathic graduates choose to train in non-osteopathic residency programs. An osteopathic physician (DO) is a fully licensed, patient-centered medical doctor. DO has full medical practice rights throughout the United States and in 44 countries abroad.|$|E

The lion relief, puring water, {{that is part}} of the water-trough (which is attached to the fountain) <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> over the years and was replaced with a replica in 2016.

5|$|The North Shore {{branch of}} the SIRT began at Saint George Terminal, using the northernmost {{platform}} and tracks of the terminal. After running through the St. George Freight Yard (near the modern Ballpark Station), the line ran {{on the shore of}} the Kill Van Kull from New Brighton to West Brighton. The line ran on land between St. George and New Brighton, and on a ballast-filled wood trestle supported by a wood retaining wall through Livingston and West Brighton. Though the right-of-way is distinguishable, little evidence of this portion of the line exists today, except for abandoned tracks and supports, much of which <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> into the kull.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E
5|$|While {{inflation}} <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> {{away the}} achievements of most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners {{in an era of}} much higher individual ticket prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.|$|E

25|$|The lake's {{principal}} inflows {{are from}} the Rubicon River and Five Lakes Creek, formerly {{a tributary of the}} Rubicon. Lake water has drowned the historical confluence of the two water courses. The Rubicon River was once known as the south fork of the middle fork of the American River. The Rubicon River's entry into the lake is via a cataract where the river <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> through the elevated granite block.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} dolmens {{scattered}} around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs; however, the acidic soil of Brittany <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone, then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, {{in various states of}} ruin.|$|E

On the slopes just below the woodland, most of the clay topsoil <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> away leaving a narrow band of oolitic limestone mixed with marl. This band of limestone, which has a radial exposition of 270 degrees stretching from the east-facing lieu-dits of Bassess Mourottes and Hautes Mourottes above Ladoix-Serrigny to down south and west to northwest facing lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne above Pernand-Vergelesses, is most suited for white wine grape varieties and have historically been the source for Corton-Charlemagne wine.|$|E
25|$|Haiti also {{suffers from}} severe {{environmental}} degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti’s forests remain, {{and in many}} places the soil <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> {{right down to the}} bedrock. Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, Haitians have created an illegal market for coal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.|$|E
25|$|Payments {{made in the}} 20th {{century as}} reparations for damage to the Bikini Atoll and the islanders' way of life have {{elevated}} their income relative to other Marshall Island residents. It has caused some Bikini islanders to become economically dependent on the payments from the trust fund. This dependency <b>has</b> <b>eroded</b> individuals' interest in traditional economic pursuits like taro and copra production. The move also altered traditional patterns of social alliance and political organization. On Bikini, rights to land and land ownership were the major factor in social and political organization and leadership. After relocation and settlement on Kili, a dual system of land tenure evolved. Disbursements from the trust fund were based in part to land ownership on Bikini and based on current land tenure on Kili.|$|E
