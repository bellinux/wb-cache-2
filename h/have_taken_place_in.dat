5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis, such an observation {{could only have been}} made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could only <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1517 BC. The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed.|$|E

This is said to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> summer 1875, when Eminescu was working as an inspector for Maiorescu's Education Ministry, overseeing schools in Iași County: reportedly, Eminescu was fascinated with Creangă's talents as a raconteur, while the latter admired Eminescu for his erudition.|$|E
