However, a 1999 study of Amanita specimens in Japanese herbaria concluded that they were closely related but distinct species, {{due to differences in}} spore shape and in the microstructure of the volval remnants. Another similar species, A.magniverrucata, is differentiated from A.abrupta by a number of characteristics: the universal veil is clearly separated from the flesh of the cap; the volval warts disappear more quickly because the surface of the cap cuticle gelatinizes; the partial veil is more persistent; the spores are smaller and roughly spherical; {{on the underside of the}} partial veil, the stem has surface fibrils that are drawn upward so as to somewhat resemble a cortina (a cobweb-like protective covering over the immature spore bearing surfaces); A.magniverrucata has a known distribution limited to the south western coast of North America.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{simple to}} harvest, matsutake {{are hard to}} find because of their {{specific}} growth requirements and the rarity of appropriate forest and terrain, combined with competition from local folk and wild animals such as squirrel, rabbits and deer for the once-yearly harvest of mushrooms, causing the price to be very high at times or as low as $2 per pound for pickers when the market will bear it. Domestic production of matsutake in Japan has been sharply reduced over the last 50 years due to the pine-killing nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which has influenced the price a great deal. The annual harvest of matsutake in Japan is now less than 1,000 tons, and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>mushroom</b> supply is largely made up by imports from China, Korea, the North American Pacific Northwest (Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia), and Northern Europe (Sweden and Finland). [...] The price for matsutake in the Japanese market is highly dependent on quality, availability, and origin. The Japanese matsutake {{at the beginning of the}} season, which is the highest grade, can go up to $1,000 per kilogram. In contrast, the average value for imported matsutake is about $90 per kilogram.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} eritadenine isoamyl ester (EiA) on cyclic AMP (cAMP) -dependent {{biochemical}} systems were investigated {{in order to}} elucidate the mechanism of its hypolipidemic action. EiA exhibited a twofold effect on stimulated lipolysis in rat epididymal fat cells; i. e., EiA (5 xlO~ 4 M) inhibited theophylline-induced glycerol release, but potentiated the lipolytic action of epinephrine. EiA (5 X 10 " 4 M) {{had no effect on}} the theophylline-induced augmentation of cAMP levels in fat cells. EiA inhibited cAMP-dependent protein kinase [EC 2. 7. 1. 37] in the fat pad infranatant and liver supernatant fractions. Kinetic studies using partially purified liver enzyme showed that EiA inhibited protein kinase at the phosphorylation step, the inhibition being competitive with respect to ATP. EiA inhibited the cAMP phosphodiesterase [EC 3. 1. 4. 17] of fat cells. It increased the rate of cAMP accumu-lation in fat cells induced by epinephrine on incubation for one minute and it also potentiated cAMP-induced lipolysis. EiA enhanced the action of lower concentrations (5 xl 0 ~ 5 M— 5 xl 0 ~ 4 M) of dibutyryl-cAMP (DBcAMP) in DBcAMP-induced lipolysis, but suppressed the action of higher concentrations (10 ~ 3 M) of DBcAMP. This biphasic pattern was also observed in DBcAMP-induced increase in a-aminoisobutyrate uptake by isolated perfused rat liver and in cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in rat adrenal cells. It is suggested that the biphasic effects of EiA may be due to its inhibition of both protein kinase and cAMP phosphodiesterase.

The experiments were carried out at Bisei-cho, Okayama Prefecture in 1958. In this experiments the insecticides were DDT, EPN, dieldrin, aldrin, malathon (powder) and lindane (Fumigant). These insecticides were used singly or jointly to control the larvae of injurious Dipterous insects. All of them were recognized the fair effect. It may be concluded {{from the results of}} this experiment that the use of insecticide has economical advantages in the following conditions: (1) The effect of insect control by insecticide is over about 50 %.

40|$|The N-terminal {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of an aminopeptidase from <b>Japanese</b> edible <b>mushroom,</b> Grifola frondosa, {{was reported to have}} high similarity with that of a serine proteinase from basidiomycete, Agaricus bisporous (Nishiwaki and Hayashi, 2001). The full-length cDNA and the corresponding genomic DNA of the enzyme were cloned, based on the reported N-terminal {{amino acid sequence}}. The predicted open reading frame (ORF) of the cloned cDNA, encoding a product of 379 amino acids, was expressed in E. coli using pET expression vector. The expressed pro-enzyme (40 kDa) underwent autolysis to produce the mature protein (30 kDa) and a pro-peptide (10 kDa). The mature protein and the pro-peptide remained tightly bound to each other and could not be separated by Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography or Q-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme was inactive in the bound form. Upon treatment with subtilisin, the bound pro-peptide was further hydrolyzed and a high serine proteinase activity was recovered. No aminopeptidase activity was detected at any stage of the protein processing. These results clearly indicated that the N-terminal amino acid sequence and the function of the reported aminopeptidase were not derived from the same protein entity and hence caused the structure-function anomaly...|$|R
