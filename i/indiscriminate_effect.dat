40|$|Aims The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial efficacy of five different proteases belonging to two different families on Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Methods and Results We used three serine proteases and two metalloproteases in single species biofilm formation assays and in human cell invasion processes. Following each protease incubation with bacterial cells, surface protein patterns were analysed by SDS-PAGE and zymography. Some differently expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Conclusions The effect of tested proteases on biofilm formation was not related to the protease category but was strain-dependent and was related to the biofilm formation capacity of each staphylococcal strain. Some proteases showed a nonspecific and <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>effect</b> on surface proteins, while others induced a discrete and reproducible action on protein profiles. Significance and Impact of the Study The inhibition of the surface-related virulence factors is a promising avenue to overcome persistent infections caused by bacterial biofilms. To this end, we show here that proteases, in particular the metalloprotease serratiopeptidase, can interfere with adhesion and invasion of eukaryotic cells and biofilm formation in staphylococci and their use could represent a viable treatment for the development of novel combination therapies...|$|E

40|$|Recently, States {{have chosen}} to deploy new weapons with {{sophisticated}} technological platform that operate {{in a different way}} respect to the traditional use of weapons on the battlefield, such as the unmanned aerial vehicles that does not carry a human operator and that can be piloted remotely. These vehicles, outfitted with missiles, become weapons dissimilar from traditional arms under many aspects. This study attempts to analyse whether deployment of these instruments comply, {{in the context of an}} armed conflict, with general rules of international humanitarian law (IHL). In light of the technological developments that changed the war scenario in modern armed conflicts, it has been necessary to assess whether there is a legal vacuum with regard to the so-called new weapons or it is possible to apply to these weapons existing IHL rules. In the latter case, problems in the implementation of traditional principles of IHL has been verified in these new contexts with regard to tools that are not weapons per se but may be transformed into weapons through their use. We have focused too on the question of targeting individuals i. e. high-level belligerent leaders in an armed conflict and if this target selection violates the law of war. Finally, we have considered if the deployment of drones outfitted with missiles may be evaluate as war crime and who is responsible for it, taking note that drones are directed remotely without a direct participation in hostilities on the battlefield with a new problem on the identification of the person responsible for crimes. In conclusion, it seems that even if there are no specific prohibitions on certain types of new weapons, general principles of IHL concerning the use of weapons in armed conflict and international criminal law are applicable and must be taken into account in order to assess both the lawfulness of the use of such weapons under IHL in a given case and the individual criminal responsibility under international criminal law. Consequently, when assessing the responsibility for war crimes in the use of new weapons it must be taken into account of the characteristics of the weapon employed. If the new weapon is inherently incapable to hit a specific target or if it has been used in contrast with the principles of IHL and individual is aware of the <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>effect</b> of the deployment, the responsibility for war crimes should be affirmed...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes numerous {{acute and}} chronic opportunistic infections in humans. One {{of its most}} formidable weapons is a type III secretion system (T 3 SS), a multi-protein molecular syringe that injects powerful toxins directly into host cells. The toxins lead to cell dysfunction and, ultimately, cell death. Identification of regulatory pathways that control T 3 SS gene expression {{may lead to the}} discovery of novel therapeutics to treat P. aeruginosa infections. In a previous study, it was found that expression of the magnesium transporter gene mgtE inhibits T 3 SS gene transcription. MgtE-dependent inhibition appeared to interfere with the synthesis or function of the master T 3 SS transcriptional activator ExsA, although the exact mechanism was unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that mgtE expression acts through the GacAS two-component system to activate transcription of the small regulatory RNAs RsmY and RsmZ. This event ultimately leads to inhibition of exsA translation. Moreover, our data reveal that MgtE acts solely through this pathway to regulate T 3 SS gene transcription. Our study reveals an important mechanism that may allow P. aeruginosa to fine-tune T 3 SS activity in response to certain environmental stimuli. In addition, a previous study has shown that the P. aeruginosa gene algR abrogates mgtE mediated regulation of cytotoxicity. AlgR has pleiotropic effects in P. aeruginosa, including regulation of synthesis of the exopolysaccharide alginate. In the second part of my thesis, I show that algR and mgtE genetically crosstalk to inhibit ExsA driven T 3 SS gene transcription. This genetic interaction between algR and mgtE seems to be specifically directed towards regulation of T 3 SS gene expression rather than having an <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>effect</b> on multiple virulence attributes in P. aeruginosa. Additionally, we have further demonstrated that AlgR inhibits mgtE transcription. These studies suggest the presence of a T 3 SS inhibitor that is inhibited by both AlgR and MgtE. Future work will involve transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to identify such an inhibitor. Taken together, this study provides important insight into the molecular mechanisms of mgtE expression and function in P. aeruginosa. We have established that mgtE has pleiotropic effects on cytotoxicity in P. aeruginosa. Thus, given the role that cytotoxicity regulation plays in shaping P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and associated clinical outcomes, mgtE might be an interesting drug target, though extensive future studies are required to validate this proposition. Nevertheless, this research, provides clues for identification of novel therapeutic targets in P. aeruginosa. Hence this work, in the long run, serve to ameliorate the morbidity and mortality in patients infected with P. aeruginosa...|$|E

40|$|The {{recognition}} of the international scope {{and nature of the}} problem of refugees, which induced the establishment of UNHCR and the adoption of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, did not result in shared responsibility for the protection of refugees but rather in a strict apportioning of responsibilities between UNHCR on the one hand, and states on the other. Rather than sharing the apportioned part as a collective responsibility, states become individually responsible for refugees who seek refuge in their respective territories, and hence only for part of the problem of refugees. This individual responsibility is triggered by observing the prohibition of refoulement. Since this prohibition is not coupled to a distributive mechanism, its observance may cause huge disparities in terms of numbers of refugees, and hence in the extent of responsibility individual states incur. Remedying these <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>effects</b> would require taking collective responsibility for the problem of refugees, more in particular, a system that would secure joint and several responsibility whereby individual states have the right of recourse to other states to recover ‘overpayment’, in short: a non-discretionary burden sharing mechanism that involves all states...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOxidative stress plays {{a central}} role in the {{pathogenesis}} of diverse chronic inflammatory disorders including diabetic complications, cardiovascular disease, aging, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with moderate to advanced CKD have markedly increased levels of oxidative stress and inflammation that likely contribute to the unacceptable high rates of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in excess of the capacity of cells/tissues to detoxify or scavenge them. Such a state of oxidative stress may alter the structure/function of cellular macromolecules and tissues that eventually leads to organ dysfunction. The harmful effects of ROS have been largely attributed to its <b>indiscriminate,</b> stochastic <b>effects</b> on the oxidation of protein, lipids, or DNA but in many instances the oxidants target particular amino acid residues or lipid moieties. Oxidant mechanisms are intimately involved in cell signaling and are linked to several key redox-sensitive signaling pathways in fibrogenesis. Dysregulation of antioxidant mechanisms and overproduction of ROS not only promotes a fibrotic milieu but leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and further exacerbates kidney injury. Our studies support the hypothesis that unique reactive intermediates generated in localized microenvironments of vulnerable tissues such as the kidney activate fibrogenic pathways and promote end-organ damage. The ability to quantify these changes and assess response to therapies will be pivotal in understanding disease mechanisms and monitoring efficacy of therapy...|$|R

500|$|Public {{nuisance}} concerns {{protecting the}} public, unlike private nuisance, which protects an individual. As such {{it is not}} only a tort but also a crime. In Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission [...] "which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects". Because of the wide definition given, there are a large range of issues which can be dealt with through public nuisance, including picketing on a road, as in Thomas v NUM, blocking a canal, as in Rose v Miles, or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road, as in Lyons v Gulliver. A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public, one can claim for personal injuries as well as damage to property. Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered [...] "special damage" [...] over and above the effects on the other affected people in the [...] "class".

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to {{a growing body of}} research on the impact of China’s rustication programme—a social mobilisation, transferring urban school graduates to rural communities during the Cultural Revolution—on the lives of the Cultural Revolution cohort (CR cohort), and more broadly, to research on the impact of socialist campaigns on social mobility. The analyses of this thesis are based on two national surveys as well as interviews that I conducted with former rusticates and non-rusticates. Distinct from earlier studies which stated that the rustication programme had <b>indiscriminate</b> and adverse <b>effects</b> on all social groups, my results show the process itself was socially stratified: (1) children from the bad class origin and highly-educated families were intensively targeted, and (2) the privileged military families were spared from the mobilisation, and their children were sent to join the People's Liberation Army (PLA). In view of the timing of major life transitions, rusticates lag behind their non-rusticated counterparts and individuals from adjacent cohorts, despite the fact that the delayed attainment of further education was experienced by all members of the CR cohort. After controlling for experience of rustication, children of party officials have a higher chance of obtaining a college degree than those from other social backgrounds. The analysis of the complete work-life histories of the CR cohort as a whole reveals four employment trajectories: Rusticates are more likely to be in the trajectory group characterised by unemployment in the late stage of their career than non-rusticates. Children of party members have a higher likelihood to be in the trajectory dominated by managerial work with short initial spells in the PLA. Rusticates are found to be less satisfied with their lives, their current situation is more deprived and they are more likely to be active in conflict solving, as opposed to non-rusticates and members of adjacent cohorts. Interviews suggest that rusticates viewed the experience of rustication as being an important part of their past and display a thirst for public recognition.

Non-rusticates reckoned their lives were also affected by the rustication through their close links with rusticates. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
