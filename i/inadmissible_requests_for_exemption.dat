The populations compared were constituted by all patients diagnosed as having breast cancer requesting exemption from making co-payments (ALD 30 entitlement) in 1994 or in 1998. The results showed an increase in the declared number of breast cancers in 1998. This progression could be explained, in part, by a the relative aging of the population. At the same time, part of this increase appears unrelated to age. An analysis of the stages at which this disease was diagnosed demonstrates that in the department of the Puy-de-Dôme, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of breast cancers diagnosed at earlier stages...|$|R
