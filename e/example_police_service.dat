50|$|The {{company is}} most noted {{as the first}} {{manufacturer}} of ultralight aircraft {{to have one of}} their designs used by a <b>police</b> <b>service.</b> The Monterey Park, California Police Department flew a Double Eagle for six months in 1982, becoming the first police department to fly an ultralight aircraft for patrols. The program was ended after seven engine failures in flight. An <b>example</b> of the <b>police</b> <b>service</b> aircraft is on display in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center and one was at one time in the EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.|$|R

50|$|Not all radio {{transmissions}} are prohibited {{in the core}} of the Radio Quiet Zone. For <b>example,</b> emergency <b>service</b> (<b>police,</b> fire, and ambulance) radios and Citizen's Band radio are permitted. However, large transmitter owners must typically coordinate their operations with the NRAO. The only broadcast radio stations are part of the Allegheny Mountain Radio network—with just one station in the AM band, and several low-power FM stations. Exceptions to restrictions are usually determined on a case-by-case basis, with preference given to public safety concerns, such as remote alarm systems, repeaters for emergency services, and NOAA Weather Radio.|$|R

5000|$|Clearance rates can be {{problematic}} {{for measuring the}} performance of <b>police</b> <b>services</b> and for comparing various <b>police</b> <b>services.</b> This is because a police force may employ {{a different way of}} measuring clearance rates. For <b>example,</b> each <b>police</b> force may have a different method of recording when a [...] "crime" [...] has occurred and different criteria for determining when a crime has been [...] "cleared." [...] One police force may appear to have a much better clearance rate because of its calculation methodology.|$|R

50|$|The Indian <b>Police</b> <b>Service</b> (IPS) uses {{insignia}} on its shoulder flashes {{which are}} similar to those used by the Indian Army. Since Police Inspectors and officers below this rank are recruited by states individually, the insignias vary slightly though the rank structure is the same.

General policing and patrolling {{was provided by}} the Toronto <b>Police</b> <b>Service,</b> the Ontario Provincial Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Canadian Forces, while the Peel Regional Police aided in policing at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga during the arrivals of delegates. The five departments formed an Integrated Security Unit (ISU), similar to the one created for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

40|$|Forensic {{science has}} a {{significant}} current and future role in crime detection, policing and the criminal justice system. Government and societal drivers, police priorities and advances {{in science and technology}} are demanding, as well as providing opportunities, for its impact and potential to be expanded, evaluated and assessed further. Within this, {{there is a need for}} the Criminal Justice System to be clear what it is looking for in respect of forensic science and to identify what the priorities, opportunities and processes are for development and possible expansion (of some areas, such as Digital Forensics, Biometrics and Imaging technologies). For <b>example,</b> if the <b>police</b> <b>service’s</b> primary forensic science require-ments are for reductions in unit costs, improvements in detection rates or faster turn-around times then this should be clearly specified to internal and external providers, while recognising that such requirements could have consequences for the development and delivery of forensic science, as well as policing, in other ways. A key area of agreement within the forensic community is the importance of establishing a vehicle for identifying future possibilities, potential and priorities which fosters innovation, maintains invest-ment and shapes (rather than directs) the forensic science market; together with the need for engagement with the broader based academic community, in relation to research and development...|$|R
