Cities along the shore in some cases were unable to accommodate {{the large number of}} workers needed for the cleanup, so BP used <b>flotels</b> to house some of the workers. BP told the media that <b>flotels</b> were convenient because they allowed workers to be close to cleanup sites, lessening travel time.|$|R

A <b>flotel</b> (floating habitat used by oil platform crews) broke loose of its moorings and slammed into the Cochrane-Africatown USA Bridge; the bridge damage was later found not to be critical {{but in the meantime}} its traffic was reduced from four lanes to two. There was cause for concern because the bridge, in conjunction with underwater tunnels, {{is a part of the}} I-10 Hazardous Materials route across the Mobile River. The Battleship Parkway crossing Mobile Bay was also closed before the storm and was completely submerged during the hurricane. Many coastal homes south of the Point Clear area were severely damaged, flooded, or swept away.|$|E
50|$|Directors Nicky Gogan and Paul Rowley {{first visited}} the camp as {{children}} when Mosney was {{run as a}} holiday centre. They returned to the camp in February 2004 to begin a period of research with the residents at the camp. Originally the intention was to write a script for a drama {{based on the idea}} of <b>flotels</b> - container ships holding asylum seekers to be floated off the coast while the asylum seekers were being processed. The filmmakers decided soon after meeting the residents in Mosney to change direction and make a documentary. They began to run a series of audio and video workshops in the camp with the residents, including concerts with a rap group formed at Mosney, audio workshops with the women's group, and community radio broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|Strand, {{influenced}} by Terje Isungset and other former drum teachers, show a percussive musical mind often with melodic lines that argue {{their way through}} an electronic soundscape pointing to his IDM influences. His solo performances {{is known for its}} springy ideas combining computers with Frank Zappa inspired bisicle concerts, often including electronic drums and creative percussions. Pianist Øystein Moen, in the line-up of bands like Jaga Jazzist and Puma, bring along a huge pack of musical ballast ranging from lyrical piano pieces to contemporary electric freebag. Moen meets Me at Sea are presenting original material including different emotions like the piceful harmonies to externalizing parts of noise-impro. They want to ceep the music in between genres, and show elements of their musical influences, such as Brad Mehldau, Paul Bley and Keith Jarrett has to be mentioned, and electronic artists such as <b>Flotel</b> and Ilkae.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{function}} of a jacket structure is to support {{the weight of the}} topside structure by transferring the weight to the foundation. The jacket structure must also be designed to resist environmental loads (from wind and waves) and also accidental loads, such as boat impact, extreme environmental conditions and earthquake. This thesis presents the results from a strength assessment based on the conceptual design of an eight-legged jacket with V plus X braces pattern and an alternative six-legged jacket with fully X braces pattern. Subsequently, a study was carried out to compare the responses of the two jacket structures when they are subjected to an accidental collision from a floating living quarter (a <b>flotel).</b> To date, extensive research has been carried out on vessel-to-jacket collisions. However, little work has been performed for flotel-to-jacket collisions. This thesis implements the basic design principles of ship collision and several reasonable assumptions. It is expected that the results could provide an overview of how the different potential impact locations and directions will influence the resistance capacity of the jackets. It is also anticipated that this procedure and the assumptions could be a reference for related research in the future...|$|E

40|$|With the {{estimated}} increase {{in demand for}} energy in the World by one-third within the next 25 years, the findings and estimates in the Arctic are of great importance. Equipment, procedures, training, facilities, logistics, EER and production are {{only some of the}} many challenges for the industry moving north. The industry must be prepared for the public eye, as high societal expectations to companies must be anticipated. There are great differences between the areas in the Arctic; therefore this thesis focuses on areas that are currently open for petroleum activities in the Norwegian Barents Sea, considering two operational scenarios and two emergency preparedness scenarios. 1. 	Operation scenarios a. 	Off-loading by shuttle tanker b. 	<b>Flotel</b> connected to rig 2. 	Emergency preparedness scenarios a. 	Emergency landing with helicopter on water (Ditching) b. 	Man over board (MOB) The overall question to be answered was whether the Norwegian Barents Sea is significantly rougher than the North Sea and thus if it is possible to carry out the selected scenarios? This was split into three parts: What is required and/or needed for these operations to be performed with a satisfactory level of risk? How will this influence the availability? Is it possible to conduct operations in the Norwegian Barents Sea at this point, without unreasonably high cost? By satisfactory it is meant as good as the North Sea. Background material regarding Barents Sea conditions and the operations investigated was thoroughly studied before a qualitative risk analysis was performed. The Bow Tie method was selected for this analysis, based on scenarios created for the particular operation or emergency preparedness cases; focusing on the differences between the Norwegian Barents Sea {{and the rest of the}} Norwegian Continental Shelf. The main differences found for the area of interest were; rapid weather changes, icing, polar night, lower temperatures and underdevelopment. The analysis has revealed that the selected operations in the area of interest can be carried out with a satisfactory risk level, with extra attention paid to operational planning and some minor adjustments to requirements. The Norwegian Barents Sea stands out as an Arctic area that will allow for petroleum activity without unreasonable added costs. The analysis and research has found that the conditions in the Norwegian Barents Sea are not significantly different from what the industry faces in other areas of the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The main issue found was the underdevelopment of the area and no area emergency preparedness. Uncertainties with weather forecasts are also an issue; however these are expected to improve as more observations are made. The forecast models for polar lows need to be improved. With gradual development and improved infrastructure, the investigated scenarios will not represent any greater risk in the Norwegian Barents Sea than other areas on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Communicating the risk level to the public is a challenge for the industry. Industry partners seem to agree on the challenges and risks, and that they are not significantly different or worse than in the North Sea. The analysis? performed in this thesis do not challenge this view. Public opinion seems to be that the Norwegian Barents Sea is something completely new and different from the rest of the Norwegian Continental Shelf. At least for the cases studied in this thesis, this simply is not true. &# 8195...|$|E
