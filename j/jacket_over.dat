5|$|On the May 23 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Deuce 'n Domino parted ways with Cherry and {{replaced}} her with Maryse. On the June 20, 2008 episode of SmackDown, following {{a loss to}} Jesse and Festus, their second straight loss in two weeks, Deuce and Domino engaged {{in a fight with}} each other, and Deuce performed the Crack 'em in da Mouth finishing move on Domino. Deuce then threw his <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> Domino, dissolving their partnership. The split was then further cemented when Deuce was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft. Following the draft, Domino was predominantly featured as an enhancement talent—a wrestler who consistently loses to make his opponents look stronger—on SmackDown weekly. In August 2008, Domino and Cherry were released from their WWE contracts. The following year, Deuce was released from the WWE as well.|$|E

25|$|Lindy Chamberlain was {{questioned}} about the garments that Azaria was wearing. She claimed that Azaria {{was wearing a}} matinee <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> the jumpsuit, but the jacket was not present when the garments were found. She {{was questioned}} {{about the fact that}} Azaria's singlet, which was inside the jumpsuit, was inside out. She insisted that she never put a singlet on her babies inside out and that she was most particular about this. The statement conflicted with the state of the garments when they were collected as evidence. The garments had been arranged by the investigating officer for a photograph.|$|E
25|$|At about 11:45pm ship's time Gracie was jarred awake by a jolt. He sat up, {{realized}} the ship's engines {{were no longer}} moving, and partially dressed, putting on a Norfolk <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> his regular clothes. Reaching the Boat Deck, he {{realized the}} ship was listing slightly. He returned to his cabin {{to put on his}} life jacket and on the way back found the women he had been chaperoning. He escorted them up to the Boat Deck and made sure they entered lifeboats. He then retrieved blankets for the women in the boats, and along with his friend Smith assisted Second Officer Charles Lightoller in filling the remaining lifeboats with women and children.|$|E
25|$|The Lapels: Neapolitan jackets {{are famous}} for their wide lapels, which oftentimes are peaked (“a punta”) for {{double-breasted}} jackets, formal jackets, and coats. The “risvolto dentellato” (the “classic” style of lapels – not peaked) are notoriously wider in Neapolitan jackets: they can be as wide as 4 inches, compared to the 3 inches of a regular lapel width). Just {{as is the case}} for the pockets, the Neapolitan lapel features double stitching running along the sides – a stunning detail that’s peculiar of a Neapolitan creation – although reserved for the less formal pieces. The “scollo a martiello” (literally “hammer neck”) is the opening of the <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> the shirt, which in Neapolitan tailoring is perfectly parallel to the lapels. The cran is the space that separates the lapel and the neck, and it is usually higher in Neapolitan tailoring to create the illusion of a more slender figure.|$|E

500|$|In 1962, all Grosset & Dunlap books become [...] "picture covers", {{books with}} artwork and {{advertising}} printed directly on their covers, {{as opposed to}} books with a dust <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> a tweed volume. The change was to reduce production costs. Several of the 1930s and 1940s cover illustrations were updated by Nappi for this change, depicting a Nancy of the Kennedy era, though the stories themselves were not updated. Internal illustrations, which were dropped in 1937, were returned to the books beginning in 1954, as pen and ink line drawings, mostly by uncredited artists, but usually corresponding with Nappi's style of drawing Nancy on the covers. Nappi followed trends initiated by Gillies and often illustrated Nancy wearing the same clothing more than once, including a mustard shirtwaist dress.|$|E
500|$|Of appearance, {{after meeting}} Nolan for {{an article about}} The Dark Knight Rises, {{journalist}} Jeffrey Ressner described the director as [...] "the picture of Zen-like calm, speaking softly and deliberately about his work." [...] Nolan speaks with an English accent, which supports a more sophisticated impression accentuated by his habit of wearing suits. Professionally, he commonly dresses in a clubbable but also muted ensemble, often wearing a dark and narrow-lapeled <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> a blue dress shirt. In colder weather, he is observed as carrying a herringbone waistcoat (with the bottom button left open). An article in The New York Times Magazine understood Nolan's clothing style to [...] "split {{the difference between the}} demands of an executive suit and a tundra". Empire declared him [...] "the best dressed director since Hitchcock." ...|$|E
500|$|The winning entry was by Angel Gracia and Cliff Guest and {{it showed}} the female protagonist (played by the director's sister Anabel Garcia) being {{supported}} and guided by her girlfriends who introduce her with the male protagonist. The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder and walks away from the girl. Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, US-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of Tina Turner's 1984 single [...] "What's Love Got to Do with It".|$|E

500|$|Roxas is {{depicted}} as a spiky blond-haired boy with blue eyes. Due to his nature as a Nobody, he is an [...] "empty shell" [...] of series' protagonist Sora created when the latter sacrifices his heart and becomes a Heartless during the events of Kingdom Hearts. As a result, despite his teenage appearance, Roxas is one day short of a year old when he rejoins Sora in Kingdom Hearts II. As a civilian, he wears a white <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> a black one and white trousers. As a member of Organization XIII, Roxas wears a hooded black coat that covers most of his body. His weapon is the Keyblade known as , resembling a classic skeleton key with a long silver keychain extending from the hilt, and a Mickey Mouse token {{on the end of}} it.

On December 3, Hilson performed [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] at the VH1 Divas Salute the Troops concert. She took to the stage dressed in a gold bustier with high-waisted pants and a fringe-laden jacket to perform the song {{in front of an}} audience that included members of the US Armed Forces. Hilson was backed by four female dancers, who wore stylized military jackets. Mawuse Ziegbe from MTV News wrote that, [...] "Hilson brought her saucy, sexpot swagger to the stage." [...] The promotion of the song continued on December 7, when she performed a remixed version of [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] on Lopez Tonight, dressed in a silver and black leotard. Hilson later performed [...] "Pretty Girl Rock" [...] on December 14 on the Today Show, mixing the track with James Blunt's single [...] "You're Beautiful". For the performance, she wore a glittery multi-colored <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> a black blouse, skin-tight jeans and stilettos.|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> her dress and walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E

50|$|Borea's 1946 fall {{collection}} was presented on 12 September at her Paris salon, {{which had been}} redecorated with white and red and massed with red flowers. The lines of her clothing designs were simple, with natural shoulders. Fullness was eschewed except for drapery featured on aslim silhouette for evening. Among her fashions at the showing included a gray flannel ski suit with white leather suspenders and gold buckles. Borea introduced amber, mouse gray, and moss green corduroy box <b>jackets</b> <b>over</b> tweed suits or simple turtleneck wool dresses.

The tape began with Saldívar stating how badly she wanted to die. During the conversation, the jury heard Larry Young try to persuade her to lower her gun; Saldívar said {{that she could not}} do so. Young told her that by committing suicide she would only harm her parents. Saldívar then asked to contact her mother to say goodbye and ask for forgiveness. She continued to whine [...] "I just wanna die" [...] as Young began talking about religion to determine if she believed in a faith that might cause her to reconsider suicide. Young told Saldívar that if she would give herself up, he would place a <b>jacket</b> <b>over</b> her so that the media would not have a picture of her face during her surrender. Isaac Valencia told Saldívar that if she were to surrender they promised to turn off all of the lights that were pointing towards her truck; she agreed. As she left her truck, she was scared by the dozens of armed police and FBI agents who were pointing rifles and pistols at her. She ran back to her truck, pointed the gun at her head, and screamed at Young: [...] "They're carrying guns! They're carrying guns! They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me!" [...] Anchor newswoman, María Celeste Arrarás, wrote in her 1997 investigative book, that she found it [...] "curious" [...] for a person who cried for hours that she wanted to die: [...] "would be afraid that someone might make her wish come true." [...] The New York Times also commented that: [...] "she alternately begged to be killed and expressed fear that she would be killed if she left the truck." ...|$|E
2500|$|Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) is the dark-haired, older Duke boy. More {{mature and}} {{rational}} than his cousin Bo, he is typically {{the one who}} thinks of the plan that will get the two out of whatever trouble they have gotten into.

He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former boxer. Luke was the first Duke to perform the [...] "hood slide" [...] across The General Lee, which is seen in the opening credits of the show (a shot taken from the second episode, [...] "Daisy's Song") and later told by Tom Wopat to be an accident, because his foot got caught {{on the side of the}} General Lee when he attempted to jump across the hood; he also caught his thigh on the hood's radio antenna, cutting himself, resulting in such antennas being removed from later versions of the General Lee which those later versions looked similar to the ones in The Dukes of Hazzard film. However, the [...] "hood slide" [...] quickly proved popular and became a regular staple of episodes. The only episode to directly reference the age difference between Luke and Bo is in the seventh season opener, the [...] "flashback" [...] episode [...] "Happy Birthday, General Lee," [...] where it is stated that Luke had already been in the Marines while Bo was in his last year at high school.
