25|$|Nocturnal {{animals have}} higher body temperatures, greater activity, rising serotonin, and {{diminishing}} cortisol during the night—the inverse of <b>diurnal</b> <b>animals.</b> Nocturnal and <b>diurnal</b> <b>animals</b> both have increased electrical {{activity in the}} suprachiasmatic nucleus, and corresponding secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, at night. Nocturnal mammals, which tend to stay awake at night, have higher melatonin at night just like diurnal mammals do. And, although removing the pineal gland in many animals abolishes melatonin rhythms, it does not stop circadian rhythms altogether—though it may alter them and weaken their responsiveness to light cues. Cortisol levels in <b>diurnal</b> <b>animals</b> typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day.

50|$|The golden-rumped {{elephant}} shrew is a <b>diurnal</b> <b>animal,</b> which {{lives in}} densely vegetated forests, avoiding clear and open areas {{to help protect}} themselves from predators. Golden-rumped elephant shrews build up to 6 nests at a time, alternating nests every night to leave no pattern for hunting predators to follow. It inhabits coastal regions and is found in moist, dense-brush forests and lowland semi-deciduous forests. Males have slightly larger home areas than females, {{and are more likely}} to trespass into neighboring territories, which makes them more vulnerable to predators.|$|E
50|$|In the cool-temperate {{parts of}} its range, the common kestrel migrates south in winter; {{otherwise}} it is sedentary, though juveniles may wander around {{in search for}} {{a good place to}} settle down as they become mature. It is a <b>diurnal</b> <b>animal</b> of the lowlands and prefers open habitat such as fields, heaths, shrubland and marshland.

It will thrive in treeless steppe where there are abundant herbaceous plants and shrubs to support a population of prey animals. The common kestrel readily adapts to human settlement, as long as sufficient swathes of vegetation are available, and may even be found in wetlands, moorlands and arid savanna. It is found from the sea to the lower mountain ranges, reaching up to 4500 m ASL in the hottest tropical parts of its range but only to about 1750 m in the subtropical climate of the Himalayan foothills.|$|E

40|$|Chronic high {{caloric intake}} (HCI) {{is a risk}} factor for {{multiple}} major human disorders, from diabetes to neurodegeneration. Mounting evidence suggests a significant contribution of circadian misalignment and sleep alterations to this phenomenon. An inverse temporal relationship between sleep, activity, food intake, and clock mechanisms in nocturnal and diurnal animals suggests that a search for effective therapeutic approaches can benefit from the use of <b>diurnal</b> <b>animal</b> models. Here, we show that, similar to normal aging, HCI leads to the reduction in daily amplitude of expression for core clock genes, a decline in sleep duration, an increase in scoliosis, and anxiety-like behavior. A remarkable decline in adult neurogenesis in 1 -year old HCI animals, amounting to only 21 % of that in age-matched Control, exceeds age-dependent decline observed in normal 3 -year old zebrafish. This is associated with misalignment or reduced amplitude of daily patterns for principal cell cycle regulators, cyclins A and B, and p 20, in brain tissue. Together, these data establish HCI in zebrafish as a model for metabolically induced premature aging of sleep, circadian functions, and adult neurogenesis, allowing for a high throughput approach to mechanistic studies and drug trials in a diurnal vertebrate...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the inverse}} {{temporal}} relationship of central clock activity to physiological or behavioral outputs in diurnal and nocturnal species, understanding the mechanisms and physiological consequences of circadian disorders in humans would benefit from studies in a <b>diurnal</b> <b>animal</b> model, phylogenetically close to humans. Here we report {{the discovery of the}} first intrinsic circadian disorder in a family of diurnal non-human primates, the rhesus monkey. The disorder is characterized by a combination of delayed sleep phase, relative to light-dark cycle, mutual desynchrony of intrinsic rhythms of activity, food intake and cognitive performance, enhanced nighttime feeding or, in the extreme case, intrinsic asynchrony. The phenotype is associated with normal length of intrinsic circadian period and requires an intact central clock, as demonstrated by an SCN lesion. Entrainment to different photoperiods or melatonin administration does not eliminate internal desynchrony, though melatonin can temporarily reinstate intrinsic activity rhythms in the animal with intrinsic asynchrony. Entrainment to restricted feeding is highly effective in animals with intrinsic or SCN lesion-induced asynchrony. The large isolated family of rhesus macaques harboring the disorder provides a powerful new tool for translational research of regulatory circuit...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} my work are damages on {{agricultural}} land caused by wild boars, reducing game damages, ensuring the standardized state by appropriate hunting and by prevention of the outbreak of swine fever. Today´s agriculture intensively uses oilseed and corn in crop production and in last twenty years the size of sowing plots has expanded several times. Due to these conditions, wild boars are present mainly in these areas, where they can find food and shelter, especially in the period from June to October. This {{is supported by the}} fact that in this period the season of mushroom and berry pickers begins and wild boars are disturbed. The care of gamekeepers, who try to attract wild boars from fields and to prevent damage on agricultural land, is devaluated by this. When wild boars are disturbed, they do not like to return to the wood. In the wood they have less and less quiet also because of their mating and expanding. That is why the wild boars have changed from a <b>diurnal</b> <b>animal</b> to a nocturnal animal, living mainly in the fields of oilseed, corn and cereals...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCone photoreceptors are {{required}} for color vision and high acuity vision, and they die {{in a variety of}} retinal degenerations, leading to irreversible vision loss and reduced quality of life. To date, there are no approved therapies that promote the health and survival of cones. The development of novel treatments targeting cones has been challenging and impeded, in part, by the limitations inherent in using common rodent model organisms, which are nocturnal and rod-dominant, to study cone biology. The African Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis ansor-gei), a <b>diurnal</b> <b>animal</b> whose photoreceptor population is more than 30 % cones, offers significant potential as a model organism for the study of cone development, biology, and degeneration. However, a significant limitation in using the A. ansorgei retina for molecular studies is that A. ansorgei does not have a sequenced genome or transcriptome. Here we present the first de novo assembled and functionally annotated transcriptome for A. ansor-gei. We performed RNA sequencing for A. ansorgei whole retina to a depth of 321 million pairs of reads and assembled 400, 584 Trinity transcripts. Transcriptome-wide analyses and annotations suggest that our data set confers nearly full length coverage for the majority of retinal transcripts. Our high quality annotated transcriptome is publicly available, and we hope it will facilitate wider usage of A. ansorgei as a model organism for molecular studies of cone biology and retinal degeneration...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration in organotypic cultures of adult porcine retina. Our hypothesis was that the photoreceptors accumulate opsins, which, together with exposure to cyclic dim light illumination, induce autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) to overcome damaging protein overload. For this purpose, retinas were cultured for 48 h and 72 h during which they were illuminated with dim light for 8 h/day; specimens were analyzed by means of immunohistochemistry, Western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transmission electron microscopy. ER-stress and photoreceptor degeneration was observed in conventionally cultured retinas. The additional stress in the form of dim light illumination for 8 h/day resulted in increased levels of the ER-stress markers GRP 78 /BiP and CHOP, as well as increased level of active caspase- 12. Increased autophagic processes in cone and rod photoreceptors were detected by LC 3 B-II increases and occurrence of autophagosomes at the ultrastructural level. Illumination also resulted in altered protein expression for autophagy inducers such as p 62 and Beclin- 1. Moreover, there was a decrease in phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which further indicate an increase of autophagy. Rod and cone photoreceptors in retinas from a <b>diurnal</b> <b>animal</b> that were exposed to dim light illumination in vitro displayed autophagy and ER-stress processes. As no alteration of rhodopsin mRNA was observed, autophagy and ER-stress are suggested to decrease rhodopsin protein at the posttranscriptional level...|$|E
