40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{stability}} of the body sway among three feedback conditions. Feed(X, Y) was feedback condition that presented Xand Y-component of sway on a <b>X-Y</b> <b>recorder.</b> Feed(X, Y= 0) was feedback condition that presented X-component on the <b>X-Y</b> <b>recorder.</b> Feed(X= 0, Y) was feedback condition that presented Y-component on the <b>X-Y</b> <b>recorder.</b> The indexes were velocity, acceleration, shift length, and area of the sway. The results were as follows: 1. Velocity of X-component; Feed(X= 0, Y) <Feed(X, Y= 0) =Feed(X, Y) Velocity of Y-component; Feed(X, Y= 0) <Feed(X, Y) <Feed(X= 0, Y) 2. Acceleration of X-component; Feed(X= 0, Y) <Feed(X, Y) =Feed(X, Y= 0) Acceleration of Y-component; Feed(X, Y= 0) <Feed(X, Y) <Feed(X= 0, Y) 3. Shift length of X-component; Feed(X= 0, Y) <Feed(X, Y= 0) =Feed(X, Y) Shift length of Y-component; Feed(X, Y= 0) <Feed(X= 0, Y) =Feed(X, Y) 4. Area; Feed(X, Y) =Feed(X=O, Y) =Feed(X, Y=O) These results suggested that when the subjects controlled their posture by the feedback information used in this study, the body sway became more stable as nonpresented component...|$|R

Aqueous electrolyte solutions were prepared from the distilled water. The PPTA films were electrodeposited using the method described by Yamasaki et al. 3 A conventional three-electrode system was employed for the oxidative electropolymerization of metanilic acid and electrochemi-cal measurements. The test electrode on which the PPTA film was electrodeposited was a transparent indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass plate 0. 8 cm wide and 5 cm long.

40|$|The suprathreshold {{acoustic}} reflex responses of forty two ears affected by {{sensorineural hearing loss}} of cochlear origin and fifty-eight ears demonstrating normal hearing, were recorded {{by means of an}} electro-acoustic impedance meter and attached <b>X-Y</b> <b>recorder.</b> The recordings were done in ascending and descending fashion,  at successively increasing and decreasing 5 dB intensity levels from 90 - 120 - 90 dB HL respectively, for the individual pure-tone frequencies of 500, 1 000, 2 000 and 4 000 Hz. The contralateral mode of measurement was employed. Analysis of  these recordings indicated that the {{acoustic reflex}}  responses could be differentiated into five  characteristic patterns of  growth, which could be depicted upon a continuum of peaked, peaked-rounded, rounded, rounded-flat,  and flat  shapes. The peaked and peaked-rounded patterns were found  to predominate at all four pure-tone frequencies  in the normal ears, while the rounded-fiat  and flat  patterns were found  to predominate only at the higher pure-tone frequencies of 2 000 and 4 000 Hz in the ears affected  by sensorineural hearing loss. This latter relationship was also able to be applied to two disorders of  the loudness functio— loudness recruitment and hyperacusis.

40|$|The static {{coefficient}} of friction between contacting surfaces of a plurality of bodies is determined by applying a load to the bodies in a direction normal to the contacting surfaces. Opposite ends of a flexible filament are connected to a load cell and {{the first of the}} bodies. A motor continuously moves the second of the bodies away from the load cell at constant velocity at right angles to the force of the normal load so that the first body moves intermittently relative to the second body across a contact surface between them. The load on the surfaces, the nature of the surfaces, and the speed of the first body relative to the load cell are such that the filament is alternately and cyclically tensioned and relaxed as the movement occurs. The maximum tension occurs at the incipient stages of movement of the first body relative to the second body. The load cell derives a series of measurements which are coupled to an <b>x-y</b> <b>recorder,</b> from which the maximum forces of the filament are determined to enable the static {{coefficient of}} friction to be determined. From the maximum forces and the normal force, the coefficient is determined.

That was the feedback condition. The number of trials in each condition was twenty-five. The indexes were velocity, acceleration, shift length, and area of the body sway. The results were as follows: (1) The velocity, the acceleration, the shift length, and the area of the body sway had not practice effects under the eyes closed, the eyes open, and the feedback conditions. (2) The velocity, the acceleration, and the shift length of lateral component under the feedback condition were larger than the eyes open condition, but smaller than the eyes closed condition. The velocity and the acceleration of anterior-posterior component under the feedback condition were the smallest of the three conditions. The area of the body sway under the feedback condition was the smallest of the three conditions.

40|$|An {{experimental}} method {{has been developed}} for selective depassivation of small regions on an otherwise passive metal surface with use of focused laser radiation. Techniques for generating bare metal surfaces on passive metals have, to date, included scraping, straining, abrading, shearing, and fracturing (!). Each of these involves uncertainties in the initial active condition of the surface and/or gross mechanical disturbances. With the laser method, these uncertainities still exist but are confined to regions of time and/ or distance which are orders of magnitude smaller than other methods. Because the laser depassivation method allows generation of fresh metal surfaces under controlled and reproducible conditions, it should prove useful in fundamental studies on metal repassivation and localized cor-rosion. Preliminary results on pitting for example ~ are presented below. While the corrosion behavior of laser modified surfaces has received some attention (2), no reports are knownwhich use focused lasers for localized depassivation, although similar applications have been made previously to promote rates of maskless pattern electro-plating (3). APPARATUS A tunable dye laser (Molectron DL-II, Exiton dye type BBQ, 390 nm) was pumped by a pulsed nitrogen laser (Molectron UV- 24) and provided a beam which was focused with an ordinary compound microscope lens (Bausch & Lomb) fitted with a 32 mm objective lens. The working distance between lens and (immersed) specimen was about 4 cm.
