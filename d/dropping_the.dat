5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved <b>dropping</b> <b>the</b> ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of an oil drop from a single capillary in a continuous phase flowing perpendicular to the capillary opening has been studied numerically. The shear stress at the interface of <b>the</b> forming <b>drop,</b> <b>the</b> angular velocity inside <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> and <b>the</b> pressure field around <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> have been determined in {{a cross section of}} <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> formation area. <b>The</b> results show a maximum pressure in the continuous phase near the stagnation point and a maximum shear stress in both phases nearer the top of <b>the</b> forming <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> lowest pressures were found behind the top of <b>the</b> <b>drop,</b> where <b>the</b> surrounding flow starts to separate from the interface of <b>the</b> <b>drop.</b> <b>The</b> shear stress outside <b>the</b> <b>drop</b> causes a drag which, together with the drag originated from the pressure field around <b>the</b> <b>drop,</b> promotes drop detachment...|$|R

5|$|Although the GWR {{agreed to}} {{contribute}} £175,000 {{and a similar}} sum was promised by the GNR, sufficient funds to make a start on construction had not been raised {{by the end of}} 1857. Costs were reduced by cutting back part of the route at the western end so that it did not connect directly to the GWR station, and by <b>dropping</b> <b>the</b> line south of Farringdon. In 1858, Pearson arranged a deal between the Met and the City of London Corporation whereby the Met bought land it needed around the new Farringdon Road from the City for £179,000 and the City purchased £200,000 worth of shares. The route changes were approved by Parliament in August 1859, meaning that the Met finally had the funding to match its obligations and construction could begin.|$|E

When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was thrown out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation.

5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford <b>dropping</b> <b>the</b> more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
