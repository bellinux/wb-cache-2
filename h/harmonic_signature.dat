50|$|Based on the {{technical}} practice {{it is known that}} a cavity implosion inside liquid generates high temperatures of thousands of kelvins and even a shock wave. There are found many intersecting systems of white lamellae inside quartz at many localities from the Bohemian Massif. It can be assumed that according to high number of wavefronts transferred through the minerals and resulting high number of cavity implosions, the structure of quartz was partially disrupted during the fluidization and the distribution of prevailing pressure was respected during the transfer into a solid state. There could be then preferred a creation of denser quartz in the area of higher pressure. This means a creation of smaller basic molecular Si-O rings. The situation in the area of lower pressure could be opposite. A finding of such <b>harmonic</b> <b>signature</b> of the quartz density is considered to be an option for the hypothesis verification.|$|E

Directional wavelets, when convolved with signals on the sphere, can separate the anisotropic filamentary structures which are characteristic of both the CMB and foregrounds. Extending previous component separation methods, which use the frequency, spatial and <b>harmonic</b> <b>signatures</b> of foregrounds to separate them from the cosmological background signal, SILC can additionally use morphological information in the foregrounds and CMB to better localise the cleaning algorithm. We test the method on Planck data and simulations, demonstrating consistency with existing component separation algorithms, and discuss how to optimise the use of morphological information by varying the number of directional wavelets {{as a function of}} spatial scale. We find that combining the use of directional and axisymmetric wavelets depending on scale could yield higher quality CMB temperature maps.

40|$|In this work, {{the fully}} cavitated or bubble regime of Laser Wakefield Acceleration was exper-imentally studied. It {{provides}} acceleration fields {{in excess of}} 100 GeV/m while also generating uniform electric field gradients. This allows {{for the production of}} high-energy electron beams with moderate energy spread and femtosecond bunch lengths. Although quasi-monoenergetic beams have been observed in experiments, it remains unproven that these beams were generated in this fully cavitated acceleration structure. In addition, these high-energy electron beams should have temporal structures on the order of tens of femtoseconds. However, current detection techniques are still limited to the measurement of features no less than ∼ 100 fs. A unique second harmonic radiation signature was first observed in this investigation, confirming the existence of the bubble regime. This second harmonic was generated by the interaction of the bubble’s high-density electron sheath with a strong laser field.

40|$|GPS draconitic signal (351. 6 ± 0. 2 days) and its higher {{harmonics}} {{are observed}} at almost all IGS {{products such as}} position time series of IGS permanent stations. Orbital error and multipath are known as two possible sources of these signals. The effect of Earth shadow crossing of GPS satellites is another suspect for this signal. Up to {{now there is no}} serious attempt to investigate this dependence. AMATLAB toolbox is developed and used to determine the satellites located at the earth shadow. RINEX observation files and precise ephemeris are imported to the toolbox and a cylindrical model is used to detect the shadow regions. Data of these satellites were removed from the RINEX observation files of three IGS permanent stations (GRAZ,ONSAandWSRT) and new RINEX observation fileswere created. The time span of these data is about 11 years. The new and original fileswere then processed using precise point positioning (PPP) method to determine position time series, for further analysis. Both the original and new time series were analyzed using the least squares harmonic estimation (LS-HE) in the following steps. The 1 st step is the validation of the draconitic <b>harmonics</b> <b>signature</b> in the original position time series of the three stations. The 2 nd step does the same for the new time series. It confirms that the power spectrum at the draconitic signals decreases to some extent for the new time series. The difference between the original and new time series (difference between all three position quantity (X, Y and Z)) is then analyzed in the 3 rd step. Signature of the draconitic harmonics is also observed to the differences. The results represent that all eight harmonics of GPS draconitic period do exist at the residuals and mainly they decrease. All of the three stations were then processed together using the multivariate LS-HE method. At the 4 th step, the difference of the spectral values between the original time series and new times serieswere analyzed. Decreasing of the spectral values at most harmonics (e. g. 1 st, 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th, 7 th and 8 th) represents the effect of removing satellite observations at shadow of the earth on draconitic harmonics. At least, five harmonics among seven shows the amelioration of results (draconitic error reduction) after removing the earth shadowed data from RINEX raw data. The results show that the draconitic year’s component of data is in part due to eclipsing satellites...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Cluster {{multi-point}} mission {{offers a}} unique collection of non-thermal continuum (NTC) radio waves {{observed in the}} 2 - 80 kHz frequency range over almost 15 years, from various view points over the radiating plasmasphere. Here we present rather infrequent case events, such as when primary electrostatic sources of such waves are embedded within the plasmapause boundary far from the magnetic equatorial plane. The spectral signature of the emitted electromagnetic waves is structured {{as a series of}} wide harmonic bands within the range covered by the step in plasma frequency encountered at the boundary. Developing the concept that the frequency distance df between harmonic bands measures the magnetic field magnitude B at the source (df = F ce, electron gyrofrequency), we analyse three selected events. The first one (studied in Grimald et al., 2008) presents electric field signatures observed by a Cluster constellation of small size (~ 200 to 1000 km spacecraft separation) placed in the vicinity of sources. The electric field frequency spectra display frequency peaks placed at frequencies fs = n df (n being an integer), with df of the order of F ce values encountered at the plasmapause by the spacecraft. The second event, taken from the Cluster tilt campaign, leads to a 3 -D view of NTC waves ray path orientations and to a localization of a global source region at several Earth radii (R E) from Cluster (Décréau et al., 2013). The measured spectra present successive peaks placed at fs ~ (n 1 / 2) df. Next, considering if both situations might be two facets of the same phenomenon, we analyze a third event. The Cluster fleet, configured into a constellation of large size (~ 8000 to 25 000 km spacecraft separation), allows us to observe wide-banded NTC waves at different distances from their sources. Two new findings can be derived from our analysis. First, we point out that {{a large portion of the}} plasmasphere boundary layer, covering a large range of magnetic latitudes, is radiating radio waves. The radio waves are issued from multiple sources of small size, each related to a given fs series and radiating inside a beam of narrow cone angle, referred to as a beamlet. The beamlets illuminate different satellites simultaneously, at different characteristic fs values, according to the latitude at which the satellite is placed. Second, when an observing satellite moves away from its assumed source region (the plasmapause surface), it is illuminated by several beamlets, issued from nearby sources with characteristic fs values close to each other. The addition of radio waves blurs the spectra of the overall received electric field. It can move the signal peaks such that their position fs satisfiesfs = (n alpha) df, with 0 < alpha < 1. These findings open new perspectives for the interpretation of NTC events displaying <b>harmonic</b> <b>signatures...</b>|$|R

We have analyzed the amplitude of key harmonics of the Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) recorded while participants observed orientation-based texture and contour stimuli, forming coherent global patterns, alternating with visual patterns in which the same number of local elements were randomly oriented in order to loose any globally organized feature. Comparing the results of the clinical sample with those obtained in an age-matched control group, we have observed that in the texture conditions the 1 st and 3 rd <b>harmonics,</b> containing <b>signature</b> of global form processing (Norcia, Pei, Bonneh, Hou, Sampath, & Pettet, 2005), were present in the control group, while in the experimental group only the 1 st harmonic was present. In the Contour condition the 1 st harmonic was not present for both groups while the 3 rd harmonic was significantly present in the control group but absent in the group with autism. Moreover, the amount of organization required to elicit significant 1 st harmonic response in the texture condition was higher in the clinical group. The present results bring additional support to the idea that texture and contour processing are supported by independent mechanisms in normal vision. Autistic vision would thus be characterized by a preserved, perhaps weaker texture mechanism, possibly mediated by feedback interactions between visual areas, and by a disfunction of the mechanism supporting contour processing, possibly mediated by long-range intra-cortical connections. Within this framework, the residual ability to detect contours shown in psychophysical studies could be due to the contribution of the texture mechanism to contour processing...|$|R

Currently {{it is not possible}} to unambiguously differentiate the large number of proposed models to explain these phenomena through existing observations. Aims. We investigate the observable predictions of a simple model that generates flux modulation: a spiral instability rotating in a thin accretion disk. This model is motivated by the accretion ejection instability (AEI) model for low- frequency QPOs (LFQPOs). We are particularly interested in the inclination dependence of the observables that are associated with this model. Methods. We develop a simple analytical model of an accretion disk, which features a spiral instability. The disk is assumed to emit blackbody radiation, which is ray-traced to a distant observer. We compute pulse profiles and power spectra as observed from infinity. Results. We show that the amplitude of the modulation associated with the spiral rotation is a strong function of inclination and frequency. The pulse profile is quasi-sinusoidal only at low inclination (face-on source). As a consequence, a higher-inclination geometry leads to a stronger and more diverse <b>harmonic</b> <b>signature</b> in the power spectrum. Conclusions. We present how the amplitude depends on the inclination when the flux modulation comes from a spiral in the disk.
