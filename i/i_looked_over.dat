500|$|Then, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> and {{saw this}} {{man on the}} extreme right aisle sort of {{galloping}} to the podium. He was tall, he was thin, {{and the way he}} was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium. ... He got to the podiumâ€”and I sat up straight. I was impressed with him.|$|E
2500|$|..... <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> ... and Martin {{was very}} quietly {{sitting in the}} chair, and a tear ran down his cheek. [...] It was a victory like none other. It was an {{affirmation}} of the movement.|$|E
2500|$|... or {{the life}} of me, I could not run to get it. It seemed like an age before I could get the ball {{in my hands and}} then, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> to first, it seemed like the longest throw I ever had to make. The first baseman was the tallest in the league, but I threw the ball far over his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{be ready}} presently. <b>I</b> am just <b>looking</b> round to decide on what to take. Be seated, please, while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> this pile of sketches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{read the}} leading articles, Joe, {{and the foreign}} intelligence, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the market prices. In short, I read just what gentlemen read." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{must have}} threescore cattle killed,' said she, 'and cut up into quarters, {{and every time}} <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} he must throw one of them into my mouth.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, Wrangler met singer Margaret Whiting. She was 22 {{years his}} senior. They {{met in a}} nightclub, and Wrangler later recalled: [...] "I was with my manager when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> at Margaret, who was {{surrounded}} by five guys in a booth. There she was with the hair, the furs and the big gestures. I thought, 'Boy, now that's New York! That's glamour!' I had to meet her." [...] Their romance began a few weeks later.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 Massow {{developed}} an aneurysm and became seriously ill. He required urgent hospital treatment, including {{at one point}} having to be operated on without anaesthetic, which saved his life. Massow subsequently described the experience as uplifting, stating that [...] "The prospect of dying wasn't frightening, as I'd thought, but calm and full of relief. And instead of thinking about a tomorrow that wouldn't come, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> my past 'life' and was actually quite proud and happy I'd acquitted myself OK. There {{was nothing to be}} ashamed of." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{because you}} only thought he meant mischief, you must {{straightway}} proceed to do mischief. That's poor logic. But think over what I {{have told you}} now, while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> these papers." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{in hopes}} that this volume might have gone its way without preface; but as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the sheets, <b>I</b> find in them various fallings short of old {{purposes}} which require a word of explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think that}} Wilberforce's report {{shows that they}} have a right to that title now. Take a seat, Mr. O' Connor, and a newspaper--there are some that arrived two days ago--while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> your report." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{exercise}} in the usual form, and marked six faults.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder. Archie's wish {{to get up}} became irresistible, and my {{resolve to}} go on with him {{vanished}} altogether.|$|E
60|$|Julia was {{occupied}} in arranging some music on her piano. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{two or three}} songs; they were Moore's Irish melodies.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> what <b>I</b> have written, I am {{sensible}} it {{is vastly}} {{different from the}} ordinary style of courtship--but I shall make no apology--I know your good nature will excuse what your good sense may see amiss.|$|R
50|$|Daniel, Daniel {{would you}} mind? :If <b>I</b> <b>look</b> it <b>over.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, I declare!' said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} as I rowed, 'there is his head upon {{the crest of}} a wave. Easy, or we shall be over him! Two more strokes and be ready to seize him! Keep up, friend! There's help at hand!' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{may have}} tumbled down-stairs in the dark, {{but he never}} walked down or ran down. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the banisters, and I was alone with the thunder.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{the side}} of the ship at the dark-blue water. Oh, how I longed to plunge into it and be {{released}} for ever from this abiding nightmare! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at the yellow paper and the faded script. At the head was written: [...] "Baskerville Hall," [...] and below in large, scrawling figures: [...] "1742." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Charley," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> {{a copy of}} {{the letter}} O in which it was {{represented}} as square, triangular, pear-shaped, and collapsed in all kinds of ways, [...] "we are improving. If we only get to make it round, we shall be perfect, Charley." ...|$|R
60|$|Trick. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> all <b>over</b> it; I'm {{sure he is}} not there.--Come away, dear.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Among {{the persons}} who are {{attracted}} {{to me in my}} rising fame and fortune,' said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> my letters, 'and who discover that they were always much attached to me, is the self-same Creakle. He is not a schoolmaster now, Traddles. He is retired. He is a Middlesex Magistrate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad conscience," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "I've been {{where you}} have been--Miss Grimes. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the edge and I jumped. I'd stay where you are, if I were you." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of our arrival {{we were sitting in}} the Colonel's gun-room after dinner, Holmes {{stretched}} upon the sofa, while Hayter and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his little armory of Eastern weapons.|$|E
6000|$|... "And as I stood hearkening, dulcimers, haut-boys, and shawms, And violoncellos, and a three-stringed double-bass, Joined in, {{and were}} intermixed with a singing of psalms; And <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{at the dead}} men's dwelling-place.|$|E
6000|$|And now {{of course}} you are anxious to hear what took place when papa jumped into the landau by the side of poor little mamma, propped up by her pillows. [...] "I am come to your part of the story, my dear," [...] says <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> to my wife as she is plying her needles.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> it <b>over</b> carefully, {{and three}} minutes later walked out with Chris Holtzmann's new address in my pocket.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} {{from the table}} at which I was sitting and I saw him.|$|R
60|$|We {{hastened to}} the gun pointed out, and while I was {{standing}} there waiting for orders, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the side, and, for the first time, {{became aware of the}} cause of these proceedings.|$|E
6000|$|I {{shut the}} door into the inner office and moved up behind him. He made no sign that he saw or heard. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and read, amid half-formed words, sentences, and wild scratches:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was up in}} {{a second}} and shinning down the hill. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still keeping silence, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> out <b>over</b> the sea. I don't know why, {{except that}} <b>I</b> instinctively <b>looked</b> {{anywhere}} rather than look at him.|$|R
60|$|He handed me, apologetically for his scholarship, a {{piece of}} paper, and {{observed}} me while <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> it <b>over.</b> It was quite right.|$|R
6000|$|She laughed. [...] "It is charming," [...] she said, [...] "but {{there are}} so many places where there is just as good a breeze, or perhaps better. How I would like to go to some one of them! To me this island is lonely and doleful. Every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the sea for a ship I hope that one will come that can carry us away." ...|$|R
