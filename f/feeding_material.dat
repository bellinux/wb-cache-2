The aim of the diploma thesis is firstly to inform about availability of ecological <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> for poultry bred in ecological agriculture, also to suggest measures which would lead for ensuring of organic food sufficiency. To accomplish the given aim, the diploma thesis is divided into two main sections. The first section is a literary overview and the second one is a practical section. The literary overview introduces the ecological agriculture in the Czech Republic discussing plant and animal production. In the section concerning plant production is dealt with basic conditions which must be observed to lead to good yield. Animal production focuses on breeding of poultry in ecological agriculture and analyses main specifics of their breeding. The practical part of the diploma thesis was created on the basis of ascertained information from poultry breeders and specialized literature materials. Gained information were evaluated. The result of the practical should be: 1. availability of ecological <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> for poultry bred in ecological agriculture in the Czech Republic 2. suggestion of possible measures leading for ensuring of organic food sufficiency for poultry 3. suggestion of alternatives for shortage <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> in organic food Contribution of the diploma thesis is in findings of necessity of new agricultural areas for ensuring of <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> base for poultry as dynamically developing sector of ecological agriculture...|$|R

The paper discusses {{the way in which the}} Alternate Feed Guidance has been interpreted in the past with respect to processing mixed wastes and the significance of recent changes in NRC's interpretation of the Alternate Feed Guidance that sets the stage for a broader range of mixed waste materials to be processed as alternate <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> The paper also reviews the le gal rationale and policy reasons why materials that would otherwise have to be treated and/or disposed of as mixed waste, at a mixed waste disposal facility, are exempt from RCRA when reprocessed as alternate <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> at a uranium mill and become subject to the sole jurisdiction of NRC, and some of the reasons why processing mixed wastes as alternate <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> at uranium mills is preferable to direct disposal.

40|$|This {{document}} summarizes {{a portion}} of the work performed for the fuel fabrication process development task for the fiscal year 1998 (FY 98) research and development (R and D) activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). It was determined through previous efforts that development work is necessary when new <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> are introduced into an established fabrication process. The FMD Program decided to select a new UO{sub 2 } source in FY 98 for use in fuel fabrication R and D activities. The new source identified was UO{sub 2 } powder derived from the Ammonium Uranyl Carbonate (AUC) process. Fuel fabrication activities to date have used Cameco UO{sub 2 } obtained from Canada. The properties of Cameco UO{sub 2 } differ significantly from those of AUC-derived UO{sub 2 }. Although the AUC-derived UO{sub 2 } material was used previously to fabricate the majority of the European reactor-grade mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, it is important to establish how it will interact with weapons-grade plutonium in terms of fuel fabricability. Furthermore, plutonium <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> can be quite different (from a ceramics perspective) depending on the conversion process and processing parameters, and it is important to quantify the effects these differences may have on the fuel fabrication process. There were two main tasks included in this effort: (1) Develop baseline MOX fuel fabrication processing parameters for the AUC-derived source of UO{sub 2 } <b>feed</b> <b>material,</b> using both surrogate CeO{sub 2 } and prototypic PuO{sub 2 } powders. (2) Fabricate MOX fuel using the baseline fabrication processing parameters, the new source of UO{sub 2 } <b>feed</b> <b>material,</b> and an alternative source of PuO{sub 2 } <b>feed</b> <b>material.</b> The experiments performed and results obtained from these <b>Feed</b> <b>Materials</b> Baseline Development activities are described...|$|R

Higher percentage reductions in CO 2 evolution (94.7  %), OUR (94.9  %) and C/N ratio (60.5  %) were observed in C/N 30 experiment, which showed that total biodegradable ingredients are stabilized. In addition, the degradation became decreased with {{increasing the amount of}} sewage sludge, caused by insufficient free spaces between the substrate mass for feasible microbial activities. Moreover, the decomposition process was analyzed by Monod kinetics which resembles Michaelis–Menten equation, and the following results (i.e., k m =  0.4482 and r m =  114.9425) suggested that the optimal nutrient balance has been occurred in C/N 30 experiment.
