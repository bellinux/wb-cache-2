30|$|ERA {{as defined}} in the European Union (EU) {{legislation}} has to evaluate the 'risks to {{human health and the}} environment, whether direct or indirect, immediate or delayed, which the deliberate release or the placing on the market of GMOs may pose' (<b>EC</b> 2001, <b>Annex</b> II) [2]. In addition, potential cumulative long-term effects have to be analysed. The EU Directive 2001 / 18 (<b>EC</b> 2001, <b>Annex</b> II) [2] further describes the different 'effect categories' to be considered. 'Direct effects' are primary effects on {{human health and the environment}} which are the result of the GMO itself and which do not occur through a causal chain of events. 'Indirect effects' are effects 'occurring through a causal chain of events, through mechanisms such as interactions with other organisms, transfer of genetic material, or changes in use or management of the crop' (<b>EC</b> 2001, <b>Annex</b> II) [2]. 'Immediate effects' refer to effects 'which are observed during the period of the release of the GMO. Immediate effects may be direct or indirect.' 'Delayed effects' are effects 'which may not be observed during the period of the release of the GMO but become apparent as a direct or indirect effect either at a later stage or after termination of the release' [2]. All this should be done on a case-by-case basis, in a stepwise fashion and properly consider uncertainty and knowledge gaps [2, 3]. Last but not least, EU legislation states that 'The precautionary principle has been taken into account in the drafting of this directive and must be taken into account when implementing it' [2, 4]. While these provisions give guidance, a heated debate persists just on how they should be interpreted, and, more importantly, implemented [5]. In our view, the current implementation of ERA falls short of complying with the EU regulations.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a fully {{analytical}} approach is proposed for framed structures with semi-rigid beam-to-column connections. Traditionally, {{the analysis of}} frame structures {{is based on the}} assumption that all connections are either frictionless pinned or fully rigid. Recent limit state specifications permit the concept of semi-rigid connection of the individual frame members in the structural design. In a frame with semi-rigid joints the loading creates both a bending moment and a relative rotation between the connected members. The moment and relative rotation are related acting through a constitutive law, which depends on the joint properties. In this study, a simplified beam-to-column connection is applied which was specified in <b>EC</b> 3 <b>Annex</b> J. Results are presented for non-sway and sway frames under different load conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the draft handbook {{for the analysis}} of seismic actions for Malaysia which serves as the commentary for the debut <b>EC</b> 8 National <b>Annex</b> and makes seismic design more user-friendly for practitioners. For loading specification, comprehensive spectral shape tables are presented according to the location of Malaysia (Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak) for different ground conditions and the site natural period is taken as the controlling parameter. Example is given to guide designers on the method of calculating site natural period from boreholes record, particularly for flexible soil site. A quasi-static method of analysis which circumvents issues generated by uncertainties in the natural period properties of real building structures is introduced along with examples. The handbook is foreseen to be an extremely useful document for engineers in low to moderate seismicity region especially for countries like Malaysia which did not consider seismic action in the past...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a genetic}} {{algorithm}} is proposed for discrete minimal weight design of steel planar frames with semi-rigid beam-tocolumn connections. The frame elements are constructed from a predetermined range of section profiles. Conventionally, the analysis of frame structures {{is based on the}} assumption that all connections are either frictionless pinned or fully rigid. Recent limit state specifications permit the concept of semi-rigid connection of the individual frame members in the structural design. In a frame with semi-rigid joints the loading will create both a bending moment and a relative rotation between the connected members. The moment and relative rotation are related through a constitutive law which depends on the joint properties. The effect, at the global analysis stage, of having semi-rigid joints instead of rigid or pinned joints will be to modify not only the displacements but also the distribution of the internal forces in the structure. In this study, a simplified beam-to-column connection is presented which was specified in <b>EC</b> 3 <b>Annex</b> J. In order to capture the changes in the nodal force and moment distribution in terms of joint flexibility, the ANSYS finite element analysis is applied. The structural model is formulated as a combination of 3 D quadratic beam elements and linear torsional springs. Present work deals with the effects of joint flexibility to the optimal design problem. The design variables-including joint properties- are discrete. Results are presented for sway frames under different load conditions. 2. Keywords: discrete optimization, frames, semi-rigid, genetic algorith...|$|R

40|$|The twin aims of this {{research}} were to improve the presentation of codified design information and to investigate the methods used to calibrate the partial safety factors applied to resistance functions (yR factors) so as to improve both {{the economy and the}} reliability of the predictions. A restructured version of EC 3 (known as F-EC 3) was developed by rearranging the design clauses on the basis of design tasks. This system enables the code to become more user-friendly. Hypertext versions of both EC 3 and F-EC 3 have been created on PC-based Microsoft Windows compatible software. The implications of hypertext on structural codes are investigated. The procedure used for calibrating the yR-factors contained within <b>EC</b> 3 (the <b>Annex</b> Z method) was reviewed and an alternative techniques involving less assumption proposed. A comprehensive set of measurements recording the material strength and the geometric properties of steel were obtained and collated. The large data set (over 7000 tests) was sufficient to evaluate the type of probability distribution characterising the variability of the basic material and geometric properties of structural steel. The resulting data were combined with experimental test results to determine the reliability of plate girder design and restrained beam design. The theoretical shear buckling resistance of plate girders (predicted by the simple post-critical and tension field methods) was compared with experimental test results to determine reliability. The analysis demonstrated that plate girder design falls well short of the target reliability and an adjustment to the design methods is required in order to ensure safe design. A series of 4 -point bending tests on laterally restrained beams were conducted to establish the accuracy of the Mp 1. Rd resistance function. This study quantifies the degree of conversation inherent in the Mp 1. Rd design method and provides convincing evidence of the need to reduce the yR-factor applied to this resistance function. A modification is proposed to the design formulae which improves accuracy and permits the full moment capacity of restrained beams to be utilised...|$|R
