5|$|Fire control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Invincibles during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director <b>firing</b> <b>system.</b> This consisted of a fire control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to receive this system during her refit from April to August 1914, but its installation was interrupted by the outbreak of the war and it was not fully working until after the Battle of the Falkland Islands in November. Indomitable and Inflexible didn't receive their systems until May 1916, immediately before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the <b>firing</b> <b>system</b> of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fires forces are locked in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished are standing on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return to the Spirit of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E

50|$|A Direct <b>Fire</b> <b>System</b> {{refers to}} the instrumentalities {{required}} for a land or vehicle based missile to strike a satellite. A Direct <b>Fire</b> <b>System</b> is a kinetic kill system designed to physically destroy or damage a satellite, instead of electronically disrupting its orbit or mission. The PRC demonstrated its ability to launch a land-based kinetic kill vehicle into a satellite when it fired a SC-19 missile into an aging Fengyun series satellite and destroyed it on January 11, 2007.No known tests of a vehicle-based Direct <b>Fire</b> <b>System</b> have occurred, {{but it has been}} reported that the new Jin-class submarine will have the ability to launch the SC-19 or a similar type of missile.|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of semi-automatic (or autoloading) firearms is usually {{what is known}} as a closed-bolt <b>firing</b> <b>system.</b> In a closed-bolt system, a round must first be chambered manually before the weapon can fire. When the trigger is pulled, only the hammer and firing pin move, striking and firing the cartridge. The bolt then recoils far enough rearward to extract and load a new cartridge from the magazine into the firearm's chamber, ready to fire again once the trigger is pulled.|$|E
25|$|Man-portable {{anti-tank}} systems (MANPATS or MPATS) are shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets. They {{are typically}} unguided weapons {{and are a}} threat to armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft (especially helicopters), and field fortifications. Generally MANPATS fall into three distinct categories. The first consist of a small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high explosive anti-tank warhead operated by a single soldier. The second is a <b>firing</b> <b>system</b> onto /into which a rocket is loaded, operated by a single soldier. The third are manufactured prepacked and issued as a single unit of ammunition with the launcher discarded after a single use.|$|E
25|$|To be on {{the safe}} side, a pill-activated {{inflation}} device is preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact is the safest option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is more sensitive to the presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro <b>firing</b> <b>system</b> have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis {{about the}} Possibility of usage fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> for extinguishing <b>fires</b> I was mainly {{interested in the}} topic of fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> and their usage {{and also in the}} problematics of fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> installed and used in the SYNTHOS Kralupy a. s., SYNTHOS PBR s. r. o. and TAMERO INVEST s. r. o. (companies) For this purpose, four fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> were chosen based on the used fire extinguishing agent. According to these criteria were chosen water, foam, powder and gas based fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems,</b> which are described in the thesis with regard to their construction, operation and usage. Chosen fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> were further evaluated regarding their capabilities for extinguishing fire. According to the conducted research current options for fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> are used. Even though current options of usage fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> are used it is possible to improve the usage of them by introducing technical and organizational measures. As a crucial technical measure, there is proposed a technical adjustment of the water based fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>system.</b> For improving the usage of this fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>system</b> and increasing the level of fire safety of the guarded object it is proposed to change this non-automatic fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>system</b> to automatic. Other devices are automatic and the proposed improvements do not have such underlying character as it in case of the evaluated water based fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>system.</b> In the theoretical part of the thesis there are described terms like fire, burning and conflagration (fire). There are named conditions and possibilities for the origin of fire and its spreading and is described the spreading of conflagration in time and space. Furthermore, the theoretical part of the thesis is concerned about named fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems.</b> There is the history of their use for fighting fire, the overview of fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> based on the used agent and the description on the different kinds of fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems</b> along with the description of the possibilities of their use for fighting fire. In the theoretical part are also mentioned new technologies used in the field of fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems.</b> The conclusion of the thesis is focused on the problematics of operation and operational capability of fixed <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Model 1910 fires from {{a locked}} breech. When fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together. The barrel will stop in a {{rearward}} position. The bolt, unlocking itself, will then continue forward, stripping the chamber and driving the barrel forward again. After this action, a wedge will {{rise from the}} frame and lock the entire frame back into position. This <b>firing</b> <b>system</b> wasn't strong and had to fire cartridges weaker than the comparable 9×19 Parabellum caliber. The screw {{at the front of}} the frame, when undone will allow the removal of a plate on the left side of the pistol granting access to the moving parts within the pistol. This design was not stiff enough to sufficiently support the left side of the barrel extension and after prolonged firing, the left plate was prone to loosening. The only safety on the pistol was a small lever set in front of the grip.|$|E
25|$|The Messerschmitt Bf 110 was {{the most}} {{successful}} night fighter that served in the Luftwaffe. Among the most notable night fighter aces were Helmut Lent, who shot down 110 enemy aircraft and Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer, who shot down 121 enemy aircraft. Lent mostly flew in the Bf 110 (and variants of the Ju 88), while Schnaufer flew the Bf 110 exclusively. The Bf 110's main strength was its ability to carry heavy armament in its nose section. The later G series was fitted with 20mm MG FF/M cannons and sometimes with two 30mm MK 108 cannons. Starting in Mid'1944 the Bf 110 G-4 night fighters entered serial production with two MG FF/M as the Schräge Musik 'off-bore gun' (upward <b>firing)</b> <b>system</b> for attacking Allied bombers from underneath with several units field modifying their Bf 110 with this system some time earlier. The Schräge Musik cannons were typically mounted in the rearmost glazed area of the cockpit in the Bf 110 or in the fuselage behind the cockpit on other machines. Several Dornier Do 217, Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 219 carried similar installations. To compound the British night bomber problems the Avro Lancaster, Handley Page Halifax and Short Stirling did not carry ventral ball turrets under their fuselage, making them vulnerable {{to this kind of}} attack.|$|E
