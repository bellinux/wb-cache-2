I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
