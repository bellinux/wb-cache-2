40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} analyse family {{businesses}} in rural areas, family business strategies and re-registration of sole proprietors with the Centre of Registers and Information Systems (hereinafter Commercial Register) in 2009, {{and to provide}} an overview of entrepreneurship policies targeted at <b>Estonian</b> <b>rural</b> businesses. Layoffs have increased the number of unemployed; some of those who have lost employment opt for social assistance benefits, but some others decide to become entrepreneurs. Many enterprising people in Estonia have set up a family enterprise, mainly in the sphere of services, agriculture and tourism. The Estonian entrepreneurship policy supports enterprising people and approves of entrepreneurship as a promoter of national economic development. One of the most positive qualities of family enterprises is their short decision-making chain, which ensures rapid implementation of the strategy...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} or aim of {{this thesis}} is to attempt to examine the possibilities of a <b>rural</b> credit <b>union</b> to provide at least a partial answer {{to the problem of}} fulfilling the short-term credit needs of farm people. To do this, it is necessary first to devote some time to an examination of the various sources of short-term credit which are presently serving in the agricultural field {{in order to understand the}} relative importance of short-term credit to the rural people. A basic understanding of the credit union operations appears to the writer to be essential in evaluating the services performed by these institutions Along these same lines, an investigation into the background of <b>rural</b> credit <b>union</b> development may be of benefit in attempting to determine the apparent soundness and workability of the whole idea. A study of the sources of existing short-term credit and credit union operations and their historical background appears to be important in evaluating the experience of some particular area wherein <b>rural</b> credit <b>union</b> development has been carried on to some extent. Lastly, some principles of guides must be derived from the other phases of this study to determine the feasibility of adapting <b>rural</b> credit <b>unions</b> in some other area such as Nebraska. The credit union idea envelops one of the most important democratic principles of cooperation and self-help. An effort will be made to explore the extent to which <b>rural</b> credit <b>unions</b> actually develop these principles. It was the goal of the writer to explore the role of credit unions in providing some of the short-term and intermediate credit in agriculture. Whereas it is true that several of the credit sources have great possibilities for expansion in supplying the needed capital required for successful farming operations, the major emphasis will be placed on <b>rural</b> credit <b>unions.</b> Advisor: Kris Kristjanso...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze {{socio-economic}} goals of the administrative-territorial reform in Estonia. An administrative-territorial reform has been a top issue since in Estonia regained its independence but there are virtually no results. In 1995, a law was passed granting the Government the right to take decisions on the country’s administrative-territorial division. Both the local authorities and the central government can initiate changes in the administrative-territorial division. By the spring of 2012, there were 226 local governments in Estonia, including 193 rural municipalities and 33 cities. The administrative-territorial organisation of Estonia needs changes. The average population of <b>Estonian</b> <b>rural</b> municipalities is less than 2, 500 people and, in spite of mergers, there are still inexpedient units where the centrally located settlement is separated from its hinterland in administrative terms. However, one should be objective when preparing and implementing the administrative-territorial reform. The often expressed opinion that decreasing the number of rural municipalities would result in retrenchment of resources in terms of the number of local officials and administrative costs is misleading...|$|R
