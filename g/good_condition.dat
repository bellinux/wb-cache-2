5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very <b>good</b> <b>condition</b> and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last coastal watchtower {{to be built}} was Sopu Tower, {{which was}} {{constructed}} in Gozo in 1667. The tower had almost collapsed but was rebuilt in the early 2000s {{and it is now}} in <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

5|$|Both {{panel and}} frame are in <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b> That the panel retains its {{original}} frame makes it especially interesting to art historians, {{apart from its}} aesthetic qualities. The canvas has suffered little paint loss, board cracking, or other damage, and has been cleaned several times since it came into the possession of the Groeningemuseum.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 2014, the {{expedition}} announced that on 7 September it had located one of Franklin's two ships. The ship is preserved in very <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> with side-scan sonar picking up even the deck planking. The wreck {{lies at the}} bottom of the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, west of O'Reilly Island. On 1 October at the House of Commons, Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed that the wreck is indeed HMS Erebus.|$|E

5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{public and}} much of the {{military}} command structure were kept in the dark about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command personnel were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was in <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} he died, Vainio had become friends with ice hockey coach Juhani Tamminen and dined with his family.

5|$|There {{are four}} ghost {{stations}} on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations {{in that part}} of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops would improve the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.|$|E
5|$|A 1937 {{survey of}} Kennedy's rebuilt church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{said that it}} was formed from a {{continuous}} nave and chancel, measuring in total 43 by 15feet (13.3 by 4.7m). The church, which was at that time in <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> was entered through a porch on the south side, and there was a vestry on the north side. As well as the font, the church contained some 18th-century memorials. The font is now in the south chapel of St Cybi's Church, Holyhead.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England in the 11th century a motte and bailey castle was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} side of the city, but the Norman rulers continued to use the older burh walls, despite the city having expanded beyond these defences in the north and south-east. During the years of the Anarchy in the 1140s, Worcester was successfully attacked several times; after the war a new city wall was built to improve the city's defences. The new walls, completed by the early 13th century, were constructed of stone and had three main gates. They were maintained in <b>good</b> <b>condition</b> into the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in <b>good</b> <b>condition,</b> or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|At Syracuse, he {{repaired}} {{the city}} walls and the temples of the gods. He had new roads built and pushed to keep roads in <b>good</b> <b>condition.</b> He had planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus and to found a city {{high up in the}} Alps. He planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.|$|E
5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. The city walls were used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were thrown off {{the tops of the}} walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that the city walls were in sufficiently <b>good</b> <b>condition</b> for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire broke out in the city, however, the Danes entered and pillaged Canterbury.|$|E
