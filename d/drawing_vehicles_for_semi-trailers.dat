40|$|OBJECTIVES: This article {{describes}} some innovative approaches to understanding, measuring and attributing value to traditional wisdom in Vanuatu. METHODS: The article uses decolonising methodologies to privilege indigenous perspectives. In particular, the study features {{the use of}} endogenous practices, such as sand <b>drawing,</b> as a <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> facilitating community engagement in the research. RESULTS: The results of the project reveal that, {{in the context of}} broad structural support for customary practices, communities leveraging traditional wisdom into commercial realms are able to generate livelihoods and maintain cultural heritage transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Local communities report increased pride and pleasure in the resurgence and innovation of cultural practices...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) methodology <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> design. At present, many Chinese semi-trailer enterprises have low design level and their products {{often have a}} relatively short life-span. To solve this problem, {{it is necessary to}} integrate intelligent design process into semi-trailer design. Then a rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> based on KBE is put forward. Combining with the UG development tools (KF, UDF, Part Family and Reuse Library), CBR (Case-Based Reasoning), parametric modeling and knowledge integration techniques, the rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> is realized. The system provides appropriate suggestions and supports to promote working efficiency. Besides, it also achieves knowledge reuse and accumulation, improves the design quality and significantly reduces the design cycle...|$|R

40|$|Those of us {{interested}} in articulating spaces where the arts meet research {{find ourselves in}} a healthy discourse on practices and problems in the qualitative genre. What started with Elliot Eisner in the 1990 ’s as educational criticism has multiplied into a garden of diverse theories and methods; blurred genre, arts based research, arts based inquiry, a/r/tography, scholARTistry, arts based educational research, etc. (Cahnmann-Taylor & Siegusmund, 2008). Barone and Eisner (2012) see arts based research as a tool to provoke investigation, re-presentation, and disequilibrium. What is common to most approaches is the idea that the arts can articulate nuances in lived experience over which academic language may stutter. In Picturing Research, editors/authors Linda Theron, Claudia Mitchell, Ann Smith and Jean Stuart fluently illustrate ways in which drawing {{can be used as a}} research tool in a variety of qualitative methods. They focus on studies in which researchers use <b>drawing</b> as <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> participants to generate meaning or dialogue. With diverse backgrounds in education, language and literacy, visual methodology, educational psychology, and feminist literary theory, their approach is distinctively reflexive. In the introduction, the editors outline how they came to be involved with drawing as a visual methodology...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the functions of}} drawing in design and how, based on these functions, a computational sketching environment might support design reasoning. Design, like all problem solving activities, involves reasoning— making decisions, expressing ideas, verifying and evaluating proposals, and ultimately, taking action. For designers, <b>drawing</b> is a <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> design reasoning, and therefore the spontaneous marks made on paper during sketching form a partial record of the designer’s thinking. Most designers sketch early design ideas with a pencil on paper: sketching is still the quickest and most direct means to produce visual representations of ideas. The ambiguity of free hand sketching allows multiple interpretations and thus stimulates the production of more design alternatives. The linked acts of drawing and looking invite designers to recognize new interpretations of the alternatives they propose. By drawing and looking, designers find visual analogies, remember relevant examples, and discover new shapes based on previously unrecognized geometric configurations in their sketches. 1. Thinking with a pencil Visual representations such as freehand sketches and concept diagrams seem to {{play a significant role}} in design problem solving. Design reasoning is accompanied by, and we might say, embedded in, the act of drawing. Sketching on paper and pencil supports ambiguity, imprecision, and incremental formalization of ideas as well as rapid exploration of alternatives...|$|R
