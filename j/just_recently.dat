5|$|The {{population}} segment {{most likely}} to develop lung cancer is people aged over 50 who {{have a history of}} smoking. In contrast to the mortality rate in men, which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality rates have been rising over the last decades, and are <b>just</b> <b>recently</b> beginning to stabilize. In the USA, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 8% in men and 6% in women.|$|E
5|$|In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an {{emissary}} to Norway {{to discuss}} the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched a vicious attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, {{in response to the}} failure of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was {{at the height of his}} power, and his only son had <b>just</b> <b>recently</b> been recognised as heir to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has <b>just</b> <b>recently</b> become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
5|$|Susie {{was created}} for the film by {{director}} and screenwriter Steve Kloves. Although Kloves was interested in casting Pfeiffer in the role from the beginning, Pfeiffer was much more hesitant to commit, citing exhaustion after having <b>just</b> <b>recently</b> completed several films at the time until Kloves ultimately convinced her to accept. Actress Jodie Foster and singer Madonna were also considered for the role, among other candidates. Having not sung on-screen since Grease 2 (1982), Pfeiffer initially had reservations about providing her character's vocals herself but ultimately underwent several months of vocal coaching in preparation to perform the film's musical numbers. Pfeiffer researched professional lounge singers in addition to drawing real-life inspiration from the performances of renowned jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion <b>just</b> <b>recently</b> but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E
