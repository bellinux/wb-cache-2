40|$|Increased salt {{tolerance}} in crop plants provides yield increases in marginal lands and protect plants exposed to transient osmotic stress. The primary characteristics associated with {{salt tolerance}} to date are: (i) NaCl transport, (ii) Na+ distribution and (iii) components at the cellular level. Among these three characteristics, cellular components {{appear to be}} the most amenable to study and manipulation at the present time. Plant tissue culture has been used selectively to isolate salt tolerant cultivars of many plants such as alfalfa, barley, sugarbeet, wheat (Flowers et al. 1977). In Iran, soybean (Glycine max L. (Merill.) is second in importance to sunflower as a oil crop. Besides being an important source of vegetable oil and protein meal, <b>immature</b> <b>bean</b> and pods of soybean can be eaten as a green vegetable, hence it is called green soybean. Soybean seeds contain: 14 - 24 % oil, 37 - 45 % protein and 25 % carbohydrates. One of the main limitation factors to increase cultivation area of this crop in many parts of Iran is soil salinity. Salinity causes to decrease oil production in soybean. The main objective of this report is to study the effect of different concentrations of NaCl on callu...|$|E

A., Barker, R. F., Hall. T. C., and Kemp, J. D. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 3320 - 3324]. Gel retardation and footprinting assays using nuclear extracts from <b>immature</b> <b>bean</b> cotyledons revealed strong binding of nuclear proteins to an upstream region (- 628 to - 682) that contains two inverted A/T-rich motifs. Fusion of a 103 -base pair fragment or a 55 -base pair synthetic oligonucleotide containing these motifs to a minimal 35 S promoter/GUS cassette yielded strong GUS expression in several tissues. A different pattern of GUS expression was obtained in immature embryos and germinating seedlings from the nominally constitutive, full-length, 35 S promoter. Whereas GUS expression {{under the control of}} the 0. 8 -kilobase beta-phaseolin regulatory region is limited to immature embryos, expression from constructs containing the A/T-rich motifs is strongest in roots. These data, combined with S 1 mapping, provide direct evidence that a plant upstream A/T-rich sequence that binds nuclear proteins can activate transcription in vivo. They also indicate that additional regulatory elements in the beta-phaseolin 5 '-flanking region are required for embryo-specific gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Dry Phaseolus {{beans are}} an {{important}} staple Food and <b>immature</b> <b>bean</b> pods are popular as a vegetable. Phaseolus seeds are deficient in the sulfur-containing amino acids {{and the most important}} Phaseolus species, the common bean (P. vulgaris) is susceptible to many pests and diseases, Genetic modification of the crop could contribute to solving some of these problems. However, the recalcitrance of Phaseolus towards in vitro regeneration is a major bottleneck in transgenic plant production, It has been reported that, in an attempt to avoid the use of in vitro regeneration, transgenic plants have been produced through particle bombardment of seedling meristems of P, vulgaris. This approach relies on screening rather than selection for transformed tissues and is therefore inefficient. We anticipate that a regeneration procedure that involves a callus phase is more suitable for obtaining transgenic plants because selection for transformed cells can be more readily achieved in callus than in organized meristems, Regeneration from callus in P. vulgaris is hard to attain but it has been reported for two genotypes that were constructed from a P, vulgaris x P, acutifolius (tepary bean) hybrid, We found that the same mode of regeneration can be obtained {{in a wide range of}} P, acutifolius genotypes. The regeneration system enabled us to produce transgenic plants of a wild genotype of P. acutifolius with Agrobacterium. P, acutifolius can now be used as a 'bridge species' to introgress transgenes into the common bean. Optimized cocultivation and regeneration procedures are now applied to cultivated tepary and common bean genotypes in order to obtain transgenic plants with Agrobacterium...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} major types of organic beans: dry beans, snap beans (also known as green beans), and soybeans. The mature seeds of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{serve as a}} protein source {{in a variety of}} foods worldwide. Dry beans and snap beans are the same species, {{although}} dry beans are distinguished from snap beans (green beans) which are consumed as immature pods. Dry and snap beans also differ from soybeans (Glycine max), in which the seeds are consumed in a variety of processed forms such as tofu, soybean meal, oil, and fermented forms such as miso. Dry beans are divided into classes with a range of seed sizes, colors, and shapes. Examples include black beans, pintos, navy beans, small red beans, and kidney beans. Soybeans are usually divided into two groups, feed-grade and food-grade, with the food-grade including soybeans for processing, [...] "tofu-beans", and edamame, the latter of which is eaten as <b>immature</b> <b>beans.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{maturity}} of green coffee beans {{is the most}} influential determinant of the quality and flavor of the resultant coffee beverage. However, the chemical compounds {{that can be used}} to discriminate the {{maturity of}} the beans remain uncharacterized. We herein analyzed four distinct stages of maturity (immature, semi-mature, mature and overripe) of nine different varieties of green Coffea arabica beans hand-harvested from a single experimental field in Hawaii. After developing a high-throughput experimental system for sample preparation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurement, we applied metabolic profiling, integrated with chemometric techniques, to explore the relationship between the metabolome and maturity of the sample in a non-biased way. For the multivariate statistical analyses, a partial least square (PLS) regression model was successfully created, which allowed us to accurately predict the maturity of the beans based on the metabolomic information. As a result, tryptophan was identified to be the best contributor to the regression model; the relative MS intensity of tryptophan was higher in <b>immature</b> <b>beans</b> than in those after the semi-mature stages in all arabica varieties investigated, demonstrating a universal discrimination factor for diverse arabica beans. Therefore, typtophan, either alone or together with other metabolites, may be utilized for traders as an assessment standard when purchasing qualified trading green arabica bean products. Furthermore, our results suggest that the tryptopha...|$|R
40|$|Tolerance {{to shade}} among mungbean genotypes were {{assessed}} {{based on their}} environmental stress tolerance indices (ITC). Through an approach of direct and indirect relationships between quantitative characters, quantitative characters that play roles in mungbean tolerance to shade was identified. The trial was conducted at Kendalpayak Experimental Farm, Malang. Treatments were without shading and with a 52 % shading using 12 mungbean genotypes representing 9 genotypes tolerant to shading and susceptible genotypes. Under each shaded environment, the treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. Observations were carried out on plant morphology (leaf number, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf hairs number, plant height, stem diameter, age of flowering and harvesting, number of pods, pod dry weight, seed weight and seed size) and leaf anatomy (thickness of leaves, epiderm cells, palisade tissue length, and number of leaf stomates). Mungbean genotypes that were tolerant to shading had different plant morphology and leaf anatomy from those of susceptible genotypes. The tolerant mungbean genotypes had larger leaves, less number of leaf hairs, thicker leaves, thinner leaf epidermal cells, longer palisade tissue, more number of stomates, higher contents of chlorophyll a and b, larger diameter of stem, higher pod dry weight, larger seed size, and higher grain yields {{than those of the}} susceptible genotypes. Three characters of mungbean plants that need {{to be taken into account}} in determining tolerance to shade were the leaf area, number of leaf hairs, and seed weight per plant.

2500|$|The term [...] "green coffee bean" [...] {{refers to}} unroasted mature or <b>immature</b> coffee <b>beans.</b> These have been {{processed}} by wet or dry methods for removing the outer pulp and mucilage {{and have an}} intact wax layer on the outer surface. When immature, they are green. When mature, they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330mg per dried coffee bean. Nonvolatile and volatile compounds in green coffee beans, such as caffeine, deter many insects and animals from eating them. Further, both nonvolatile and volatile compounds contribute to {{the flavor of the}} coffee bean when it is roasted. Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids, trigonelline, proteins, and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action. Since the mid 2000s, green coffee extract has been sold as a nutritional supplement and has been clinically studied for its chlorogenic acid content and for its lipolytic and weight-loss properties.|$|R
40|$|The two {{molecular}} forms, I and II, of [alpha]-galactosidase from immature, mature (resting) and germinated vicia faba seeds {{have been}} studied. The enzymes have been purified by a multistage procedure and, in particular, the effect these stages have upon the relative isoenzyme levels has been investigated. Upon purification in Mcllvaine buffer the relative isoenzym pattern for mature seeds {{was seen to}} change from the low molecular weight enzyme being the major form in the crude extract, through the two molecular forms being almost equal after the citric acid precipitation and ammonium sulphate fractionation, to the high molecular weight enzyme being the major form after the final purification stage of dialysis. A parallel purification carried out in Acetate buffer introduced a time lag between the change in isoenzyme levels found upon acid precipitation in the McIlvaine system. Purification of extracts of whole (testas intact) immature seeds in Mcllvaine buffer showed enzyme to be the dominant form throughout all the purification stages, while beans devoid of testas produced extracts where enzyme j was the greater. Drying the green <b>immature</b> <b>beans</b> {{in the presence of}} testas gave the normal mature bean isoenzyme patterns, while drying in the absence of testas, or where the testa {{has been replaced by a}} non-physiological covering produced extracts where enzyme remained the major isoenzyme throughout all stages of purification. Enzyme was the more abundant isoenzyme in the crude McIlvaine buffer extracts from germinated seeds, with small amounts of enzyme appearing upon purification. A preparation of (X-galactosidase when incubated with a 30 - 65 % ammonium sulphate fraction from green bean testa was observed to convert in vitro to an enzyme with very similar physical properties to enzyme from mature seeds. Some factors affecting this conversion have been investigated and it appears that the active component in the green testa is proteinaceous. The physiological role of CX-galactosidases in seeds has been considered. Attempts were made to modify galactomannans by hydrolysis with CX-galactosidases, so as to produce galactose-depleted products which would form stronger gels with K-carrageenan than would the parent galactomannans. vicia faba enzymes failed to produce any significant hydrolysis whereas coffee and clover enzymes increased the mannose/galactose 6 ratio but also appeared to hydrolyse the mannan backbone so that gel formation was inhibited. This was believed to be due to the presence of contaminating fB-mannanase. Unsuccessful attempts were made to remove this activity from clover enzyme by several purification stages culminating in affinity chromatography. <p...|$|R

The article is published by 	American Society for Horticultural Science and can be found at: [URL] bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) breeding programs are tasked with developing cultivars that meet the standards of the vegetable processing industry and ultimately that of the consumer, all the while matching or exceeding the field performance of existing cultivars. While traditional breeding methods have had a long history of meeting these requirements, genetic marker technology, combined with the knowledge of important quantitative trait loci (QTL), can accelerate breeding efforts. In contrast to dry <b>bean,</b> snap <b>bean</b> <b>immature</b> pods and seeds are consumed as a vegetable. Several pod traits are important in snap bean including: reduced pod wall fiber, absence of pod suture strings, and thickened, succulent pod walls. In addition, snap bean pods are selected for round pod cross section, and pods tend to be longer with cylindrical seed shape. Seed color is an important trait in snap bean, especially those used for processing, as processors prefer white-seeded cultivars. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the genetic control of traits important to snap bean producers and processors. RR 6950, a small seeded brown indeterminate type IIIA dry bean accession, was crossed to the Oregon State University (OSU) breeding line OSU 5446, a type I Blue Lake four-sieve breeding line to produce the RR 138 F₄:₆ recombinant inbred (RI) mapping population. We evaluated the RR 138 RI population for processing and morphological traits, especially those affecting pods. The RR 138 population was genotyped with the BARCBean 6 K_ 3 Beadchip, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to assemble a linkage map, and identify QTL for pod traits.
