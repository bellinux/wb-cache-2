40|$|Abstract: The way rubbish {{is handled}} is often {{restricted}} {{by the development}} level of a country and the urban economy. Before the 1980 's, rubbish was mostly <b>dumped</b> <b>and</b> buried {{on the outskirts of}} cities in China. There was no sanitation control in the municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial site. Since there is neither capping {{on the top of the}} site nor means to prevent the leakage at the base of the <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial site, the rubbish is in contact with the earth's surface and the leachate infiltrates through soil. At present, the Chinese government is constructing modern landfill in accordance with the international standards for sanitation landfill. Municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial sites will be closed and remediated. The geological environment problems of municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial must be studied in order to close and remediate them successfully. The rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial sites and the combined relevant rubbish materials were investigated in China. The impact of leachate from rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial sites on surface water, soil and rock, and groundwater water was analysed, together with gas movement and enrichment in the geological environmental. As a result, the geological environmental problems of municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial were understood. The study provides a basis for municipal rubbish <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> burial site remediation in the cities of China.

In order {{to ensure the safety}} operation of the pipeline, determine the temperature drop <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> pressure was needed at different shutdown is important. This paper builds the heated oil pipeline temperature drop model after shutdown based on the unsteady heat transfer theory <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> model based on fluid transient flow theory. In order to solve the models, MATLAB is adopted a code for the models solving program. VB and MATLAB hybrid programming method which is on the basis of COM technical is utilized to develop a friendly man-machine interface for the heated oil pipeline shutdown <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> simulation software. The practical application shows using of VB and MATLAB hybrid programming method can reduce the work of algorithm developing and enhance the reliability of heated oil pipeline shutdown <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> simulation software...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand the physical processes of shut-in <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> of viscous multiphase flowline. For this purpose, experiments were performed on shut-in <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> processes in the Multiphase Flow Rig at Statoil's research Centre in Porsgrunn. Real crudes were used with oil viscosity up to 30, 000 cP at room temperature. Different physical processes were identified that significantly influence the shut-in <b>and</b> <b>restart.</b> The performance of the numerical tools (OLGA code and CFD) is assessed against the experimental data and theory. The OLGA code is found to predict well the shut-in process, but over-predicts the restart time. © BHR Group 2013...|$|R

We find that 'ecological dumping' describes an ill posed problem: it {{has little to do}} with <b>dumping</b> <b>and</b> need not have any impact on the environment. Looking at the existing literature we find that although 'capital flight' is a misnomer, too, there are real problems dealt with under this heading. Nevertheless, because of their emotive and misleading undertone, we should better give up both notions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. HPC {{systems are}} growing in both {{complexity}} and size, increasing {{the opportunity for}} system failures. Checkpoint <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> techniques are one of many fault tolerance techniques developed for such adverse runtime conditions. Because {{of the variety of}} available approaches for checkpoint <b>and</b> <b>restart,</b> HPC system libraries, such as MPI, seeking to incorporate these techniques would benefit greatly from a portable, extensible checkpoint <b>and</b> <b>restart</b> framework. This paper presents a specification for such a framework in Open MPI that allows for the integration of a variety of checkpoint/restart systems and protocols. The modular design of the framework allows researchers to contribute to specialized areas without requiring knowledge of the entirety of the code base. ...|$|R
