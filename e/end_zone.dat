5|$|In January 2013, {{construction}} {{added another}} 368 {{seats in the}} north endzone and two observation decks. The $11million project also includes a significantly upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed colonnade, and a north <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> concourse that connects the two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157feet of ribbon board will be added on the north <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> more than 160 linear feet {{in the northeast and}} northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal feet in the south <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> over the athletic offices. The construction was completed during the 2013 season. The stadium's capacity is 60,862, making it the third-largest on-campus stadium in Texas.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots also {{employ a}} corps {{known as the}} <b>End</b> <b>Zone</b> Militia. During each game, about ten men dressed as minutemen line the back of each <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> When the Patriots score a touchdown, field goal, point-after-touchdown or safety, the militia behind the {{opposite}} <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> fire a volley of blanks from flintlock muskets. Per {{an interview with the}} Loren & Wally Show on WROR 105.7 FM in and around the time of Super Bowl XLIX, said shots use double the load of black powder than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer Josh Pahigian named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.|$|E

The <b>end</b> <b>zones</b> changed to natural green in 2000 with the {{installation}} of FieldTurf, which lasted until 2009 when they reverted to gold for one season. Purple <b>end</b> <b>zones</b> saw a return prior the 2010 season.

5|$|The kick bounced out {{of bounds}} at the Clemson 44-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense {{returned}} to the field. On the first play, Vick attempted a pass into the <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> The throw was intercepted by Clemson defender Robert Carswell, who downed {{the ball in the}} <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback. The interception was the final play of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech in the lead, 3413.|$|E
2500|$|On {{fields that}} have a {{surrounding}} running track, such as Molson Stadium and many universities, the <b>end</b> <b>zones</b> are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track. Until 1986, the <b>end</b> <b>zones</b> were [...] deep, giving the field an overall length of , and a correspondingly larger cutoff could be required at the corners. This was particularly common among U.S.-based teams during the CFL's American expansion, where few American stadiums were able to accommodate the much longer and noticeably wider CFL field. The <b>end</b> <b>zones</b> in Toronto's BMO Field are only 18 yards instead of 20 yards.|$|R

5|$|The quickest {{score in}} NFL history {{occurred}} on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers scored a safety {{on the opening}} kickoff three seconds into the game. Darius Reynaud of the Titans fielded the kickoff and took a short step backwards (into the south <b>end</b> <b>zone)</b> for what was ruled to be a safety, not a touchback, because the ball {{was not in the}} <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> when it was fielded. The Steelers, however, lost the game 16-9, which was also their first home opener loss since Heinz Field opened.|$|E
5|$|A {{safety is}} scored {{when the ball}} carrier is tackled in his own <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense. In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick {{the ball to the}} scoring team via a free kick.|$|E
5|$|At 10:10 of {{the third}} quarter Roethlisberger {{completed}} a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14–9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison—who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren—snapped the ball out of the <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> to give the Giants a safety and tie the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown—taking a 21–14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.|$|E

5|$|Cincinnati's offense {{took over}} at the spot of the {{interception}} and immediately began moving down the field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first down at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first down at the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in the <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in the <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{received}} {{the ball to}} start {{the third quarter and}} drove down the field on rushing plays by Donald Brown, Jordan Todman and Tyler Lorenzen, before the drive stalled at the Buffalo 36-yard line. UConn punter Desi Cullen's punt was downed at the Buffalo 1-yard line, pinning them against their own <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> The Bulls were unable to move the ball, punting the ball back to UConn after three plays. Starting from their own 44-yard line, the Huskies drove to within the Buffalo 10-yard line; an offside penalty on Buffalo's Jerry Housey gave UConn a 1st-and-goal at the Buffalo 4-yard line. Connecticut used a play-action pass, only their second pass attempt of the game, to fool the Bulls; UConn tight end Steve Brouse was wide open in the <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> catching the ball for the touchdown and giving Connecticut back the lead at 24–20 with 5:22 left in the third quarter.|$|E

5|$|Once again {{facing the}} New England Patriots, the New York Giants headed to Lucas Oil Stadium, home of Eli's brother Peyton's team, the Indianapolis Colts. The Giants {{got off to}} an early lead by an {{intentional}} grounding call on Tom Brady in the <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a safety and retaining the ball {{for most of the}} 1st quarter. However, New England came back and battled to a 10–9 lead. Nearing the end of the 4th quarter with the Giants behind 17–15, Patriots coach Bill Belichick allowed them to score a touchdown with the idea that they would have nearly a minute to drive downfield and score. However, the New York defense held and broke up several Brady pass attempts. A last-second throw into the <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> by the Patriots QB was thwarted and the Giants had won their second Super Bowl 21–17 in four years at New England's expense.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1954, the Sun Bowl did not award most {{valuable}} player honors, but Harold Johnson from Cincinnati was statistically the game's {{most valuable}} player, intercepting two Virginia Tech passes (one in the <b>end</b> <b>zone)</b> and scoring the first touchdown of the game on a 13-yard run.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the {{interception}} in the <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> Alabama's offense {{returned to}} the field at its 20-yard line, the regulation starting point after a ball is downed in the <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> A deep pass by Zow fell incomplete, then Alexander ran for a one-yard gain. On third down, Zow completed a first-down pass to wide receiver Michael Vaughn at the Alabama 32-yard line. Zow then completed another first-down pass, this time to Freddy Milons at Alabama 45-yard line. Alexander rushed ahead for a one-yard gain, then Zow threw an interception to Tech defender Ryan Smith, who returned {{the ball to the}} Alabama 36-yard line. After the interception, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which pushed the Hokies back to their 49-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The Auburn Tigers upset {{expectations}} and tied the Commodores 7–7. Ammie Sikes scored first for Vanderbilt. Auburn scored after a Sikes fumble. The ball was kicked some fifteen yards down field {{clear of the}} melee, picked up by Kirk Newell, and run 55 yards to the <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sooners had {{the ball}} first in overtime, with Adrian Peterson scoring on their first play. Boise State then drove the ball toward the goal line, but faced fourth-and-two from the five yard line. They then sent quarterback Jared Zabransky into motion and snapped to backup wide {{receiver}} Vinny Peretta, who ran an option pass and found Derek Schouman in the <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> The Broncos chose {{to go for the}} two-point conversion and the win instead of kicking for the tie. They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass to the right side and handing the ball behind his back to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered the <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> untouched, giving the Broncos a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing kickoff saw {{yet another}} Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball {{off of the}} kickoff, letting it roll back into the <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> Frey {{recovered}} the loose ball; if he had simply taken a knee, by rule {{it would have been}} a touchback and the Huskies would have gotten the ball at their own 20-yard line. Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|E
