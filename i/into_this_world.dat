5|$|<b>Into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> {{was born}} George Mason, fourth of that name, on December 11, 1725. He {{may have been}} born at his father's {{plantation}} on Dogue's Neck (later Mason Neck), but this is uncertain as his parents also lived on their lands across the Potomac in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Origins {{introduces}} Travis Grady, a trucker with {{a troubled}} past {{who suffers from}} nightmares. Returning characters from the first installment are Alessa Gilespie, a young girl who possesses supernatural powers; licensed practical nurse Lisa Garland, who has a drug addiction and dreams of being an actress instead of a nurse; physician Michael Kaufmann, who supplies Lisa with illegal drugs; and Alessa's mother, Dahlia Gillespie, {{a member of the}} town's cult which plans to bring its malevolent god <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Virginia Dare: The {{daughter}} of Ananias Dare, {{and the first}} English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not disappear in the 1580s; when Steve Rogers went <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> he saved the colony, {{which would have been}} killed by starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E

5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E
25|$|In William Henry Hudson's 1887 romance, A Crystal Age, {{the protagonist}} falls {{down a hill}} into a Utopian, asexual, {{pastoral}} paradise; since he falls <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> it is sometimes classified as a hollow earth story; although, the hero himself, thinks he may have traveled forward in time, by millennia.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} wildly {{speculative}} paranormal explanations {{have been proposed}} to explain the origin of Spring-heeled Jack, including {{that he was an}} extraterrestrial entity with a non-human appearance and features (e.g., retro-reflective red eyes, or phosphorus breath) and a superhuman agility deriving from life on a high-gravity world, with his jumping ability and strange behaviour, and that he was a demon, accidentally or purposefully summoned <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> by practitioners of the occult, or who made himself manifest simply to create spiritual turmoil.|$|E

500|$|Much of Mason's {{efforts in}} 1774 and 1775 was in {{organizing}} a militia {{independent of the}} royal government. Washington by January 1775 was drilling a small force, and he and Mason purchased gunpowder for the company. Mason wrote in favor of annual election of militia officers in words that would later echo in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, [...] "We came equal <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> and equals shall we go out of it.

[...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E
500|$|Cox {{wanted the}} show to {{establish}} itself before opting for an appearance by Aniston. Lawrence stated that it took a considerable length of time to lay on the foundation of Cougar Town; [...] "And once we did and once it was clicking, I think {{that not only did}} Courteney feel comfortable talking to Jen about doing it, but comfortable in how funny she thinks the show is and that Jen would like it and fit <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> really well." [...] He added: [...] "It starts and ends with Courteney and Jennifer being really great friends and excited to work together again—especially doing comedy together.

500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] We really wanted to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> so he's been played his entire life. You really root for him to make the right decision in this one, but you know tragic figure he doesn't.|$|E
2500|$|It is Kitty, Laura's neighbour. Laura is {{panicked and}} excited. She {{wants to see}} Kitty but she is unprepared, looking too much, she believes, like [...] "the woman of sorrows". Kitty is invited in. She fits {{effortlessly}} and confidently <b>into</b> <b>this</b> post-war <b>world</b> of domestication, {{she seems to have}} it all. She notices Laura's amateur efforts at making a cake, just what Laura was dreading. Laura recognises her inability to fit <b>into</b> <b>this</b> domestic <b>world,</b> but also her inability not to care -she is trapped between two worlds. She also recognises, however, that Kitty does not have the perfect world her confidence implies. For example, Kitty has remained barren despite her desire to have children. On the other hand, the one thing Laura seems to be excelling at in the domestic sphere is producing progeny.|$|R

500|$|Helena {{was born}} at Buckingham Palace, the {{official}} royal residence in London, on 25 May 1846, the day after her mother's 27th birthday. She was the third daughter and fifth child of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Albert reported to his brother, Ernest II, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, that Helena [...] "came <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> quite blue, but she is quite well now". He added that the Queen [...] "suffered longer and {{more than the other}} times and she will have to remain very quiet to recover." [...] Albert and Victoria chose the names Helena Augusta Victoria. The German nickname for Helena was Helenchen, later shortened to Lenchen, the name by which {{members of the royal family}} invariably referred to Helena. As the daughter of the sovereign, Helena was styled Her Royal Highness The Princess Helena from birth. Helena was baptised on 25 July 1846 at the private chapel at Buckingham Palace. Her godparents were The Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, her first cousin once-removed by marriage; The Duchess of Orléans (Hélène, for whom The Queen's mother The Duchess of Kent stood proxy); and The Duchess of Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|The news of Ferrier's death {{came as a}} {{considerable}} shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that [...] "no singer {{in this country has}} ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered". Her death, he continued, [...] "quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation" [...] (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she [...] "may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen." [...] Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: [...] "The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order." [...] Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, [...] "have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague." [...] At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: [...] "She seemed to bring <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> a radiance from another world." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E

[...] "Where shall we spend the night?" [...] she asked.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Spin, she revealed that the song is about [...] "going <b>into</b> <b>this</b> masculine <b>world</b> {{that is associated with}} sexual assault, but presented as something really welcoming and nice. The song's sort of about being—I was assaulted and I had a really hard time engaging in any types of relationship with men, because I was just so terrified of men for a while." ...|$|R
