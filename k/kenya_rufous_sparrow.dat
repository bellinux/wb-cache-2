50|$|The Kenya sparrow, {{also known}} as the <b>Kenya</b> <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer rufocinctus) is a sparrow found in Kenya and Tanzania. It tends to be found in dry wooded savannah and {{agricultural}} areas. Some authorities have lumped the great sparrow (P. motitensis), the Kenya sparrow, and the Socotra sparrow (P. insularis) into P. motitensis following Dowsett and Forbes-Watson (1993). Some authorities also lump Shelley's sparrow and the Kordofan sparrow with this species, or all three with the great sparrow.|$|E
50|$|The great sparrow, {{also known}} as the {{southern}} <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrow</b> or the <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer motitensis) is found in southern Africa in dry, wooded savannah and towns.|$|R
50|$|Shelley's sparrow (Passer shelleyi), {{also known}} as Shelley's <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrow</b> or the White Nile <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrow,</b> is a sparrow found in South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya. It is {{frequently}} considered a subspecies of the Kenya sparrow, {{which in turn is}} considered a subspecies of the great sparrow. This species is named after English geologist and ornithologist George Ernest Shelley.|$|R
5|$|Within its genus, the Iago sparrow {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 Check-list of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrows</b> as the single species Passer motitensis. This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, and separation from the other <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrows</b> by about , are sufficient grounds for species status. Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested it may be a close relative of the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow and not the <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kordofan sparrow, {{also known}} as the Kordofan <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrow,</b> (Passer cordofanicus) is a sparrow found only in northwestern Sudan and eastern Chad. It is {{frequently}} considered a subspecies of the Kenya sparrow, which in turn is considered a subspecies of the great sparrow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of this species}} and the other [...] "rufous sparrows" [...] is confused. Some authors considered this species {{to be the same}} as the Iago sparrow, and some recognise only some of the <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrows</b> as separate from the great sparrow, but the Handbook of the Birds of the World recognises the Socotra sparrow, Kenya sparrow, Kordofan sparrow, and Shelley's sparrow.|$|R
5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was once}} thought to be most closely related to the <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrows,</b> a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar {{habitats}} on continental Africa. Though the Iago sparrow is closest to the <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrows</b> in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It may in fact be more closely related to the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago sparrow occurs in most habitats on available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago sparrow is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
5000|$|The term sesquimorphism (the Latin numeral prefix sesqui- means one-and-one-half, so {{halfway between}} mono- (one) and di- (two)) has been {{proposed}} for bird species in which [...] "both sexes have basically the same plumage pattern, though the female is clearly distinguishable by reason of her paler or washed-out colour". [...] Examples include Cape <b>sparrow</b> (Passer melanurus), <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrow</b> (subspecies P. motinensis motinensis), and saxaul sparrow (P. ammodendri).|$|R
5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other <b>rufous</b> <b>sparrows,</b> which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Presentation date: 1996 - 02 - 05 Breeding bird {{communities}} {{were examined in}} 18 managed Douglas-fir stands in 6 age classes from 5 to 34 years old in spring and early summer, 1993 on the Detroit Ranger District, Willamette National Forest, Oregon. The range of seral stages included early shrub/sapling, late shrub/sapling, and pole. In general, the 9 younger stands were opencanopy while the 9 older stands were closed-canopy. Of the 50 bird species recorded, 21 had large enough sample sizes for analysis. Of these 21, 8 showed a pattern of increasing abundance with increasing stand age (chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, hermit thrush, hermit warbler, Pacific-slope flycatcher, Swainson's thrush, Wilson's warbler, winter wren). Six species showed a pattern of decreasing abundance with increasing stand age (American robin, darkeyed junco, <b>rufous</b> hummingbird, white-crowned <b>sparrow)</b> and 4 species peaked in abundance in age class 2 (10 - 14 years old) before decreasing with increasing stand age (dusky flycatcher, MacGillivray's warbler, orange-crowned warbler, rufous-sided towhee). Two species did not exhibit any particular pattern associated with stand age (warbling vireo, western tanager). Three species were dropped from analysis because their average territory size {{is larger than the}} smallest stand surveyed. Abundance indices for species which showed an increasing pattern were positively associated with habitat variables describing conifer basal area, percent cover of live conifer crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest conifer tree, number of conifer stems/ha between 20 - and 30 - cm dbh, and/or percent cover of live hardwood crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest hardwood tree. Abundance indices for species which showed a decreasing or peaked abundance were negatively associated with the same variables, excluding percent cover of hardwood crown. Total abundance, species richness, and species diversity did not differ (P< 0. 05) among the age classes. However, bird community composition changed with increasing stand age. Open-canopy stands were dominated by species preferring open-canopy habitats (top 5 species in order of abundance: dark-eyed junco, MacGillivray's warbler, rufous hummingbird, dusky flycatcher, rufous-sided towhee) while closed canopy-stands were dominated by species preferring closed-canopy habitats, (hermit warbler, dark-eyed junco, chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, Swainson's thrush); the dark-eyed junco was an exception. The rate of bird community change was rapid along the gradient of open-canopy stands but appeared to reach a plateau once canopy closure was reached...|$|R
