5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a <b>dimensionless</b> unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a <b>dimensionless</b> measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dimensionless</b> {{variables}} {{can always}} be taken to be integer combinations of the dimensional variables (by clearing denominators). There is mathematically no natural choice of <b>dimensionless</b> variables; some choices of <b>dimensionless</b> variables are more physically meaningful, and these are what are ideally used.|$|E
25|$|Since the kernel is only defined {{to within}} a multiplicative {{constant}}, if the above <b>dimensionless</b> constant is raised to any arbitrary power, it will yield another equivalent <b>dimensionless</b> constant.|$|E
25|$|Bed load {{transport}} {{rates are}} usually expressed as being related to excess <b>dimensionless</b> shear stress raised to some power. Excess <b>dimensionless</b> shear stress is a nondimensional measure of bed shear stress about the threshold for motion.|$|E

25|$|More formally, {{the number}} of <b>dimensionless</b> terms that can be formed, p, {{is equal to the}} nullity of the {{dimensional}} matrix, and k is the rank.

25|$|While most {{mathematical}} identities about <b>dimensionless</b> numbers translate in {{a straightforward}} manner to dimensional quantities, {{care must be}} taken with logarithms of ratios: the identity log(a/b) = log a − log b, where the logarithm is taken in any base, holds for <b>dimensionless</b> numbers a and b, but it does not hold if a and b are dimensional, because in this case the left-hand side is well-defined but the right-hand side is not.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Reynolds number, {{there are at least}} two other relevant <b>dimensionless</b> parameters. A wing has three velocity scales: the flapping velocity with respect to the body (u), the forward velocity of the body (U0), and the pitching velocity (Ωc). The ratios of them form two <b>dimensionless</b> variables, U0/u and Ωc/u, the former is often referred to as the advance ratio, and it is also related to the reduced frequency, fc/U0.|$|E
25|$|In fluid mechanics, the Reynolds {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} forces (vsρ) to viscous forces (μ/L). It {{is one of the}} most important <b>dimensionless</b> numbers in fluid dynamics and is used, usually along with other <b>dimensionless</b> numbers, to provide a criterion for determining dynamic similitude. As such, the Reynolds number provides the link between modeling results (design) and the full-scale actual conditions. It can also be used to characterize the flow.|$|E
25|$|If p is {{the unit}} of time the {{quotient}} t/p is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation t for the (<b>dimensionless)</b> number of units of time rather than the time itself, t/p can be replaced by t, but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by p in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a <b>dimensionless</b> number to the correct quantity including unit.|$|E
25|$|Many pairs (b,nbsp&τ) of a <b>dimensionless</b> non-negative number b and {{an amount}} of time τ (a {{physical}} quantity which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with τ proportional to lognbsp&b. For any fixed b not equal to 1 (e.g. e or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time τ. For any non-zero time τ the growth rate is given by the <b>dimensionless</b> positive numbernbsp&b.|$|E

25|$|Parts-per notations are all <b>dimensionless</b> quantities: in {{mathematical}} expressions, {{the units}} of measurement always cancel. In fractions like “2 nanometers per meter” (2nm/m= 2nano= 2×10−9= 2ppb= 2×0.000000001) so the quotients are pure-number coefficients with positive values less than1. When parts-per notations, including the percent symbol (%), are used in regular prose (as opposed to mathematical expressions), they are still pure-number <b>dimensionless</b> quantities. However, they generally take the literal “parts per” meaning of a comparative ratio (e.g., “2ppb” would generally be interpreted as “two parts in a billion parts”).|$|E
25|$|This {{question}} considers three variables: distance D, time T, {{and velocity}} V. These variables admit {{a basis of}} two dimensions: time T and distance D. Thus there is 32=1 <b>dimensionless</b> quantity.|$|E
25|$|For large {{oscillations}} of a pendulum, {{the analysis}} is complicated by an additional <b>dimensionless</b> parameter, the maximum swing angle. The above analysis is a good approximation as the angle approaches zero.|$|E

25|$|Thrust-to-weight {{ratio is}} a <b>dimensionless</b> ratio of thrust to {{weight of a}} rocket, jet engine, {{propeller}} engine, or a vehicle propelled by such an engine that indicates {{the performance of the}} engine or vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Although {{dimensional}} analysis shows that both λ and Z are <b>dimensionless,</b> this is misleading. The long wavelength statistical fluctuations {{are not exactly}} scale invariant, and only become scale invariant when the interaction strength vanishes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{practical}} {{approach is}} through multi-layer configuration catalyst layer,. This idea was {{promoted by the}} highly spatial variation of reaction rate through the catalyst layer, which is measured by a new <b>dimensionless</b> parameter, h.|$|E
