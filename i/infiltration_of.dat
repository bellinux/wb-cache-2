30|$|Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>infiltration</b> {{process is}} {{essential}} for agriculture, hydrologic study, watershed management, irrigation system design and drainage design. In this investigation, three soft computing techniques (SVR, GP and M 5 P tree) and two empirical models (MLR and Kostiakov model) were used to estimate the <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> the soil with different water qualities. The obtained results concluded that the M 5 P tree model is the most efficient model to predict the <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> the soil with different water qualities than the SVR, GP, MLR and Kostiakov model, whereas the results of SVM were more suitable {{as compared to the}} GP and MLR and also gave better prediction than Kostiakov model. Thus, M 5 P tree model was the most suitable model for predicting the <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> the soil. Finally, SA suggests that cumulative time is an essential parameter which affects the <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> the soil with different water qualities using M 5 P model tree for this data set.|$|R
40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} to study the effect of ripping and water head on <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> sandy-loam and clay-loam soils during Summer, 2001. The treatments involved ripping of soil with chisel plough up to 60 - 90 cm depth of soil with four water head treatments ranging from 5 to 20 cm depth of irrigation water. The difference in <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soil between ripping and control treatments was significant. Mean <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> sandy loam soil ranged between 4. 35 - 8. 13 cm hr‾ 1 (control treatment) and 5. 79 - 13. 72 cm hr‾ 1 in the ripping treatment in different water head treatments. Similarly, mean <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> clay loam soil ranged between 1. 51 - 3. 28 cm hr‾ 1 (control) and 2. 23 - 4. 76 cm hr‾ 1 (ripping) in different water head treatments. Ripping of soil and water head significantly increased the <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soil than the control treatment. The magnitude of increase in the infiltration rate was 132 - 163 % in sandy loam soil and 136 - 146 % in clay loam soil in various treatments. In conclusion, ripping improved the <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soil thus providing an opportunity for speedy reclamation of salt affected lands where hardpan is a major limitation for salt leaching. The positive effect of ripping and increasing water head on <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soil warrants the scientific irrigation scheduling and precision land leveling to avoid unnecessary water losses for efficient water management and conservation in an arid environment...|$|R
40|$|A filed {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of tillage practices and compaction on <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> a sandy soil. Mean cumulative infiltration ranged from 3. 18 - 6. 15 cm hr - 1 for rotavator, 3. 75 - 7. 85 cm hr - 1 for moldboard plow and 6. 02 - 13. 62 cm hr - 1 for chisel plow under different compaction treatments. Whereas, mean <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soil was 6. 53 cm hr - 1 for rotavator, 7. 59 cm hr - 1 for moldboard plow and 12. 36 cm hr - 1 for chisel plow. Among the various compaction treatments, three-pass treatment caused 12. 5, 22. 9 and 50. 3 % reduction in <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soils under rotavator, moldboard and chisel plow, respectively. However, the reduction in <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soil under high compaction treatment (five-passes) was 35, 45 and 58 % under rotavator, moldboard and chisel plow, respectively. The difference in <b>infiltration</b> rate <b>of</b> soil was significant among one-pass, three-pass and five-pass treatments than the control treatment (zero-pass). This study has highlighted an excellent potential for water conservation in sandy soils if simple conventional agricultural implements such as tractor, planters etc. alongwith different tillage practices are used for soil compaction.

5|$|South of {{the river}} Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, {{commander}} of XXX Corps and Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning of I Airborne Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine. Instead they ordered the Corps staff to prepare a plan to withdraw the division (Operation Berlin). The evacuation of the surviving 2,500men {{able to make the}} crossing was to begin at 20:45. The evacuation would be from north to south, and was modelled on the evacuation from Gallipoli in the First World War. During the day's fighting, some units had become isolated and never received the order to evacuate. Those capable of taking part were formed into groups of fourteen (the maximum capacity of the boats) and guided to the river by men from the Glider Pilot Regiment who during the day had reconnoitred and marked out two routes to the river.

We explored a new strategy consisting <b>of</b> intraosseous <b>infiltrations</b> <b>of</b> platelet rich plasma into the subchondral bone in combination with the conventional intra-articular injection in order to tackle several knee joint tissues simultaneously.
