5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> that he had dropped on the ground back into the <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>dogs</b> – In 1937, <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> {{were the}} first things sold in McDonald's. Then in CEO Ray Kroc's 1977 autobiography, he {{prohibited}} the company from selling <b>hot</b> <b>dogs,</b> regardless of potential demand, as he regarded them as unhygienic; however, <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> were reintroduced in 1995 at some Midwestern located stores (at the option of the franchise-holder) as a summer item. UK stores sold <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> during 2002 on the McChoice menu (later PoundSaver) and as a seasonal menu item {{in the summer of}} 1999. Also, at least one American restaurant offered Oscar Mayer <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> at some time, notably in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, and McDonald's locations at Toronto Metro Zoo and SkyDome in Toronto offered <b>hot</b> <b>dogs</b> until 1999.

5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins {{in large quantities}} made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour <b>Hot</b> <b>Dog</b> Co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E

40|$|We utilize a Bayesian {{approach}} {{to fit the}} observed mid-IR-To-submillimeter/millimeter spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 22 WISE-selected and submillimeter-detected, hyperluminous hot dust-obscured galaxies (<b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs),</b> with spectroscopic redshift ranging from 1. 7 to 4. 6. We compare the Bayesian evidence of a torus plusgraybody (Torus+GB) model {{with that of a}} torus-only (Torus) model and find that the Torus+GB model has higher Bayesian evidence for all 22 <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> than the torus-only model, which presents strong evidence in favor of the Torus+GB model. By adopting the Torus+GB model, we decompose the observed IR SEDs of <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> into torus and cold dust components. The main results are as follows. (1) <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> in our submillimeter-detected sample are hyperluminous, with torus emission dominating the IR energy output. However, cold dust emission is non-negligible, contributing on average of total IR luminosity. (2) Compared to QSO and starburst SED templates, the median SED of <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> shows the highest luminosity ratio between mid-IR and submillimeter at rest frame, while it is very similar to that of QSOs at, suggesting that the heating sources of <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> should be buried AGNs. (3) <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> have high dust temperatures (K) and high IR luminosity of cold dust. The relation of <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> suggests that the increase in IR luminosity for <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> is mostly due to the increase of the dust temperature, rather than dust mass. <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> have lower dust masses than submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and QSOs within a similar redshift range. Both high IR luminosity of cold dust and relatively low dust mass in <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> can be expected by their relatively high dust temperatures. (4) <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> have high dust-covering factors (CFs), which deviate from the previously proposed trend of the dust CF decreasing with increasing bolometric luminosity. Finally, we can reproduce the observed properties in <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> by employing a physical model of galaxy evolution. This result suggests that <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> may lie at or close to peaks of both star formation and black hole growth histories, and represent a transit phase during the evolutions of massive galaxies, transforming them from the dusty starburst-dominated phase to the optically bright QSO phase...|$|R

She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> stands, needed a building of its own.

5|$|Sanchez {{started his}} first regular season NFL {{game against the}} Houston Texans on September 13, 2009, {{throwing}} his first touchdown pass, a 30-yard reception, to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. Sanchez and the Jets won the game 24–7, with Sanchez throwing for 272 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He was named the Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance in the game, {{the first of three}} consecutive Rookie of the Week awards. He played his first home game a week later versus the New England Patriots, a 16–9 victory; it was also his first AFC East division game and his first rivalry game. It was the Jets' first victory over New England at home since 2000. With a 24–17 victory over the Tennessee Titans in Week 3, Sanchez became the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to start and win his first three games of an NFL season. However, his performance began to regress as he had a pass intercepted for a 99-yard touchdown return, and fumbled another attempted pass in the end zone for another touchdown, as the Jets fell to the New Orleans Saints in Week 4. These two plays were enough to spoil an otherwise strong outing from the Jets's defensive unit as the team dropped to a 3–1 record. Following the loss to New Orleans, Sanchez received criticism in a 16–13 overtime loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 6 when he threw five interceptions against a lowly Bills defense that previously had only four interceptions all season long. The Jets ended their losing streak in a 38–0 victory against the Oakland Raiders in Week 7 however, Sanchez was criticized after he was seen eating a <b>hot</b> <b>dog</b> on the Jets' bench in the fourth quarter.|$|E

40|$|Hot dust-obscured galaxies (<b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs)</b> {{are a new}} {{population}} {{recently discovered}} in the All-Sky survey. Multiwavelength follow-up observations suggest that they are luminous, dust-obscured quasars at high redshift. Here we present the JCMT SCUBA- 2 850 μ m follow-up observations of 10 <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs.</b> Four out of ten <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> have been detected at > 3 σ level. Based on the IR SED decomposition approach, we derive the IR luminosities of AGN torus and cold dust components. <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> in our sample are extremely luminous with most of them having L_ IR^ tot> 10 ^ 14 L_. The torus emissions dominate the total IR energy output. However, the cold dust contribution is still non-negligible, with the fraction of the cold dust contribution to the total IR luminosity (∼ 8 - 24 %) being dependent on the choice of torus model. The derived cold dust temperatures in <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> are comparable to those in UV bright quasars with similar IR luminosity, but much higher than those in SMGs. Higher dust temperatures in <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> {{may be due to}} the more intense radiation field caused by intense starburst and obscured AGN activities. Fourteen and five submillimeter serendipitous sources in the 10 SCUBA- 2 fields around <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> have been detected at > 3 σ and > 3. 5 σ levels, respectively. By estimating their cumulative number counts, we confirm the previous argument that <b>Hot</b> <b>DOGs</b> lie in dense environments.
