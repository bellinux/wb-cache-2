5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Führer and uphold {{the virtues of}} National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him {{to be viewed as}} a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E

While the first, filed by advocate Arvind Shukla, had sought direction to the Election Commission to derecognise Mr Raj Thackeray's MNS for his controversial remarks against North Indians, the other one, filed by RU Upadhyay, sought {{protection for the}} North Indians in Maharashtra and compensation {{to those who had}} suffered from the attacks. The court, however, refused to pass any direction {{on the grounds that the}} issue was related to the aspect of law and order, and it thus directed the petitioners to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bombay High Court and seek further hearing there.|$|E

25|$|German {{reaction}} to the French Revolution was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced {{the overthrow of the}} king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the execution of the French king and the onset of the Terror disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.|$|E
25|$|President Narayanan in {{his speeches}} {{consistently}} sought {{to remind the}} nation of its duties and obligations towards the Dalits and Adivasis, the minorities, and the poor and downtrodden. He called the nation's attention to various recalcitrant social ills and evils, such as atrocities against women and children, caste discrimination and the ingrained attitudes it nurtured, abuse {{of the environment and}} public utilities, corruption and lack of accountability in the delivery of public services, religious fundamentalism, advertisement-driven consumerism, and flouting of human rights, and lamented the absence of public concern, political debate, and civic action to address them. Drawing from the experiences of his own home state Kerala, he pointed out that education was at the root of human and economic development. He hoped that the establishment would not fear the awakening of the masses through education, and spoke of the need to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> people.|$|E
25|$|The early French {{withdrawal}} has {{led some}} to speculate that Kapisa will become a security vacuum just outside Kabul. This would be no small matter: the “ring of steel” that surrounds Afghanistan’s capital has been broken {{so many times that}} few <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital’s safety anymore. Several of those early attacks, before the influx of French troops, were planned and supported out of the Tagab Valley. The French presence there had reduced the ability of militants in Kapisa to launch attacks into Kabul. When the French leave, the U.S. would not have the troops to fill in the gap, leaving a big opportunity for militants north of Kabul to strike back.Most of the province population believe that the long-term presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan can only serve to perpetuate the war cycle and the departure of the French will weaken the Taliban stance. Over 60 French soldiers have been killed in Kapisa since 2008, with hundreds more injured severely. With the help of Afghan National Army, French forces conducted operations to repel the insurgents and Afghan forces were able to gain a foothold in Kapisa valleys. They oversaw the formation of the 3rd Brigade of the 201st Afghan corps that is now deployed in Kapisa and of the Afghan police who now are solely responsible for providing the province’s security.|$|E

[...] "Someone has to get the country, and I think we should have the best chance," [...] Rhodes told Rothschild; [...] "I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king.

At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics. Orion only held one press screening for the film. The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil. Cameron noted that The Terminator was a hit [...] "relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters.

2500|$|Perhaps due to {{emotional}} and mental stress, he turned increasingly to religion, converting to the Roman Catholic faith in early 1913.

Deciding he could better serve his church within the army, he instead followed it to war as a lieutenant, telling a priest at the time [...] "we are not ready, but I <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart". He died in the last stand of the French artillery at the Battle of Rossignol.

2500|$|The author C. S. Lewis {{wrote about}} the {{implications}} of perception of religious imagery in questionable circumstances on issues of religious belief and faith. He argued that people's ready ability to perceive human-like forms around them reflects a religious reality that human existence is immersed in a world containing such beings. The principal reason he believed in religion was because he believed himself to be wired to believe it, just as he believed human beings are wired to perceive inference (if ... then) and other mental logical phenomena as representing truths about the external world that can be learned from, rather than representing purely internal phenomena to be characterized as error. He chose to believe in his wiring for religious perception in the same way and for the same reasons that he chose to believe in his wiring for logic, choosing to use and rely on both as guides to learning about the world rather than regarding them as purely random in origin and discarding them. People continue to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon of logic, {{despite the fact that they}} sometimes make demonstrably mistaken inferences.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Queen's Canadian titles include Defender of the Faith/Défenseur de la Foi, {{neither the}} monarch {{nor any of}} the viceroys have an {{official}} religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (Fidei defensor, in Latin) signifies the sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of {{the security of the}} Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. Defender of the Faith thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the House of Commons: [...] "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In our countries [...] there are no established churches, but in our countries there are people who <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt {{that it was a good}} thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler." ...|$|E
