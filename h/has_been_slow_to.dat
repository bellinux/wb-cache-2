5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, {{as well as the}} first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probably}} impossible to completely eliminate dimensional change in wood, but elimination {{of change in}} size may be approximated by chemical modification. For example, wood can be treated with chemicals to replace the hydroxyl groups with other hydrophobic functional groups of modifying agents (Stamm, 1964). Among all the existing processes, wood modification with acetic anhydride has been noted for the high anti-shrink or anti-swell efficiency (ASE) attainable without damage to wood. However, acetylation of wood <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> be commercialised due to the cost, corrosion and the entrapment of the acetic acid in wood. There is an extensive volume of literature relating to the chemical modification of wood (Rowell, 1983, 1991; Kumar, 1994; Haque, 1997).|$|E
25|$|Despite actions taken, {{the region}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> recover. During the moratorium, {{there was a}} {{decrease}} in employment {{in the oil industry}} along the Florida Coast and a net increase in employment in Louisiana, which also received more concern from the oil industry. Coastal areas were impacted economically more than inland areas. The Louisiana fishing industry was shown to still be damaged by the spill years after it had occurred. Oyster numbers in particular have dropped significantly in the region. Other at risk species used as sustenance include speckled trout, crabs, and mullet. Due to proximity to the spill site, Louisiana bore the brunt of clean up efforts. BP decided on the oil dissolving chemical Corexit which was shown by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be neither the most or least toxic option. Criticisms of the use of the chemical included health impacts on humans, such as headaches, vomiting, and reproductive problems.|$|E

25|$|AOL {{has faced}} {{a number of}} {{lawsuits}} over claims that it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes {{in response to a}} class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{point out}} {{that many of the}} {{products}} to be impacted are already making their way through the supply chain. As a result, much inventory that was legal prior to the signing of the law and was manufactured shortly thereafter will probably be on shelves as the deadlines approach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen apparently agree that these products are already in distribution, but believe that manufacturers should still be held liable. The problem is not the lead or phthalate content, as they imply, {{but the fact that the}} products must be tested to make sure they comply. There is also confusion of what products need a GCC and which do not. They have not been tested because the items generally do not contain hazardous materials; CPSC <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> define some of the accreditation or testing criteria; some of the low volume, low value items are not economical to test; and lot tracking methods would not allow some of the items to be tracked.|$|E

500|$|On January 24, 1994, {{prosecutors}} {{announced that}} they would be not bringing charges against Evan Chandler for attempted extortion as Jackson's camp <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> report the extortion claim to the police and had tried to negotiate a settlement with Chandler for several weeks. Evan had first made his demand for a financial settlement on August 4, 1993, and the Jackson camp filed extortion charges against Evan and his attorney Barry K. Rothman in late August 1993. After tape recordings supporting the extortion claim were released to the media on August 30, a lawyer for Jackson explained they had not gone to the police earlier because, [...] "It was our hope that this would all go away. We tried to keep it as much in-house as we could." [...] Jackson had already experienced years of bizarre rumors and speculation. In the extortion investigation, a search warrant was never sought to search the homes and offices of Evan Chandler and Barry Rothman and no grand jury was convened when both men declined to be interviewed by police. In contrast, the police searched Jackson's residences solely based on Jordan's allegations reported by a psychiatrist with no particular expertise in child sexual abuse and increased their efforts to investigate Jackson after no supporting evidence was found in their raids and after questioning almost 30 children (Jackson's phonebooks were seized) and their families, all of whom said Jackson had done nothing wrong. Officers flew to the Philippines to interview two ex-housekeepers who had sold a molestation story to the tabloids but decided it lacked credibility. Several parents also complained to one of Jackson's attorneys of aggressive investigative techniques by the police; allegedly frightening their children with lies, e.g. â€˜We have nude photos of you', to pressure them into accusing Jackson and unequivocally telling parents their children had been molested even though their children had denied being victimized.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} has made {{a concerted effort to}} promote good health-related behaviors. In most rural areas, a network of National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee (NPHCC) workers, the All-China Women's Federation representatives, the Communist Youth League of China, local epidemic prevention stations, and schools have led health education campaigns encouraging a wide array of hygienic behaviors. That work, combined with a high literacy rate (even in poor areas), has led to widespread knowledge of many basic health behaviors, such as the importance of drinking boiled water. However, actual behavioral change <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> follow, especially in poor areas where fuel may be scarce and understanding of the link between raw water or unwashed hands and diarrhea is tenuous. Thus, the problem is more one of the effectiveness of health messages than of their dissemination: In the late 1990s, health education in most rural areas provided little concrete information to link hygienic behavior to improved health, and most provinces still lacked specialized health education training. As a result, significant disparities exist between poorer and wealthier rural counties, both among and within provinces in China. While a number of wealthier and middle-income rural counties have experienced tremendous health-related benefits as a result of improvements in water supply and sanitation, poorer counties with more limited resources have yet to receive similar benefits. In Minqin county, Inner Mongolia, [...] "10,000 people have left the area and have become shengtai yimin, â€œecological migrants".|$|E
