50|$|The <b>duckbill</b> <b>valve</b> {{is similar}} in {{function}} to the mitral valve in the heart. See also Heimlich valve.|$|E
50|$|A <b>duckbill</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{check valve}} in which flow {{proceeds}} through a soft tube that protrudes into the downstream side. Back-pressure collapses this tube, cutting off flow.|$|E
50|$|A <b>duckbill</b> <b>valve</b> is a valve, {{manufactured}} from rubber or synthetic elastomer, {{and shaped}} like the beak of a duck. It {{is commonly used}} in medical applications to prevent contamination due to backflow.|$|E
25|$|Exhaust valves are {{necessary}} to prevent the diver inhaling water, and to allow a negative pressure difference to be induced over the diaphragm to control the demand valve. The exhaust valves should operate at a very small pressure difference, and cause as little resistance to flow as reasonably possible, without being cumbersome and bulky. Elastomer mushroom valves serve the purpose adequately, though <b>duckbill</b> <b>valves</b> were also common in twin-hose regulators. Where {{it is important to}} avoid leaks back into the regulator, such as when diving in contaminated water, a system of two sets of valves in series can reduce the risk of contamination. A more complex option which can be used for surface supplied helmets, is to use a reclaim exhaust system which uses a separate flow regulator to control the exhaust which is returned to the surface in a dedicated hose in the umbilical.|$|R
50|$|This type of trickle valve {{utilizes}} {{a specially}} designed duckbill rubber sleeve. The negative pressure of the dust collection system collapses the sleeve on itself, creating an airtight seal. Adjustable leaf springs are inserted into {{the sides of the}} sleeve which help to resist the vacuum. The weight of collected material above the valve forces the sleeve open to allow a steady discharge. <b>Duckbill</b> sleeve trickle <b>valves</b> have no moving parts.|$|R
40|$|Duckbill-shaped {{elastomer}} {{check valves}} are sometimes installed on storm-water or sewage outfall ports to prevent backflow or seawater intrusion. Unlike fixed diameter ports, the jet velocity varies nonlinearly with port discharge flow. An analysis of all available experimental {{data on the}} head-discharge characteristics of check valves shows that the collective data can be effectively correlated with {{the parameters of the}} approach flow in the discharge port. Two dimensionless relations are obtained for the effective percentage jet opening area and the valve head loss. The relations are derived from data for nominal port diameters in the range of 100 - 305 mm (4 - 12 in.), and appear to hold generally for elastomer check valves. The head-discharge relations can be used to determine the jet discharge velocity and opening area that are needed as input to numerical plume models for environmental impact assessment and outfall design. The results can also be conveniently incorporated into a diffuser hydraulics code. In general, the calculations show that the use of <b>duckbill</b> check <b>valves</b> leads to a more uniform port discharge distribution, higher jet velocities, and higher energy head requirements...|$|R
40|$|Design, simulation, {{fabrication}} {{and measurement}} {{results of a}} new method to fabricate in-plane oriented micro valves with use of an-isotropic wet chemical etching techniques are reported. The method is very engaging due to the simplicity, low demands on cleanroom resources, high accurate controllability and wafer-thickness independence. Integration in micro systems is facilitated by the unique possibility to obtain in-plane working devices. Performed analytical and numerical simulations as well as measurements of a <b>duckbill</b> <b>valve</b> demonstrate the functionality...|$|E
40|$|Duckbill-shaped {{elastomer}} {{check valves}} are often installed on wastewater effluent diffusion systems and stormwater outfalls to prevent backflow or sea water intrusion Unlike fixed diameter ports, the jet velocity varies nonlinearly with port discharge flow. A new theory {{to predict the}} hydraulic characteristics of a duckbill elastomer check valve (DBV) is presented, and it provides a theoretical basis for the correlation of all DBV hydraulic data. It is shown that a DBV {{can be considered as}} a smooth converging nozzle. By modelling the <b>duckbill</b> <b>valve</b> as a two-dimensional rubber membrane, a theory is developed to relate the DBV material properties and flow conditions to the valve deformation. The valve opening area is predicted {{as a function of the}} driving pressure head; a linear head-discharge relation is predicted. The predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The derived head-discharge relation can be readily incorporated into a diffuser internal hydraulics code to determine the variation of discharge flow and jet velocity along a multiport diffuser fitted with duckbill check valves. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Duckbill-shaped {{elastomer}} valves {{are often}} installed on wastewater effluent diffusers, stormwater outfalls, and industrial flow systems to prevent backflow and sediment/salt water intrusion. Unlike fixed diameter nozzles, the flow from a <b>duckbill</b> <b>valve</b> (DBV) depends {{both on the}} driving pressure {{and the size of}} the valve opening. A nonlinear large deformation finite element analysis of a prototype DBV is reported herein. The elastomer is modeled as a hyperelastic incompressible solid, and the flow inside the DBV, shaped like a converging nozzle, is treated as energy conserving. The deformed valve is computed iteratively from sequential standard large deformation analysis of the internal flow and pressure loading. The calculations show that the valve opening is lip shaped, and the maximum stress occurs around the two sides of the saddle of the DBV; maximum strains are on the order of 5 %. In contrast to the traditional square-root head-discharge dependence, a linear pressure-discharge relation is predicted for a range of elastomer thickness; the jet velocity/valve opening area varies nonlinearly with discharge. The normalized predictions of valve discharge flow and opening area as a function of the driving pressure are in excellent agreement with experimental data.
