5|$|Jade burial suit: Burial suits made of jade {{existed in}} China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Confirming ancient records about Han royalty and nobility buried in jade burial suits, archaeologists {{discovered}} in June 1968 the tombs and jade burial suits of Prince Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC) {{and his wife}} Dou Wan in Hebei province. Liu's suit, in twelve flexible sections, comprised 2,690 square pieces of green jade with holes punctured in {{the four corners of}} each piece so that they could be sewn together with gold thread. The total weight of the gold thread used <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> was 1,110 g (39oz). Princess Dou Wan's suit had 2,156 pieces of jade stitched together with 703 g (24.7oz) of gold thread. Although jade burial outer wears and head masks appear in tombs of the early Han Dynasty, burial suits did not appear until the reign of Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC), with the earliest being found in the Shizishan site. A total of 22 Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) and 27 Eastern Han (25–220 AD) complete and partial jade burial suits were uncovered between 1954 and 1996. They are found mainly in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan, as well as at Yangjiawan, Dongyuan, Guangzhou, Mawangdui, Mianyang and Shizhaishan. The jade burial suit gradually disappeared when it was forbidden in 222 by Emperor Wen of Wei.|$|E

25|$|Delta {{arrives at}} a {{containment}} chamber where Eleanor is held, but Lamb captures him and severs his bond with Eleanor by temporarily stopping her heart. Though Eleanor survives, Delta begins to slowly die as the bond cannot be re-established. Using a Little Sister, Eleanor transforms herself into a Big Sister and breaks Delta from confinement. Together they head for an escape pod that Sinclair has arranged to leave Rapture. The two find that Lamb has converted Sinclair into Subject Omega, declaring that Delta should be what Sinclair is now, and Delta is forced to finish him off. After a final climactic showdown with the remnants of The Rapture Family in order to buy time for Eleanor to prepare the pod, Delta is forced to flood the area and escape <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit.</b> Eleanor and Delta {{make it to the}} escape pod but a bomb set by Lamb leaves Delta mortally wounded. Eleanor teleports and reaches the escape pod before the bomb blows, while Delta manages to grab onto the pod's side and climb aboard as it rises.|$|E

500|$|Savage sued CAIR for {{copyright}} infringement {{for using}} excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was [...] "deliberately designed {{to obscure the}} specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as [...] "a throwback document" [...] and a [...] "book of hate". CAIR called the suit [...] "bizarre, sloppy and baseless". On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as {{it was used to}} [...] "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations." [...] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit.</b> That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.|$|E
500|$|The story {{starts as}} Bornstellar {{makes his way}} to [...] "Erde-Tyrene" [...] where he meets the two humans Chakas and Morning Riser, who serve as his guides. Bornstellar is seeking Precursor artifacts, relics from an extinct but technologically {{superior}} civilization. The humans lead Bornstellar to a ring island where they find and activate the cryptum of the Didact. The cryptum preserves the Didact in an indefinite sleep. Bornstellar begins to suspect that the artificial intelligence <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> of armour has conspired to bring him to the island, and that the humans held subconscious knowledge allowing them to aid in waking the Didact. After the Didact recovers from his slumber, he conscripts Bornstellar, Chakas, and Riser, taking them on a quest given by the Librarian who has provided them a state-of-the-art space ship, hidden for thousands of years beneath the island. Aboard the ship Bornstellar learns about the Forerunner war with humankind 10,000 years prior. Forerunners went to war with humans and San 'Shyuum when their expansion began encroaching on Forerunner worlds. After their defeat the Librarian saved the human race from extinction and planted a genetic command known as a [...] "geas" [...] in them, the cause of Chakas and Riser's subconscious knowledge. It is later revealed that the humans and San 'Shyuum were united against the Flood, a parasitic alien species that controls its host, and attacked only the Forerunner planets with Flood infestation.|$|E

2500|$|Hoveyda's {{became a}} {{household}} name in Iran through the constant character assassination he received by the late Towfigh magazine, Iran's most popular political satire magazine. [...] Hoveyda was largely unknown among the population of Iran before Towfigh publisized him. [...] He was caricatured in Towfigh's weekly magazine carrying a cane (caused by a traffic accident {{in which he was}} involved), wearing one carnation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> jacket pocket, and smoking a pipe. [...] Towfigh magazine referred to him as [...] "The Caned One" [...] and even devoted an entire book dedicated to exposing his flaws as a premier entitled [...] "Assa-Nameh". The magazine (and Iranian media in general) frequently criticized and lampooned Hoveyda, primarily because they intended to criticize the Shah himself, but were unable to directly do so due to censorship.|$|E
2500|$|After Bracken's World was cancelled, Harrison {{was caught}} in the 20th Century-Fox proxy {{shareholder}} war beginning December 1970 between majority shareholders Darryl Zanuck, head of Fox, his estranged wife Virginia Fox, and their son: respectively, Harrison's father-in-law, mother-in-law, and husband. In the course of the struggle, then-studio chief Darryl Zanuck fired his son. Harrison's contract was abruptly terminated in January 1971. The reason given was that her presence might prove [...] "embarrassing" [...] to the studio. Harrison later sued for wrongful termination, breach of contract, alleged defamation, and infliction of emotional distress. Harrison was named in the $22 million lawsuit her husband filed November 1, 1971, against his father, Darryl Zanuck, then 68, 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Chairman and CEO Dennis C. Stanfill, and Fox Executive Committee chairman William T. Gossett. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> Zanuck contended that he, Harrison, and former Fox executive David Brown had been wrongly terminated and subjected to humiliation and embarrassment.

At the same time, Irving also sued Holocaust historian Gitta Sereny for libel for an article {{she had written}} about him entitled [...] "Spin Time for Hitler" [...] in The Observer newspaper on 21 April 1996, although the case {{did not go to}} court. In letters of 25 and 28 October 1997, Irving threatened to sue John Lukacs for libel if he published his book, The Hitler of History without removing certain passages highly critical of Irving's work. The American edition of The Hitler of History was published in 1997 with the allegedly libelous passages included, but because of Irving's legal threats, no British edition of The Hitler of History was published until 2001. When the latter was published, {{as a result of the}} threat of legal action by Irving, the passages containing the criticism of Irving's historical methods were expunged by the publisher, to the disappointment of many reviewers.|$|E

2500|$|Aguirre then {{sued the}} SEC under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeking {{documents}} related to his employment and discharge, {{as well as the}} SEC's investigation of Pequot and Mack. The SEC, claiming several exemptions under the law released redacted versions of the documents, thereby withholding information. They also failed to produce Aguirre's original personnel file. Aguirre alleged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> that the SEC had failed to conduct an adequate search for documents and he challenged the SEC's failure to produce his original personnel file, which contained records missing from the version given him. On April 28, 2008, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, citing the Senate report extensively, ruled in his favor, forcing the SEC to turn over documents to Aguirre. The Court wrote of [...] "the importance of understanding the dispute between the parties, as well as plaintiff’s legal argument that the public interest in disclosure of the withheld records outweighs any privacy interest" [...] under exemptions claimed by the SEC and relied heavily on the Senate report. It noted how the SEC resisted deposing Mack and didn't considering him a potential tipper until after a front-page article in The New York Times revealed the derailed investigation and then did not depose him until the statute of limitations for civil and criminal penalties had run out.|$|E

Rose said <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> that Azoff failed to promote his 2008 album, Chinese Democracy, and deliberately mishandled concert dates, [...] "forcing Rose into a position where he would {{have no choice but to}} reunite with the original members of Guns N' Roses for a reunion tour."
