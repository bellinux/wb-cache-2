30|$|The CSS {{technique}} was first proposed 50  years ago[5]. It {{is based on}} the thermal-heating-induced sublimation of the source's material followed by vapor condensation onto the closely spaced substrate. The cross dimensions of the source and the substrate greatly exceed the distance between the source and the substrate. So far the CSS technique has been widely used in the production of thin films for solar cell applications[6]. To our knowledge, CSS has not yet been used for production of graphene films. We simplified the design of the setup intended for film deposition as much as possible. In our case, carbon films were deposited using the thermal sublimation of the graphite at atmospheric pressure in the quasi-closed volume created inside a muffle furnace. This volume was the fused quartz crucible with <b>ground</b> <b>stopper</b> filled with densely packed fine TiO 2 powder. (TiO 2 was used because of its good chemically stability, high temperature stability, and corrosion resistance). Such a design has ensured reproducible results. The growth temperature was 850 °C. The substrate was 130 -nm-thick SiO 2 film on silicon wafer obtained by oxidizing it in air at 1, 100 °C. Two types of film were investigated: one obtained using direct contact between the graphite plate and substrate (type I) and another obtained at 300 -μm distance (type II).|$|E

40|$|Peroxides are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds with unusual stability problems and {{are one of the}} most hazardous classes of chemicals routinely handled in the laboratory. Peroxides can be formed via intentional chemical reactions (i. e., ozonolysis), but just as hazardous is the inadvertent peroxide formation during storage of certain compounds. Some compounds form explosive peroxides and others are polymerizable unsaturated compounds that can initiate a runaway, explosive polymerization reaction. To varying degrees, shock, heat or friction may cause unexpected explosion of peroxidized organic chemicals. Common classes of compounds that form peroxides include: 1. Ethers, acetals, and ketals, especially cyclic ethers and those with primary and/or secondary alkyl groups 2. Aldehydes, including acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde 3. Compounds containing benzylic hydrogens 4. Compounds containing allylic hydrogens, including most alkenes; vinyl and vinylidene compounds, and dienes Refer to Appendix A for a list of common peroxide forming chemicals and recommendations on safe storage durations. STORAGE AND HANDLING y The quantity of peroxide-forming chemicals kept should be restricted to the minimum amount needed. y Store peroxide-formers in airtight bottles, away from light and heat. Avoid using containers with loose-fitting lids and glass <b>ground</b> <b>stoppers.</b> y Certain peroxide formers, including those in Appendix A-List A, should be stored under nitrogen if possible. y Evaluate for peroxide formation regularly and always prior to distillation (see right).

40|$|SUMMARY It is {{now well}} {{established}} that although acetylsalicylate does {{not interfere with}} the commonly used nitration method for measuring paracetamol, salicylate does interfere. Several methods have been used to remove this interference, by solvent extraction, or to make allowance for the interference, for example, by arithmetical correction. We describe a new approach to the problem by modifying the reaction conditions in an attempt to find the optimum conditions for the nitration of paracetamol {{while at the same time}} minimising salicylate interference. A method is proposed in which the concentration of nitrite is reduced and a time delay is introduced after the addition of sulphamic acid. This method is shown to be accurate, precise, and linear and exhibits minimal interference from salicylate. Add 10 ml distilled water to a nitrite tube and mix well. This will be sufficient for 10 analyses (~ 75 mg per assay). 2 Add 1 ml plasma to a TCA tube. Mix well and centrifuge at 1600 g for 8 minutes. Treat the 100 and 400 !lg/ml paracetamol standards and water for the blank similarly. 3 Transfer 3 ml of the supernatants to 150 x 23 mm glass tubes with <b>ground</b> glass <b>stoppers.</b> Add 1 ml of the nitrite solution and start the stopwatch. Swirl very gently. Do not mix vigorously. 4 Exactly 5 minutes after adding the nitrite add I ml of the sulphamic acid solution slowly (over about 5 seconds) followed by a further 1 ml when the effervescence has died down. Do not mix the tubes but transfer them to the water bath. 5 Exactly 10 minutes after adding the nitrite add 5 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. Stopper the tubes and mix briefly on a vortex mixer.

5000|$|The {{effort to}} power the Fair with electricity, which became a {{demonstration}} piece for Westinghouse Electric and the alternating current system they had been developing for many years, {{took place at the}} end of what has been called the War of the currents between DC and AC. Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid {{to power the}} Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US$510,000 to supply an alternating current based system. Edison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, put in a US$1,720,000 bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with direct current. After the Fair committee went over both proposals, Edison General Electric re-bid their costs at $554,000 but Westinghouse under bid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract. Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs. Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a <b>ground</b> glass <b>stopper</b> in one end, based on a Sawyer-Man [...] "stopper" [...] lamp patent they already had. The lamps worked well but were short lived, requiring a small army of workmen to constantly replace them. Westinghouse Electric had severely underbid the contract and struggled to supply all the equipment specified including twelve 1,000 horsepower single phase AC generators and all the lighting and other equipment required. They also had to fend off a last minute lawsuit by General Electric claiming the Westinghouse Sawyer-Man based stopper lamp infringed on the Edison incandescent lamp patent.|$|R

Introduction: The {{comparative}} study of soils herein given is a physical study of five types of soil in their relation to Agriculture. This study has to do only with the relation of moisture and air to the soil. The comparisons given are found in experiments carefully preformed in the soil physics laboratory. Although field conditions were not obtained in the laboratory we found no conditions or results than {{which could not be}} applied directly to some phase of Agriculture. The moisture problem is one of great importance to farmers in the Middle West, and only by careful study of the physical conditions of the soil can the problem be solved. We must learn the conditions which aid in conserving soil moisture, and those which cause a loss, and practice farming methods which conserve the soil moisture. If certain conditions in the laboratory are influential in conserving moisture, like conditions in the field will produce similar effects. Eight experiments have been performed in the laboratory to demonstrate the difference in the relation of the five types of soil to soil moisture and air. In performing these experiments care was given to each soil. Also each soil had received the same treatment previous to experimenting. Each soil was air dried, and sifted so that of each type only. the fine soil was used. Experiment No. 1. Determination of the specific gravity of soils.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of CO 2 in animal membranes {{has received the}} attention of but few investigators and the data presented have been inadequate and apparently contradictory. Krogh (1919) published a permeability constant for CO 2 in connective tissue based on a single determination. He considered his value too high although it is lower than a similar constant given by Hagenbach (1898) for COs diffusing in 20 per cent gelatin. Fenn (1928 b) published diffusion coefficients for CO ~ in nerve and muscle and found values considerably lower than the diffusion coefficient that he calculated from Krogh's permeability constant. Considering the contradictory results obtained by the above authors and the fundamental importance of {{the knowledge of the}} rate of {{diffusion of}} CO 2 in physiological problems it seemed desirable to make a study of the diffusion of this gas in different types of membranes. Two methods of determining the rate of diffusion of CO 2 in tissues and the results of measurements made on connective tissue, muscle, and frog skin are given below. Apparatus and Methods Measurement of Permeability. [...] The method of measuring permeability of tissues to COs depends on the fact that small amounts of COs can be detected by conductivity changes in a barium hydroxide solution (Fenn, 1928 a). Essentially the method is to pass COs of a known tension over one face of a tissue and catch the CO ~ that leaves the opposite face in barium hydroxide. Measurements of the conductivity of the barium solution are made by means of a suitable Wheatstone bridge and the changes are expressed in cc. of CO 2 at standard pressure and temperature. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a conductivity cell with two platinum electrodes sealed into the side arm of a bottle, fitted with a <b>ground</b> glass <b>stopper.</b> The brass tube (A) is sealed into the glass stopper with de Khotinsky cement.

The enlightened ruler (this was written during the rule of Abbas Pasha) knows his own interests, and never willingly parts with a subject liable to cess, at times objecting even to their obeying pilgrimage law. We, on the other hand, in India, allow a freedom of emigration, in my humble opinion, highly injurious to us. For not only does this exodus thin the population, and tend to impoverish the land, it also serves to bring our rule into disrepute in foreign lands. At another time I shall discuss this subject more fully. [FN#5] The glare of Alexandria has become a matter of fable in the East.

There are, however, few copper coins, the pieces of ten or five faddah (or parahs), whereas silver and gold abound. As regards the latter metal, strangers should mistrust all small pieces, Turkish as well as Egyptian. [...] "The greater part are either cut or cracked, or perhaps both, and worn down to mere spangles: after taking them, it will not be possible to pass them without considerable loss." [...] Above all things, the traveller must be careful never to change gold except in large towns, where such a display of wealth would not arouse suspicion or cupidity; and on no occasion when travelling even to pronounce the ill-omened word [...] "Kis" [...] (purse). Many have lost their lives by neglecting these simple precautions.

Sonnini, however, is right when he says of the Egyptian fellahs, that their stomachs, accustomed to digest bread badly baked, acrid and raw vegetables, and other green and unwholesome nourishment, require doses fit only for horses. Advisable precautions are, in the first place, to avoid, if travelling as a native, any signs of European manufacture in knives, scissors, weights, scales and other such articles. Secondly, glass bottles are useless: the drugs should be stowed away in tin or wooden boxes, such as the natives of the country use, and when a phial is required, it must be fitted into an etui of some kind.

I made the mistake of buying my drugs in England, and had the useless trouble of looking after them during the journey.
