The engine was a rear-mounted, <b>direct</b> <b>driven</b> {{impeller}} air-cooled 750 cc twin-cylinder unit made by JAP driving the rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox and chain to the axle which had a friction differential. The suspension was by independent coil springs at the front and underslung semi elliptic at the rear. Steering was by a chain system.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{to tackle}} the problem; instead of {{adapting}} the waves to the power-take off system is adapting the system to the waves. This {{can be done by}} using a <b>direct</b> <b>driven</b> WEC (wave energy converter) with a linear generator. The advantage with this setup is a less complex mechanical system with potentially a smaller need for maintenance. One drawback with this kind of system is a more complicated transmission of the power to the grid. This is due to the characteristics of the generated voltage which will vary both in amplitude and frequency.|$|E

The action of kicking is therefore used to pass and also shoot, depending on where the ball is aimed. Depending on how the Kick button is used, various different actions (such as a <b>direct,</b> <b>driven</b> pass, a volley, a lofted cross, etc., can be commanded.|$|E

In 1995, the Quad 4 engines received balance shafts, and a <b>direct</b> <b>driven</b> power steering off the intake camshaft.

50|$|Since the {{deployment}} of the first WEC in 2006, {{it has been in}} operation in real ocean seas for several months during three different time periods. During these periods measurements of electrical power, buoy motion and mooring line forces have been carried out and analyzed to enhance the knowledge about <b>direct</b> <b>driven</b> linear generator WEC dynamics. In the first test period all electrical power was converted to heat over a three phase delta-connected resistive load. To investigate the impact of a non-linear load on the WEC system, the generator was, during the second test period, connected to a non-linear load consisting of a diode rectifier, capacitors and resistors. The control, load and measurement system for the WEC have successively been expanded and now there is a remotely operated measurement system and control system.|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} wind energy is towards large {{offshore}} wind farms. This trend {{has led to}} the demand for high reliability and large single unit wind turbines. Different energy conversion topologies such as multiple stage geared generators, single stage geared generators and gearless (<b>direct</b> <b>drive)</b> generators have been coupled to the wind turbine in the last decades. <b>Direct</b> <b>drive</b> generators based on permanent magnet technology have a high efficiency, less components and lower speeds that can translate to high energy yield and less maintenance demand.

A peculiar type of parallel robots is called vertical Cable <b>Direct</b> <b>Driven</b> Robot (CDDR). In this {{paper we discuss}} an innovative type of planar parallel 2 -link, 2 -d. o. f. robot which is conceptually similar to CDDRs; in place of using cables, this robot uses Storable Tubular Extendible Member (STEM) actuators, {{one of which is}} also capable to actively rotate. STEMs are lightweight mechanisms used mainly in the space industry. We devise a complete model for the behavior of the robot. The kinematics of robot is defined analytically, whereas the structural model is based on numerical and empirical considerations as well. A working prototype of a STEM actuator is presented. The robot is evaluated via the analysis of force polytopes inside the workspace envelope. This allows us to define some useful indexes: maximum force, maximum admissible weight, out-of-plane stiffness. Results show that the robot outperforms Cable <b>Direct</b> <b>Driven</b> Robots (CDDRs). The robot's workspace reaches above the link anchor points and the system can eliminate configuration singularities. Out-of-plane stiffness is indeed computed to be within an acceptable range...|$|E

40|$|TutorialDuring {{operation}} of compressor trains by a {{variable speed drive}} system (VSDS), integer and non-integer harmonic currents are generated in the inverter. Via the electrical system of the inverter and the motor, an excitation torque is transferred across the motor air gap into the main mass of the motor rotor. The frequency of this excitation may cause torsional resonances. Due to the rapid increase in excitation frequency of integer harmonics, intersections with relevant torsional natural frequencies (TNFs) can in general be avoided within the operating speed range. In contrast, the intersections of the noninteger harmonic excitation frequencies, also called interharmonics, with TNFs within the operating speed range may have an essential impact on the vibration behaviour of the rotating equipment. This aspect has to differentiate between two train configurations. The first are <b>direct</b> <b>driven</b> trains and the second, trains including an intermediate gear. For <b>direct</b> <b>driven</b> trains, only fatigue problems have to be considered. In trains with an intermediate gear, on top of that, interaction of torsional and lateral movement may {{have a negative effect}} on the lateral vibration behaviour of the gear rotors. The main focus of this publication is on a simple but effective method for turbo compressor applications that allows avoiding main resonances within the operating speed range caused by intersections of interharmonic excitations with relevant TNFs. This method is based on detailed knowledge of the inverter behaviour and possible design options of the motor itself. This in-depth understanding was developed by correlating numerical and experimental results based on dynamic torque measurements of real turbo compressor trains. During this investigation the mechanically relevant torsional excitations were identified. Therefore, the different types of inverters and their corresponding characteristics had to be analyzed and understood in detail. This knowledge, in combination with possible motor designs, with regard to the number of pole pairs and the most common train configurations (<b>direct</b> <b>driven</b> and/or trains including intermediate gears), is incorporated in this report...|$|E
