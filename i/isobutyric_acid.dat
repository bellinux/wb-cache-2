This distinction was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic tests. Two novel species are therefore proposed: Prevotella marshii sp. nov. (group E 2) and Prevotella baroniae (group E 4). Both species are saccharolytic; the end-products of fermentation for P. marshii are acetic, propionic and succinic acids, while P. baroniae produces acetic and succinic acids with minor amounts of isovaleric and <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acids.</b> The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain of Prevotella marshii is 51 mol% and that of Prevotella baroniae is 52 mol%.

Since then, female-produced pheromones of over twenty diprionid species have been investigated by solvent extraction followed by separation and identification. However, no study has shown what the females actually release. Collection of airborne compounds using absorbtion on charcoal filter as well as solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by analysis employing gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealed an unusual system in Diprion pini, in which the pheromone precursor alcohol, 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tridecanol, is released together with acetic, propionic, butyric and <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acids.</b> The corresponding acetate, propionate and butyrate esters of 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -tridecanol were {{also found in the}} samples.

40|$|The easily {{available}} 2, 2 -disubstituted 3 -amino- 2 H-azirines 1 react {{with a variety}} of acidic compounds, e. g. NH-acidic heterocycles, to give novel heterocycles containing alpha,alpha-disubstituted alpha-amino acids. These reactions proceed via formation of an intermediate aziridine, which is rearranged to a bicyclic zwitterion. The zwitterion is the key intermediate in all reactions proceeding via cleavage of the C=N bond of 1. The reaction of 1 with carboxylic acids leads to the formation of diamides, e. g. acyl-amino <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acids.</b> The general character of this reaction has been demonstrated in particular with amino acids and oligopeptides. Together with the selective hydrolysis of the C-terminal amide group, this reaction sequence (‘Azirine/Oxazolone-Method’) represents a new and efficient strategy for the synthesis of peptides with alpha,alpha-disubstituted alpha-amino acids. The scope of the ‘Azirine/Oxazolone-Method’ for the synthesis of linear and cyclic peptides and depsipeptides is demonstrated by the synthesis of segments of the peptaibols Alamethicin F- 30 and Trichotoxin A- 50 as well as of model peptides, used for studies of the influence of alpha,alpha-disubstitution on the conformation of the peptide. Via an analogous approach, the synthesis of cyclo[Gly-Phe(2 Me) -Aib-Aib-Gly] is achieved by the pentafluorophenol/DCC cyclization of H-Gly-Phe(2 Me) -Aib-Aib-Gly-OH. In the case of cyclic depsipeptides, the linear precursos can be cyclised directly by treatment with HCl-gas in a non-nucleophilic solvent (‘Direct Amide-Cyclization’) ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that coffee has some {{benefits}} for health; however, {{little is known about}} the specific role of the main polyphenol compounds of coffee, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), without caffeine interaction. A 1 H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR) -based metabolomics approach was used to assess the effect of CGAs from coffee on the human urine metabolome. Ten male volunteers participated in a dietary crossover randomized intervention study with a rich CGAs coffee extract beverage (CEB: 223 mg/ 100 ml of CGAs). The study consisted of a daily intake of CEB or a control beverage with equal caffeine dose during 28 days. Fasting urines collected at the first and last days of each period of the study were analyzed using an CGAs untargeted 1 H-NMR approach. Additionally, 4 -hour postpandrial urines after the first intake of each beverage were also analyzed. Uni- and multi-variate statistic approaches were used to strengthen the results. Multilevel partial least squares discriminant analysis (ML-PLS-DA) was used to paired comparisons across the crossover design. A further univariate analysis model for crossover studies was performed to assess the significant changes. Acute consumption of CEB resulted in high excretion of 2 -furoylglycine, likewise endogenous compounds such as succinic, citric, 3 -methyl- 2 -oxovaleric and <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acids.</b> Sustained consumption of CEB showed an increase of microbiota-derived compounds such as hippuric, 3 -(3 -Hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -hydroxypropionic and 3 -hydroxyhippuric acids in urine.

40|$|AbstractFor {{two-phase}} {{anaerobic digestion}} process of food waste, {{degree of hydrolysis}} and products by acidification during hydrolysis and acidification phase directly affect the performance of methanogenesis phase. Temperature has great impact on hydrolysis and acidification of food waste. This paper monitored the dynamic change of biogas production, biogas composition, pH, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during hydrolysis and acidification stage so as to investigate specific influence of temperature on food waste. With the same inoculum and 9 days’ fermentation, three different temperatures (35, 55 and 70 °C) were taken into consideration. The results showed that cumulative gas production was 4860 mL at 70 °C, which was 129. 79 % and 37. 87 % higher than that at 35 and 55 °C. Besides, hydrogen content at 70 °C was 45. 34 %, which was the highest among the three temperatures. Hydrolysis rate was proportional to the increase of temperature. Meanwhile, total VFAs yield and composition widely differed at three different temperatures. The hydrolysis and acidification products at 35 °C were mainly ethanol and acetic acids and the highest concentrations of ethanol at 35 °C were 3. 28 and 3. 65 times of that at 55 and 70 °C, but more acetic, <b>isobutyric</b> and butyric <b>acids</b> were generated at 55 and 70 °C.
