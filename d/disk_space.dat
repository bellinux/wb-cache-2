40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 829 on 10. 04. 2017 by CS (TIS) Three readback signal detection methods are investigated for real-time flying height or head <b>disk</b> <b>spacing</b> variation measurement under vibration conditions. This {{is carried out}} by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental study. The first method (amplitude detection) provides {{a simple way to}} study the head <b>disk</b> <b>spacing</b> change. The second method (PW 50 parameter estimation) can be used effectively for real-time spacing variation measurement in normally operated hard disk drives, primarily in low frequency spacing variation conditions. The third method (thermal signal detection), on the other hand, is more effective and suitable for high frequency spacing variation measurement. By combining the PW 50 estimation and thermal signal detection methods, a noval spacing variation detection method for the whole frequency range is constructed. This combined signal detection method not only has been used to study the head <b>disk</b> <b>spacing</b> variation itself, but also has the potential of being used for real time flying height control. Analytical models are developed for head disk assembly and head position servo control mechanisms to analyse the operation failure of hard disk drives under vibration conditions. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show their good agreement with experimental results. A novel active flying height control method is proposed to suppress the flying height or head-disk spacing variation in hard disk drives under vibration conditions. Simulation results show that this active flying height control can effectively suppress the head-disk spacing variation, therefore the performance and reliability of HDDs can be well improved when working in vibration conditions: The method has a good potential to be applied to future ruggedized hard disk drives...|$|R

5|$|The 2007 {{version was}} {{announced}} September 12, 2006. A tabbed interface {{allows users to}} access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate tray icons and windows open. Symantec revised Norton Internet Security and made this version more modularized, which has reduced the suite's memory usage to 10–15 megabytes and scan times by 30–35 percent. Another result is that spam filtering and parental controls are separate components to install. When installed, the features consume 100 MB of <b>disk</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|Norton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was {{released}} November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the browser, parental controls, {{and the ability}} to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1.

5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of <b>disk</b> <b>space.</b> Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E
5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions {{due to lack of}} <b>disk</b> <b>space,</b> so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard <b>disk</b> <b>space,</b> SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E
40|$|Commercial scallops, Pecten fumatus, {{glued to}} plastic mesh disks showed growth and {{survival}} {{equal to or greater}} than similar sized scallops in conventional earhung and cage culture. In two experiments of 13 and 25 weeks duration, some aspects of disk culture, such as <b>spacing</b> between <b>disks,</b> scallop orientation and the choice of valve by which the scallops were glued, were examined to determine their effects on shell growth, somatic tissue weight increase, predation and survival. As <b>disk</b> <b>spacing</b> was increased through 40, 60, 80 to 100 mm, predation increased at <b>disk</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 60 mm and total soft tissue mass peaked at 60 mm and above. There {{were no significant differences in}} soft body weight or shell height between scallops glued by either valve in either normal (flat left valve uppermost) or inverted (cupped fight valve uppermost) orientation. However, scallops glued by the left valve had higher percentage survival and larger muscle weights regardless of orientation. By contrast, those glued by the right valve had heavier gonads. Orientation and the scallop culture technique employed significantly affected spionid polychaete infestation of the shell. Scallops glued by the left valve, with left or fight valve uppermost, and glued by the fight valve with this valve uppermost had significantly lower polychaete prevalence than scallops contained in cages, earhung or glued by the fight valve with left valve uppermost...|$|R
