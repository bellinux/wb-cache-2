Last century’s tourism-led revival applied different attitudes toward these structures: preservation, adaptation, restoration and reconstruction. These attitudes constitute the phenomenological framework for the comparison of these two places.

On the other hand we have in mind the multiple phenomena linked to the restructuring and sometimes the dissolution suffered by the constructed area and which results into a heterogenous urban mosaic composed by adding or demolishing buildings or by changing the land use which is reflected in population and buildings densities and in the manifestation of urban flows. Finally, we intend to make a statement on the manner in which there has been or not a changing in the pattern of urban habitation in the post-communist period, taking into consideration the divergent effects of periurbanization, urban sprawl or the restructuring/dissolution of urban space of Bacau municipality...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{addressing}} {{practices in}} Greenland {{do not support}} geocoding. Addressing points on a map by geographic coordinates is vital for emergency services such as police and ambulance for avoiding ambiguities in finding incident locations (Government of Greenland, 2010) Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the current addressing practices in Greenland. Asiaq (Asiaq, 2011) is a public enterprise of the Government of Greenland which holds three separate databases regards addressing and place references: – list of locality names (towns, villages, farms), – technical base maps (including road center lines not connected with names, and buildings), – the NIN registry (The Land Use Register of Greenland - holds information on the land allotments and buildings in Greenland). The main problem is that these data sets are not interconnected, thus making it impossible to address a point in a map with geographic coordinates in a standardized way. The possible solutions suffer from the fact that Greenland has a scattered <b>habitation</b> <b>pattern</b> and the generalization of the address assignment schema is a difficult task. A schema would be developed according to the characteristics of the settlement pattern, e. g. cities, remote locations and place names. The aim is to propose an ontology for a common postal address system for Greenland. The main part of the research is dedicated to the current system and user requirement engineering. This allowed us to design a conceptual database model which corresponds to the user requirements, and implement a small scale prototype. Furthermore, our research includes resemblance findings in Danish and Greenland's addressing practices, data dictionary for establishing Greenland addressing system's logical model and enhanced entity relationship diagram. This initial prototype of the Greenland addressing system could be used to evaluate and build the full architecture of the addressing information system for Greenland. Using software engineering methods the implementation can be done according to the developed data model and initial database prototype. Development of the Greenland addressing system using a modern GIS and database technology would ease the work and improve the quality of public services such as: postal delivery, emergency response, customer/business relationship management, administration of land, utility planning and maintenance and public statistical data analysis...|$|E
40|$|Long-term archaeological data {{gathering}} in the southern Netherlands may deliver an unprecedented regional comparison that could be exemplary for the Pleistocene sand areas of the Northwest European Plain. On a micro-scale level, {{it has become clear}} that Bronze Age (2000 - 800 BC) and Iron Age (800 - 12 BC) farmers intensively used the landscape, resulting in a relatively dense distribution pattern of settlements all over the ridges and planes of the cover sand landscape. However, this agricultural use of the landscape-related to the "celtic field" system-led to a process of soil degradation by increased acidification during which Umbric Podzols gradually transformed into Carbic Podzols that could no longer be used as farmland. According to established "models," this process of "secondary podzolization" particularly affected those sections of the landscape that were dominated by dry sandy soils with a low loam content (loam = clay and silt, between c. 10 % and 20 %). In the Late Iron Age (250 - 12 BC), the changing soil conditions resulted in a dramatic shift in the <b>habitation</b> <b>pattern</b> that clearly manifests itself in the Roman period (12 BC- 410 AD); on the local scale, the habitation moved from the degenerated soils to nearby areas with better soil conditions (higher loam content), which became more densely inhabited now than in the Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (2000 - 500 BC). The introduction of new land management (in the later Iron Age, and also by Romans) could also have been important for soil degradation. The areas where the Roman period settlements concentrated became also the areas where we can find the early medieval habitation (447 - 751 AD) and where the Plaggic Anthrosols started to develop in the late medieval period (1270 - 1500 AD). This paper is based on the analysis of soil properties. Measured loam values of soil samples (n= 181) in Veldhoven, southern Netherlands, are in agreement with the described model that the plaggen cover is located on soils containing high combined silt and clay content (> 25 %) and that Carbic Podzols with no plaggen cover have low combined silt and clay content (< 15 %). Local spatial as well as vertical variations in loam content of sand layers have shown to occur, warning against single parameter research. Other potential causes for the deviation of the model are as follows: (a) impact of fluctuating groundwater levels; (b) impact of different hydrological properties in the shallow subsurface, depending on the grain size and transmissivity of the sediments; (c) organic matter content; (d) land management; and (e) climate change...|$|E

It occupies the lowest of a series of terraces, where the higher ones have a geology less favorable to Native use, where test pits yielded no finds. At the time of the site's listing on the National Register in 1984, it had only been subjected to test excavations. These yielded two important artifacts, a Neville phase point dated to c. 5,500 BCE, and a stone bayonet dated to c. 1,800 BCE. Significant quantities of fire-cracked rocks (indication of cooking activity) were found in test pits throughout the site. Test pits were only dug into the plow zone, so the possibility of even older artifacts exists. Notably for archaeological sites in the interior of Maine, no ceramic artifacts of any kind were found. This strongly suggests that the site was abandoned before c. 1,000 BCE. These types of sites are extremely rare in Maine, and provide a means to investigate shifting <b>habitation</b> <b>patterns</b> over time.|$|R

We argue that way-finding is better understood {{as a function of}} gender differences where gender is understood as a lived social relation, a product of the interaction between an embodied habitus and a particular social field. The use of survey versus landmark way-finding strategies is linked to an individual’s gendered experiences of urban life. The study examines way-finding strategies from a sample of 127 gay men and lesbians from the Tallahassee, Florida metropolitan region to explore urban <b>habitation</b> <b>patterns.</b> We find that different way-finding strategies (most commonly a survey or landmark approach) are influenced by the habitus and gendered experiences of fear and anxiety in urban areas. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses suggest that individuals who perceive that their own gender presentation violates gender norms (gender dissonance) experience higher levels of social sanctions (harassment, hostility, and discrimination). In multivariate analysis, the study finds that gender-dissonant men tend to navigate using the landmark way-finding approach usually associated with women, whereas gender-dissonant women navigate using the survey way-finding approach usually associated with men. ...|$|R

These data were related to land cover and land ownership data using a GIS. Housing density increase was particularly pronounced in the central Pine Barrens, an area where seasonal housing units are common. Lakes and streams were more abundant in areas that exhibited highest growth. Within national forest lands, 80 % of the area contained no housing units.

The tell Chogha Golan formed out of consecutive visits of Pre-Pottery Neolithic date that suggest its setting also enabled good access to resources and nourishment in the surrounding area.

40|$|Raised bogs {{are popular}} {{research}} subjects in various scientific disciplines such as palaeobotany, climatology, archaeology and historical geography. However, interdisciplinary studies using a long-term cultural perspective are rare. This paper aims {{to make a}} contribution in that field by exploring the long-term development of raised bogs in the Netherlands, with a main focus on man-land relations. Central are the peatlands in the Pleistocene areas of the country that — with regard to peat inception, development, human use and exploitation — show patterns that are probably similar to those in larger parts of the North-west European Plain. Three spatial research levels are used. The first level offers a concise summary of the current knowledge level on bog development in the Netherlands and adjacent areas. The second level centres on the eastern Dutch region of Twente, and especially attempts to reconstruct the former maximum peat cover. In this region, as in most other parts of the Netherlands, hardly any peat remnants have survived to the present day. The third level consists of two detailed case-studies of smaller areas in Twente. This study shows that raised bogs, soon after they started developing, became intrinsic parts of settlement territories and were used in spatially and temporally varying ways. The assessment and integration of different types of data allows a more detailed and reliable reconstruction and analysis of long-term <b>habitation</b> <b>patterns</b> and man-land relations. The interdisciplinary approach also demonstrates which research deficits exist, allows new interdisciplinary questions to be asked and shows which methods may be applied in future studies...|$|R

Bill passed away on October 25, 2008, but his influence on how we think about China will survive him for a long, long time. (See this list of Skinner’s publications to get an impression of the depth and scope of his contributions.) Bill was a generous and open scholar, and many scholars working in the field today owe him a permanent debt of gratitude for his advice and support in the past several decades. (See this Chinese obituary documenting Skinner’s significance for Chinese scholars.) Bill was a particularly fertile thinker when it came to using analytical and spatial models to explicate social reality in China (and occasionally Japan or France). (His work on Japanese demographic behavior is a great example; he devised an analytical framework for permitting inferences about family planning choices within Japanese peasant families demonstrating very specific preferences about birth order depending on the age and wealth of the parents. See “Conjugal Power in Tokugawa Japanese Families” in Sex and Gender Hierarchies, edited by B. D. Miller (Cambridge University Press, 1989).) Skinner was insistent that social data need to be analyzed in spatial terms; he believed that many social patterns will be best understood when they are placed in their geographical context. And the reason for this is straightforward: human social activity itself is structured in space, through transport systems, <b>habitation</b> <b>patterns,</b> the circuits of merchants and necromancers, and the waterways that integrate social and economic systems in pre-modern societies. He also believed that identifying the right level of geographical aggregation is an important and substantive task; for example, he argued against the idea of making economic comparisons across provinces in China, on the basis that provincial boundaries emerged as a result of a series of administrative accidents rather than defining “natural” boundaries of human activity...|$|R

Major occupations were found spanning the period from the Late Archaic, through the Mississippian periods. Many of the earlier sites, dating to the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, were covered by later occupations. During the Middle Archaic period (c. 4000-6000 BC), larger sites appeared, with locations again guided by environmental factors, as was the case throughout prehistory.|$|R
40|$|Historically, social inequalities have {{persisted in}} the caste Hindu {{structure}} {{and they continue}} even now {{in different parts of}} the Indian sub-continent to this day. Caste discrimination has existed not only in the form of social hierarchy but also in the location of <b>habitations.</b> Sheltering <b>patterns</b> of the so-called untouchables were kept away to keep them separated from the mainstream society which led to denial of all civic amenities and other services which were available to the rest. For instance, the dalit settlements were/are located, invariably in the downstream of the villages, which is unsanitary in all possible means. The widely quoted G. O. of the Madras Presidency [No. 1010 and 1010 (A) ] on the socio-economic conditions of the Chingelput Paraiahs (1892) describe their poor living conditions: " always badly nourished; clad, if at all, in the vilest of rags; eaten up with leprosy or other horrible diseases; hutted like pigs; untaught; uncared for, and unpitied''. Similar conditions had persisted and continued in the different parts of the Madras Presidency till independence. However, several social movements had attempted to eradicate these inequalities, but they had not produced the expected results over the period. Neither the pre-colonial rulers nor the colonial administrators had initiated any constructive attempts to eradicate these social inequalities, particularly in terms of their habitations. ...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) This {{thesis is}} based on surveys of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{conducted}} at Angkor, Cambodia. The appraisal of preceding remote sensing surveys led to selective ground based prospection for archaeological objects of interest on different scales. The successive relocation {{of the political and}} religious centre from the 9 th to the 14 th century has left a palimpsest landscape that reaches from small artificial habitation mounds, masonry monuments and their enclosures, to the extensive water management network of channels and earthworks that covered large parts of the floodplain between the Kulen Hills and Lake Tonle Sap. To make efficient use of the technique, the GPR survey had to be adjusted to those dimensions. The area-covering grid method was chosen for small scale surveys on <b>habitation</b> <b>patterns,</b> production sites and cemeteries, testing potential and limits in the application. A major factor in the measuring and processing of data was the floodplain geology of predominantly clayey sand and an environment prone to inundation that provided varying signal penetration depths depending on either compact or soft soil. For the larger scales, GPR was used in combination with GPS, GIS and remote sensing data sets. The concept of spatial configuration of monuments in and outside of enclosures led the search for remains of missing laterite and sandstone structures. A survey in the centre of Angkor Wat revealed the outline of six towers as part of a potential quincunx formation. They were further analysed by excavations to establish a preliminary construction history of the area. Surveys inside the peripheral enclosures of Chau Srei Vibol, Banteay Sra and Prasat Komnap showed evidence of demolished structures, some of it possibly from the Angkorian period. For questions concerning the functioning of a water management system in the Angkorian floodplain, GPR profiles in search for infrastructure were conducted alongside and over the embankments of the giant reservoirs. Evidence of outlets in the central areas of the eastern embankments of all four baray at Angkor confirmed them being part of the network. On the largest scale, GPR transects were run across parts of the floodplain to investigate the network of canals and earthworks that had been mapped by remote sensing. Obstacles, profiles and grids as well as the detected anomalies were integrated into a geo-referenced GIS database. Potential connections between centres and temples were integrated at areas where associated and previously mapped earthworks discontinued. Anomalies associated to the water management features were classified according to their characteristics and potential function as former artificial and natural channels, moats, ponds as well as masonry remains, and analysed with regard to archaeological maps and available remote sensing data. Newly acquired high resolution satellite radar (TerraSAR-X) data was used to evaluate a potential relation between water saturation and anomalies. The complete dataset was analysed for a complementation of archaeological maps and with the intent to separate features of the artificial canal network of Angkor from the natural landscape and the original distribution of rivers...|$|R
40|$|In {{fields of}} {{research}} such as archaeology, botany etc, researchers are often required to conduct {{what is known}} as “geo-referencing”, a task which requires interpreting natural language descriptions of specimen findings and estimating their geodetic coordinates. This task is extremely important as it enables researchers to place specimen on a map, and in so doing allow them to analyze variables such as growth <b>patterns,</b> <b>habitation,</b> and climate conditions, etc. Unfortunately however, databases containing natural language descriptions of specimen locality are massive; and manually conducting geo-referencing on such sizable databases is virtually impossible. Researchers will often spend weeks on end attempting to geo-reference important findings, with the outcome of success being very limited due to time and resource constraints. It {{is for this reason that}} we have undertaken a project that investigates the possibility of a system to be able to understand locality descriptions and geo-reference specimen data on behalf of a human. Botanists (and related others) would the...|$|R

There are two major island groups in the central portion of the bay: Islesboro to the north, and the Fox Islands (politically divided between North Haven and Vinalhaven) to the south. In the 1970s the Fox Islands were studied intensively by archaeologists of the Maine State Museum to understand <b>habitation</b> and subsistence <b>patterns</b> of its prehistoric occupants. In addition to identifying more than 130 sites in both communities, this survey work was able to establish chronologies of occupation and modes of subsistence in the area. Eight significant sites were identified, and have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Turner Farm, Turner Farm II, Mullen's Cove, Joe Amesbury Place, Bortz-Lewis Site, Bull Rock Site, Cabot I Site, and Crocker Site. All of these have as a major component a shell midden, each of which yieleded evidence of habitation in the Late Archaic and Ceramic phases.|$|R
40|$|Sudan is {{a country}} that has {{witnessed}} huge population displacements, some due to natural causes and others due to a multitude of ill-devised government policies. The worst form of displacement the country witnessed however has been war-related displacements which have been devastating both in terms of scale and effect. An estimated 6 million were reported to have been displaced in 2005 due to the war in the southern and western part of the country, this was reported as the highest number worldwide and which constituted 14 % of the countrys total population. All this places Sudan on the map as the country of displacement par excellence with millions of displaced trekking its vast terrain in search of a suitable place to relocate, or a better place to position themselves. As a result of these multiple and compounded displacements the country needs {{to come to terms with}} what is at hand, what is jeopardized and what opportunities are being developed. In these extreme conditions queries arise concerning notions of settlement, questions such as what does place and home mean in such a country and to whom? In this thesis we endeavor to understand how displacement may affect and redefine such notions, hypothesizing on whether something can be made out of the outcome. Displacement in Sudan has certainly been too broad a topic which has succeeded in attracting the interest of historians, political scientists, environmentalists, and a great number of international development and humanitarian organizations. Scholars such as Johnson, De Waal, Mamdani, Tigani and Carloyn Fluehr-Lobban, have produced a corpus of literature concerning this subject. In all this architects and urbanists have hardly had a say, this comes as rather unusual given the fact that most of these displacements are played out and have their greatest impacts on urban settlements. In this dissertation we attempt to fill this gap, our attempt however is not exclusive of what has already been done but rather stitches together the different disciplines that have tackled this subject bringing them together in a singular work. The spatial dimension is used here as the thread which binds these disparate and vast disciplines together, and our two cases, that of Khartoum and Yei, are used as the platform for their engagement. All the disciplines presented seem to converge in the two cases, clearly illustrating the extent of, and the multiplicity and complexity of the manifestations that result out of displacement. The underlying questions in this dissertation therefore are concerned with the meanings of place and home, and the techniques developed to reconstitute these meanings in circumstances far from the ordinary. We question the links between place and home, identity and territoriality, wealth and investments; how these concepts are played out in conditions of displacement, and how they might come to affect the postwar urbanism that begins to emerge.
