5|$|Sakic's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} abilities helped carry the Avalanche {{in the years}} after their 2001 Stanley Cup, which saw the team lose key players to retirement and free agency, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 2004–05 lockout.|$|E
5|$|The Alliance for Sweden {{received}} {{a majority of}} votes, but not full majority in Parliament. But the fragmented opposition, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> entrance of the Sweden Democrats in parliament, the government could continue.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{sought to}} develop their own players, rather than buying them from other teams, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{investment}} of $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in Lyn Lary and Jimmie Reese in 1927. However, Weiss and Bill Essick convinced Barrow to approve the purchase of Joe DiMaggio from the Pacific Coast League.|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} 1930s, and <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> 1945, <b>the</b> {{magazine}} mostly became {{a copy of}} Pioneer and was eventually merged with it.|$|R

5|$|After decisive Ottoman {{victory at}} the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, and <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Croats {{continued}} defending themselves against the Ottoman attacks. The Ottoman conquest {{during the early years}} of the 16th century prompted the formation of the Uskoks, which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kružić, also called (Prince of Klis). As a part of the Habsburg defensive system, Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position. They fought almost alone against the Ottomans, and for more than two decades defended the fortress against the Ottoman attacks.|$|E
5|$|After the Camp Jackson Affair, {{there were}} no more {{military}} threats to Union control until 1864, although guerrilla activity continued in rural areas {{for the duration of the}} war. Union General John C. Frémont placed the city under martial law in August 1861 to suppress sedition; after Fremont's dismissal, Union army forces continued to suppress pro-Confederate demonstrations. The war significantly damaged St. Louis commerce, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy blockaded the Mississippi shutting off St. Louis's connection to eastern markets. War also slowed growth during the 1860s, with an increase of only 43,000 residents from 1860 to 1866.|$|E
5|$|Akhtar {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the nine judges in the beauty pageant Femina Miss India (2002). He was the judge on the first season of the dance-reality show Nach Baliye (2005). He hosted a TV show on NDTV Imagine, called Oye! It's Friday! in the same year. He has endorsed several brands as a part of his career, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> release of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. These include Hindustan Unilever's water purifier product titled Pureit, Chivas Regal, Britannia Nutri Choice Biscuits, IndusInd Bank, Dulux Paint, and Titan Industries, to name a few.|$|E
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> Roman conquest the Ilercavones became romanized, {{much like}} the other Iberian tribes in the peninsula. Gradually, they became assimilated into <b>the</b> Roman population, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> {{acquiring}} <b>the</b> Latin language as their own vernacular.|$|R
30|$|State-owned or state-controlled {{corporations}} {{are more likely}} to have interlocking directorate networks; this is <b>especially</b> true <b>after</b> <b>the</b> establishment of SASACs.|$|R

5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E
5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E
50|$|Several allied aircrew who crashed or {{landed in}} Ireland were interned though many were {{returned}} to Britain or Northern Ireland, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> 1942. <b>The</b> final release was made in June 1944.|$|R

5|$|By 2003, many Turks {{had come}} to see American foreign policy in the region as a threat. Matters were not helped by the {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP led to an immediate increase in tensions with America, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, and <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of {{megalomania}} and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled {{with his own}} ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, {{in as much as}} he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E
50|$|Dorothee Elmiger (born 1985 in Wetzikon) is a Swiss writer. She {{presently}} {{lives in}} Switzerland. Elmiger {{is considered one}} of the most promising young Swiss writers, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> winning <b>the</b> second Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, the Kelag Prize, in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The “Macedonian Question,” became <b>especially</b> {{prominent}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Balkan wars in 1912-1913, {{following the}} defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the subsequent division of the Region of Macedonia between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia.|$|R
50|$|Through <b>the</b> 1970s, and <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> mid-1975, <b>the</b> {{party was}} also shaken by {{factional}} struggles. There were even armed attempts to topple Pol Pot. The resultant purges reached a crest in 1977 and 1978 when thousands, including some important KCP leaders, were executed.|$|R
5|$|During the 58-day voyage, twopeople died {{of illness}} and onewoman {{gave birth to a}} child. The voyage to Santo Domingo had lasted longer than expected, and {{provisions}} ran low, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> loss of the St. François. La Salle had little money with which to replenish supplies, and finally two of the merchants aboard the expedition sold some of their trade goods to the islanders, and lent their profits to La Salle. To fill the gaps left after several men deserted, La Salle recruited a few islanders to join the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Finnish-German {{relations}} cooled {{after the}} National Socialists rose {{to power in}} 1933—Finns admired Imperial Germany, not the radical and anti-democratic Nazi regime. Finnish conservatives did not accept the state violence and anti-church policies of the Nazis. Still, there was sympathy for German aims to revise the Treaty of Versailles, although the official Finnish policy was reserved, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Finland even recalled its ambassador for a short period. Finnish Nazis and ultranationalist parties such as the IKL achieved only minor support in several elections, especially {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Mäntsälä rebellion in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war against Mexico in May 1845 and <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> claim by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After gold was discovered in California in 1849, more White emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than ever had before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with Whites.|$|E
50|$|Through <b>the</b> 1970s, and <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> mid-1975, <b>the</b> {{party was}} shaken by {{factional}} struggles, including armed attempts to topple Pol Pot.

30|$|Fatigue and {{insufficiency}} fractures of {{the pelvis}} and lower limb come in many guises. The common presentations {{are well known}} to radiologists yet can still pose diagnostic difficulties <b>especially</b> early <b>after</b> <b>the</b> onset of clinical symptoms.|$|R
25|$|Each year {{starting}} with his 100th, The Rainbow held a Birthday Party for Breuning.

5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Shepard {{accepted}} {{the position of}} pastor at Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, where he would remain {{for the rest of}} his life. The church struggled financially, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> onset of the Great Depression in 1929, and several congregation members mortgaged their homes to keep the church afloat. Shepard's reputation as a minister grew, and he served as assistant secretary of the National Baptist Convention and associate editor of the National Baptist Voice.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, home matches {{were mostly}} played in smaller towns with no {{professional}} football clubs. As the team became more successful, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> World Cup win in 2003, {{the number of}} spectators rose accordingly. Today, the team usually plays in stadiums with 10,000 to 25,000 seats. The ten largest German cities have only hosted five international matches. The team have played twice in Frankfurt and Berlin, and once Hamburg. Bremen, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen, Cologne, Munich and Stuttgart have never hosted an international match of the women's team.|$|E
50|$|Views {{from the}} lamp {{room in the}} Withernsea Lighthouse are breathtaking, <b>especially</b> <b>after</b> {{climbing}} <b>the</b> 144 steps. There is no lamp, however, as this was removed after closure and sent to St Mary's Lighthouse in Tyne and Wear where it can still be seen to this day.|$|R
50|$|Back in the spa, Corazon puts a guilt trip on Celine {{for letting}} JB {{shoulder}} the burden in their family.
