5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and <b>elective</b> <b>abortion.</b> Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of the party's national and state candidates are pro-life and oppose <b>elective</b> <b>abortion</b> on religious or moral grounds. While many advocate exceptions {{in the case of}} incest, rape or the mother's life being at risk, in 2012 the party approved a platform advocating banning abortions without exception. They oppose government funding for abortions.|$|E
25|$|Musgrave {{identifies}} as pro-life and staunchly opposes <b>elective</b> <b>abortion.</b> At the national level, she {{has supported the}} Partial Birth Abortion Ban and the Child Custody Protection Act.

50|$|Anti-abortion movements, also {{referred}} to as pro-life movements, are involved in the abortion debate advocating against the practice of abortion and its legality. Many anti-abortion movements began as countermovements in response to the legalization of <b>elective</b> <b>abortions.</b> Abortion is the intentional termination of a human pregnancy.|$|R
50|$|Also that year, in an {{important}} reproductive rights case, a federal court upheld the NYCLU's position that denial of Medicaid payments for <b>elective</b> <b>abortions</b> is unconstitutional.|$|R
25|$|Identifying as pro-life, McDonnell campaigned as an {{opponent}} of <b>elective</b> <b>abortion.</b> He did not favor standard exceptions on abortion in cases of rape and incest. As a state legislator, {{he had been the}} lead sponsor for legislation to ban partial birth abortions, as well as for legislation requiring parental consent for minors' abortions, and informed consent for women seeking abortions. He opposed state and federal government funding for elective abortions.|$|E
25|$|Today, the Southern Baptist Convention, {{the largest}} Protestant {{denomination}} in the United States, opposes <b>elective</b> <b>abortion</b> except {{to save the}} life of the mother. The Southern Baptist Convention calls on Southern Baptists to work to change the laws in order to make abortion illegal in most cases. Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission from 1988 to 2013, said that he believes abortion is more damaging than anything else, even poverty.|$|E
25|$|During 2009, as Congress debated {{proposals}} {{for health insurance}} reform, Romney {{said that he was}} in favor of increased health insurance portability, coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system, an emphasis on preventative care, loosening restrictions on importation of prescription drugs, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. He said he opposed efforts to provide non-emergency health coverage to undocumented immigrants and he supported the Hyde Amendment prohibiting government funding for <b>elective</b> <b>abortion.</b> Romney opposed a federal single-payer system, but supported state efforts to reduce the uninsured population.|$|E
50|$|Perry is pro-life and opposes {{government}} funding for <b>elective</b> <b>abortions.</b> In 2003, Perry signed the Prenatal Protection Act, which explicitly included fetuses in its definition of human life.|$|R

2500|$|The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America {{maintains}} a pro-choice position when fetuses are aborted before viability {{outside of the}} womb. The ELCA position statement says abortion should be an option of last resort, the ELCA community should work to {{reduce the need for}} <b>elective</b> <b>abortions,</b> and that as a community, [...] "the number of induced abortions is a source of deep concern to this church. We mourn the loss of life that God has created." [...] The ELCA Social Statement on Abortion adds: [...] "The church recognizes that there can be sound reasons for ending a pregnancy through induced abortion. [...] These are the threat to a woman's physical life; when pregnancy has resulted from rape, incest or sexual violence; and fetal abnormalities incompatible with life. The church opposes legal restrictions on abortion and provides health-care benefits to its employees that cover <b>elective</b> <b>abortions.</b> Some hospitals affiliated with the church perform <b>elective</b> <b>abortions.</b>|$|R
25|$|In April 2010, McDonnell {{signed a}} bill seeking to nullify the {{insurance}} purchase requirement in the then proposed federal health care legislation. On March 10, 2010, before Congress finished its final consideration of the package, a bipartisan Virginia Healthcare Freedom Act passed the General Assembly by an 80–17 majority, which McDonnell signed on March 24, 2010. McDonnell supported Virginia's legal challenge to {{the constitutionality of the}} final Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Although abortion funding was not debated during the regular session of the General Assembly, McDonnell raised the issue through the use of his amendatory veto power. During the April 21, 2010 veto session, the Virginia legislature passed restrictions on state public funding for <b>elective</b> <b>abortion</b> except in the instances of rape, incest, life of the mother, or life-threatening fetal anomaly.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum {{aspiration}} in {{the first}} trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion, and can be performed in a primary care office, abortion clinic, or hospital. Complications are rare and can include uterine perforation, pelvic infection, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate. Infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the United States. The rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion {{in the first}} trimester is similar {{regardless of whether the}} procedure is performed in a hospital, surgical center, or office. Preventive antibiotics (such as doxycycline or metronidazole) are typically given before <b>elective</b> <b>abortion,</b> as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection. The rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid-level practitioner. Complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen. Second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{has stated}} that Roe v. Wade is settled law and is {{self-described}} as pro-choice. He is against intact dilation and evacuation abortions (known legally as [...] "partial birth abortion") and has spoken in favor of parental consent for minors who seek an abortion. He {{said he would not}} use abortion as a litmus test in Supreme Court confirmations. He opposes federal funding for <b>elective</b> <b>abortion</b> in accordance with the Hyde Amendment.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2013, Engh {{made the}} {{decision}} to drop health insurance coverage of <b>elective</b> <b>abortions</b> for the Catholic university's faculty and staff. He {{wrote a letter to the}} school's faculty and staff stating that he and the university [...] "studied how the school can structure its medical insurance plans in 2014 to be compliant with federal and California laws and regulations while representing its values as a Jesuit university." [...] Neither the Affordable Care Act or California law mandate employers to cover <b>elective</b> <b>abortions.</b> The faculty senate of the school took a vote and declared Engh's resolution invalid, but the final decision rests with the board of trustees of the school.|$|R
50|$|McDonnell is pro-life.

2500|$|The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) {{generally}} takes {{a pro-choice}} stance. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) {{believes that the}} choice to receive an <b>elective</b> <b>abortion</b> can be [...] "morally acceptable;" [...] however, the denomination does not condone late abortions where the fetus is viable and the mother's life is not in danger.|$|E
2500|$|The LDS Church opposes <b>elective</b> <b>abortion</b> [...] "for {{personal}} or social convenience" [...] but states that abortion {{could be an}} acceptable option in cases of rape, incest, danger to the health or life of the mother, or where the fetus has been diagnosed with [...] "severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth." [...] The church [...] "strongly discourages surgical sterilization as an elective form of birth control".|$|E
2500|$|During the 2004 presidential election, Burke {{stated that}} he would not give communion to John Kerry or other Catholic {{politicians}} who publicly support legalized abortion. He also wrote a pastoral letter saying Catholics should not vote for politicians who support abortion or other [...] "anti-life" [...] practices. Burke later clarified his position, stating that one could vote for a pro-choice politician and not commit a mortal sin, if one believed there was a more significant moral issue than abortion at hand, but he also {{stated that he}} could not think of any sort of issue that would qualify. In a September 2008 interview, Burke said that [...] "the Democratic Party risks transforming itself definitively into a 'party of death', because of its choices on bioethical questions", especially <b>elective</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In April 2010, Hoffmann {{introduced}} legislation to forbid insurance companies operating within Louisiana from offering coverage of <b>elective</b> <b>abortions.</b> The only procedures permitted {{under the new}} law, all of whose opponents came from the Black Caucus, would involve miscarriages or abortions to save the mother's life. Hoffmann said that his law {{was a response to}} the national health care measure signed by U.S. President Barack Obama in March 2010. Hoffmann added: [...] "Louisiana is a very pro-life state," [...] and his legislative district in the northeastern quadrant of the state is particularly conservative. The legislature also denies medical malpractice protection to doctors who perform certain <b>elective</b> <b>abortions</b> and gives the state the authority to shut down abortion clinics deemed not in compliance with the law.|$|R
50|$|On January 22, 2016, Daleiden {{appeared}} on C-SPAN for a question-and-answer session that included viewer call-ins.

In general, members are encouraged obey the law of the country in which they live, although there have been notable exceptions. The church discourages gambling in all forms, including lotteries.|$|E
2500|$|Cantor opposed {{public funding}} of {{embryonic}} stem cell research and opposed <b>elective</b> <b>abortion.</b> He was rated 100% by the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) and 0% by NARAL Pro-Choice America, indicating a pro-life voting record.

2500|$|The current church {{stance is}} that [...] "decisions {{about birth control}} and the {{consequences}} of those decisions rest solely with each married couple" [...] and that they should consider [...] "the physical and mental health of the mother and father and their capacity to provide the basic necessities of life for their children" [...] when planning a family. However, in teaching children about sexual morals and birth control, Mormons parents have ranked among the lowest in comfort discussing these topics with their children among US parents of all religious affiliations. In discussing another method of family planning the church [...] "strongly discourages" [...] surgical sterilization like vasectomies and tubal ligation and only allows it for serious medical conditions after discussing it with a bishop.

2500|$|The 2010 Massachusetts Senate special {{election}} victory of Scott Brown seriously imperiled {{the prospects of}} a health care reform bill, as Democrats lost their 60-seat Senate super-majority. The White House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi engaged in an extensive campaign to convince both centrists and liberals in the House to pass the Senate's health care bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In March 2010, after Obama announced an executive order reinforcing the current law against spending federal funds for <b>elective</b> <b>abortion</b> services, the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The bill, which had passed the Senate in December 2009, did not receive a single Republican vote in either house. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the PPACA into law. The New York Times described the PPACA as [...] "the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades," [...] while the Washington Post noted {{that it was the}} biggest expansion of health insurance coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Both houses of Congress also passed a reconciliation measure to make significant changes and corrections to the PPACA; this second bill was signed into law on March 30, 2010.
