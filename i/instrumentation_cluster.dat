40|$|The {{importance}} of the ambience presented by instrumentation in the vehicle of today is of great significance for the automotive industry. The rapid technological development of electronic equipment has enabled {{the large amount of}} information devices in the drivers' environment. The types of driver information and their appearances are well identified by car manufacturers, but {{there is a lack of}} knowledge regarding drivers' perceptions of <b>instrumentation</b> <b>clusters</b> as well as their appearance. To increase this knowledge a study was conducted in order to measure these perceptions. Twenty-three subjects were studied using a method consisting of eye-tracking, assessments and interviews. Each subject was to view eight clusters and to assess each cluster according to six different semantic descriptions. The interviews were based on the subject's individual eye-tracking data. The subject was monitored by an eye-tracking equipment during the assessment task. The results showed that there were some significant correlations between time spent viewing a cluster and its assessment. Moreover, the results also give a view on how clusters are assessed and why they are assessed in particular ways.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to design, construct and test a wave energy harvesting system based on data acquired over a focused, 10 week continuation of a prior, related feasibility study. It {{has been shown that}} a pelton system is a viable solution for instrument power needs onboard a vertical profiler deployed in the open ocean with a surface to bottom interval between approximately 1 and 300 meters. The pelton system would extend the deployment times of <b>instrumentation</b> <b>clusters</b> possibly indefinitely through the use of rechargeable batteries. System efficiency was increased through testing and subsequent modification of water-jet orifices. The pelton wheel design was improved upon, providing a further increase in system efficiency. The findings of this study will be used to guide the construction of a sea worthy pelton prototype system to be tested in the coming year. Project Description “This engineering intern project will support the development and testing of a device for collecting wave-energy on-board a profiling oceanographic instrument. A prototype of the system is being developed now and will be tested in the summer of 2009. Projects related to this effort include efficiency improvement of the system through lab testing, at-sea deployment of a prototype system, and analysis of system performance from data collected during test deployments. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{realisation}} {{of specific}} automotive applications with “Full ” CAN functionality at “Basic ” CAN cost on highly integrated 8 -Bit microcontroller of NEC’s 78 K/ 0 family. CAN {{today is the}} most widespread serial communication protocol in automotive applications. Coming from the high speed, high performance applications like motor management, where CAN is fairly well established in almost all major car makers around the globe, it has now conquered the wide field of comfort and convenience electronics as well as driver information systems. Although numerous silicon manufacturers have introduced {{a wide range of}} integrated microcontrollers with on-chip CAN, there was still lack of Application Specific Standard Products (ASSP) with CAN. NEC, an early pioneer of CAN activities, has established a complete new family of highly integrated microcontrollers specifically for the area of automotive <b>instrumentation</b> <b>clusters.</b> The new “Direct storage CAN ” (DCAN) module of NEC ideally combines a CAN 2. 0 b extended frame compliant with “Full ” CAN functionality at “Basic ” CAN cost.

40|$|Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), wtih their highly {{parallel}} structure, is {{a powerful}} tool to manipulate computer graphics and process large amounts of data in parallel. GPUs are becoming increasingly popular in today's embedded system world. One typical example is the modern vehicle. Nowadays, modern vehicles are often required to run graphic applications such as <b>instrumentation</b> <b>cluster,</b> navigation system, media player or games with higher graphic quality concurrently on multiple displays. Compared to the CPU, GPU is more suitable to fulfil these requirements. In {{order to reduce the}} hardware cost and the power consumption at the same time, a good solution is to share a single GPU for multiple applications. Thus emerges the need of GPU real time scheduling. Since current GPUs do not support preemption, accurate prediction of the GPU command execution time becomes an indispensable precondition for scheduling. In this work, the driver model and hardware features of a typical 3 D embedded GPU is analysed. Concepts to measure GPU execution time and other statistics is present and implemented. The measured execution time and the relevant statistics of the GPU command group allow us to explore the factors and metrics that affect the execution time of GPU rendering commands, more specifically, OpenGL ES 2. 0 commands/APIs. Different models are developed to predict the important time-consuming rendering commands: Flush, Swap, Clear, Draw and Texture Loading. As for the Draw command, a recent-history-based approach is proposed to estimate the number of fragments. Finally, the accuracy of the measurement and prediction is evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Calcareous {{wetlands}} {{are rare}} in New England {{due to the}} limited occurrence of limestone-rich bedrock. Because of their great floristic diversity and their support of numerous rare and uncommon plant species, these habitats are targeted for conservation. Little {{is known about the}} intricate workings of these ecosystems. This research contributes significantly to understanding the complex biogeochemical relationships that exist between the plant and soil systems in calcareous freshwater wetland environments as a whole. ^ A 3 -year field study was initiated in May 1996, to collect data on soils, geochemistry, and hydrology along a 250 -m-long transect. Monitoring was concentrated within the rooting zone. Field monitoring and water sampling were conducted biweekly across three growing seasons. Measurements were made for soil-water pH, conductivity, total iron, alkalinity and several dissolved metals. Strong seasonal patterns were observed for several parameters including calcium and iron. Seasonal changes in geochemistry were evaluated using Solmineq. 88, a thermodynamic model. ^ In July 1997, soils were sampled adjacent to each replicate <b>instrumentation</b> <b>cluster</b> and standard analyses conducted. Significant differences were measured between the stations for pH, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable calcium, phosphorus, manganese, and biologically available iron. ^ A detailed vegetation analysis was completed in July 1997. High species richness and turnover were measured across the site. Ordination and cluster techniques were used to analyze the vegetation patterns and relate these to environmental site variables. The ordinations suggest that gradients in both soil chemistry (e. g., pH, exchangeable calcium, phosphorus, and iron) and geochemistry (e. g., pH and dissolved calcium) may have strong influences on the vegetation patterns observed in this study. ^ These research results will serve as a baseline for the geochemistry in the greater watershed region, representing a relatively undisturbed system. No fen studies currently exist (for any geographical region) that monitored soil and geochemical parameters throughout the growing season. This research demonstrates the importance of seasonal sampling to describe the cycles present in site biogeochemistry accurately, and it defines several geochemical parameters that strongly influence plant species occurrence and distribution within these environments. This detailed analysis provides valuable information for conservation managers seeking to identify areas for future conservation, preservation, or restoration efforts. ...|$|E

40|$|In this work, we have {{developed}} Caft, a middleware that runs {{on top of the}} Terracotta system and has the capacity to run simple multi-threaded Java applications in a transparent way, scheduling threads across the several nodes in a Terracotta cluster and taking advan-tage of the extra computational and memory resources available. We use bytecode <b>instrumentations</b> to add <b>clustering</b> capabilities to the multi-threaded Java application, as well as extra synchroniza-tion if needed. The middleware supports several modes, in order to achieve a balance between transparency and flexibility. We tested the middleware with a Fibonacci computing application, an Open Source renderer (Sunflow) and an application that multiplies a ma-trix by a vector. We concluded that our middleware is scalable, as it allows a multi-threaded application to achieve lower execution times by adding more nodes to a Terracotta cluster...|$|R
40|$|Distinctive {{sources of}} ions {{reside in the}} plasmasphere, plasmasheet, and ring current regions at {{discrete}} energies constitute the major plasma populations in the inner/middle magnetosphere. They contribute to the electrodynamics of the ionosphere-magnetosphere system as important carriers of the global current system, in triggering; geomagnetic storm and substorms, as well as critical components of plasma instabilities such as reconnection and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the magnetospheric boundaries.

40|$|Sistan plain, {{located in}} the north of Sistan and Baluchestan province, {{is one of the most}} {{significant}} cultural area in eastern Iran. This region is located between south Asia (Indus valley) and Western Asia (Mesopotamia) and also has been a connector between cultures of Central Asia and South of Persian Gulf area. Sistan was the main area to connecting between west and south Asia. Much of the cultural items found in the site under exploration were huge bulk of diverse pottery. Most pieces of pottery found in the Sistan plain were of the pottery belonging to Shahr-e Sukhteh, and its villages dating back to the third millennium BC, Dahane Gholaman of the Achaemenid period 550 BC and a large number of sites belonging to the Islamic period, which vary in term of the colour ranging from buff, gray, black and red and in terms of thickness. This study aims to determine the morphological relations of the pottery of Sistan plain using semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) methods. In this regard, 52 pieces of pottery from prehistoric, historic and Islamic eras, which were collected from archaeological surveys, were analysed. The samples were gathered from Gerdi domain, Dahaneh Gholaman, Shahr-e Sukhteh, south of the Hamoun Lake, Rostam castle and around the Shileh River. The <b>instrumentation</b> and <b>cluster</b> analysis of pottery sherds indicated that the prehistoric pottery pieces of Sistan plain have a different composition compared with that of Sistan area. Moreover, the glazed pottery pieces of the Islamic era are different from those of Sistan plain in terms of their chemical and have silica compounds, gypsum and aluminosilicate, which indicates the continuity of local technology, production and trade in Sistan to the Islamic period. In addition, the composition and structure of pottery in this region accounts for the high level of skills and knowledge of potters, who made a variety of pottery pieces with diverse applications in the local communities, which continued from prehistory to the Islamic era in this plain...|$|R
