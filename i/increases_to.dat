5|$|The {{traffic density}} on I-68 in Garrett County is rather sparse {{compared}} to that of Allegany County. At the Maryland–West Virginia state line, there is an annual average daily traffic of 11,581vehicles per day. This density <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> its highest point in Garrett County at exit22, where US219 leaves I-68; 19,551vehicles per day drive through this section. At the Allegany County line, the traffic density decreases slightly to 18,408. In Allegany County, the vehicle count <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 28,861 in LaVale, and to the freeway's peak of 46,191 at the first US220 interchange (exit42) in Cumberland. East of Cumberland, the vehicle count decreases to 16,551 at Martins Mountain and stays nearly constant to the eastern terminus of I-68 in Hancock.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease.

5|$|According to the 2010 census, the City and County of Denver {{contains}} 600,158 {{people and}} 285,797 households. The population density is 3,698 inhabitants {{per square mile}} (1,428/km²) including the airport. There are 285,797 housing units at an average density of 1,751 per square mile (676/km²). However, the average density throughout most Denver neighborhoods tends to be higher. Without the 80249 zip code (47.3 sqmi, 8,407 residents) near the airport, the average density <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> around 5,470 per square mile.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{clubs in}} the Copa Libertadores receive US$250,000 for {{advancing}} into the second stage and US$300,000 per home match in the group phase. That amount is derived from television rights and stadium advertising. The payment per home match <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> US$550,000 in the round of 16. The prize money then increases as each quarterfinalist receives US$650,000, US$700,000 is given to each semifinalist, US$1,000,000 is awarded the runner-up, and the winner earns US$2,300,000.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 80% after the first week.|$|E

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the diet of the American black duck consists of approximately 80% plant food and 20% animal food. The animal food diet <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 85% during winter. During nesting, {{the proportion of}} invertebrates increases. Ducklings mostly eat water invertebrates for the first 12 days after hatching, including aquatic snowbugs, snails, mayflies, dragonflies, beetles, flies, caddisflies and larvae. After this, they shift to seeds and other plant food.|$|E
5|$|Governor Dayton {{formally}} {{proposed a}} state budget on February 15, calling for $37 billion in state spending, necessitating cuts of about 10 percent to most state agencies. Because {{the state was}} projected to take in only about $32 billion in taxes, {{the rest of the}} budget shortfall was covered by <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> income and property taxes for wealthier Minnesotans, as he had promised during his campaign. Meanwhile, Republican legislators, led by House Speaker Kurt Zellers and Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch, demanded the budget be kept below $32 billion.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the premium}} tax credits are {{mandatory}} spending, meaning all those eligible under the ACA receive them without Congressional appropriation. These adjust with premium <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> limit after-subsidy premium payments by ACA enrollees to a fixed percentage of income. Based on President Trump's threats {{to end the}} CSR payments during early 2017, several insurers and actuarial groups estimated {{this resulted in a}} 20 percentage point or more increase in premiums for the 2018 plan year. In other words, premium increases expected to be 10% or less in 2018 became 28-40% instead.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling {{began in the early}} eighteenth century. By 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent. From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, and after World War II, the whale population <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 33 percent of the pre-whaling population. Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling nations in the nineteenth century, while in the twentieth century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.|$|E
5|$|The fetal {{hypothalamus}} and pituitary {{start to}} secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18–20 weeks, {{the production of}} thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically significant and self-sufficient level. Fetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains low, less than 15ng/dL until 30 weeks, and <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 50ng/dL at full-term. The fetus needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism. The presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment.|$|E
5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> infinity. The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E
