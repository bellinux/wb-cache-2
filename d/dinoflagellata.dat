40|$|The {{study of}} a small saline {{eutrophic}} lake was performed under meromictic and holomictic conditions. The meromictic period was characterised by anoxic conditions in the bottom layer with high sulphide and nutrient concentrations. The depth of the nutricline varied as affected by thermohaline conditions in the water column. In late summer 1997, holomictic conditions replaced ordinary meromitic conditions in the lake. This transformation caused anoxia to spread throughout the water column and mass mortality of almost all the organisms occured. Thereafter, oxic conditions were re-established slowly as the new phytoplankton population developed. As {{a consequence of the}} particulate organic matter decay, inorganic N and P concentrations increased and had doubled approximately six weeks after the mass mortality. The revitalisation of the phytoplankton population was initiated immediately after the mass mortality by the development of "microflagellate" species, which were favoured by the high ammonia concentrations. The larger phytoplankton species (diatoms and <b>dinoflagellatae)</b> developed at the expense of smaller ones when nitrate became the dominant nutrient in the water column. A year after the mass mortality the composition of the phytoplankton population was the same as before...|$|R

5000|$|The {{dinoflagellates}} (Greek δῖνος dinos [...] "whirling" [...] and Latin flagellum [...] "whip, scourge") are a {{large group}} of flagellate eukaryotes that constitute the phylum <b>Dinoflagellata.</b> Most are marine plankton, but they are common in freshwater habitats, as well. Their populations are distributed depending on temperature, salinity, or depth. Many dinoflagellates are known to be photosynthetic, but a large fraction of these are in fact mixotrophic, combining photosynthesis with ingestion of prey (phagotrophy). In terms of number of species, dinoflagellates form one of the largest groups of marine eukaryotes, although this group is substantially smaller than the diatoms. [...] Some species are endosymbionts of marine animals and play an important part in the biology of coral reefs. Other dinoflagellates are unpigmented predators on other protozoa, and a few forms are parasitic (see for example Oodinium, Pfiesteria).

40|$|This work investigates for {{the first}} time the {{seasonal}} changes in phytoplankton, bacteria, and photosynthetic picoplankton as well as nutrient concentrations on the North-western shelf of Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Seawater samples were collected off Penneshaw desalination plant, where waters from the Investigator Straight, Gulf Saint Vincent and Backstairs Passage meet. Low nutrient values were measured throughout the period of study (July 2012 –July 2013) suggesting the occurrence of oligotrophic conditions on the region.

Prochlorococcus Cyanobacteria prevailed among picophytoplankton during most of the period of study (July 2012 –July 2013). Previous studies indicate that oligotrophic environments are indeed typically dominated by Prochlorococcus. The dominant species found here seem either adapted to grow under low nutrient concentrations, possessing high surface/volume ratios, or have a mixotrophic behaviour allowing them to complement photosynthesis with predation.

40|$|Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous {{deposits}} of the Crimea Peninsula {{are rich in}} microfossils frequently used for stratigraphic interpretations. In case of foraminifera, the research has been carried predomi- nantly on assemblages obtained by washing the rock samples. The present paper is based on investigations of thin sections from the more indurated sediments that seldom were objects of study. Its goal was to obtain additional information on age and environment of sediments studied. Over 250 thin sections from 16 surface outcrops yielded abundant foraminifera from which over fourty are described herein. Many foraminiferal species (e. g., Labirynthina mirabilis, Parurgonina caelinensis, Neokilianina rahonensis, Amijella amiji, Anchispirocyclina lusitanica) are stratigraphically significant and known from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian of the Mediterranean Tethys. The Early Cretaceous fauna is represented by Protopeneroplis ultragranulata, Everticyclammina kelleri, Nautiloculina bronnimanni, Monsalevia salevensis, and Mayncina bulgarica. Generally, the investigated fauna is typical for paleoenvironment of the carbonate platform. Older (Kimmeridgian-Tithonian) assemblages represent the inner, and younger (Berriasian) outer parts of the platform.

40|$|The {{problems}} of the origin and evolution of meiosis include the enigmatic variability of the synaptonemal complexes (SCs) which, being morphology similar, consist of different proteins in different eukaryotic phyla. Using bioinformatics methods, we monitored all available eukaryotic proteomes to find proteins similar to known SC proteins of model organisms. We found proteins similar to SC lateral element (LE) proteins and possessing the HORMA domain {{in the majority of}} the eukaryotic taxa and assume them the most ancient among all SC proteins. Vertebrate LE proteins SYCP 2, SYCP 3, and SC 65 proved to have related proteins in many invertebrate taxa. Proteins of SC central space are most evolutionarily variable. It means that different protein-protein interactions can exist to connect LEs. Proteins similar to the known SC proteins were not found in Euglenophyta, Chrysophyta, Charophyta, Xanthophyta, <b>Dinoflagellata,</b> and primitive Coelomata. We conclude that different proteins whose common feature is the presence of domains with a certain conformation are involved {{in the formation of the}} SC in different eukaryotic phyla. This permits a targeted search for orthologs of the SC proteins using phylogenetic trees.

40|$|The {{organisation}} of dinoflagellate chromosomes is exceptional among eukaryotes. Their genomes are {{the largest}} in the Eukarya domain, chromosomes lack histones and may exist in liquid crystalline state. Therefore, the study of the structural and functional properties of dinoflagellate chromosomes is of high interest. In this work, we have analysed the telomeres and telomerase in two <b>Dinoflagellata</b> species, Karenia papilionacea and Crypthecodinium cohnii. Active telomerase, synthesising exclusively Arabidopsis-type telomere sequences, was detected in cell extracts. The terminal position of TTTAGGG repeats was determined by in situ hybridisation and BAL 31 digestion methods and provides evidence for the linear characteristic of dinoflagellate chromosomes. The length of telomeric tracts, 25 - 80 kb, is the largest among unicellular eukaryotic organisms to date. Both the presence of long arrays of perfect telomeric repeats at the ends of dinoflagellate chromosomes and the existence of active telomerase as the primary tool for their high-fidelity maintenance demonstrate the general importance of these structures throughout eukaryotes. We conclude that whilst chromosomes of dinoflagellates are unique in many aspects of their structure and composition, their telomere maintenance follows the most common scenario...|$|E

Consensus sequences for Perkinsus olseni, the Perkinsus isolates and P. atlanticus were approximately 98 - 99 % similar to each other but only 65 - 79 % similar to P. marinus and P. andrewsi sequences. Some individual P. olseni sequences were less similar to each other (97. 4 %) than they were to P. atlanticus sequences (97. 8 - 98. 2 %), therefore NTS provides further evidence that P. atlanticus, P. olseni, Perkinsus sp. from Anadara trapezia and Perkinsus sp. from Austrovenus stutchburyi are conspecific. We propose that P. atlanticus be synonymised with P. olseni Lester & Davis, 1981 which has taxonomic priority, and that Perkinsus sp. from Anadara trapezia and Perkinsus sp. from Austrovenus stutchburyi belong to R olseni sensu lato as well.

Many of these species occurred concentratedly during the period of early and middle August and some species increased in density of population to some extent though not enough to cause red water phenomena. It is presumed that this period was most important for the occurrence of red water phenomena being provided with most environmental requirements in view of several occurrences of localized discoloration though slight in intensity.

40|$|Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are the {{two most}} {{abundant}} marine cyanobacteria. They represent a significant fraction of the total primary production of the world oceans and comprise a major fraction of the prey biomass available to phagotrophic protists. Despite relatively rapid growth rates, picocyanobacterial cell densities in open-ocean surface waters remain fairly constant, implying steady mortality due to viral infection and consumption by predators. There have been several studies on grazing by specific protists on Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in culture, and of cell loss rates due to overall grazing in the field. However, the specific sources of mortality of these primary producers in the wild remain unknown. Here, we use a modification of the RNA stable isotope probing technique (RNA-SIP), which involves adding labelled cells to natural seawater, to identify active predators that are specifically consuming Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean. Four major groups were identified as having their 18 S rRNA highly labelled: Prymnesiophyceae (Haptophyta), Dictyochophyceae (Stramenopiles), Bolidomonas (Stramenopiles) and <b>Dinoflagellata</b> (Alveolata). For the first three of these, the closest relative of the sequences identified was a photosynthetic organism, indicating the presence of mixotrophs among picocyanobacterial predators.
