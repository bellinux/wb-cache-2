5|$|By December 15, 1950, the ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> {{had retreated}} {{back to the}} town of Choksong on the {{southern}} bank of the Imjin River—its original defensive position {{at the start of the}} Korean War. On the right flank of the ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> the ROK 6th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> was located at the north of Dongducheon along the southern bank of the Hantan River. The ROK 1st <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> planned to defend the Imjin River by placing its 11th and 12th Regiments at the west and the east side of Choksong respectively, while the ROK 6th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> defended the Route 33 at the Hantan River by placing its 7th and 19th Regiments on each side of the road. Both the ROK 15th Regiment of the 1st <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> and the ROK 2nd Regiment of the 6th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> were placed in the rear as reserves. The South Koreans had also constructed numerous bunkers, barbed wire obstacles and minefields on both banks of the river in order to strengthen defenses and to maintain troop morale.|$|E
5|$|During the lull {{both sides}} made changes to their dispositions. The 53rd (Welsh) <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> {{relieved}} the 15th (Scottish) <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> {{in the west}} of the British salient, while the 43rd (Wessex) <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> relieved the infantry of the 11th Armoured Division who were still holding the Odon bridgehead. The Germans moved up the 277th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> which began to relieve the 9th SS Panzer Division and the battle group of the 2nd SS Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Army began {{a process}} of {{downsizing}} its forces. The Army reactivated the 29th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> and began reorganizing its forces and further consolidating them. As a result, the Army decided to downsize the 26th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> into a brigade, and put it under the command of the 29th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division.</b> On 1 September 1993, the division was inactivated, and the 26th Infantry Brigade designated in its place, based in Springfield. The 3rd and 43rd brigades, 26th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> were inactivated, and the 86th Infantry Brigade was put under the command of the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division.</b> On 1 October 1995, the division was formally designated the 26th Brigade, 29th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division.</b> In 2004, the 26th Brigade transitioned into the 26th (Yankee) Infantry Brigade Combat Team.|$|E
50|$|Republic of Korea Army {{divisions}} are major tactical formations led by and general officers. There are currently 41 Army and 2 Marine Divisions.

5|$|In 1963, the {{division}} was reorganized under the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan. Its regimental commands were inactivated {{in favor of}} brigades. The 101st Infantry Regiment became the 1st Brigade, 26th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> headquartered in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The 104th Infantry Regiment became the 3rd Brigade, 26th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts. Among {{the division}}'s units in 1965 were the 1-101 infantry, 1-104, 2-104, 1-181, 1-182, 1-220 Infantry, and 1-101 FA. The division was organized as a light <b>infantry</b> <b>division,</b> {{and at the same}} time, the 26th Aviation Battalion was established to provide air support. In 1967 the 43rd <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> of the Connecticut Army National Guard was consolidated into the 43rd Brigade, 26th Division, and put under the command of the 26th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September, the UN Forces {{launched}} another counteroffensive {{with the}} 24th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> {{at the center}} of the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Three of I Corps divisions advanced behind the 24th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> in Operation Commando. Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies. These attacks were fierce, though enemy resistance was not as strong as it had been in previous offensives. In November, the Chinese attempted to counter this attack, but were unsuccessful. It was at this point, after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations. In January 1952, IX Corps was again reorganized, now containing the 7th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> and the newly arrived 45th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division.</b> Two months later, it was reorganized with the 2nd <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> the 40th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> and the South Korean 2nd, 3rd, and Capital Divisions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the areas}} of the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> Murska and Detachment Ormozki, the Germans cleared the {{territory}} north of the Drava, and border guard units were withdrawn south of the river. On this day, the 39th Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 42nd <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> Murska from the Detachment Ormozki, and the 36th Infantry Regiment of the former joined the 27th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> Savska.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Marine Corps {{reconnaissance}} {{estimated that}} the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, {{in as many as}} 5 or 6 <b>divisions.</b> <b>Infantry</b> <b>divisions</b> normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some <b>infantry</b> <b>divisions</b> could have up to eight brigades–however most <b>infantry</b> <b>divisions</b> along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.|$|R
5|$|Orders were {{subsequently}} issued for the 36th Infantry Regiment {{to join the}} 27th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> Savska, replaced by the 39th Infantry Regiment from Detachment Ormozki.

5|$|The 70th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> was an <b>infantry</b> <b>division</b> of the British Army that fought {{during the}} Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War.

This division then transferred to Egypt on the outbreak of the Second World War and soon became the 6th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> which went on {{to take part in the}} Battle of Crete and the Syria–Lebanon Campaign. On 10October 1941, the 6th Division was re-created as the 70th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> in an attempt to deceive Axis intelligence concerning the strength of the British military in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The 94th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> was mobilized for {{deployment}} for World War II on 15 September 1942 at Fort Custer, Michigan.

The 376th Infantry Regiment continued as part of the 94th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> and the remainder of the 188th Infantry Brigade became the 94th Reconnaissance Troop, still assigned to the 94th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division.</b>|$|E
5|$|The German side reacted by {{deploying}} their {{reserves to}} the region throughout the night. One improvised battle group consisting of five battalions from the 96th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division,</b> supported by artillery and four Tiger tanks moved to Gorodok No. 2 to reinforce the 170th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> to the west. Another similar battle group using battalions from the 96th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> was sent to Workers Settlement No. 1 to support the 227th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division.</b>|$|E
5|$|The regulars and reserves—at {{least on}} paper—totalled a mobilised force of almost 700,000 men, {{although}} only 150,000 men were immediately available to be formed into the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) {{that was sent}} to the continent. This consisted of six <b>infantry</b> <b>divisions</b> and one of cavalry. By contrast, the French Army in 1914 mobilised 1,650,000 troops and 62 <b>infantry</b> <b>divisions,</b> while the German Army mobilised 1,850,000 troops and 87 <b>infantry</b> <b>divisions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 105th and 107th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Divisions</b> were to {{join the}} 92nd and 93rd <b>Infantry</b> <b>Divisions</b> as Negro divisions. A {{shortage}} of manpower resulted in the activation of the 105th and 107th being cancelled in 1942.|$|R

These divisions had used the brief respite in the fighting during the last two weeks of September to rest and refit, taking in a large number of replacements. By 1 October, over 70% of the men of General Clarence Huebner's 1st <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> were replacements, and the last two weeks of September were spent giving these men village-fighting and weapons training. The impending offensive's plan called for both infantry divisions to avoid street fighting in Aachen; instead, the two divisions would link up and encircle the city, assigning a relatively small force to capture it while the bulk of US forces continued pushing east.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} evaluation, the 166th Aviation Brigade completed {{training for}} the Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB), 34th <b>Infantry</b> <b>Division</b> on 4 August 2008.
