40|$|Liberalization and {{privatization}} {{are often}} associated with global demands for termination of state interference in business. The policy often result in dispute between neoliberalism and socialism. Neoliberalism perceives state interference in economic area as bad, damaging, an inefficient to economic life. State, which conduct the operation in political power logic, is perceived less or even not give the place for the expanding of healthy market structure and competitive. While socialism perceived state as central figure of economic with the centralized planning instrument and the ownership be on the hand of state. As economic system, socialism {{can be understood as}} an economic system in which the means of production, distribution, and exchange are publicly owned and operate. Since socialism assumes state as the most representative organization, so the meaning of owned and operated by public means the power of ownership and the mode of operation be on the hand of state. As political ideology, in its connection wit the economic control, socialism believe that the state should develop the <b>economic</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> on market operation. This paper prove that neoliberalism and the philosophy demands for termination of state role, in the reality, suffer a kind of paradox. On one hand, it trust market excellence so much over state. But on the other hand, it requires the active role of state to return the free market idea...|$|E
40|$|This book explores how {{the concept}} of "competition", which is usually {{associated}} with market economies, operated under state socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where the socialist system, based on command <b>economic</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> state-centred <b>control</b> over society, was supposed to emphasise "co-operation", rather than competitive mechanisms. The book considers competition in {{a wider range of}} industries and social fields across the Soviet bloc, and shows how the gradual adoption and adaptation of Western practices led to the emergence of more open competitiveness in socialist society. The book includes discussion of the state’s view of competition, and focuses especially on how competition operated at the grassroots level. It covers politico-economic reforms and their impact, both overall and at the enterprise level; competition in the cultural sphere; and the huge effect of increasing competition on socialist ways of thinking...|$|R

Until {{the adoption of}} liberalization policies from the 1980 's, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia have favoured a policy of food self-sufficiency based on <b>economic</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> public <b>control</b> of networks. Despite all this, the external food dependency went on increasing during all the period. With liberalization of exchanges, governments stress a concept of food security based on the satisfaction {{of the needs of}} the population through local and imported products. What are the consequences of this evolution on livestock systems and on agro-pastoral societies in the steppe areas of Maghreb ?Alary Véronique, El Mourid Mohammed.

40|$|The future {{smart grid}} is {{expected}} to be an interconnected network of small-scale and self-contained microgrids, in addition to a large-scale electric power backbone. By utilizing microsources, such as renewable energy sources and combined heat and power plants, microgrids can supply electrical and heat loads in local areas in an economic and environment friendly way. To better adopt the intermittent and weather-dependent renewable power generation, energy storage devices, such as batteries, heat buffers and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with vehicle-to-grid systems can be integrated in microgrids. However, significant technical challenges arise in the <b>planning,</b> operation <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of microgrids, due to the randomness in renewable power generation, the buffering effect of energy storage devices and the high mobility of PEVs. The two-way communication functionalities of the future smart grid provide an opportunity to address these challenges, by offering the communication links for microgrid status information collection. However, how to utilize stochastic modeling and optimization tools for efficient, reliable <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>planning,</b> operation <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of microgrids remains an open issue. In this paper, we investigate the key features of microgrids and provide a comprehensive literature survey on the stochastic modeling and optimization tools for a microgrid. Future research directions are also identified...|$|R
30|$|Tropospheric ozone {{is a major}} gaseous {{pollutant}} generated by the photochemical reactions of precursor gases such as nitrogen oxides with volatile organic compounds that are mainly emitted from factories and car exhausts. Recently, ozone concentrations have rapidly increased in the developing Asian countries. For example, during 1982 – 2003, ozone concentrations in Beijing, China increased from a daily maximum of approximately 80  μg m− 3 (about 40  nL L− 1, ppb) to 250  μg m− 3 (125  ppb) (Shao et al. 2006). High concentrations of ozone have also been observed frequently at an agricultural site in the Yangtze River Delta, China, with the highest values of daily 1 -h maximum and monthly 7 -h mean being 144 and 67  ppb, respectively, during 2007 – 2011 (Tang et al. 2013). In the 2020 s under “Current legislation” scenario, which incorporates expected <b>economic</b> development <b>and</b> <b>planned</b> emission <b>controls</b> in individual countries, the annual average ozone levels showed maximum increases of 8 – 12  ppb in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Southeast Asia comparing with the 1990 s (Dentener et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|Globalization and the {{expansion}} of transport networks has transformed migration into a major policy issue because of its effects on a range of phenomena, including resource flows in economics, urbanization, as well as the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Quantifying and modeling human migration can contribute towards {{a better understanding of the}} nature of migration and help develop evidence-based interventions for disease control policy, economic development, and resource allocation. In this study we paired census microdata from 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with additional spatial datasets to develop models for the internal migration flows in each country, including key drivers that reflect the changing social, demographic, economic, and environmental landscapes. We assessed how well these gravity-type spatial interaction models can both explain and predict migration. Results show that the models can explain up to 87 percent of internal migration, can predict future within-country migration with correlations of up to 0. 91, and can also predict migration in other countries with correlations of up to 0. 72. Findings show that such models are useful tools for understanding migration as well as predicting flows in regions where data are sparse, and can contribute towards strategic <b>economic</b> development, <b>planning,</b> <b>and</b> disease <b>control</b> targeting. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Before 1990, {{regional}} development policy as a governmental function was of secondary importance. Although <b>economic</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> management {{were based on}} sectoral principles, regional processes contributed towards an equilibrium {{in the sense that}} differences in social-economic development were decreasing among the various regions. This apparent contradiction is attributable to Hungary 2 ̆ 019 s economic structure. Before 1990, {{due to the lack of}} market and competition, the economic system basically gave support to and protected weaker regions at the expense of the strong ones. These tendencies hindered the dynamism of the economy while leading to the mitigation of regional imbalances. In the first half of the 1990 s, spatial development activity in Hungary was of transitory nature. Partly because of the untested practice of spatial development management, institutions and mechanism, and partly because of the absence of a medium-level authority with appropriate powers, the issues that required intervention had to be handled by means of direct governmental instruments. The insufficiency of the available instruments, however, hindered the efficiency of individual interventions. The process of economic recession highlighted the need to create new spatial development instruments in order to manage growing regional disparities, the problems of depressed regions affected by serious social and economic crisis. The clearly unfavourable regional trends created the need for establishing a more pronounced regional policy with a new institutional system, decentralisation of decision-making, co-ordination of resources. Its basis was laid down in Act XXI of 1996 on Spatial Development <b>and</b> <b>Planning.</b> The law specifies the tasks and identifies the instruments and institutions of spatial development <b>and</b> <b>planning.</b> With the adoption of the Act, Hungary was the first among the accession countries to create a legal framework in conformity with EU spatial development requirements. A review of spatial processes and measures indicates that in the 1990 s spatial development policy established its new network of instruments and institutions, primarily with a view to mitigating spatial disparities and it focused, in particular, on underdeveloped and depressed regions. Although this policy could reduce the unfavourable effects of market-based spatial differences in the economy, it could prevent new excessive depressed (crisis-ridden) regions from surfacing, nevertheless it failed to put a halt to these trends...|$|R
