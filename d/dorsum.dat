5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her <b>dorsum.</b> The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the <b>dorsum</b> of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the <b>dorsum</b> of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the <b>dorsum</b> of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E
5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown. The back is dull, yellowish, ochre-grey in colour, with dark brown to black {{tips of the}} hairs. The latus (side of the body between therib cageand theuppermost and largest part of the hip bone) is tinged with rust-red, and the underside is pale yellowish ochre. In winter, its pelage turns grey, with a yellowish tinge; the underside becomes greyish brown, and the anterior <b>dorsum</b> and head are tinged with yellow. The incisive foramen (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine foramen.|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the <b>dorsum</b> of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
5|$|The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) {{abundant}} throughout some {{certain parts}} of the body, including the funiculi and tarsi. It is more sparse on the coxae, genae (an area {{on both sides of the}} head below the eyes), gaster and gula (the reduced sternite of the first segment of the thorax). Hairs on the scapes point downwards. Erect and suberect hair are seen all over the body in sparse numbers, although this varies. These hairs are not as abundant in comparison to other Novomessor species. The head and thorax are both -colored, and the epinotal spines, legs and node are yellowish red. The antennal scapes are reddish brown and the abdomen is piceous brown. The hair exhibits a gold-like color. The suture is absent from the thorax, and the mesonotum is wider than the epinotum. The front portion of the mesonotum is narrow whereas the back is rectangular. The node is evenly round and oval shaped, the postpetiole is narrow at the front and the <b>dorsum</b> is feebly convex. The gaster is large and oval shaped.|$|E
5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous {{ulceration}} (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the <b>dorsum</b> (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The soft palate or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E
25|$|Illustration 1: The surgeon {{cuts the}} {{excessively}} wide {{bones of the}} upper nasal <b>dorsum</b> (violet) with an osteotome (bone chisel), then detaches, corrects, and relocates them inwards, to a position, between the ocular orbits (red), that narrows {{the width of the}} nasal <b>dorsum.</b>|$|E

25|$|If the nasal-tip wound {{is greater}} than 15nbsp&mm in diameter, the surgeon enlarges it to {{comprehend}} the entire aesthetic subunit affected by the defect, and {{the reconstruction of the}} nasal subunit done with a forehead flap. If the nasal-tip defect also involves the nasal <b>dorsum,</b> a forehead flap is indicated for reconstructing the entire nasal-tip and <b>dorsum.</b>|$|E
25|$|A wound {{greater than}} 15mm in {{diameter}} can be corrected with a paramedian forehead flap, which will reconstruct either the entire nasal <b>dorsum</b> or the lateral {{wall of the}} nose, as required. The surgical management of such wounds (< 15nbsp&mm dia.) usually requires enlarging the wound as necessary, {{in order for the}} skin graft to comprehend the entire aesthetic subunit being corrected. Moreover, if the wound comprehends the <b>dorsum</b> and the lateral wall of the nose, then a cheek-advancement skin flap is the applicable correction for replacing the lateral nasal skin up to its junction with the dorsum; afterwards, a paramedian forehead flap is applied to resurface the nasal <b>dorsum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Based {{upon the}} {{available}} area of nasal skin, the surgeon selects the locale for the bilobed flap, and orients the pedicle. If the defect {{is in the}} lateral aspect of the nose, the pedicle is based medially. If the defect is at the nasal tip, or at the nasal <b>dorsum,</b> the pedicle is based laterally. An ideal location for the second flap is along the junction of the nasal <b>dorsum</b> and the lateral nasal wall.|$|E
25|$|Intratrochlear nerve – conveys {{sensation}} to {{the medial}} {{region of the}} eyelids, the palpebral conjunctiva, the nasion (nasolabial junction), and the bony <b>dorsum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nasal defects {{involving}} {{either the}} bone or the cartilage of the lateral nose are best managed with free grafts of flat septal bone and of cartilage. Small defects {{of the nasal}} <b>dorsum</b> can be covered with cartilage grafts harvested from either the septum or the concha of the ear. The correction of large-area defects of the nasal <b>dorsum</b> requires the stable support of a bone graft affixed either with a lag screw or with a low-profile plate. A costal graft (from the rib cage) is ideal for such a repair, {{because it can be}} harvested with an attached extension of cartilage that can be sculpted to blend into the nasal tip; other potential donor sites for nasal <b>dorsum</b> reconstruction materials are the outer table of the skull, the iliac crest, and the inner table of the ilium proper.|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the nasal}} defect (wound) occurred, in either the <b>dorsum</b> or the lateral wall, or both, determines the {{reconstructive}} skin-flap technique applicable to the corresponding aesthetic nasal subunits.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{between the}} nasal <b>dorsum</b> and the medial canthal tendon is uniquely suited to healing by {{secondary}} intention; the outcomes often {{are superior to}} what is achieved with either skin grafts or skin-flaps and tissue-flaps. Because the medial canthal tendon is affixed to the facial bone, it readily resists the forces of wound contracture; moreover, the animation (movement) of the medial brow also lends resistance to the forces of wound contracture. Furthermore, the medial canthal region is aesthetically hidden by {{the shadows of the}} nasal <b>dorsum</b> and of the supraorbital rim, thereby obscuring any differences in the quality of the color and of the texture of the replacement skin (epithelium).|$|E
25|$|The surgeon designs the nasolabial flap {{and sets}} its central axis at a 45-degree angle from the (long) {{axis of the}} nasal <b>dorsum.</b> The shape of the skin flap is cut from the wound {{template}} fabricated by the surgeon.|$|E
25|$|Spindle-shaped, head acutely pointed, <b>dorsum</b> much arched. Colour green, a {{patch of}} pale ochraceous on the wing-cases and a narrow lateral band of the same colour from head to tail, with a brown line superposed on it that extends to the {{abdominal}} segments; abdominal segments and wing-case sparsely spotted with black.|$|E
25|$|Males and females. Upperside bluish-white. Forewing: {{cell with}} five broad {{transverse}} black bands, the basal and subbasal bands produced to the <b>dorsum,</b> the medial band generally extended into interspace 2, the preapical ended on the median rein, {{and the fifth}} or apical from costa along the discocellulars extends {{on both sides of}} these and terminates at lower apex of cell; beyond the fifth band is a short macular transverse bar of the ground colour that terminates on vein 5, followed by a very broad black terminal band that occupies about one-third of the width of the wing and is traversed by a transverse subterminal series of rounded spots of the ground colour. Hindwing: ground colour along <b>dorsum</b> and above vein 7 whitish; a streak along the <b>dorsum,</b> a subbasal and an inner discal transverse band from costa across cell, and a very broad terminal band, black; the former two joined near the tornus by cross lunular black marks, the terminal band traversed by a series of slender lunules of the ground colour; a small black spot in interspace 1 above tornus and another at base of interspace 4; the black at the apices of interspaces 2 to 4 and the lunules of the ground colour thereon suffused with grey; tail black, edged and tipped with white.|$|E
25|$|Perforated septum – The {{reconstruction}} of a saddle nose {{caused by a}} (collapsed) perforated septum, or by autoimmune problems such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), sarcoidosis, {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (EGPA), relapsing polychondritis, by intranasal drug use, and by excessive nasal aerosol use. The saddle nose deformity resulting from lost <b>dorsum</b> support is reconstructed using autologous bone grafts and rib cartilage grafts.|$|E
25|$|The species lacks {{distinct}} sexual dimorphism, but mature male monitors on Guam {{have been}} reported to be three times the mass of mature females. Males fight for females, and in one observation, after mounting the female, the male used his chin to rub the <b>dorsum</b> of the female's head and forequarters. While mounted and oriented head to head, the male and female slowly rotated in a clockwise direction through 360°, with the male remaining superior.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the tongue is called the <b>dorsum,</b> and is divided by a groove into {{symmetrical}} halves by the median sulcus. The foramen cecum {{marks the end of}} this division (at about 2.5cm from the root of the tongue) {{and the beginning of the}} terminal sulcus. The foramen cecum is also the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct and is formed during the descent of the thyroid diverticulum in embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|Ridges are {{broader than}} many lunar mare ridges and are {{confined}} {{largely to the}} cratered plains materials. Antoniadi <b>Dorsum,</b> which is a well-developed broad ridge north of the Kuiper quadrangle, is less well developed at its south end and appears in this quadrangle as an irregular scarp. A number of linear depressions superficially resemble grabens but are chains of overlapping secondary craters, for example, Goldstone Vallis (15° S., 32°) and Haystack Vallis (5° N., 46°).|$|E
25|$|Tropical {{species of}} pigeons can display a rich variety of colour, presumably to {{facilitate}} species recognition. The plumage of the seed-eating genera of Columbidae {{is more often}} dull brown or grey. Typically imperial pigeons have dark <b>dorsum</b> and wings, ranging from grey to iridescent green. Their breasts are paler, ranging in colour from grey through orange and pink to dark grey. Less conspicuous markings are found on birds isolated to islands. Most species display little or no sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|Upperside dark cupreous red, glossy and shining. Forewing: base irrorated with dusky scales; costa {{edged with}} a narrow, {{inwardly}} jagged, jet-black band that broadens to the apex, thence continued along the termen, decreasing in width to the tornus; opposite the apex the inner {{edge of the}} black is acutely angulate. Hindwing: base and <b>dorsum</b> broadly but slightly irrorated (sprinkled) with dusky scales; costa narrowly, dorsal margin more broadly pale; termen very narrowly and evenly margined with black.|$|E
25|$|The form of {{the nasal}} subunits—the <b>dorsum,</b> the sidewalls, the lobule, the soft triangles, the alae, and the columella—are {{configured}} differently, according to the race and the ethnic group of the patient, thus the nasal physiognomies denominated as: African, platyrrhine (flat, wide nose); Asiatic, subplatyrrhine (low, wide nose); Caucasian, leptorrhine (narrow nose); and Hispanic, paraleptorrhine (narrow-sided nose). The respective external valve of each nose is variably dependent upon the size, shape, and strength of the lower lateral cartilage.|$|E
25|$|Geological {{features}} on Phobos are named after astronomers who studied Phobos and {{people and places}} from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. There is one named regio, Laputa Regio, and one named planitia, Lagado Planitia; both are named after places in Gulliver's Travels (the fictional Laputa, a flying island, and Lagado, imaginary capital of the fictional nation Balnibarbi). The only named ridge on Phobos is Kepler <b>Dorsum,</b> named after the astronomer Johannes Kepler. Several craters have been named.|$|E
25|$|Four {{species of}} {{imperial}} pigeon {{are found in}} Philippines and Sulawesi. All have a distinct pale band across {{the centre of the}} tail, and a rich green or purple <b>dorsum.</b> This grouping shares characteristics and distribution with Ptilinopus, and forms a link between the genera. The pink-belled (D. poliocephala) and the white-bellied (D. forsteni) imperial pigeon are similar and allopatric species. The Mindoro (D. mindorensis) and the grey-headed (D. radiata) imperial pigeons differ in size but are otherwise similar.|$|E
25|$|Upperside dull {{brownish}} black. Forewing: a broad outwardly oblique white transverse {{band that}} crosses {{from a little}} beyond the basal third of the costal margin to the <b>dorsum,</b> its outer half hyaline (glass like), followed by a hyaline triangular area that does not reach the costa or the termen but is traversed by conspicuously black veins. Between the semihyaline transverse band and the hyaline area the black forms {{a more or less}} even band slightly narrower in the middle; the black edging to the costa and termen broad, broadened towards the apex; cilia black.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} rhinoplasty of {{an extensive}} heminasal defect or {{of a total}} nasal defect {{is an extension of}} the plastic surgical principles applied to resolving the loss of a regional aesthetic subunit. The skin layers are replaced with a paramedian forehead flap, but, if forehead skin is unavailable, the alternative corrections include the Washio retroauricular-temporal flap and the Tagliacozzi flap. The nasal skeleton is replaced with a rib-graft nasal <b>dorsum</b> and lateral nasal wall; septal cartilage grafts and conchal cartilage grafts are applied to correct defects of the nasal tip and of the alar lobules.|$|E
25|$|The Goode Method {{determines the}} {{extension}} of the nose from the facial surface by comprehending the distance from the alar groove to the tip of the nose, and then relating that measurement (of nasal-tip projection) to the length of the nasal <b>dorsum.</b> The nasal projection measurement is obtained by delineating a right triangle with lines parting from the nasion (nasofrontal juncture) to the alar–facial–groove. Then, a second, perpendicular delineation, that traverses the tip-defining point, establishes the ratio of projection of the nasal tip; hence, the range of 0.55:1 to 0.60:1, is the ideal nasal-tip-to-nasal-length projection.|$|E
25|$|Mauling is an agonistic {{interaction}} that {{is often}} seen among workers in yellow jacket colonies. The mauler bites the <b>dorsum</b> of the thorax and gaster of the maulee. Ninety-seven percent of maulings last for 10 seconds or less, but some observed maulings were as long as 4 minutes. These interactions are mostly seen amongst older workers and occur throughout colony decline and up until total colony termination. These interactions between workers usually involve only one mauler at a time, but that same mauler often attacks multiple other workers that are nearby. These behaviors and their implications are still not fully understood by scientists.|$|E
25|$|V. acadica males readily {{attempt to}} mate with the queens. Males {{approach}} the queens from the side and attempt to mount the <b>dorsum</b> of the queen's gaster. The queen often attempts to turn and face the male in order to bite him. The male continues to follow the queen, and mounts her while grasping her thorax with all 6 of his legs. He then curls his gaster under the abdomen of the queen in order to insert his genitalia. If the queen is unreceptive, she will curl her gaster toward her head to form a C-shape to prevent penetration and use her legs to dislodge the male.|$|E
25|$|C. cadaverina is {{a fairly}} large species, ranging {{anywhere}} from 9-14 millimeters long. and has many characteristics that are common to its family, Calliphoridae. These characteristics include their metallic color, having bristles on their meron as well as having plumose arista. This species is known for having a shiny metallic blue abdomen {{for which it is}} named. It has a dark blue or black thorax and distinctive darker blue stripes present on the <b>dorsum</b> behind its head. Along with these other characteristics, C. cadaverina also has white calypters, a bare stem vein, and a parafacial with a ground color ranging from black to reddish brown with a yellow covering.|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} a muscular organ {{in the mouth}} of most {{vertebrates}} that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing. It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (<b>dorsum)</b> is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.|$|E
