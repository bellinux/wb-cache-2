500|$|The French {{conductor}} {{and composer}} Pierre Boulez, who interpreted Janáček's operas and orchestral works, called his music surprisingly modern and fresh: [...] "Its repetitive pulse varies through changes in rhythm, tone and direction." [...] He described his opera From the House of the Dead as [...] "primitive, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense,</b> but also extremely strong, like {{the paintings of}} Léger, where the rudimentary character allows a very vigorous kind of expression".|$|E

Like Scrubs and the British version of The Office, it is the sort of show that truly deserves to be seen uninterrupted, several episodes at a time, for maximum enjoyment. The laughs-per-minute quotient here is insanely high, making it great value as a home library purchase." ...|$|E

The press came to refer to the three, who made numerous joint public appearances, as the [...] "Movement widows". Evers-Williams and King were frequent guests at Medgar Evers College, and Shabazz occasionally visited the King Center in Atlanta. Writing about Shabazz, Evers-Williams described her as a [...] "free spirit, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense</b> of the word.

[...] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly wrote that Madonna was [...] "honest" [...] in the song. Louis Virtel of The Backlot included the song on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs", describing its composition as [...] "a hip-hop kiss-off with cabaret flair." [...] Michael R. Smith from The Daily Vault found the track to be [...] "defiant" [...] and [...] "in-your-face". He realized that Madonna directed the lyrics to her past relationships with actor Warren Beatty and comedian Sandra Bernhard.|$|E

[...] Praising the same book, Mark Van Doren wrote: [...] "These poems are clear, swift, and strong; and witty, too, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense</b> of that word."

I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical.

2500|$|As Crown Prince, Charles' brusque manner {{led many}} to regard his future {{accession}} with some apprehension, yet he {{proved to be}} one of the most popular of Scandinavian kings and a constitutional ruler <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense</b> of the word. His reign was remarkable for its manifold and far-reaching reforms. Sweden's existing municipal law (1862), ecclesiastical law (1863) and criminal law (1864) were enacted appropriately enough under the direction of a king whose motto was: Land skall med lag byggas - [...] "With law shall the land be built". Charles also helped Louis De Geer to carry through his reform of the Parliament of Sweden in 1866. He also declared the freedom of women by passing the law of legal majority for unmarried women in 1858 – his sister Princess Eugenie became the first woman who was declared mature.|$|E
2500|$|For Zwemer, the Church was {{precious}} {{because it}} was indeed ‘the Church of God which He purchased with His own blood.’ His view on denominations was ecumenical and generous and far from the parochial tendency occasionally demonstrated in the Reformed tradition. The Arabian Board he set up was expressly ‘undenominational.’ He is able to praise Popes Gregory VII and Innocent III. He longed for the day Orthodox churches would join in with Muslim evangelism. His opening editorial for The Moslem World stated that it aimed ‘to represent no faction or fraction of the Church, but to be broad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense</b> of the word.’ His slogan was: ‘In essentials it seeks unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity.’ Yet, he was clear and precise about what the essentials were. Such desire for ecumenism was fed by his all-pervasive passion for mission to Islam: ‘the issues at stake are too vital and the urgency too great for anything but united front.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|The Greatest Story Never Told {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 89, based on 13 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim [...] ". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club stated [...] "Told sometimes feels like {{too much of}} a good thing; at 18 furious tracks, it’s overwhelming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense.</b> Saigon’s background as an ex-con lends specificity and direction to his social criticism: He’s a battle-tested survivor singling out the injustices and hypocrisy of a world filled with prisons and traps, real and metaphorical. Told is worth the wait". In his review for The Village Voice, Phillip Mlynar complimented Saigon for his [...] "sincerity" [...] and [...] ability to offer advice to his listeners. Chad Grischow from IGN praised the album's themes and message, and wrote that [...] "it is the balance of uplifting, positive energy and gritty realism that makes this debut work so well". About.com's Henry Adaso gave the album four out of five stars and called it [...] "tight, visceral, consistent".|$|E

2500|$|Nolan {{compared}} Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), as a {{film about}} human nature. He also sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). He stated: [...] "When you say you're making a family film, it has all these pejorative connotations that it'll be somehow soft. But when I was a kid, these were family films <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense,</b> and they were as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum. I wanted to bring that back in some way." [...] He also cited the space drama The Right Stuff (1983) as an example to follow and screened it for the crew before production. To emulate that film, he sought to capture reflection on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration grounded in real-world space travel, the director also invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and sought to emulate the look of their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of a spacecraft interior.|$|E

I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense</b> of that word.

2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{noted that}} the story is typical for its time, but said that this [...] "is overshadowed by its bold, filmic execution" [...] {{as well as its}} insight into Tatsumi's early career. Katherine Dacey of Manga Bookshelf found the art's anatomy lacking, but complimented its {{characterization}} and composition, concluding that the manga has [...] "a vital, improvisatory energy missing from Tatsumi's later period". Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics liked the manga's tense situations, but felt that the second half was slow with a weak ending, and said that Tatsumi's art is [...] "blocky and crude in places, but there's an energy about it that helps propel those early pages forward." [...] Connie C. of Comic Book Resources described it as a [...] "very straightforward crime story, [...] is well told, but doesn't get much more elaborate", but called it a [...] "beautiful example" [...] of a pulp short story. Tom Spurgeon called the manga [...] "a fun but rough work, full of character types and situations entirely too on the nose to reflect the nuances of certain moral questions brought to bear", especially disliking the ending and saying of the art: [...] "the best scenes in Black Blizzard have a physical immediacy that only arises from fundamentally solid cartooning with a corresponding attention to movement". Publishers Weekly called the story and layouts simple, and the art sometimes crude, but [...] "with a cinematic use of perspective, intensified via the characters and their circumstances, Tatsumi constructs a thrilling narrative with emotional depth." [...] Michelle Smith of Comic Book Resources said that the manga is [...] "a quick and fun hard-boiled adventure yarn", feeling that the story was [...] "silly" [...] and Shinpei's connection [...] "too convenient", but complimenting the [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] and finding the rough art to suit the characters. The A.V. Club described the manga as a [...] "head-spinning blur of hardboiled suspense", likening the climax to Mickey Spillane's work, and calling Tatsumi's early art [...] "necessarily loose and frantic". Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters compared the story's nervous tension to EC Comics stories and said that the art [...] "while simplistic, conveys a depth and nuance that engages the reader", adding that [...] "unwieldy exposition or narrative declarations" [...] are avoided, and that the manga [...] "is still eminently enjoyable in a way that so many of dated classics of that era are not." [...] ICv2 said that [...] "Tatsumi skillfully uses the conventions of the crime story to examine his characters who come from very different social backgrounds", calling Black Blizzard [...] "one of the first examples of the realistic, socially conscious, and adult (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>sense</b> of the term) gekiga genre of manga." [...] Deb Aoki of About.com said of the manga: [...] "while not as polished as his later works, this one-shot crackles with youthful energy, cinematic style, and Tatsumi's burning desire to push the boundaries of manga beyond kids stuff." ...|$|E
