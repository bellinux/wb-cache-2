Pai and Vau replied that he should leave unless <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them their names. This is a defence that appears in other mythologies of the Pacific that {{possibly}} reflects the belief that to know a person’s name is to have some power over that person. Tefolaha knew their names so they departed. As they left, sand spilled out of their baskets creating the smaller islets of Nanumea.|$|E

To express the ghetto's turmoil and pathos, Van Peebles used sprechgesang as a form <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> stories in; he recorded three albums using this style, Brer Soul, Ain't Supposed To Die a Natural Death and As Serious as a Heart-Attack. The albums were categorized as spoken word at the time, but was later called a precursor to rapping and hip hop music.|$|E

500|$|The first printed {{version of}} Amy Robsart's murder {{appeared}} in the satirical libel Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious propaganda work against the Earl of Leicester written by Catholic exiles in 1584. Here Sir Richard Verney goes directly to Cumnor Place, forces the servants {{to go to the}} market, and breaks Lady Amy's neck before placing her {{at the foot of the}} stairs; the jury's verdict is murder, and she is buried first secretly at the Cunmor parish church before being dug up and reburied at Oxford.

500|$|Iðunn is {{introduced}} in the Prose Edda in section 26 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning. Here, Iðunn is described as Bragi's wife and keeper of an eski (a wooden box made of ash wood and often used for carrying personal possessions) within which she keeps apples. The apples are bitten into by the gods when they begin to grow old and they then become young again, which is described as occurring up until Ragnarök. Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) states {{that it seems to}} him that the gods depend greatly upon Iðunn's good faith and care. With a laugh, High responds that misfortune once came close, that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> Gangleri about it, but first he must hear the names of more of the Æsir, and he continues providing information about gods.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of his death The Timess {{estimation}} of Walpole was no higher than, [...] "he had a versatile imagination; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a workmanlike story in good workmanlike English; and he was a man of immense industry, conscientious and painstaking". The belittling tone of the obituary brought forth strong rebuttals from T S Eliot, Kenneth Clark and Priestley, among others. Within a few years of his death, Walpole was seen as old-fashioned, and his works were largely neglected. In the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Elizabeth Steele summed up: [...] "His psychology was not deep enough for the polemicist, his diction not free enough for those returning from war, and his zest disastrous to a public wary of personal commitment". In 2011, Peter Hitchens, an admirer of Walpole, though not an uncritical one, wrote: ...|$|E

Instead, Victor's {{replacement}} Tyrus (Ray Campbell) arrives with Mike, who informs Walter he will never see Gus again. That night, Walter drives to Gus' house and approaches with the gun, but before he can cross the street, Walter receives a call from Tyrus, who says simply, [...] "Go home, Walter." [...] The next day, as Walter approaches Mike at the bar, Mike tells Walter that he observed Walter tailing him to the bar. Mike then reveals <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that Walter was carrying a weapon in the lab. Walter suggests he and Mike {{are in the same}} danger, and Gus could easily kill Mike the same way he killed Victor. This visibly unnerves Mike, who appears to be aware of this. Walter asks that Mike get him in a room with Gus so he can kill him. In response, Mike punches Walter, knocking him to the floor, kicks him in the torso a few times and then leaves the bar.|$|E
500|$|At 1:45am Catherine Eddowes' {{mutilated}} {{body was}} found by PC Edward Watkins at the south-west corner of Mitre Square, in the City of London, about 12 minutes walk from Berner Street. She had been killed less than 10 minutes earlier by a slash to the throat {{from left to right}} with a sharp, pointed knife at least 6inches (15cm) long. Her face and abdomen were mutilated, and her intestines were drawn out over the right shoulder with a detached length between her torso and left arm. Her left kidney and most of her uterus were removed. The Eddowes inquest was opened on 4 October by Samuel F. Langham, coroner for the City of London. The examining pathologist, Dr Frederick Gordon Brown, believed the perpetrator [...] "had considerable knowledge of the position of the organs" [...] and from the position of the wounds on the body <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that the murderer had knelt {{to the right of the}} body, and worked alone. However, the first doctor at the scene, local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, disputed that the killer possessed anatomical skill or sought particular organs. His view was shared by City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy. Because of this murder's location, the City of London Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were brought into the enquiry.|$|E
500|$|Though Daubeny's {{book in the}} Beagles library {{described}} the volcanic geology of the Canary Islands, it said that {{the structure of the}} Cape Verde Islands was [...] "too imperfectly known". Darwin saw Quail Island as his key to understanding the structure of St. Jago, and made careful studies of its stratigraphy in the way he had learnt from Adam Sedgwick. He collected specimens and described a white layer of hard white rock formed from crushed coral and seashells lying between layers of black volcanic rocks, and noted a similar white layer running horizontally in the black cliffs of St. Jago at [...] above sea level. The seashells were, as far as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> [...] "the same as those of present day". He speculated that in geologically recent times a lava flow had covered this shell sand on the sea bed, and then the strata had slowly risen to their present level. Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology presented a thesis of gradual rising and falling of the Earth's crust illustrated by the changing levels of the Temple of Serapis. Darwin implicitly supported Lyell by remarking that [...] "Dr. Daubeny when mentioning the present state of the temple of Serapis. doubts the possibility of a surface of country being raised without cracking buildings on it. – I feel sure at St Jago in some places a town might have been raised without injuring a house." [...] In a letter to Henslow he wrote that [...] "The geology was preeminently interesting & I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale of upraised coast... that would interest Mr. Lyell. While still on the island, Darwin was inspired to think of writing a book on geology, and later wrote of [...] "seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes".|$|E

500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] based on what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> from the [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes on a dime, a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel {{a creature of the}} stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and now <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> everyone what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away.|$|E

[...] In a similar vein, a magazine writer in the 1940s described the difference between Dewey's private and public behavior by noting that [...] "Till he gets to the door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. But the moment he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 20, 1869, Gould and Fisk started {{hoarding}} gold, {{driving the}} price higher. By September 22, gold closed at $141 an ounce {{at which time}} Fisk and Gould owned between $50 and $60 million in gold {{between the two of}} them, about three times the public supply available in New York. The increase in gold prices on this day alone had netted a profit of $1.75 million for the two conspirators. On Thursday, September 23, Gould visited Corbin's house and was informed of Julia's letter that arrived the same day. [...] After reading it and discovering Grant was annoyed with his speculations, Gould knew he was very likely to sell gold on Friday. Subsequently, Corbin asked Gould if he would buy Corbin's account so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> Grant that he no longer owned any gold, but Gould refused to bail Corbin out, fearing it would trigger a collapse in the market.
