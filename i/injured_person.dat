Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses.

40|$|Background: Operative {{treatment}} of acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations Allman-Tossy III type is controversial. There {{are more than}} 30 types of operative treatments described. At the Department of Traumatology of Celje General and Teaching Hospital (CGTH) we operate the AC joint dislocation by the AC joint opened reduction and fixation using two Kirschner wires and additional figure of eight wire loop over the AC joint. The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate the results of acromioclavicular joint complete dislocation Allman-Tossy III type operative treatment. Patients and methods: In the 2 -year period from July 1 st 1997, to June 31 st, 1999, at the Department of Traumatology of CGTH we operatively treated 59 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> with the AC joint dislocation. There were 55 men (93 %) and 4 women (7 %). The average age was 40 years (from 20 to 72 years). 56 (95 %) <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> had the AC joint injury of Allman-Tossy III type. In first three weeks (early reconstruction) we operated 45 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> (76. 3 %). The applied material was removed after 8 weeks. 47 (79. 7 %) <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> were re-examined {{at least one year}} after the injury (27 months in average; 14 – 39 months). The results were evaluated according to University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) scale for the shoulder function evaluation. The impact of factors on a good treatment result was presented by the odds ratio and uni-variant analysis calculation. Results: Out of 47 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> re-examined according to the UCLA scale at least one year after the injury there were 17 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> (36. 2 %) rated with an excellent result (UCLA 34 – 35), 22 good (46. 8 %) (UCLA 28 – 33), 5 satisfactory (10. 6 %) (UCLA 21 – 27) and 3 bad (6. 4 %) (UCLA 0 – 20). In total we achieved 83 % of excellent and good results. The <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> age did not significantly affect the treatment result. Complications occurred in 14 (29. 8 %) injured patients. If no complications were occurred the odds ratio for good result was 6. 7.   39 % of the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> were on the sick leave for more than 4 months. In the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> with accident insurance we noticed a longer sick leave status (odds ratio 1. 25). The injury did not affect the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> employment. The majority of the employed (92. 4 %) carried out the same work after treatment as before the injury. Conclusion: By the operative {{treatment of}} the AC joint dislocation a good or excellent result is achieved in the majority of the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> (83 % in total). </p...|$|R
25|$|An official, who has {{intentionally}} {{committed a}} breach of duty which he ought to exercise {{in favor of a}} third party and therefore prejudice to such third party, is liable for any injury arising therefrom. If the breach is the result of this official's negligence, he may be held liable to compensate only in so far as the <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> is unable to obtain compensation by other means. In the case mentioned in the preceding sentence, if the <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> who may obviate the injury by making use of a legal remedy has intentionally or negligently omitted to make use of it, the official shall not be liable to compensate for the injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{employer}} {{shall be}} jointly liable to make compensation for any injury which the employee has wrongfully caused {{to the rights}} of another in the performance of his duties. However, the employer is not liable for the injury if he has exercised reasonable care in the selection of the employee, and in the supervision of the performance of his duties, or if the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of such reasonable care. If compensation cannot be obtained according to the provision of the preceding sentence, the court may, on the application of the <b>injured</b> <b>person,</b> take the financial conditions of the employer and the <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> into consideration, and order the employer to compensate for a part or the whole of the injury.

In the case of the preceding sentence, the guardian is not liable if there is no negligence in his duty of supervision, or if the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable supervision. If compensation cannot be obtained according to the provisions of the preceding two sentences, the court may, on the application of the <b>injured</b> <b>person,</b> take the financial conditions among the tortfeasors, the guardian and the <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> into consideration, and order the tortfeasors or his guardian to compensate for a part or the whole of the injury.|$|E

If it was reputation that has been damaged, the <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> may also claim the taking of proper measures for the rehabilitation of his reputation. A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals. A person, who violates a statutory provision enacted {{for the protection of}} others and therefore prejudice to others, is bound to compensate for the injury, except no negligence in his act can be proved. If several persons have wrongfully damaged the rights of another jointly, they are jointly liable for the injury arising therefrom.

25|$|A {{tourniquet}} can {{be defined}} as a constricting or compressing device used to control arterial and venous blood flow to a portion of an extremity for a period of time. Pressure is applied circumferentially around a portion of a limb at a desired location; this pressure is transferred to the walls of blood vessels, causing them to become temporarily occluded or restricted. In surgical settings, a tourniquet is used to occlude arterial blood flow following exsanguination to produce a relatively bloodless operative field and to minimize blood loss. In emergency settings, a tourniquet is used stop traumatic bleeding such that medical care can be provided in time before the <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> bleeds out. In rehabilitation settings, a tourniquet is used to restrict arterial blood flow at a consistent and safe pressure for short periods of time during low intensity exercise to more rapidly increase muscle size and strength.|$|E

He first {{appears in the}} season eight episode [...] "Plastique", assisting Chloe with helping an <b>injured</b> <b>person</b> after a bomb explosion. In the episode [...] "Toxic", Chloe calls on his help when Oliver is poisoned and refuses {{to be taken to}} a hospital. In [...] "Prey", Clark begins to suspect that Davis is a serial killer after he finds Davis unconscious at one of the murder scenes, and learns later that Davis is usually the first paramedic to arrive on similar scenes. Davis starts to suspect the same thing himself when he begins to lose track of large portions of time, and finds himself covered in blood, but with no wounds on his own body. Davis is informed by Faora, the wife of General Zod, that after the pair learned they could not have children that he was genetically created to adapt to any injury and to be Earth's ultimate destroyer. In [...] "Abyss", Davis confesses to Chloe that he is in love with her, and believes that she is marrying the wrong man; as a result she asks him to not see her again. On Chloe's wedding day, in the episode [...] "Bride", Davis transforms into the hulking monster called Doomsday, and travels to Smallville where he injures Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe. In the episode [...] "Infamous", Davis discovers that he can keep Doomsday from emerging if he kills, and subsequently begins choosing criminals as his victims. He subsequently learns that Chloe's presence will also keep the monster at bay in the episode [...] "Turbulence", and in [...] "Beast" [...] Davis and Chloe leave town together so that Davis can keep Doomsday from coming out. In the season eight finale, Chloe uses black kryptonite to separate Davis from Doomsday, leaving him human; when Davis discovers that Chloe does not love him he stabs Jimmy with a pipe. Before Davis can attack Chloe, Jimmy pushes him into a metal rod, which results in Davis's death before Jimmy himself dies.|$|E
