The average times for the three materials across all colours were 2. 26 s for AM material, 3. 20 s for swell paper, and 4. 03 s for embroidered symbols. These findings can be explained by the fact that the AM material (polylactide) is firmer and more easily perceived tactually than the other two materials.

The {{following}} article was published in the <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Visual</b> <b>Impairment</b> & Blindness, 109 (4), article 4. The final version of record can be found at [URL] The ability to get out and about is important to social inclusion and quality of life and {{it is one of the}} most significant challenges for people who are blind or visually impaired. There has been little research into the underlying concerns of people who are blind or visually impaired when making decisions about mobility. Method: This grounded theory study explored the main mobility-related concerns of people who are blind or visually impaired. It uses qualitative data, drawn from a combination of online discussions, face-to-face, telephone and email interviews, and focus groups with people who are blind or visually impaired and rehabilitation practitioners. Results: The primary concern of people who are blind or visually impaired when making choices about where to go, and when and how to do so, was a desire to see oneself and to be seen by others as “normal”. Self-identity and perceived “normality” are subjective and changeable and are continually internally co-reconstructed to achieve congruence between them. The mobility strategies used are those that are perceived as most “normal”. Discussion: Perceived “normality” has a powerful influence on behaviour. By harnessing this, rehabilitation services may be better able to promote autonomy and self-reliance. Implications for Practitioners: To promote independence, rehabilitation services must change people’s perception of what is “normal”. People must be supported to come to perceive fulfilment of valued social roles, autonomy and self-reliance as “normal”...|$|E
40|$|Aim From {{the most}} recent data the {{magnitude}} <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and its causes in 2010 have been estimated, globally and by WHO region. The definitions <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are the current definitions of presenting vision in the International Classification of Diseases version 10. Methods A systematic review was conducted of published and unpublished surveys from 2000 to the present. For countries without data on <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> estimates were based on newly developed imputation methods that took into account country economic status as proxy. Results Surveys from 39 countries satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study. Globally, {{the number of people}} of all ages visually impaired is estimated to be 285 million, of whom 39 million are blind, with uncertainties of 10 e 20 %. People 50 years and older represent 65 % and 82 % of visually impaired and blind, respectively. The major causes <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are uncorrected refractive errors (43 %) followed by cataract (33 %); the first cause of blindness is cataract (51 %). Conclusion This study indicates that <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in 2010 is a major health issue that is unequally distributed among the WHO regions; the preventable causes are as high as 80 % of the total global burden. In order to set policies and priorities and to evaluate global eye health, it is essential to have up to date information on prevalence and on causes <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> As it previously did in 1995, 2002 and 20041 e 3 the WHO Prevention of Blindness and Deafness Programme has carried out a systematic search and review of all available data to obtain a global estimate <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> for 2010. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> have been derived at a global level and in the six WHO regions.

40|$|Importance: Myopia (ie, nearsightedness) is {{becoming}} the most common eye disorder to cause blindness in younger persons in many parts <b>of</b> the world. <b>Visual</b> <b>impairment</b> due to myopia is associated with structural changes of the retina and the globe because of elongation of the eye axis. How axial length-a sum of the anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and vitreous chamber depth-and myopia relate to the development <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> over time is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the association between axial length, spherical equivalent, and the risk <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and to make projections <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> for regions with high prevalence rates. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study uses population-based data from the Rotterdam Study I (1990 to 1993), II (2000 to 2002), and III (2006 to 2008) and the Erasmus Rucphen Family Study (2002 to 2005) as well as case-control data from the Myopia Study (2010 to 2012) from the Netherlands. In total, 15404 individuals with data on spherical equivalent and 9074 individuals with data on axial length {{were included in the}} study; right eyes were used for analyses. Data were analyzed from September 2014 to May 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: <b>Visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and blindness (defined according to the World Health Organization criteria as a visual acuity less than 0. 3) and predicted rates <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> specifically for persons with myopia. Results: Of the 15693 individuals included in this study, the mean (SD) age was 61. 3 (11. 4) years, and 8961 (57. 1 %) were female. Axial length ranged from 15. 3 to 37. 8 mm; 819 individuals had an axial length of 26 mm or greater. Spherical equivalent ranged from - 25 to + 14 diopters; 796 persons had high myopia (ie, a spherical equivalent of - 6 diopters or less). The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> varied from 1. 0 % to 4. 1 % in the population-based studies, was 5. 4 % in the Myopia Study, and was 0. 3 % in controls. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> rose with increasing axial length and spherical equivalent, with a cumulative incidence (SE) <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> 3. 8 % (1. 3) for participants aged 75 years with an axial length of 24 to less than 26 mm and greater than 90 % (8. 1) with an axial length of 30 mm or greater. The cumulative risk (SE) <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was 5. 7 % (1. 3) for participants aged 60 years and 39 % (4. 9) for those aged 75 years with a spherical equivalent of - 6 diopters or less. Projections of these data suggest that <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> will increase 7 - to 13 -fold by 2055 in high-risk areas. Conclusions and Relevance: This study demonstrated that <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> is associated with axial length and spherical equivalent and may be unavoidable at the most extreme values in this population.

Results: The main causes <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> were cataracts (58. 7 %), refractive error (19. 4 %), and glaucoma (2. 9 %). <b>Visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was found to be associated with advancing age, low education, and unemployment (P< 0. 001). Most patients (85. 1 %) were found to have good quality of life overall. Quality of life was found to be poor in the domains <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> function (64. 2 %) and social interaction (50. 9 %). Quality of life was found to be related to the degree <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> ie, blind patients reported poor quality of life (41. 4 %) when compared with those having low vision (8. 6 %) or near normal vision (2. 4 %, P< 0. 001). Conclusion: This study identified poor quality of life in patients with a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Family physicians need to identify these visually impaired patients early and make timely referrals.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> {{is known}} to be higher in a diabetic population than in a non-diabetic population. How much <b>of</b> this <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> may be attributed to uncorrected refractive error is unclear. This study examined the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in a Hong Kong diabetic population to determine the proportion <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> that could be corrected with prescription spectacles. Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) were recruited as subjects for this study. All subjects underwent a standardised diabetic retinopathy screening that included measurement of presenting distant vision, biomicroscopic examination of the anterior eye and a retinal examination. For those subjects whose visual acuity was worse than 6 / 9. 5, autorefraction was performed. In this study, we classified <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> into three categories: no <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (<b>visual</b> acuity in the better eye better than or equal to 6 / 18), mild <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (<b>visual</b> acuity in the better eye between 6 / 18 and 6 / 60) and severe <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (<b>visual</b> acuity in the better eye {{less than or equal to}} 6 / 60). Results: For the 2, 301 subjects who participated in this study, the mean age at examination was 61. 4 ± 10. 5 -years (range, 23 to 92 -years). Regarding visual acuity, 11. 3 per cent (259 / 2, 301) <b>of</b> subjects had <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> with 10. 6 per cent being mild (244 / 2, 301) and 0. 7 per cent severe (15 / 2, 301). After correction with a prescription determined by autorefraction, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> dropped to 4. 0 per cent (91 / 2, 301). Nearly 70 per cent (168 / 259) <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was correctable by prescription spectacles and 21. 6 per cent (56 / 259) of subjects were likely to benefit from cataract surgery. Conclusion: For our sample of diabetic patients, nearly 70 per cent <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> could be remedied by a spectacle correction. In the care of the diabetic eye, eye-care providers should not focus solely on diabetic retinopathy. The quality of life in people with T 2 DM can be improved simply by eliminating uncorrected refractive errors. School of Optometr...|$|R
50|$|The {{optic nerve}} {{hypoplasia}} is generally manifested by nystagmus (involuntary eye movements, often side-to-side) and a smaller-than-usual optic disc. The degree <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> is variable, and ranges from normal vision to complete blindness. When nystagmus develops, it typically appears by 1-8 months of age, and usually {{indicates that there}} will be a significant degree <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> but the severity is difficult to predict in infancy. Although there are many measures to compensate for <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> there are few treatments available to induce normal optic nerve function.|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of reversible and irreversible <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was determined {{in children with}} severe and profound sensorineural deafness, as subnormal vision can adversely affect their educational and social development. Eighty three of 87 such children attending an audiology service were examined to assess the incidence and severity <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Each child underwent a detailed ophthalmic assessment. The criteria for <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> were <b>visual</b> acuity < 6 / 9 Snellen or equivalent and/or abnormal binocular vision. Forty five had a normal ophthalmic examination (54. 2 %). Twenty nine had <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (34. 9 %) and nine had ophthalmological abnormalities that did not interfere with vision (10. 9 %). A higher proportion of children with risk factors for visual pathology demonstrated <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> than those in whom there were no risk factors. None the less, 44 % <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was among patients without risk factors. The results underline the need to examine all children with severe and profound sensorineural deafness soon after diagnosis and indicate that children with multiple handicaps have a greater likelihood <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (11 <b>of</b> 14 cases) ...|$|R
