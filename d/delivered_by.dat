40|$|Objective: This study {{explores the}} basic {{demographic}} characteristics of expectant mothers {{in the context of}} their intentions regarding mode of delivery, in particular, the preference for caesarean delivery, and analyzes the social and psychological factors that influence delivery preference. Method: A cross-sectional survey of pregnant women was conducted during June to August in 2015. This study adopted a stratified sampling method, and 16 representative hospitals in five provinces of China were included. Results: 1755 and 590 of expectant mothers in their first and second pregnancies, respectively, were enrolled in this study. 354 (15. 10 %) intended to <b>deliver</b> <b>by</b> caesarean section and 585 (24. 95 %) participants were uncertain prior to delivery. 156 (8. 89 %) of expectant mothers in their first pregnancy and 198 (33. 56 %) expectant mothers in their second pregnancy intended to <b>deliver</b> <b>by</b> caesarean section. Ordinal logistic regression analysis found that nationality, parity, trimester of pregnancy, and advanced maternal age were factors associated with intention to <b>deliver</b> <b>by</b> caesarean (ordered logistic regression/three-level caesarean delivery intention criterion; odds ratios p < 0. 05). Conclusions: 8. 89 % of first pregnancy expectant mothers and 33. 56 % of second pregnancy expectant mothers intended to <b>deliver</b> <b>by</b> caesarean section. Any intervention program to reduce the rate of Caesarean delivery should focus on the Han population, older pregnant women, and expectant mothers in their second pregnancy, at an early gestation...|$|R
