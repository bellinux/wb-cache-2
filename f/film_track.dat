5000|$|Because the <b>film</b> <b>track</b> {{and music}} track are {{recorded}} separately during {{the creation of}} a music video, artists usually lip-sync their songs and often imitate playing musical instruments as well. Artists also sometimes move their lips at a faster speed than the recorded track, to create videos with a slow-motion effect in the final clip, which is widely considered to be complex to achieve. Similarly, some artists have been known to lip-sync backwards for music videos such that, when reversed, the singer is seen to sing forwards while time appears to move backwards in his or her surroundings. Notable exceptions to this trend include Bruce Springsteen's hit [...] "Streets of Philadelphia", which only uses the instruments as a backing track while the vocals were recorded with a microphone attached on the singer, giving a different feel to it.|$|E
5000|$|Potter's {{screenplay}} for Gorky Park (1983) led to him gaining an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, although it {{emerged as a}} shadow of Martin Cruz Smith's original novel. He also wrote Dreamchild (1985), a film which shared themes with his earlier Alice (1965) TV script. In her last film role, Coral Browne portrayed the elderly Alice Hargreaves who recalls in flashbacks her childhood when she was the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Potter adapted his television play Schmoedipus (1975) for the cinema. The ensuing <b>film,</b> <b>Track</b> 29 (1987), directed by Nicolas Roeg, was the last project Potter would pursue in Hollywood. However, Potter did provide uncredited script work on James and the Giant Peach (released 1995) — his chief contribution providing dialogue for the sardonic caterpillar. Potter makes a sly reference to this in Karaoke when the character Daniel Feeld (Albert Finney) is invited to provide dialogue for an [...] "arthritic goat" [...] in a children's film.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS Cesar {{presents}} an automated multiparameter approach to pattern {{recognition in the}} rapid detection of malignant cells from cervical and other cancers. Cells are cybernetically classified. They are collected into a container into which a nuclear stain may be incorporated and laid as a track on 35 mm. film using a disposable mapping pen device. The <b>film</b> <b>track</b> (Cytotrack) may be scanned using conventional optics and provision may be made for electronic sensing devices measuring a number ofparameters, some ofwhich are not normally used in conventional microscopy. The object of this communication is to give an outline of {{a new approach to}} the evaluation of cells in a variety of cytological preparations, with particular reference to smears from the female genital tract. Here we are concerned chiefly with the main features of this method and the reasoning which led us to adopt it. There is no doubt that exfoliative cytology has come into its own as a diagnostic tool in the detection of cancer and precancerous conditions. With traine...|$|E
40|$|WSex {{films with}} {{variable}} Se/W ratio were deposited by non-reactive r. f. magnetron sputtering from WSe 2 target changing the applied d. c. pulsed bias conditions and substrate temperature. The structural and chemical properties were measured by cross-sectional {{scanning electron microscopy}} (X-SEM), energy dispersive analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The tribological properties were measured in ambient air (RH = 30 – 40 %) and dry nitrogen {{by means of a}} reciprocating ball-on-disk tribometer. A clear correlation was found between the Se/W ratio and the measured friction coefficient displaying values below 0. 1 (in ambient air) and 0. 03 (in dry N 2) for ratios Se/W ≥ 0. 6 as determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The results demonstrated that notable tribological results could be obtained even in ambient air (friction ≤ 0. 07 and wear rate ≈ 10 − 7 mm 3 Nm− 1) by controlling the film microstructure and chemical composition. By incorporating carbon, wear and chemical resistance can be gained by formation of non-stoichiometric carbides and/or alloying into the defective WSex hexagonal structure. The existence of a WSe 2 rich interfacial layer (either on the ball scar or embedded in the <b>film</b> <b>track)</b> was evidenced by Raman in low friction conditions. The improvement in tribological performance is therefore obtained by means of layered WSex, the formation of gradient composition from metallic W (hard) to WSe 2 (lubricant) and carbon incorporation.

40|$|This thesis had 2 objectives. The first {{purpose of}} this thesis was to develop an {{experimental}} procedure to study electric current induced flow of liquid metal, similar to that found at the armature-rail contact due to local melting, to determine the kinetics of liquid flow Ga under electric current conditions. For this, a model system comprising a bead of Ga on a Cu thin <b>film</b> <b>track</b> was devised in order to enable liquefaction and current induced movement of Ga to occur along the Cu track. Upon application of current, Ga underwent liquefaction due to Joule heating and once liquid, it rapidly migrated along the Cu track towards the negative terminal. The Ga liquid flow was attributed to electromigration of liquid Ga {{under the influence of}} direct electric field. The kinetics of Ga flow was determined. This method will be useful in calculating the kinetics of electromigration of molten Al along Cu rails in future railgun development. The second {{purpose of this}} thesis was to analyze debris left on Cu/ 24 Ag rails following firing of 7075 Al armatures, {{in order to understand the}} compositional evolution of the debris, and its role in creating surface damage to armature/rail interfacial surfaces. EDS analysis showed a majority of the debris was composed of oxidized aluminum with significant porosity. The analysis of the rail debris will benefit future studies on preventing rail debris from damaging railguns. US Navy (USN) author...|$|E
