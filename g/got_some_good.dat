500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good,</b> funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E

An EastEnders insider is reported to have said [...] "Fatboy has been a real hit with viewers and the bosses have decided that it's now time to bring in his dad so people can see what Fatboy is really all about." [...] Norwood's contract was once again renewed in late 2013 for another year, by the new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who promised [...] "juicy storylines" [...] for the character. One source from the programme said [...] "Fatboy is a popular character and appeals to all ages. He's not had a decent storyline for a while but always provides much-needed humour in Albert Square. [...] He’s <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> stuff coming up and is an important member of the cast." ...|$|E
500|$|Marsden first {{appeared}} on 5 March 2001 in the [...] "Who Shot Phil?" [...] storyline. In the whodunit storyline the five main suspects were Dan Sullivan, Steve Owen, Lisa Shaw, Ian Beale and Mark Fowler. A source in the Daily Record said, [...] "Sooner or later the truth will out.

[...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> news for you, Phil," [...] she says, after arresting him on suspicion of murder. [...] "The police in Portugal found your jacket. Unfortunately for you, it's covered in blood. Mrs Fowler's blood..." [...] In 2003, Marsden returned in March July, August, November and for a longer stint in December.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Larry King" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that [...] "Larry King" [...] was the [...] "best {{of the season}} so far", saying {{that there was a}} [...] "really nice balance" [...] in the episode's plots. Sassone said that Hayek was [...] "fine", but much preferred the Jack character single. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist for The Star-Ledger, complimented the episode, reporting that it was [...] "much better" [...] and perhaps the first episode he enjoyed [...] "unreservedly." [...] He added that the entire cast was used [...] "well" [...] and that it [...] "gave us a Jack story that balanced comedy with some genuine emotion, <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> mileage out of a rare Liz/Kenneth story... and employed the guest stars as well as they have all season." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning admitted in his recap that he was [...] "thrilled" [...] after reading the synopsis of the episode, regarding to Tracy causing mayhem in New York, but after the airing, [...] "I was a bit disappointed" [...] as it [...] "wasn't as over-the-top", but overall, [...] "this was still a fun and funny episode." [...] Canning gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating. Time contributor James Poniewozik enjoyed Liz and Kenneth's story as it [...] "felt more emotionally real" [...] and [...] "allowed Kenneth to get to show a bit more spine than usual, standing up to Liz on their journey to darkest Queens". Poniewozik noted that it was [...] "nice" [...] to see the Pete character back, as Scott Adsit had not appeared on 30 Rock for quite some time.|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I {{like the way he}} played it. ... I think he's got a sense of humor and he's <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> things there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warne {{played down}} his achievement, commenting that [...] "I {{was just trying}} to tie up an end and I got a bit lucky", while his skipper noted that [...] "Shane is like the West Indian bowlers – when he gets on top he gets all over you". Atherton was unhappy at the post-match press conference. [...] "I don't like to see us lie down and die," [...] he said, {{referring}} to his decision to have Alec Stewart bat in the second innings despite a broken finger, but he admitted that [...] "we got walloped in the first two Tests... We've <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> players [...] we're not playing especially well at the moment." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald was less charitable towards England's performances to date, with Patrick Smith claiming that [...] "Wisden should count England wickets as just a half", and deploring Atherton's lack of aggression in the field. He also derided Gooch, Gatting and Hick, and picked out the way that the visitors' batsmen got themselves out so readily.|$|E

2500|$|Following Button's fourth-place finish, {{which was}} the fifth time in the season that he {{finished}} in the top four, he stated he did not compete to attempt to prove anything but was in the sport [...] "to do my job and my job is to do the best job I can for myself and for the team and that's exactly what I did." [...] However, he was delighted at his battle with the Williams team, saying, [...] "It was a lot of fun. And then the battle with Kimi Raikkonen, going past him was mega – I really enjoyed that. We're not the best of friends but we battle hard but clean." [...] Alonso did not feel frustrated towards teammate Räikkönen over the pair's late-race battle for sixth place: [...] "The most important thing was not the battle with him, it was the battle with the other teams and we <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> points for Ferrari today. Even if I could have overtaken Kimi a little quicker I had to save a lot of fuel {{in the last couple of}} laps so a battle with Sebastian was never a possibility." [...] Räikkönen dismissed the battle as [...] "normal racing" [...] and felt the duel had not hindered his team because it made no difference for him or Ferrari, and no matter where he finished, the team would accumulate the same amount of points.|$|E
2500|$|The Titans {{were also}} {{the first team to}} play in the Regular season, when they played the Steelers on September 10. Ringer was used to return kicks. In the 10-13 {{overtime}} loss, Ringer had 3 Kick Returns, a 19 yard average, including a long of 21 yards. He also played on special teams, and had one tackle. Ringer was again used as a kick returner, this time in a 31-34 loss to the Houston Texans. Ringer had 6 returns for a 20 yard average, with a long of 25, and no touchdowns. He also played on special teams, but had no tackles. In a 17-24 week 3 loss to the New York Jets, Ringer was benched as the kick returner, and, while active, did not play in the game. Ringer's kick return replacement, Ryan Mouton, had two fumbles during returns. Despite this, Titan's coach Jeff Fischer stood behind his decision to bench Ringer. In a 37-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was again active, but only played as a reserve on special teams. Ringer was one of three Titans who did not register a stat. The Titans, who last year had 13 wins, only three losses, started the season out zero wins four losses. They had their fifth loss of the season in a 31-9 loss to the Colts, a game in which Ringer was once again active, but only played special teams, not registering a stat. Ringer was one of two Titans that did not record an offensive stat. In a record-breaking 59-0 loss to the New England Patriots, Ringer had his first NFL carries, having 7 carries for 47 yards (6.7 average), including a 32 yard run, for no touchdowns, all amounting in Garbage time. The Titans finished the game with negative 7 passing yards as their record moved to 0 wins 6 losses, putting them in a tie for the worst record in the NFL alongside the St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite his performance in the loss, head coach Jeff Fisher said that Chris Johnson and LenDale White will continue to get the majority of the carries. [...] "There's not enough balls to go around. I wouldn't hesitate to put Ringer in if there's an issue," [...] Fisher said. During a practice on October 28, 2009, Ringer injured his back and had to be carted off in an ambulance. Fisher said of the injury [...] "It could be any number of things and it would be unfair for me to speculate right now. He is obviously in some pain." [...] The call to the hospital was initially phoned to treat a potentially [...] "traumatic" [...] injury, but tests have revealed that the injury is [...] "not considered serious". After spending a night with back problems, Ringer was released from the hospital early morning on October 29. Ringer's expected to miss a few weeks, as he's listed on the injury report with a back injury. Fisher commented on the injury, [...] "We <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> news on Javon. He obviously didn’t practice today, but he’s going to be OK. We were really concerned about it. We feared the worst and we got good results," [...] but would not elaborate as to {{the full extent of the}} injury. In a 30-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was declared inactive before the game, and did not play. It was however, the Titans first victory of the season. In week 9, Ringer was again inactive and did not play. In week 10, Ringer was listed as questionable, but was declared inactive, and did not play. In a 20-17 win against the Houston Texans, Ringer was inactive, and did not play. In 20-17 win against the Arizona Cardinals, Ringer was listed as the #2 running back. He had one yard on one carry. Ringer played because LenDale White, the team's usual #2 Running back, was benched due to being late to a team meeting. Ringer was then inactive for the rest of the season. Ringer finished the season with 8 attempts for 48 yards, playing in 7 games.|$|E
