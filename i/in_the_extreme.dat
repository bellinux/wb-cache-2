40|$|Amid {{increasing}} regulation, {{structural changes}} {{of the market and}} Quantitative Easing as well as extremely low yields, concerns about the market liquidity of the Eurozone sovereign debt markets have been raised. We aim to quantify illiquidity risks, especially such related to liquidity dry-ups, and illiquidity spillover across maturities by examining the reaction to illiquidity shocks at high frequencies in two ways: a) the regular response to shocks using a variance decomposition and, b) the response to shocks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> by detecting illiquidity shocks and modeling those as ultivariate Hawkes processes. We find that: a) market liquidity is more fragile and less predictable when an asset is very illiquid and, b) the response to shocks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> is structurally different from <b>the</b> regular response. <b>In</b> 2015 long-term bonds are less liquid and the medium-term bonds are liquid, although we observe that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>the</b> medium-term bonds are increasingly driven by illiquidity spillover from the long-term titles...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} identified robust associations between {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} and complex traits. As the proportion of phenotypic variance explained is still limited {{for most of the}} traits, larger and larger meta-analyses are being conducted to detect additional associations. Here we investigate the impact of the study design and the underlying assumption about the true genetic effect in a bimodal mixture situation on the power to detect associations. Methods: We performed simulations of quantitative phenotypes analysed by standard linear regression and dichotomized case-control data sets from <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of <b>the</b> quantitative trait analysed by standard logistic regression. Results: Using linear regression, markers with an effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> of <b>the</b> traits were almost undetectable, whereas analysing extremes by case-control design had superior power even for much smaller sample sizes. Two real data examples are provided to support our theoretical findings and to explore our mixture and parameter assumption. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea to re-analyse the available meta-analysis data sets to detect new loci <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes.</b> Moreover, our investigation offers an explanation for discrepant findings when analysing quantitative traits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general population and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes.</b> Copyright (C) 2011 S.

5|$|Hurricane Henri {{developed}} as Tropical Depression Eighteen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14 from a tropical wave, which had previously moved {{off the coast}} of Africa. The formation of a tropical depression was confirmed by reports from Hurricane Hunters. The depression tracked northward, brushing the eastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. After reaching the Gulf of Mexico it turned sharply westward, with a ridge preventing further northward movement. The depression turned southwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Henri on September 16.|$|E

40|$|A quasi-global {{sea level}} data set from tide gauges {{has been used}} to {{investigate}} extreme sea level events and their spatial and temporal variabilities. Modern methods based on a nonstationary extreme value analysis have been applied to the maxima of the total elevations and surges for the period of 1970 and onward. A subset of the data was used to study changes over the 20 th century. The analyses demonstrate the magnitude and timing of the seasonal cycle of extreme sea level occurrence, the magnitude of long-term trends <b>in</b> <b>extreme</b> sea levels, <b>the</b> evidence for perigean and nodal astronomical tidal components <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes,</b> and <b>the</b> relationship of <b>the</b> interannual variability <b>in</b> high water levels to other ocean and atmosphere variations as represented by climate indices. The subtraction from <b>the</b> <b>extreme</b> sea levels of the corresponding annual median sea level results in a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of trends at most stations, leading to the conclusion that much of <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> is due to change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mean value...|$|R
