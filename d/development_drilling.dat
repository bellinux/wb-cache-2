By {{the end of}} 2009 184 development wells had been completed, consisting of a mixture of production wells, observation wells, water injectors, gas injectors and cuttings injectors. Production was from deviated wells until 1992, when the first horizontal well was drilled. By June 1997, 28 horizontal wells had been completed, including three multilaterals. Horizontal drilling close to the oil-water contact was considered key to prolonging the plateau oil production period and achieving high recovery rates.|$|E

2500|$|Close order drill is an {{important}} factor in recruit training, and begins from their first formation on the yellow footprints. In the first phase, they learn all of the basic commands and movements, memorizing the timing through the use of [...] "ditties", or mnemonics, that help synchronize a recruit's movements with the rest of his or her platoon. Constant repetition and practice are used to facilitate muscle memory, so that any given movement can be rendered immediately and accurately upon order without hesitation. To aid in this <b>development,</b> <b>drill</b> movements are worked into other parts of daily life to help increase the platoon's synchronization and muscle memory—this same technique is used with other non-drill activities as well.

The company was incorporated in June 1976 under the name of Essar Construction Limited and was engaged primarily in core sector activities, including marine construction, pipeline laying, dredging and other port related activities. In 1984, the company ventured further into other core sectors mainly the field of exploration and <b>development,</b> <b>drilling</b> onshore and offshore oil and gas wells for Indian Public Sector oil exploration companies. The company's name was then changed to Essar Offshore and Exploration Limited in May 19 Limited, to reflect its highly diversified business interest.

This has been rapidly increased to approximately 25,000bopd through additional <b>development</b> <b>drilling</b> efforts. A total of fifteen (15) wells have been drilled to date; the company has achieved success through its ability to peacefully coexist with the host communities. Okoloko eventually led Midwestern to acquire Mart Resources taking it private in 2016. Midwestern achieved another commendable milestone in 2016 when the company celebrated nine Million Man-Hours LTI-Free operations. Midwestern has also received several awards and recognitions by notable international bodies for achievements in HSE; in 2013 the company won the prestigious Africa Oil and Gas Award for Health Safety and Environment (HSE). The company was cited for attaining six million man-hours loss time injury (LTI) free operation in its Umusadege marginal field. Midwestern is recognised as {{the largest and most}} successful venture {{in the history of the}} Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (“NNPC”) marginal field divestment program.

40|$|Mining {{companies}} desire short-term mine planning optimization {{since this}} {{enables them to}} schedule major sublevel stoping mining activities like <b>development,</b> <b>drilling,</b> extraction and backfilling. If simultaneous effort is made to reduce the grade deviation resulting from all extracted ore in a certain period, this allows it to finetune the processing operations and meet production targets. To control the short-term grade deviation, a new mixed integer linear programming model is developed which is able to consider production control constraints. For the scheduler, an objective function is developed which considers all to-be-mined ore and produces the best schedule to reduce grade deviation from combining ore of different locations. Limitations have been set {{on the availability of}} this ore. This is necessary as scheduled work must occur in the order of natural sequential transition from <b>development,</b> <b>drilling,</b> extraction and backfilling. A copper zinc operation is used to show that the periodical grade deviation can be controlled with the model. Furthermore, validation is done to proof the functionality of control constraints. The scheduler proofs that it can create schedules for half-year scheduling horizons and that it can create a better-optimized schedule regarding grade deviation than a model without the grade deviation considerations. The obtained schedules can be used by a planning engineer for detailed shift scheduling...|$|E
