5|$|Prior to the 2015 {{wilderness}} designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains {{were part}} of the largest unprotected roadless area in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of Congressional action that would designate the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a national monument by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act. Former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne initially studied the area for national monument status, but did not recommend it because Congressional action seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving <b>increased</b> <b>attention</b> when President Obama indicated he would designate a national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed wilderness areas, such as through the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Attention {{deficit is}} one of three main {{problems}} of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Children experience difficulty of paying attention and concentrating to one or more things or objects. As a results these children cannot perform the task well. Crossword puzzle {{is one of}} games that may <b>increase</b> <b>attention</b> and concentration. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of crossword puzzle to <b>increase</b> <b>attention</b> of children with ADHD. Method: Pre-experimental design was employed in this study. The population was ADHD students in Cakra Autisme Therapy. Seven students were recruited by means of purposive sampling. The independent variable was crossword puzzle and the dependent variable was the <b>increase</b> of <b>attention.</b> Data were collected using observation sheet and analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test with level of significance of α≤ 0. 05. Result: Result showed that crossword puzzle could <b>increase</b> <b>attention.</b> Respondent 2 ̆ 7 s attention improved from less to good attention, particularly in playing activities (p= 0. 014). Analysis: This finding suggests that there was differences of attention between pre and post-test. It can be concluded that crossword puzzle can <b>increase</b> <b>attention</b> of the students with ADHD. Discussion: It is recommended for teachers and parents of ADHD children to give them crossword puzzle game everyday at school or at home. Further studies should involve larger sample size and employs another game not only to <b>increase</b> <b>attention,</b> but also reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity of ADHD child...|$|R
5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the team would have {{to play in a}} sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a new}} venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be tailor-made for basketball, and the team would be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and <b>increased</b> <b>attention</b> from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E

This new romance caused the evil Stacy Keibler to turn against Wilson, {{and as a}} result of this, Wilson defected to the company. Wilson defeated Keibler in the first ever lingerie match at No Mercy. When the first ever brand separation of the company roster took place in April 2002, Wilson was drafted to SmackDown!. Shortly after this, as part of the storyline, Tajiri soon became jealous over the <b>increased</b> <b>attention</b> that Wilson received from other men, so he forced her to wear a geisha outfit, and he also appeared to mistreat her in matches. Depantsed WWE wrestler Rico on the April 25, 2002 version of Smackdown. Wilson finally grew tired of this, and during Tajiri's match against The Hurricane, she got on top of the announcer's table and stripped off her clothing. The distraction allowed The Hurricane to pick up the win. At Rebellion 2002, Torrie and her real life boyfriend at the time Billy Kidman defeated John Cena and Dawn Marie in an intergender tag team match. After the match Torrie and Kidman kissed. Torrie then got her first WWE Women's Championship match on Smackdown! after Women's Champion Molly Holly invaded the show interrupting Torrie's photoshoot and challenging her to a match in which Torrie was unsuccessful in winning.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the <b>increased</b> <b>attention</b> given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E

5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an <b>increased</b> <b>attention</b> to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E

Activity in a dorsal subregion was associated with <b>increasing</b> <b>attention</b> to relevant stimuli, correlated with behavioral measures of orienting attention to those stimuli, and resembled activity in dorsolateral prefrontal regions that are also thought to bias attention toward relevant stimuli. In contrast, activity in a rostral subregion was associated only with detecting response conflict caused by irrelevant stimuli. These findings support a 2 -component model for minimizing distraction and speak to a longstanding debate over how the ACCcd contributes to cognitive control...|$|R
