50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} organized as the Coronet Phosphate Company in 1906. The processing plant near Plant City was constructed and began mining operations in 1908. The phosphate was mined {{from the surrounding}} land holdings {{by a combination of}} dragline removal of the soil above the phosphate deposits (overburden) and hydraulic pressure stripping. The raw phosphate material was then transported to the processing plant where it was dried and stored for later shipment. The phosphate deposits in the nearby area were generally mined out by the 1920s, and mining operations shifted to the Hopewell area about 15 miles south of Plant City. In 1913 The Coronet Company purchased the Pembroke Mine facility, located between Fort Meade and Bartow in Polk County, from the French company, Compagnie Generale des Phosphates de la Florida. In addition to the Pembroke Mine, the Coronet Company operated mining facilities at a number of other sites it acquired in Hillsborough and Polk Counties. Operations at the main Plant City plant consisted solely of the drying of the rock material and its shipment to users by rail until 1945 when the plant was expanded to allow institution of a defluorinating process involving a chemical treatment of the rock. Deluorination allowed the conversion of phosphate to an animal feed supplement, Coronet <b>Defluorinated</b> <b>Phosphate</b> (CDP), which became the principal product of the company in later years.|$|E

There were 360 and 288 birds fed the SP diets in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and 288 birds were fed the CS diets in Experiment 2. Phosphorus equivalency values for phytase were calculated. The basal diets were formulated to contain 0. 27 % nonphytate P (nP); the SP basal diet contained 0. 45 % total P (tP) that included 0. 17 % P as defluorinated phosphate; the CS basal diet contained 0. 51 % tP that contained 0. 12 % P as <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Both basal diets were sup-plemented with <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> to provide 0. 36, 0. 45, or 0. 54 % nP or with 350, 700, or 1, 050 U of phytase/kg diets.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate laying hen per-formance when fed two sources of inorganic phosphorus. In Experiment 1, a regular and a coarse form of <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> and one source of dicalcium phosphate were used in diets calculated to contain either. 4 or. 5 % total phosphorus (. 2 or. 3 % nonphytate phosphorus). In Experiment 2, either the regular form of <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> or the dicalcium phosphate source was fed in diets calculated to contain either. 4,. 5,. 6, or. 7 % total phosphorus (. 2,. 3,. 4, or. 5 % nonphytate phosphorus). In Experiment 1, hens fed. 5 % total dietary phosphorus consumed more feed and produced heavier eggs (P <. 05). Hens fed the. 4 % dietary phosphorus level lost more weight during the experiment (P <. 05). No differences among dietary treatments existed for egg specific gravity. A significant source by level interaction occurred for the farm classification of thin-shelled, cracked, or broken eggs and for the total of these classifications. In Experiment 2, egg production, feed consumption, egg weight, and egg mass were depressed (P <. 05) at the. 4 % total dietary phosphorus level. Hens fed the. 4 and. 7 % total dietary phosphorus level laid eggs with the highest and lowest egg specific gravity, respectively. This trend was inverse {{to the effect of}} these phosphorus levels on egg weights. A significant source by level interac-tion occurred for the farm classification of thin shell and for the total percentage of eggs with exterior defects. At the. 4 % total phosphorus level, the regular form of <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> produced eggs with a significantly greater thin shell classification than the dicalcium phosphate source.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two experiments, each {{utilizing}} 540 turkeys, {{were conducted}} to determine the biological value of phosphorus from 13 different sources when compared with that from dicalcium phosphate (dihydrate, purified) as a standard. Each phosphorus source was added to a basal diet composed of 44 % ground yellow corn and 52 % dehulled soybean meal to supply. 09,. 18,. 27, or. 45 % inorganic phosphorus. Each of 60 diets, which included duplicates of the standard source, was fed to a pen of 9 male poults from 1 day to 3 weeks of age in each experiment. Body weight and toe ash measurements of poults collected at 3 weeks of age were used in nonlinear (exponential) bioassays to obtain relative biological values of phosphorus from various sources. With the dicalcium phosphate standard set at 100 %, the average relative biological values of three samples from each of commercial monocalcium phosphate (21 % P), dicalcium phosphate (18. 5 % P), and <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> were 93, 81, and 70 %, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Forty-seven {{commercial}} phosphorus supplements {{were obtained}} from feed manu-facturers and subjected to biological phosphorus availability assay using the turkey poult. Bone ash was the response criterion. Compared to a reference source of commercial mono/dicalcium phos-phate (assigned 100), 7 other mono/dicalcium phosphates averaged 97. 1 (range 88. 6 to 110. 0), 20 dicalcium phosphate sources averaged 90. 6 (76. 3 to 104. 8), and 20 <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> sources averaged 78. 4 % (68. 6 to 89. 6) availabilities. Combining equal parts of all sources of each type of phosphorus supplement and using purified grade calcium phosphate monobasic mono-hydrate as a defined standard, the commercial mono/dicalcium phosphates, dicalcium phosphates, and defluorinated phosphates averaged (with 95 % confidence limits) 93. 6 ± 7. 6, 88. 3 ± 8. 2, and 70. 2 ± 7. 2 % phosphorus availability in a slope ratio bioassay. Calculating the requirement inter-cepts utilizing the blended phosphorus supplements indicated apparent requirements using mono/ dicalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, and <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> of. 74,. 76, and. 83 % total phosphorus in the diet, respectively. Considering 1) the variability in availability of the sources, 2) variation in feed mixing, 3) the National Research Council requirement of. 80 %, and 4) that newly hatched poults are completely dependent on one batch of prestarter feed during 0 to 10 days of life, {{it is suggested that}} in certain instances field rickets could result from deficiency of dietary phosphorus...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o desempenho e a mineralização óssea de frangos de corte, na fase de 1 - 21 dias de idade, e a biodisponibilidade de fósforo de fosfatos comerciais utilizados na alimentação de frangos de corte. Mil e oito pintos machos de um dia de idade foram distribuídos em 14 tratamentos, com 6 repetições de 12 aves cada, em delineamento inteiramente ao acaso. Os fosfatos avaliados foram o defluorizado, monocálcico B, bicálcico A, bicálcico B e bicálcico C, com dois níveis de fósforo disponível (0, 30 e 0, 40 %). Foi adotada a técnica da {{abscissa}} e o fosfato monocálcico A como padrão (valor 100 %), com quatro níveis de fósforo disponível: 0, 25, 0, 35, 0, 45 e 0, 55 % para o cálculo da biodisponibilidade relativa. Todos os fosfatos com 0, 40 % do fósforo disponível proporcionaram às aves ganho de peso semelhante. Houve maior mineralização óssea das aves com o fosfato monocálcico B, comparado ao fosfato defluorizado. As fontes de fósforo apresentaram pequenas diferenças nos valores de biodisponibilidade relativa, com melhores resultados quanto ao monocálcico B e com maior sensibilidade de resposta da variável cinzas ósseas, em relação ao ganho de peso. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the performance and the bone mineralization of broilers, at 1 to 21 days of age, and the bioavailability of phosphorus in commercial phosphates utilized in the broilers feeding. One thousand and eight male chickens of one day old were distributed in a completely randomized design, in fourteen treatments, with six replications of twelve birds each. Phosphates evaluated were: <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate,</b> monocalcium B, dicalcium A, dicalcium B and dicalcium C, with two levels of available phosphorus (0. 30 and 0. 40 %).

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Large White turkeys to determine the feasibility of using fertilizer phosphates {{as a source of}} supplemental phosphorus for starting, growing and finishing turkeys in practical, corn-soybean meal diets. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine and compare the relative biological value of two fertilizer phosphates, concentrated triple superphosphate (CSP), and diammonium phosphate (DAP), and phosphated egg shell with a reference standard which was mono-sodium phosphate, NaH 2 PO 4 *H 2 O (A.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Large White turkeys to evaluate high-fluorine, fertilizer phosphates, diammonium phosphate (DAP) and concentrated superphosphate (CSP) along with partially <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> (PDP) and monocalcium phosphate (MCP) as sources of supplemental phosphorus. Aluminum as an alleviator of fluorine toxicity in starting and growing-finishing turkeys was studied. Fertilizer phosphates, PDP and MCP were each added to furnish all the dietary supplemental phosphorus. Aluminum sulphate was added to provide 0, 295 or 590 p. p. m. of Al in the first experiment and about a 1 : 1 A 1 :F ratio in the second experiment. CSP and DAP were somewhat toxic, significantly (P < 0. 05) depressing body weight and feed efficiency when fed to supply all supplemental phosphorus from day-old to 20 weeks, but CSP was not toxic for short periods, day-old to four weeks. Only CSP and DAP significantly (P < 0. 05) increased bone strength, bone ash and fluorine level of bone ash. Fluorine content of muscle was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased by DAP. Aluminum partially eliminated the toxic effect of DAP and CSP, but was not effective in preventing all symptoms of fluorine toxicity produced by the fertilizer phosphates. It was concluded from {{results of this study}} that PDP was an excellent phosphorus source for young turkeys. However, DAP and CSP should be added to furnish only a portion of the supplemental phosphorus along with feed grade phosphates...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, {{comprising}} two experiments, was (1) {{to determine}} in Experiment 1 the relationship of incremental dietary P (phosphorus) content on precaecal digestible P in male broilers and (2) to determine in Experiment 2 the precaecal P digestibility of various inorganic P sources at marginal levels of P supply. In Experiment 1, a total of 260 male Ross 308 broilers were divided into groups of 10 birds per pen resulting in 8 replicates for treatment 1 and 6 replicates for treatments 2 – 4. Experimental diets were formulated to contain 4 incremental concentrations of digestible P by means of increasing concentrations of monocalcium phosphate (MCP). In the second experiment, 480 -d-old male Ross 308 broilers were divided in groups of 12 birds per pen resulting in 16 replicates for the basal diet and 6 replicates for each test diet. A total of 4 inorganic P sources, MCP, monodicalcium phosphate (MDCP), dicalcium phosphate (DCP) and <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> (DFP) {{were added to the}} basal diet to determine the precaecal P digestibility. Three of the 4 inorganic P sources (MCP, MDCP and DCP) represented a mix of batches from different producers. At the end of both experiments, the chyme of the posterior part of the small intestine was collected. Digestibility of P and Ca was determined using titanium dioxide as indigestible marker. In Experiment 1, a reduction in precaecal digestibility of P was observed above an estimated precaecal digestible dietary P concentration of 4. 8 g/kg. The precaecal P digestibility of the tested inorganic P sources in Experiment 2 was 78. 3 % for MCP, 59. 0 % for DCP, 70. 7 % for MDCP and 31. 5 % for DFP. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A 3 -wk {{feeding trial}} using 920 {{day-old turkey poults}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the addition of seven levels of phytase (Natuphos®; 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1, 000, and 1, 200 U/kg of diet) to diets containing three levels of nonphytate P (nP) (. 27,. 36, and. 45 %). A positive control diet contained. 60 % nP. Semi-purified basal diets contained soybean meal as the only protein source. The increase in BW gain from added phytase was greatest for the lowest nP diet (nP by phytase interaction, P <. 001). At. 27 % nP, gains improved (P <. 001) to 800 U of phytase/kg of diet and then reached a plateau. At. 36 and. 45 % nP, increases in gains were observed only for 200 U of phytase/kg of diet. The highest phytase addition to. 36 and. 45 % nP diets produced gains equal {{to those of the}} positive control diet. Feed intake increases paralleled those of BW gains. Gain:feed was lowest for the. 27 % nP diets without phytase, but improved (P <. 001) to 800 U of phytase/kg of diet and then reached a plateau. The high incidence of leg disorders and high mortality (40 %) observed for the poults fed the. 27 % nP diet without added phytase declined with the addition of 200 to 400 U of phytase/kg of diet. Ash percentage of toes and tibias increased as the levels of nP (P <. 001) and phytase (P <. 01) increased; the magnitude of the response to phytase decreased as nP in the diet increased, resulting in an nP by phytase interaction (P <. 001). Tibial shear force and stress responded in a similar manner to increasing levels of nP and added phytase. Results show that 652 U of microbial phytase is equivalent to 1 g of P from <b>defluorinated</b> <b>phosphate</b> in turkey starter diets using soybean meal as the only source of phytate P.
