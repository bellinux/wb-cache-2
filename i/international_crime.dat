5|$|Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive.

Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of <b>international</b> <b>crime</b> syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade.

40|$|Recently, in The Netherlands, two {{businessmen}} {{have been}} prosecuted for {{their involvement in}} the commission of <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> In this article, the cases are analysed in the broader context of corporate complicity in <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> We enquire as to which extent these cases are typical for addressing corporate complicity and what lessons {{can be drawn from}} them. The cases illustrate the empirical variety of corporate complicity in <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> Furthermore, they indicate that investigating corporate complicity and connecting business entities to <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> is rather difficult. Questions are raised as to the intended deterrent effect of such prosecutions. © Oxford University Press, 2010, All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|While it {{is settled}} {{principle}} that states incur international responsibility when they commit <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> {{and also that}} international law provides for the criminal responsibility of individuals who commit <b>international</b> <b>crimes,</b> {{the relationship between these}} two regimes is far more uncertain, as is evidenced by a recent case before the International Court of Justice concerning the state responsibility of Serbia for <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> against Bosnian Muslims when the same conduct also fell {{under the jurisdiction of the}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which was charged with the prosecution of individuals. This volume investigates the issue, conducting a three-step analysis that explores the ideal theoretical underpinnings of state and individual responsibility, examines the reality of international practice and the most significant problems found in the relationship, and constructs a general legal framework that can account for the relationship and resolve the difficulties that arise.

On 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Latvia accusing it of not carrying out the treaty, namely of forming a military alliance against the USSR, and requested a new government to be formed and to guarantee Soviet military free entrance in Latvia. The Latvian government decided {{to give in to}} the ultimatum and on 17 June 1940, Soviet forces entered Latvia. The Declaration states that the Soviet ultimatum and military aggression on 17 June 1940, should be viewed as an <b>international</b> <b>crime,</b> which led to the occupation of Latvia and loss of its sovereignty and points out that the new government was formed as dictated by the Soviet Union and by international law should not be viewed as executive of Latvia as it represented Soviet, not Latvian, interests.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a gap exists between the universal consensus among all States regarding the criminalisation of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the one hand, and the prevalence of impunity on the other. It then puts forward the hypothesis that this gap {{may be explained by}} the unsuitability of the approach taken by the international community {{to address the issue of}} responsibility for core <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> In order to test this hypothesis, this thesis critically examines the different forms of responsibility for core <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> available in <b>International</b> Law. One of the important characteristics that distinguish core <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> from other <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> or ordinary crimes is that they are often committed with the simultaneous participation of several actors, including individual perpetrators, the State and, in some instances, non-state actors. Addressing the impunity for the commission of core <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> cannot, therefore, be limited to the lack of consequences for individual perpetrators. This thesis challenges the focus of International Criminal Justice on individual criminal responsibility and argues for a comprehensive approach to responsibility for <b>international</b> <b>crimes,</b> including State and collective responsibility, in order to convey the collective and political features of these crimes. The issue of responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes has been widely discussed in the scholarly literature, in particular with the development of International Criminal Law. One can observe, however, an imbalance between the amount of research dedicated to the issue of individual criminal responsibility for core <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> and the issue of State responsibility for <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> This imbalance is partly due to the fact that the notion of State criminal responsibility was rejected by a large majority of States, and discussions on these issues were abandoned. The originality of this thesis comes from the broad approach it adopts to examine the issue of responsibility for core <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> with the aim of bridging the gap between the distinct academic perspectives. It weaves together different approaches to responsibility, from individual responsibility to State responsibility, in order to identify the weaknesses of the current forms of responsibility and to highlight the complementary aspects of the main questions discussed in these different fields of law. The thesis goes beyond highlighting the complementary aspects of the different forms of responsibility for core <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> and puts forward a concrete proposal to develop a comprehensive normative framework, based on the model of the Responsibility to Protect concept, to implement a comprehensive approach to responsibility. This framework relies on the emergence of a duty to end impunity that lies with the territorial State as well as the international community. The purpose of this comprehensive normative framework is to promote the cooperation and interactions between the different mechanisms available in International Law and designed to deal with issues of responsibility for core <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> The proposal is based on the assumption that including the different norms and measures which aim to end impunity within one framework would optimise their synergy to respond to core <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> and protect the interests of humanity as a whole...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} national courts {{in light of the}} expected division of labour between international and domestic jurisdictions in seeking accountability whenever <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> are committed. The thesis proceeds from the normative assumption that states have a residual obligation to continue investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of <b>international</b> <b>crimes,</b> even after the ICC has intervened. The ICC can only proceed with a handful of investigations and prosecutions in each situation, leaving the bulk of the perpetrators to be prosecuted at the domestic level. Similarly, the ICC can only offer redress to a few victims, leaving the rest to look up to the national system for redress. Based on this, the thesis examines the domestic systems of three ICC- situation countries in order to assess the response at the domestic level in terms of securing domestic accountability and offering redress to victims of <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> The thesis assesses {{the extent to which the}} selected countries, being Kenya, Uganda and Côte D’Ivoire carried their share of the burden in investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> in their domestic jurisdictions upon the ICC’s intervention. The thesis also inquiries into whether the three countries met their obligations towards victims of <b>international</b> <b>crimes...</b>|$|R
