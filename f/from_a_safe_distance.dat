25|$|The {{conservation}} measures undertaken in Bhutan {{to preserve and}} conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The Royal Society for Protection of Nature (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education {{has been involved in}} monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to recorded information, 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 now) every year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a very modern decagonal building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with A german TV comapny) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech “spotting telescopes’’ and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled “Field Guide to Crane Behaviour”, <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes. Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the valley, the power cables were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.|$|E
50|$|This weapon {{enabled the}} German pilots to attack their bomber targets <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>distance</b> of over <b>a</b> kilometer, where {{the risk of}} being hit was much reduced. While a single fighter's payload of two or four such rockets was {{extremely}} unlikely to score a hit, a mass launch by an entire fighter squadron (a Staffel of 12-16 aircraft) as it arrived to intercept the bombers would likely score two or three hits, about 15% accuracy. The rocket's huge blast radius also compensated for inaccuracy, and even a non-lethal hit on a bomber by a showering of shrapnel would have psychological effects and perhaps cause it to take evasive manœuvres that would drive it from the protection of its fellows.|$|R

Flying in pairs (one to observe the ground, the other to observe the air around them), their tasks {{included}} bombing, strafing, close infantry support and artillery spotting. When attacking larger enemy formations, Boomerangs often operated in conjunction with larger aircraft. In this role, the Boomerang would get in close to confirm {{the identity of the}} target and mark it with a 20 lb (9 kg) smoke bomb with the [...] "cooperating" [...] aircraft delivering the major ordnance <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>distance.</b> <b>A</b> partnership between No. 5 Squadron Boomerangs and Royal New Zealand Air Force Corsair fighter bombers during the Bougainville Campaign was said to be particularly effective.|$|R

Picard abandons the proposed plan and instead offers Hugh asylum within the Federation. Hugh expresses enthusiasm at the prospect of remaining with La Forge but ultimately refuses, recognizing that the Borg will still come looking for him.
