The sculpture {{of the adult}} volution is somewhat irregularly and rather distantly spirally grooved, the grooves crossed by coarse irregular and arcuate growth wrinkles. The shell is colorless, glossy chestnut shaded to greenish yellow at the margin. The spire is tinged with reddish brown. The color of the ventral side of the shell is nacreous, <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> and purple. The columellar lip is white. The periostracum is thin and polished. The color of periostracum is greenish-olive. The spire is quite flat. The protoconch is of 1½ rapidly increasing whorls. The protoconch is flatly convex, one-seventh of the total length, regular, well defined. The shell has two whorls. The adult half whorl is the most rapidly increasing, fingernail-shaped, descending at the suture. The suture is deep. The peristome is thin and sharp, the upper lip very little curved. The outer lip is regularly rounded. The basal lip is nearly straight. The columella is very short, subvertical. Inner lip is thickly callous, terminating below in 1 or several minute tubercles, and spreading broadly above over the parietal wall. The inside of the aperture is strongly callous in the centre and towards the columella, {{where there is a}} well-impressed muscular scar of the columellar muscle. A second elongated muscle-scar is situated on the inner side of the basal lip.|$|E
500|$|The temple sits on an [...] {{site that}} was once {{part of a large}} {{sugarcane}} plantation. [...] Construction of the temple first began in February 1916. [...] Native materials consisting of crushed lava rock were used to build the temple, along with reinforced concrete. [...] The building's <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> finish was created using pneumatic stone-cutting techniques. [...] The temple has the shape of a cross when seen from the air; the highest point of the temple is , and it measures [...] from east to west and [...] from north to south. [...] The front exterior was designed {{in the form of a}} Greek cross, but lacks a tower, a rarity in LDS Church temples. [...] Apart from the Laie Hawaii Temple, only two other church temples lack towers or spires: the Cardston Alberta Temple and the Mesa Arizona Temple.|$|E
500|$|Chris Cunningham {{served as}} a model for a {{character}} in the novel Pattern Recognition (2003) by William Gibson, in which a fictitious music video director who puts [...] "robot girls in his video" [...] makes a clip characterized by the following words: [...] "No sci-fi kitsch for Damien. Dreamlike things in the dawn half-light, their small breasts <b>gleaming,</b> <b>white</b> plastic shining faints as old marble", as a reference to [...] "All Is Full of Love". In 2004, similarities were noted between the design of the robots in the music video and those in the film I, Robot, raising accusations of plagiarism by fans. E! News contacted Cunningham and 20th Century Fox—the studio behind the film—but neither of them returned calls for comment. According to Tymon Smith of The Times, 2015 American film Chappie [...] "ends with a rip off" [...] of the music video. It also was an inspiration for the opening title sequence of the television series Westworld.|$|E

500|$|Horch {{expended}} $2,497,164 {{for land}} and construction costs. He used $1,790,500 {{of the mortgage}} bond issue, $64,500 of a second mortgage, and made up the rest from a loan he himself made. The completed structure had 233 one-room, 63 two-room, and two three-room apartments {{as well as a}} penthouse suite of seven rooms. It had a series of recessions and terraces beginning at the sixteenth story which culminate in a tower. Its steel skeleton was interior, lacking the corner columns that were present in other buildings of the time. It had a brick exterior that was deep purple in its lower stories gradually growing lighter in color until at the top a faint lavender blended into pure white. Harvey Wiley Corbett said the coloration gave the skyscraper a [...] "feeling of growth." [...] He said, [...] "this colored brick exterior, which rises from a low, dark ground to a <b>gleaming,</b> <b>white</b> pinnacle, gives the building a dynamic quality. The play of sunlight on the many hues will make the building a beautiful spectacle of changing colors." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoskins {{begins his}} chapter on {{industrialisation}} with the remark [...] "England {{was still a}} peaceful agricultural country {{at the beginning of}} the seventeenth century." [...] He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's flying shuttle of 1733 and Hargreaves's spinning jenny of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his steam engine factory [...] "in the still unravished country" [...] outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by Anna Seward lamenting the ravishing of Coalbrookdale, c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from The Excursion. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the Staffordshire Potteries. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like Preston, and of new towns like Middlesbrough, which went from a single farm in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of Cornwall, including the <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> china clay pits of St Austell and the abandoned tin mines of St Cleer, commenting that [...] "there is a point, as Arthur Young saw, when industrial ugliness becomes sublime".|$|E
500|$|The Archangel Michael, the {{embodiment}} and conduit of divine justice, is positioned directly below Christ, the only figure to reach both Heaven and Earth. He wears a dispassionate expression as {{he holds a}} set of scales to weigh souls. Unusually for Christian art, the damned outweigh the blessed; Michael's scales have only one soul in each pan, yet the left pan tips below the right. Michael is given unusual prominence in a [...] "Last Judgement" [...] for the period, and his powerful presence emphasises the work's function in a hospice and its preoccupation with the liturgy of death. His feet are positioned {{as if he is}} stepping forward, almost about {{to move out of the}} canvas and he looks directly at the viewer, giving the illusion of judging not only the souls in the painting but also the viewers. Michael, like Sebastian and Anthony, was a plague saint and would have been visible to inmates through the openings of the pierced screen as they lay in their beds. Michael is painted with iconographic elements associated with paintings of the Last Judgement, and is by far the most beautifully and colourfully painted figure; he is dressed in a red cope with woven golden fabrics over a shining white alb, which dominates the lower panels, [...] "hypnotically attracting the viewer's glance" [...] according to Lane. He is surrounded by four cherubs, playing trumpets to call the dead to their final destination. Michael's role in the Last Judgement is emphasised through van der Weyden's use of colour: Michael's <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> alb contrasts with the cherub's red vestments, set against a blue sky directly below heaven's golden clouds.|$|E

In 2006, the character was again used to advertise BK's new Cheesy Bacon Angus and TenderCrisp sandwiches.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Observatory's Public Affairs Office, Russell W. Porter was {{primarily}} responsible for the Art Deco architecture of the Observatory's buildings, including {{the dome of the}} 200–inch Hale Telescope. Porter was also responsible for much of the technical design of the Hale Telescope and Schmidt Cameras, producing a series of cross-section engineering drawings that are considered among the finest examples of such work. Porter worked on the designs in collaboration with many engineers and Caltech committee members. The <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> building on Palomar Mountain that houses the 200–inch Hale Telescope is {{considered by many to be}} [...] "The Cathedral of Astronomy".|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{statues and}} {{memorials}} dot the cities, towns, and countryside of Germany, including the famous Bismarck Memorial in Berlin and numerous Bismarck towers on four continents. The only memorial depicting {{him as a}} student at Göttingen University (together with a dog, possibly his Reichshund Tyras) and as a member of his Corps Hannovera was re-erected in 2006 at the Rudelsburg. The <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> 1906 Bismarck Monument in the city of Hamburg, stands in the centre of the St. Pauli district, and is the largest, and probably best-known, memorial to Bismarck worldwide. The statues depicted him as massive, monolithic, rigid and unambiguous. Two warships were named in his honour, the [...] of the German Imperial Navy, and the [...] from the World War II–era.|$|E

2500|$|... 'The Time Machine Tour' {{included}} venues such as The Royal Albert Hall and the State Theatre in Sydney. His {{stage was}} again designed by Willie Williams and included a large bridge that could extend {{over the first}} few rows of seats. On the final night, at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Hayes' hometown of Brisbane, the performance was recorded in HD for a DVD release. The Time Machine Tour DVD came out in two editions: the special edition which was limited to 2000 copies and contained a four-panel, fold-out, <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> box, a thirty-two page color booklet with 300 photos and notes from the artist, and the regular edition. The special edition DVD, which was only available from Hayes' website, was shipped to purchasers on 1 July, and the regular edition, which was available in shops, was released on 22 July.|$|E
2500|$|The Cornaro Chapel showcased Bernini's {{ability to}} {{integrate}} sculpture, architecture, fresco, stucco, and lighting into [...] "a marvelous whole" [...] (bel composto, to use early biographer Filippo Baldinucci's term {{to describe his}} approach to architecture) and thus create what scholar Irving Lavin has called the [...] "unified work of art". The central focus of the Cornaro Chapel is the ecstasy of the Spanish nun and saint-mystic, Teresa of Avila. Bernini presents the spectator with a theatrically vivid portrait, in <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> marble, of the swooning Teresa and the quietly smiling angel, who delicately grips the arrow piercing the saint's heart. On {{either side of the}} chapel the artist places (in what can only strike the viewer as theater boxes), portraits in relief of various members of the Cornaro family — the Venetian family memorialized in the chapel, including Cardinal Federico Cornaro who commissioned the chapel from Bernini — who are in animated conversation among themselves, presumably about the event taking place before them. The result is a complex but subtly orchestrated architectural environment providing the spiritual context (a heavenly setting with a hidden source of light) that suggests to viewers the ultimate nature of this miraculous event.|$|E
2500|$|Understandings of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial and Beowulf {{have been}} {{intertwined}} {{ever since the}} 1939 discovery of the former. [...] "By the late 1950s, Beowulf and Sutton Hoo were so inseparable that, in study after study, the appearance of one inevitably and automatically evoked the other. If Beowulf came on stage first, Sutton Hoo was swiftly brought in to illustrate how closely seventh-century reality resembled what the poet depicted; if Sutton Hoo performed first, Beowulf followed close behind to give voice to the former's dumb evidence." [...] Although [...] "each monument sheds light on the other," [...] {{the connection between the}} two [...] "has almost certainly been made too specific." [...] Yet [...] "elmets are described in greater detail than any other item of war-equipment in the poem," [...] and some specific connections can be drawn. The boar imagery, crest and visor all find parallels in Beowulf, as does the helmet's <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> and jeweled appearance. Though the Sutton Hoo helmet cannot be said to fully mirror any one helmet in Beowulf, the many isolated similarities help ensure that [...] "despite the limited archaeological evidence no feature of the poetic descriptions is inexplicable and without archaeological parallel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nearing {{was born}} in Morris Run, Tioga County, Pennsylvania, {{the heart of the}} state's coal country. Nearing's grandfather, Winfield Scott Nearing, had arrived in Tioga County with his family in 1864, at the age of 35, when he {{accepted}} a job as a civil and mining engineer. Before {{the end of the year}} he had assumed full control of mining operations as the superintendent of the Morris Run Coal Company, a position of authority which he held for the remainder of his working life. An intense, driven man, Scott Nearing's grandfather studied science and nature, practiced gardening and carpentry, and regularly received crates of books from New York City, amassing a large personal library. In his memoirs written late in his life, Scott Nearing would recall his grandfather as one of the four most influential figures in his life. Nearing's upbringing was that of a young bourgeois, his mother employing a part-time tutor and two Polish servants to clean the <b>gleaming</b> <b>white</b> house atop a hill overlooking the town. Scott's brother recalled that the citizens of Morris Run had treated the handsome and intelligent Scott [...] "the way they would treat the heir to the nobleman.... They all treated him with awe." ...|$|E

He came back with a shiver and sat down in his warm seat beside the stove.|$|R

60|$|The later summer sunbeams lay on {{an expanse}} of {{slightly}} broken ground where purple and crimson heather were relieved by the golden blossoms of the dwarf gorse, interspersed with white stars of stitch-wort. Here and there, on the slopes, grew stunted oaks and hollies, whose polished leaves <b>gleamed</b> <b>white</b> with {{the reflection of the}} light; but there was not a trace of human habitation save a track, as if trodden by horses' feet, clear of the furze and heath, and bordered by soft bent grass, beginning to grow brown.|$|R

Chauvelin's keen eyes had fastened on it, saw the form of receipt for money with Heriot's signature, which he recognised, on the top.|$|R
