40|$|This paper {{presents}} two complementary techniques, shearography and pulsed stimulated infrared thermography, used {{to detect}} and characterize depth and width of the adhesion defects (delaminations or adhesive disbonds) of externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) on concrete surface structures. Shearography associated to a <b>depressure</b> load on the one hand, and step heating infrared thermography {{on the other hand}} are presented. In a first step, the feasibility study of the two methods is performed by using finite element method. Then, validation laboratory tests on specimens containing calibrated defects are carried out. Debonded areas were simulated by locally replacing the epoxy resin with non-adherent polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) discs at the concrete-to-FRP interface. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method to detect and characterize subsurface debonds of FRP strengthening materials bonded on concrete structures.

40|$|The average indoor radon {{concentration}} in Finnish flats is 80 Bq/m 3. Typically walls {{have been made}} using concrete elements. Building materials are the dominant source of indoor radon. However, in the flats of the lowest floor, with a floor slab in direct ground contact, {{the main source of}} radon is often the inflow of radon bearing soil air. The number of these ground contact flats is less than 10 % {{of the total number of}} flats. The average indoor radon concentration of these ground contact flats is 150 Bq/m 3. Consequently in more than 10 % of these dwellings the concentration limit of 400 Bq/m 3 is exceeded. The data presented is based on a nation-wide radon survey in 900 flats. Highest concentrations observed in flats have exceeded 10. 000 Bq/m 3. Best mitigation results were achieved using radon wells and sub-slab-depressurisation, the typical radon concentration reductions being 50 - 80 %. High <b>depressures</b> in flats decrease the efficiency of both radon wells and sub-slab-suction installations. In comparison, the radon concentration reductions for radon wells, obtained in low rise residential houses where <b>depressures</b> are lower, were typically remarkably higher, 80 - 95 %. The exhaust ventilation, in combination with the air tightness of the concrete elements and windows, causes remarkable underpressures over the floor slab, increasing the inflow of radon-bearing air fro...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} detection and characterization of the depth and width of defects (delaminations or adhesive disbonds) that can {{take place at the}} interface between the concrete substrate and the bonded FRP used for the reinforcement of concrete structures. Detection of disbonds between different layers is also possible. Moreover, this method can be used to evaluate the quality of adhesion of the FRP to the substrate (partial delamination, damage or poor mechanical properties of the resin). This method is based on two complementary techniques: shearography associated to a <b>depressure</b> solicitation on the one hand, and stimulated infrared thermography on the other hand. Theoretical and experimental analyses of adhesive disbonds are first presented. The performance of the method is then demonstrated using data from experimental inspection of specimens containing calibrated defects. In the inspected samples, debonded areas were simulated by locally replacing the epoxy resin with non-adherent polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) discs at the concrete-to-FRP interface or between different FRP layers.

40|$|The {{increased}} demand for energy related minerals has caused renewed interest in mining. Many of the ore deposits are below or within aquifers. To retrieve this ore, the water must {{be removed from the}} mine. Ascertaining the need for dewatering/depressuring requires the use of elementary and complex procedures. Digital computer models have been used to simulate aquifer systems and can be used to test dewatering/ <b>depressuring</b> schemes if certain precautions are taken. A digital model using a program developed by T. A. Prickett and C. G. Lonnquist has been developed in the Gas Hills, Wyoming Uranium Mining District to test a proposed dewatering/depressuring scheme for an underground uranium mine. Results of this test indicate that digital models can be used to predict dewatering/depressuring scheme effects, but continued monitoring of the piezometric surface {{in the area of the}} mine once dewatering/depressuring commences is needed in order to validate the predictions of the model...|$|R
40|$|Particle {{design is}} {{presently}} a major development of supercritical fluida applications, {{mainly in the}} pharmaceutical and speciality chemical industries. Micronisation technology provides more possibilities to deliver drug in human body either through gastrointestinal track. That experiment has a purpose to create drug-polymer microparticle composite with Particles from Gas-Saturated Solutions (PGSS) technology. Different pressures (80 - 200 bar) and polymers (PEG 6000 and Î² cyclodextrin) were applied to get microparticle with narrow size distribution, discrit morphology and fast drug release profile. Ketoprofen-PEG 6000 and ketoprofen-Î² cyclodextrin was saturated with supercritical fluid in saturated vessel and the liquified time was 2 hours, then <b>depressured</b> the solution pass through nozzle as microparticles. The compositeâs morphology is various by the effect of saturation pressure and type of polymer which used. Microparticle morphology indicate that higher saturation pressure create irregular microparticle product and on the contrary lower saturation pressure create sphere microparticle product. The average diameter of the particles obtained by PGSS at different conditions was about 0. 83 - 7. 74 Î¼m and release profile of composite Ketoprofen-PEG 6000 was faster than ketoprofen-Î² cyclodextrin...|$|R
40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) is {{commonly}} converted from liquid to vapor for gas distribution. One {{of the methods}} for vaporizing LNG {{is to use a}} shell and tube heat exchanger. Water is used on the shell side to provide the heat source and LNG is then vaporized through the tube side passages of the exchanger. In many of these applications, the LNG is at a high pressure on the tube side while the water is at a lower pressure than the LNG as it flows through the shell side. The industry consensus document API 521 [1] “Guide to Pressure Relieving and <b>Depressuring</b> Systems, ” Fourth Edition, paragraph 3. 18 “Heat Transfer Equipment Failure ” states that a complete tube rupture is to be considered for the possible overpressure of the equipment. The typical shell and tube exchanger application described above has rupture discs on the shell body to protect the shell from being over-pressured due to a tube rupture scenario. The possible freezing of the water in the shell due to mixing with cryogenic LNG is a concern. The issue to consider is whether freezing will occur before the rupture discs can safely relieve a possible over- pressure condition of the shell. A numerical analysis of the condition was performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The exchanger service, the analysis procedure and the conclusions found are detailed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|When DOE {{funds were}} {{exhausted}} in March 1995, all Phase 2 activities {{were placed on}} hold. In February 1996 a detailed cost estimate was submitted to the DOE for completing the two remaining Phase 2 Multi Annular Swirl Burner (MASB) topping combustor test burns; in August 1996 release was received from METC to proceed with these tests. The first test (Test Campaign No. 3) will be conducted to: (1) test the MASB at proposed demonstration plant full to minimum loading operating conditions; (2) identify the lower oxygen limit of the MASB; and (3) demonstrate natural gas to carbonizer fuel gas switching. The Livingston Phase 3 Pilot Plant was last operated under contract DE-AC 21 - 86 MC 21023 in September 1995 for seven days in an integrated carbonizer-CPFBC configuration. In May, 1996, the pilot plant was transferred to Contract DE-AC 22 - 95 PC 95143 to allow testing {{in support of the}} High Performance Power Systems (HIPPS) Program. The HIPPS Program required modifications to the pilot plant and the following changes were incorporated: (1) installation of a dense phase transport system for loading pulverized coal into the feed system lock hopper directly from a pneumatic transport truck; (2) removal of the char transfer pipe between the char collecting hopper and the CPFBC to allow carbonizer only operation; (3) installation of a lock hopper directly under the char collecting hopper to facilitate char removal from the process, the hopper vent gases exhaust to the carbonizer baghouse filter and the <b>depressured</b> char is transferred via nitrogen to the CPFBC baghouse for dumping into drums; (4) removal of the carbonizer cyclone and top of bed overflow drain line; all material elutriated from the carbonizer bed will thus be removed by the 22 -element Westinghouse ceramic candle filter; (5) replacement of the carbonizer continuous bottom bed drain (screw feeder) with a batch-type drain removal system; and (6) installation of a mass spectrometer that draws sample gas via a steam jacketed line from the refractory lined piping downstream of the candle filter...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 90 The {{prevailing}} use {{of expansion}} gases in distribution stations can be economically {{replaced by the}} application of turbo expanders. The advantage of turbine impulse wheels {{is that they have}} high efficiencies, even at very low partial load. With a single valve control easily programmable, seven valve points can be achieved with three control valves. Thereby, throttle losses can be minimized. The design of the valves and their drives can be adapted to the operation requirements. Bearings and couplings are deleted by a combination of expander and gear in one unit, resulting in less power loss, lower investments, and higher availability. The advantages of planetary gears compared to helicals are higher efficiency, smoother running, lower tooth loads, lower noise, and smaller plot plan. This results in secondary advantages such as smaller oil systems, baseplates, and foundations. The disadvantages are higher quality requirements regarding production and more components which, however, are smaller. When an automatic clutch is used, the LP section is shut down as soon as the gas mass flow is zero. The LP section is back into operation within a few seconds after having gas flow. The plant operates fully automatically without operators and maintenance personnel being present at the location. The economic application of expansion turbines used for energy recovery depends not only on a turbine, but on all plant components. The gain of the useful energy is higher than the expenditure of investments, operating costs and maintenance costs. The possibilities of energy recuperation from the natural gas pressure in distributing mains shall be demonstrated by means of an example. The natural gas distribution station of a large German town is supplied from a 41 bar distribution main and transmits the natural gas in two networks of 13 bar or 5 bar. Previously, the natural gas was <b>depressured</b> through throttle valves, and the energy contained in the natural gas was destroyed. Now the gas expansion will be used for the generation of electric energy by the use of expansion turbines...|$|R
