40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} performance appraisal. Performance standards are examined according to their two functions concerning their uniform and universal character. In this context, there is presented the method proposed by A. Melich, which refers to joint appraisal of manual and clerical work. The author devotes {{a great deal of}} her attention to analytical and identification instruments of the method such as: 1) systematics of criteria and characteristics of performance standards appraisal; 2) appraisal of performance standards along with appraisal notes; 3) table of {{growth in the number of}} points for particular <b>appraisal</b> <b>notes</b> assuming progressive growth of their value. The article contains an example of performance appraisal with estimation of the sum of points as well as a model of a filled form describing a work post. A wide ran g e of identification instruments ensures: 1) explicitness of research procedure; 2) it reduces the influence of subjective factor; 3) it increases accuracy and objectiveness of results. The proposed analytical method of performance appraisal may be adopted for lab o u r appraisal on the macroeconomic scale, and its results may be treated as information basis for elaboration of the basic wage system in the national economy.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Schon 2 ̆ 7 s (1983) book on the character and development of professional knowledge, our research has been directed at applying his theoretical position {{to the problem of}} how teachers acquire the knowledge of practice that allows them to teach as they do. Briefly, we have attempted to understand what lies behind the apparently simple notion that teachers learn to teach by teaching, by examining how teachers interact with their experiences in order to learn from them. This paper does not dwell on the results of our qualitative case studies of 13 participating teachers; these are reported elsewhere (Russell, 1988; Russell, Munby, Spafford, 2 ̆ 6 Johnston, 1988). Instead, this paper explores some of the work that has been occasioned by Schon 2 ̆ 7 s writing. As shown below, his books have been interpreted variously, as different people have found different points to focus upon. In some cases, these differences suggest that there are difficulties in Schon 2 ̆ 7 s position; in other cases, there are grounds for thinking that the differences emerge from incomplete understandings of Schon 2 ̆ 7 s position. We find that discussing the various interpretations helps to push our own thinking forward, and to identify the questions that we find worth pursuing. The paper has four sections. The first is a sketch of our interpretation of Schon 2 ̆ 7 s theoretical approach. The second examines selected appraisals of the more general features of Schon 2 ̆ 7 s work. The third section focuses on his two concepts of reflection which seem to have been misinterpreted by some who use his work. The fourth section focuses on the concept of 2 ̆ 2 reframing, 2 ̆ 2 which we take to be central to Schon 2 ̆ 7 s account of the development of professional knowledge. Here, the discussion moves toward identifying theoretical and empirical questions that are raised by our own work and by the <b>appraisals</b> <b>noted</b> in the second section. The paper 2 ̆ 7 s response to these appraisals is the starting point for speculations about the directions that might be taken to further our understanding of the conditions that promote teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional knowledge...|$|R

It briefly recalls the main features of the procedures put forward in the book by the authors and addresses {{some of the issues}} that have arisen in theoretical work since the early 1970 s, particularly the implications of uncertainty. An analysis of the value of project appraisal under uncertainty is provided. The rise and decline of project appraisal in the World Bank and elsewhere is charted, and reasons are considered. Particular attention is given to the difficulty of using shadow prices and to the institutional environment. It is argued that evidence from analysis of the World Bank's projects is consistent with placing a high value on the process of economic appraisal. The costs of <b>appraisal</b> are <b>noted,</b> as is the need to avoid excessive complexity. The paper argues for the impor-tance of an economic appraisal system and of attending to the incentives that operate in such a system. In the late 1960 s there was considerable development of methods for applying social cost-benefit analysis to investment in developing countries. In the 1970 s, these methods began to be applied. From 1974 to 1982 there were massive public sector investment booms in many of the developing countries. It appears that much of this investment yielded little or nothing.

Medical revalidation, introduced in 2012, is an assessment of a doctors competence and passing results in a five yearly license to practice medicine. It assesses of a doctors professional development, workplace performance and reflection and aims to provide assurance that doctors are up-to-date and fit to practice. The dominant assessment mechanism is a portfolio. The content of the revalidation portfolio has been increasingly prescribed and {{the assessment of the}} SI is a fundamental aspect of the appraisal process which ultimately allows Responsible Officers (ROs) to make recommendations on revalidation. ROs, themselves doctors, were the first to undergo UK revalidation. This qualitative study explored the perceptions of ROs and their appraisers about the use of this {{portfolio of}} evidence in a summative revalidation appraisal. 28 purposefully sampled London ROs were interviewed following their revalidation appraisal and 17 of their appraisers participated in focus groups and interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify commonalities and differences of experience. SI was mostly easy to provide but there were challenges in gathering certain aspects. ROs did not understand in what quantities they should supply SI or what it should look like. Appraisers were concerned about making robust judgements based on the evidence supplied. A lack of reflection from the process of collating SI and preparing for <b>appraisal</b> was <b>noted</b> and learning came more from the appraisal interview itself. More explicit guidance must be available to both appraisee and appraiser about what SI is required, how much, how it should be used and, how it will be assessed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{employee}} perceptions of performance appraisal in two public Technical Education Vocational Entrepreneurship and Training (TEVET) institutions located in the Southern Province of Zambia. This study followed a quantitative research approach using the census method to obtain data. Seventy-three (73) participants out of a total population of 129 at varying employment levels consented and participated in the study. A 59 item self-administered questionnaire was administered to obtain responses. The main conclusion from this study was that employees held positive attitudes about performance appraisal. The study found that the performance appraisal system was integrated into institutions’ culture and that the respondents were satisfied with the performance appraisal process and that 68 % of the respondents agreed that the performance system in their institution was fair. However, concerns about the low frequency of <b>appraisal</b> meetings were <b>noted.</b> The frequency of performance evaluation on how well the employees were meeting their targets was mostly once in a year. This called for urgent attention by the management of the institutions to ensure that at least two appraisals were conducted in a year. The study also found evidence of rating standards varying from supervisor to supervisor. The study recommended that supervisor training in rating formed part a continuous process. These findings and the recommendations in this study are expected to be of benefit to the principals and supervisors in the institutions. The findings of the study contributed to the knowledge in the field of education management and leadership by providing empirical evidence about employee’s perceptions about performance appraisal in the two public TEVET institutions in Zambia.

40|$|Traditional {{publications}} for Chinese {{children were}} based on core value and belief systems in Confucianism. After the First Opium War, foreign missionaries began to disseminate Western knowledge and religious beliefs within the Chinese society on a wider scale, reaching children through the avenue of education. At this time, however, most Chinese intellectuals held fast to their belief in traditional Chinese methods of education which emphasised the Confucian principles. The loss of the Sino-Japanese War brought a realization within China that its society and education system were relatively backward when {{compared with those of}} Western powers. Chinese intellectuals became more aware of the necessity for an entire education reform which should start from the younger generations in an attempt to revitalize China. As a result of this realization, Chinese educators began to adopt the missionaries’ practice of using publications targeted specifically at children. From the mid- 19 th century onwards, these publications underwent a period of vigorous development in China. Missionaries and Chinese intellectuals in the late Qing period had thus, between them, helped to prepare the ground for the modernization of China by educating the future generations to employ new ideas and values. This historical survey aims to investigate the development of Chinese publications for children from the mid- 19 th to the early 20 th centuries, and offering a closer look at childhood education in China during this period. Some basic clarifications on the definition of children and the nature of books for children is given in the Introductory Chapter, and a brief account of the previous works and articles related to the study is also included. The main part of this thesis starts with a critical examination of the changes of the traditional Chinese primers for children education like Three Character Classic (《三字經》) under the influence of western ideas. Then it proceeds to an exploration of the emergence of modernized textbooks in Chapter Three with a critical <b>appraisal</b> of <b>noted</b> writers and publishers such as Wang Hengtong (Wang Hang-T’ong 王亨統) and the Commercial Press (商務印書館). Chapters Four to Seven present case studies of four children’s periodicals representing different parties of interest in the reform of children education, they are respectively the missionary publication The Child’s Paper (Xiaohai yuebao 《小孩月報》), The Children’s Educator (Mengxue bao《蒙學報》) published by the Chinese reformist, Enlightenment Pictorial (Qimeng huabao《啟蒙畫報》) published by enlightened Chinese intellectuals, and The Children’s World (Tongzi shijie 《童子世界》) published by the Chinese revolutionist. Chapter Eight attempts to reveal the nature of leisure readings and the development of children’s literature in late Qing China while the final Chapter provides conclusions and suggestions for further investigation. By writing this thesis, I am committed to provide readers with a comprehensive and solid historical sketch of the development of children’s publication in a critical period of pre-modern China. published_or_final_versionChineseDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Appraisal is generally used for both accountability and professional development. This mostly depends on the school 2 ̆ 7 s objectives for carrying out the <b>appraisal.</b> It is <b>noted</b> that teachers get uncomfortable and feel threatened by the performance appraisal process. This could be for two main reasons: (a) when the objectives of appraisal exercises are not made clear to the teachers, they do not know what this would lead to; (b) teachers become threatened if they know that, the school will use the findings to decide about teachers annual increments and promotions. Literature, however, suggests that performance appraisal should be for teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional development. The exercise should be a road map for teachers and finding should help teachers to grow professionally. I carried out an exploratory case study to find out the current practices of carrying out teachers 2 ̆ 7 performance appraisal of a particular school; their perceptions about the teachers 2 ̆ 7 performance appraisal and to know whether the findings of teachers 2 ̆ 7 performance appraisal enabled the teachers to grow professionally. The findings of the study revealed that, the teachers associated the performance appraisal not with professional growth but with the amount of increment in salary, dismissal in case of poor performance and promotion or demotion. However, there are different perceptions about the utility of appraisal among the stakeholders. Some relate this to professional development, others categorize the teachers in A 2 ̆ 7 and B 2 ̆ 7 category and based on this categorizes give increments. It was evident {{that the purpose of the}} practice is not clear to teachers. Appraisers do not negotiate and inform the details on which teachers are appraised.

Accordingly, {{the current study}} sought to: (1) illuminate factors that predict health-related quality of life, caregiver burden, and reported benefits in adult siblings of adults with autism, using a stress and coping framework and (2) compare outcomes of siblings of adults with autism (n = 31) to siblings of adults with Down syndrome (DS) (n = 54). For the within subject hypotheses, analyses were repeated within the DS group and an overall Disability group (n = 97). The Disability group consisted {{of participants in the}} Autism and Down syndrome groups plus twelve individuals in a mixed group of adult siblings of adults with DS who presented with co-morbid symptoms of autism. Variables were organized using The Adult Sibling Caregiver Conceptual Model (ASCCM) into three categories: antecedents (e. g., sibling relationship quality, problem behaviors of the disabled sibling), mediators (e. g., coping strategies, cognitive appraisal types), and psychosocial outcome variables (i. e., mental and physical health-related quality of life, caregiver burden, and reported benefits). For the within subject primary hypotheses, I posited a series of relationships between the antecedents and outcomes based on prior literature on demographic and individual difference predictors (e. g., siblings of adults with autism with fewer problem behaviors would have increased health-related quality of life [HRQOL], decreased caregiver burden, and increased reported benefits) and on stress and coping factors related to the burden of providing care for an individual with autism (e. g., greater use of avoidant coping strategies would be related to lower HRQOL, increased caregiver burden, and decreased reports of benefits). Exploratory hypotheses also were examined (e. g., being married would be associated with increased HRQOL, decreased burden, and increased reported benefits). The within-subject results indicated support for eight of the ten primary hypotheses and five of the six exploratory hypotheses when examined within {{at least one of the}} study groups: Autism, DS, or Disability. Overall, sibling caregivers, regardless of their sibling’s disability, reported more favorable psychosocial outcomes when demands were lower (e. g., less severe levels of problem behaviors, fewer autism symptoms exhibited by their disabled sibling, decreased additional pile-up stress), when resources were available to cope with stress (e. g., social support, respite care), and when healthy responses to stress were reported (e. g., use of emotion focused vs. avoidant coping strategies, use of challenge vs. threat <b>appraisal</b> types). Of <b>note,</b> reported benefits, which have rarely been examined in the autism literature, were strongly related to the quality of a sibling relationship across all study groups, and with the helpfulness of received services and perceived social support within the Autism group. The between subject hypotheses also were largely supported. As expected, compared to siblings of those with Down syndrome, siblings of those with autism demonstrated greater levels of caregiver burden and lower mental HRQOL. Moreover, there was a rank ordering in levels of caregiver burden across disability groups; siblings of adults with DS reported the lowest burden, siblings of adults with DS with symptoms of autism reported significantly higher levels of burden, and siblings of those with autism reported the most burden. The results imply that autism, either alone or co-morbid with another diagnosis, presents an increased risk of stress and caregiver burden, not only in parent caregivers, but also in sibling caregivers. Interestingly, there was also evidence for higher levels of stress related growth within the Autism group compared to the DS group.
