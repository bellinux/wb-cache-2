500|$|I am a {{defeated}} {{and ruined}} war captive, that's it! The former emperor [...] treated me generously, but I betrayed him. In my present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury at me. In the past I {{have heard that}} Han law stipulates that executions of men be {{carried out in the}} city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, <b>I</b> <b>request</b> to Zhaling [...] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire.|$|E
500|$|During the 1965 war, his son, Nanda, {{was shot}} down over Pakistan. He was {{captured}} and held as {{a prisoner of war}} (POW). On realizing the identity of the wounded soldier at Kargil, Radio Pakistan immediately announced the capture of the younger Cariappa. General Ayub Khan himself contacted General Cariappa, who was living a retired life at Mercara, his hometown, with information about his son's safety. When Ayub Khan offered to release his son immediately, Cariappa is reported to have scoffed at the idea and told him to give his son no better treatment than any other POW. Singh recounts that Cariappa replied, [...] "He is my son no longer. He is the child of this country, a soldier fighting for his motherland like a true patriot. My many thanks for your kind gesture, but <b>I</b> <b>request</b> you to release all or release none. Give him no special treatment." ...|$|E

Pursuant to the instructions given by you that I personally have Wallenberg under my care, <b>I</b> <b>request</b> approval to make an autopsy with a view to establishing cause of death.... I have personally notified the minister and it has been ordered that the body be cremated without autopsy." [...] The document was signed by Smoltsov, then the head of the Lubyanka prison infirmary, and addressed to Viktor Abakumov, the Soviet minister of state security. In 1989, Wallenberg's personal belongings were returned to his family, including his passport and cigarette case. Soviet officials said they found the materials when they were upgrading the shelves in a store room.|$|E

She wrote {{instructions}} for her funeral during an illness in 1841 at Sudbury Hall: [...] "I die in all humility", she wrote, [...] "we are alike before the throne of God, and <b>I</b> <b>request</b> therefore that my mortal remains be conveyed to the grave without pomp or state…to have as private and quiet a funeral as possible.

2500|$|On 13 May 1938, {{while riding}} his {{motorcycle}} {{down the streets}} of Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge clashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes {{given to him by}} Ozaki at the time, had the police discovered the documents his cover would have been blown, but a member of his spy ring was able to get the hospital to remove the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan was due to over-zealous officers in the Kwantung Army and there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war with the Soviet Union. Unaware that Berzin had been shot as a [...] "Trotskyite" [...] in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938 reading: [...] "Dear Comrade! Don't worry about us. Although we are terribly tired and tense, nevertheless we are disciplined, obedient, decisive and devoted fellows who are ready to carry out the tasks connected with our great mission. I send sincere greetings to you and your friends. <b>I</b> <b>request</b> you to forward the attached letter and greetings to my wife. Please, take the time to see to her welfare". Sorge never learned that his friend Berzin had been shot as a traitor.|$|E
