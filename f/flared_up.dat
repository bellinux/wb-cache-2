In 508, as {{antagonism}} with the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Theodoric <b>flared</b> <b>up,</b> the Emperor Anastasius I (491–518) {{is reported to have}} sent a fleet of 100 warships to raid the coasts of Italy. In 513, the general Vitalian revolted against Anastasius. The rebels assembled a fleet of 200 ships which, despite some initial successes, were destroyed by admiral Marinus, who employed a sulphur-based incendiary substance to defeat them.|$|E
5|$|The WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova DY CMi (also {{known as}} VSX J074727.6+065050) <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> to {{magnitude}} 11.4 over January and February 2008 before dropping eight magnitudes to around 19.5 over approximately 80 days. It is a remote binary star system where a white dwarf and low mass star orbit each other {{close enough for}} the former star to draw material off the latter and form an accretion disc. This material builds up until it erupts dramatically.|$|E
40|$|Intravenous {{injection}} of methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) in mice with a unilateral antigen-induced arthritis induced with mBSA causes a <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> of the inflammation in the arthritic {{but not in}} the contralateral joint. To study whether this phenomenon is dependent on class II antigens, we treated C 57 Bl/ 10 (H- 2 b) and C 3 H (H- 2 k) mice with monoclonal anti-Iab (HB 26) and anti-Iak (2 - 2 - 1) antibodies on days - 3, - 2, - 1 and 0 before induction of the <b>flare</b> <b>up.</b> Another group was treated only once on day 0 before antigen challenge. Four injections with HB 26 completely suppressed the <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> reaction in C 57 Bl/ 10 mice; the same results were seen with 2 - 2 - 1 in C 3 H mice. One injection only partly suppressed the <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> reaction in both strains, whereas four injections with the haplotype-nonspecific antibodies did not affect the <b>flare</b> <b>up.</b> Injections with HB 26 appeared to be able to completely suppress a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction but not a reversed passive Arthus reaction in C 57 B 1 / 10 mice, indicating that anti-Ia antibodies have an effect on lymphocyte-dependent but not on antigen-antibody-dependent inflammatory phenomena. These results demonstrate that the <b>flare</b> <b>up</b> of antigen induced arthritis is dependent on the presence of Ia antigens, suggesting that the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes {{plays an important role in}} this process...|$|R

At magnitude 3.68, Alpha is the constellation's brightest star. It is a blue-white star around 22,000 times as luminous as the Sun. Near Alpha is T Pyxidis, a recurrent nova that has <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> to magnitude 7 every few decades. Three star systems have planets, all discovered by doppler spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of BhimaI, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.|$|E
5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can {{be traced}} to the {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E

5|$|The bitter {{rivalry between}} Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> in 1919, when UGA mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football during the United States' involvement in World War I. Because Tech {{was a military}} training ground, it had a complete assembly of male students. Many schools, such as UGA, lost all of their able-bodied male students to the war effort, forcing them to temporarily suspend football during the war. In fact, UGA did not play a game from 1917 to 1918.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E

Though he performed poorly in both games, the Colts still managed to win. He was shelled {{in the third inning}} by the Cincinnati Reds and on the next day, he gave up seven runs to the Cleveland Spiders in only two innings. Because of these starts, he did not appear in another game until August 14, when he was used in relief to face the Brooklyn Dodgers. His control issues <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> and he had trouble holding the Dodgers' baserunners. He was released one week later, having walked 10 batters in the 11 innings he pitched for the Colts.

Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend.

5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the magnitude2.2 Alpha Coronae Borealis.

T Coronae Borealis, {{also known as the}} Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a recurrent nova. Normally of magnitude10, it last <b>flared</b> <b>up</b> to magnitude2 in 1946. ADS 9731 and Sigma Coronae Borealis are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have Jupiter-sized exoplanets.

All of the older projectiles and powder charges had been removed from the magazines of Nevada, and the crew had taken a break after loading the new projectiles in anticipation of loading the new powder charges on Sunday.|$|E
