2500|$|Wolf was {{involved}} in Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election bid, brainstorming with the president's team about ways to reach female voters. During Al Gore's unsuccessful bid for the presidency in the 2000 election, Wolf {{was hired as a}} consultant to target female voters, reprising her role in the Clinton campaign. Wolf's ideas and participation in the <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign</b> generated considerable media coverage and criticism. According to a report by Michael Duffy in Time, Wolf was paid a monthly salary of $15,000 [...] "in exchange for advice on everything from how to win the women's vote to shirt-and-tie combinations." [...] This article was the original source of the widely reported assertion that Wolf was responsible for Gore's [...] "three-buttoned, earth-toned look." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Nader was {{the most}} {{successful}} of third-party candidates. His campaign was marked by a traveling tour of large [...] "super-rallies" [...] held in sports arenas like Madison Square Garden, with retired talk show host Phil Donahue as master of ceremonies. After initially ignoring Nader, the <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign</b> made a pitch to potential Nader supporters in the final weeks of the campaign, downplaying Gore's differences with Nader on the issues and arguing that Gore's ideas were more similar to Nader's than Bush's were, and noting that Gore had {{a better chance of}} winning than Nader. On the other side, the Republican Leadership Council ran pro-Nader ads in a few states in an effort to split the liberal vote. Nader claimed his objective in the campaign was to pass the 5-percent threshold so his Green Party would be eligible for matching funds in future races.|$|E
2500|$|The dissenting {{opinions}} strongly {{criticized the}} five justice majority for involving the Court in state-level affairs. Justice Stevens' dissent (joined by Justices Breyer and Ginsburg) concluded as follows: The per curiam opinion in Bush v. Gore did not technically dismiss the case, and instead [...] "remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion." [...] Gore's attorneys therefore {{understood that they}} could fight on, and could petition the Florida Supreme Court to repudiate the notion that December 12 was final under Florida law. However, Gore dropped the case, {{because he was not}} optimistic about how the Florida justices would react to further arguments and, as one of his advisers put it, [...] "the best Gore could hope for was a slate of disputed electors". In addition to this, <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign</b> chairman Bill Daley argued that fighting on was futile because even if the Florida Supreme Court defied the U.S. Supreme Court and ordered a new recount, [...] "he GOP would take them straight back to Washington, where the [...] Supreme Court would repeat: 'You ain't going to count, okay? So quit bothering us.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 8, 2000, the Florida Division of Elections {{reported}} that Bush won with 48.8% {{of the vote}} in Florida, a margin of victory of 1,784 votes. The margin of victory was less than 0.5% of the votes cast, so a statutorily-mandated automatic machine recount occurred. On November 10, with the machine recount finished in all but one county, Bush's margin of victory had decreased to 327. According to legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, later analysis showed that a total of 18 counties—accounting for a quarter of all votes cast in Florida—did not carry out the legally mandated machine recount, but [...] "o one from the <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign</b> ever challenged" [...] the notion that the machine recount had been completed. Florida's election laws allow a candidate to request a county to conduct a manual recount, and Gore requested manual recounts in four Florida counties: Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade, which are counties that traditionally vote Democratic and would be expected to garner more votes for Gore. Gore did not, however, request any recounts in counties that traditionally vote Republican. The four counties granted the request and began manual recounts. However, Florida law also required all counties to certify their election returns to the Florida Secretary of State within seven days of the election, and several of the counties conducting manual recounts did not believe they could meet this deadline. On November 14, the statutory deadline, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the seven-day deadline was mandatory, but that the counties could amend their returns at a later date. The court also ruled that the Secretary, after [...] "considering all attendant facts and circumstances," [...] had discretion to include any late amended returns in the statewide certification. [...] Before the 5pm deadline on November 14, Volusia County completed its manual recount and certified its results. At 5pm on November 14, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced that she had received the certified returns from all 67 counties, while Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties were still conducting manual recounts.|$|E

In 2000, Klain returned to the <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign,</b> once Coelho was replaced by William M.

5000|$|Following {{the statewide}} machine recount, the <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign</b> {{requested}} a manual recount in four counties. Florida state {{law at the}} time allowed a candidate to request a manual recount by protesting the results {{of at least three}} precincts. The county canvassing board was then to decide whether to do a recount, as well as the method of the recount, in those three precincts. If the board discovered an error that in its judgment could affect the outcome of the election, they were then authorized to do a full recount of the ballots. This statutory process primarily accommodated recounts for local elections. The <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign</b> requested that disputed ballots in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia Counties be counted by hand. Volusia County started its recount on November 12. Florida statutes also required that all counties certify and report their returns, including any recounts, by 5:00 p.m. on November 14. The manual recounts were time-consuming, and {{it soon became clear that}} some counties would not complete their recounts before the deadline. On November 13 the <b>Gore</b> <b>campaign</b> and Volusia and Palm Beach Counties sued to have the deadlines extended.|$|E

Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|R
