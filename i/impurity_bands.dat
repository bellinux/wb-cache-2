40|$|A {{chain of}} {{impurity}} cells in a photonic insulator introduces impurity modes {{of the electromagnetic}} held over a narrow band of frequencies. We introduce a model of this band {{in the manner of}} a tight-binding description of <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> in semiconductors, and use it to describe waveguiding along the chain, and, in particular, across a corner of 90 degrees. We also point out the possibility of using <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> in photonic insulators to study wave propagation along an effectively one-dimensional disordered chain.

40|$|Electrical {{transport}} through weakly-coupled doped superlattices is investigated theoretically. For all dopings we find negative differential conductivity at sufficiently {{high electric}} fields. In low-doped samples {{the presence of}} <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> modifies the current-voltage characteristics substantially and we find two different current peaks whose relative height is changing with the electron temperature. These findings can explain the observation of different peaks in the current-voltage characteristics with and without external THz irradiation in low-doped samples. Furthermore this feature is suggested as a method to probe <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> in a transport experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure of a}} prototype dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS), Ga 1 -xMnxAs, is studied by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. We prove that the optical transitions originated from <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> cause the strong positive MCD background. The MCD signal due to the E 0 transition from the valence band to the conduction band is negative indicating that the p-d exchange interactions between the p-carriers and d-spin is antiferromagnetic. The negative E 0 MCD signal also indicates that the hole-doping of the valence band is not so large as previously assumed. The <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> seem to play important roles for the ferromagnetism of Ga 1 -xMnxAs. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|Blocked <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> {{detectors}} fabricated using standard silicon technologies {{offer the}} possibility of combining high sensitivity and high accuracy in a single detector operating in a low background environment. The solid state photomultiplier described by Petroff et al., which is {{a new type of}} blocked <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> detector, offers even higher sensitivity as well as operation in the visible spectral region. The principle of operation and possible application of blocked <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> detectors for stellar seismology and the search for extra-solar planets are described...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{the choice of the}} sign of the hopping matrix in our <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> model for disordered III-V diluted {{magnetic}} semiconductors [PRL 87, 107293 (2000); cond-mat/ 0111045] is justified: with this choice, the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> is placed inside the gap and it has a mobility edge, as expected for a disordered system. The other sign choice, suggested in cond-mat/ 0111504, leads to an unphysical description of the occupied states of the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> (extremely long tail, no mobility edge, no bulk ferromagnetism).

40|$|Magneto-optical {{properties}} of the ferromagnetic semiconductor GaMnAs are studied in a material specific multi-band tight-binding approach. Two realistic models are compared: one has no <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> while the other shows an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> for low Mn concentrations. The calculated magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is positive for both models proving that, unlike previously asserted, the observed positive MCD signal is inconclusive as to {{the presence or absence}} of an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> in GaMnAs. The positive MCD is due to the antiferromagnetic p-d coupling and the transitions into the conduction band. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figue...|$|R
40|$|Impurity-induced {{quasiparticle}} bound {{states on}} a pair-breaking {{surface of a}} d-wave superconductor are theoretically described, taking into account hybridization of impurity- and surface-induced Andreev states. Further a theory for effects of surface disorder (of thin impurity surface layer) on the low-bias conductance of tunnel junctions is developed. We find a threshold $n_c$ for surface impurity concentration $n_S$, which separates the two regimes for surface impurity effects on the zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). Below the threshold, surface impurities do not broaden the ZBCP, but effectively reduce its weight and generate <b>impurity</b> <b>bands.</b> For low $n_S$ <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> can be, in principle, resolved experimentally, being centered at energies of bound states induced by an isolated impurity on the surface. For larger $n_S$ <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are distorted, move to lower energies and, beginning with the threshold concentration $n_S=n_c$, become centered at zero energy. With increasing $n_S$ above the threshold, the ZBCP is quickly destroyed {{in the case of}} strong scatterers, while it is gradually suppressed and broaden in the presence of weak impurity potentials. More realistic cases, taking into account additional broadening, not related to the surface disorder, are also considered. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|It {{was shown}} that thermal {{treatment}} of semi-insulating specially undoped gallium arsenide leads to significant changes of lux-brightness characteristics of inter- impurity and <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> in the spectra of impurity luminescence. The indicated changes {{are due to}} transformations in the system of non-radiating channels of hole recombination in it {{that took place in}} the process of thermal treatment. The effect observed can lead to variation of the correlation between the intensities of bands in the spectrum of impurity photoluminescence even if the change of concentration of luminescence centers does not occur. Such changes in lux-brightness characteristics of <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> should be concerned while using photoluminescence spectra for the analysis of changes occurring in impurity-deficient composition of gallium arsenide during its thermal treatment...|$|E

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that point defects on {{graphene}} are strongly correlated {{and can not be}} treated as independent scatters. In particular, for large on-site defect potential, it is shown that defects induce an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> with density of state characterized by the Wigner semi-circle law. We find that the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> enhances conductivity to the order of 4 e^ 2 /h and explains the absence of strong localization. Furthermore,the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> supports ferromagnetism with the induced magnetic moment approaching 1 μ_B per defect in the limit of infinite quasi-particle lifetime.

40|$|Motivated by {{the idea}} of <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> {{superconductivity}} in heavily Boron doped diamond, we investigate the doping of various elements into diamond to address the question, which <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> can offer a better DOS at the Fermi level. Surprisingly, we find that the vacancy does the best job in producing the largest DOS at the Fermi surface. To investigate the effect of disorder in Anderson localization of the resulting <b>impurity</b> <b>band,</b> we use a simple tight-binding model. Our preliminary study based on the kernel polynomial method shows that the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> is already localized at the concentration of 10 - 3. Around the vacancy concentration of 0. 006 the whole spectrum of diamond becomes localized and quantum percolation takes place. Therefore to achieve conducting bands at concentrations on the scale of 5 - 10 percent, one needs to introduce correlations such as hopping among the vacancies...|$|R
40|$|We analyze microscopically the valence and <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> {{models of}} {{ferromagnetic}} (Ga,Mn) As. We {{find that the}} tight-binding Anderson approach with conventional parameterization and the full potential LDA+U calculations give a very similar picture of states near the Fermi energy which reside in an exchange-split sp-d hybridized valence band with dominant orbital character of the host semiconductor; this microscopic spectral character {{is consistent with the}} physical premise of the k. p kinetic-exchange model. On the other hand, the various models with a band structure comprising an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> detached from the valence band assume mutually incompatible microscopic spectral character. By adapting the tight-binding Anderson calculations individually to each of the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> pictures in the single Mn impurity limit and then by exploring the entire doping range we find that a detached <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> does not persist in any of these models in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn) As.

40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the density of}} states of a two dimensional electron gas located at the interface of a GaAlAs/GaAs heterojunction. The disorder potential which is generally created by a single doping layer behind a spacer, is here enhanced {{by the presence of}} a second delta doped layer of scatterers which can be repulsive or attractive impurities. We have calculated the density of states by means of the Klauder's approximation, {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field of arbitrary strength. At low field either band tails or <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are observed for attractive potentials, depending on the impurity concentration. At higher field, <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are observed for both repulsive and attractive potentials. We discuss the effect of such an asymmetrical density of states on the transport properties in the quantum Hall effect regime. Comment: 22 pages, 12 figures. submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the density of}} states of a two-dimensional electron gas located at the interface of a strongly disordered GaAlAs/GaAs heterojunction. The disorder potential is created by two delta doped layers. The first layer includes the parent donors which provides the well with electrons and creates a smooth disorder potential. The second layer is doped with either acceptor or donor impurities, and is located inside the well, thus creating a strongly disordered potential. We {{calculate the}} density of states {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field of arbitrary strength by taking into account all perturbative terms in the fifth Klauder's approximation. We find an anharmonic spectrum, strongly asymmetric, for the Landau level density of states. At low field, the attractive potential creates the well-known band tails or <b>impurity</b> <b>bands.</b> At higher field, we show that <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are also created by repulsive potentials. We discuss the consequences of the anharmonicity and asymmetry on physical properties in the quantum Hall effect regime...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} X-ray {{absorption}} study in boron doped diamond, Nakamura et al. {{have seen a}} well isolated narrow boron <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> in non-superconducting samples and an additional narrow band at the chemical potential in a superconducting sample. We interpret the beautiful spectra as evidence for upper Hubbard band of a Mott insulating <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> and an additional metallic `mid-gap band' of a conducting `self-doped' Mott insulator. This supports the basic framework of a recent theory of the present author of strongly correlated <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> superconductivity (SCIBS) in a template of a wide-gap insulator, with no direct involvement of valence band states.

40|$|Using several {{derivatives}} of scanning force microscopy with conducting tips, we find {{direct evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a highly compensated donor <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> in GaN films near the sapphire substrate interface. Scanning current-voltage and capacitance microscopy measurements both show that the free electron density is much higher in the interfacial region of these films. However, surface contact potential images reveal that the Fermi level in the interfacial region is 50 meV to 100 meV deeper into the bandgap {{than it is in the}} less conducting bulk film. These results are inconsistent with a high density of electrons in the intrinsic conduction band. Rather, they point to the existence of a partially filled donor <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> with the Fermi level in the <b>impurity</b> <b>band.</b> We show that this anomalous conduction behavior most likely originates from a high concentration of oxygen and the defective microstructure at the GaN/sapphire interface...|$|R

With a few controversial models emerged from numerous experimental and theoretical studies, {{the mechanism of}} the ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn) As still remains a puzzling enigma. In this Letter, we use soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to positively identify the ferromagnetic Mn 3 d-derived <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> in (Ga,Mn) As.
