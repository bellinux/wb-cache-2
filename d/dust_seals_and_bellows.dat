5000|$|Maintenance and reliability: Top-loading washers {{are more}} {{tolerant}} of maintenance neglect, and may not need a regular [...] "freshening" [...] cycle to clean door <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> <b>bellows.</b> During the spin cycle, a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine, using only a lip {{around the top of}} the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge. Therefore, the potentially problematic door-sealing and door-locking mechanisms used by true front-loaders are not needed. On the other hand, top-loaders use mechanical gearboxes that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives.|$|R
40|$|The development, performance, {{and test}} {{results for the}} {{spaceborne}} magnetic tape transport are discussed. An analytical model of the tape transport was used to optimize its conceptual design. Each of the subsystems was subjected to reliability analyses which included structural integrity, maintenance of system performance within acceptable bounds, and avoidance of fatigue failure. These subsystems were also compared {{with each other in}} order to evaluate reliability characteristics. The transport uses no mechanical couplings. Four drive motors, one for each reel and one for each of two capstans, are used in a differential mode. There are two hybrid, spherical, cone tapered-crown rollers for tape guidance. Storage of the magnetic tape is provided by a reel assembly which includes the reel, a reel support structure <b>and</b> bearings, <b>dust</b> <b>seals,</b> <b>and</b> a dc drive motor. A summary of transport test results on tape guidance, flutter, and skew is provided...|$|R
40|$|Piston-skirt {{lubrication}} system provides {{steady supply of}} oil to piston rings of gas compressor. No need for oil-filled crankcase or external oil pump. Instead, part of each piston acts as its own oil pump circulating oil from reservoir. Annular space at bottom of piston and cylinder constitutes working volume of small oil pump. Depending on application, reservoir open to atmosphere, or <b>sealed</b> <b>and</b> pressurized in <b>bellows</b> to prevent contact between oil and atmosphere. Filter removes particles worn away from piston rings and cylinder wall during normal operation...|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, {{the company}} invented the first {{automotive}} mechanical seal. In the early 1940s, John Crane developed and introduced patented end face shaft <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> an elastomer <b>bellows</b> <b>seal.</b> The U.S. Navy relied on packing solutions from Crane Packing {{for a host}} of applications, including expansion joints, stern tube service, cargo pumps, rotary steam and air compressors, water-tight closures, metallic condenser packing and pipe fittings. In recognition for its service, Crane Packing received a U.S. Navy “E” Award. From the years 1941 to 1949, Crane Packing applied for and received 24 patents, the majority of which were for mechanical seals [...] designed to handle high-pressure and corrosive applications.|$|R
50|$|To prevent {{water and}} dirt from {{damaging}} the suspension, gaiters {{have been used}} to cover the fork's stanchions. However even when properly <b>sealing</b> the stanchions <b>and</b> sliders, the gaiters have to have small openings in them to allow air to move {{in and out of the}} cavity between gaiter and stanchion as the fork moves through its travel. Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes, staying trapped inside and accumulating over time. Since modern <b>dust</b> wipers <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> keep out water and dirt adequately enough by themselves, and since gaiter-less stanchions are generally regarded as more aesthetically pleasing, gaiters have fallen out of favor.|$|R
40|$|The {{merger of}} General Motors Australia and Holden Motor Body Builders in 1931 not only {{established}} Australia&# 039;s leading automotive company it formalised Automotive Design in this country. This paper, {{for the first}} time, will examine and disclose the initial 30 years of Automotive design at GM-H and expose the original designers, their origins and achievements. Initially located in Adelaide from 1923, Holden&# 039;s design section produced unique body styles, like the streamline styled All-Enclosed Coupé and provided solutions not only for <b>dust</b> <b>sealing,</b> ventilation <b>and</b> motor body strength but solved complex engineering problems with innovative design during WWII. The initial designers were trained internally by one man, Bert Wylie, who understood that good body design lay in precise drawings and not a chalk board. The team he built, with American input, applied considerable knowledge and expertise to ensure the Holden car, when released in 1948, was exactly what the Australian market wanted. Design at GM-H evolved from American practice through a small team who were provided {{the opportunity to be}} innovative and progressive. This paper explores the emergence of the Holden design team and their place in the general design sphere. The paper will argue that by the mid- 1940 s the GM-H design group were capable of producing a complete Australian car and that this expertise elevated the Holden design team to a position of respect within the GM Corporation...|$|R
5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed <b>and</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>bellows</b> chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.|$|R

The area between the barrier plate and closure head is exhausted through the closure head penetrations. The closure head, upper drive mechanism, <b>and</b> <b>bellows</b> <b>seal</b> are lifted away and transported to a safe area. The barrier plate acts as the primary boundary and each drive and control rod penetration has an elastomer seal preventing excessive tritium gases from escaping.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot spp.) tubers form a major {{food source}} of {{carbohydrates}} and other food nutrients for tropical dwellers. The tubers also are sources of industrial {{products such as}} dextrins, glues, ethyl alcohol, acetone and glucose etc. Post -harvest losses on storage of cassava root tubers are large because of their poor storage qualities. In this study, wholesome cassava tubers were washed and disinfected for used to study the storage and spoilage of cassava tubers using moist saw <b>dust</b> in <b>sealed</b> boxes <b>and</b> some exposed as control. Profuse microbial growths occurred {{on the surface of}} tubers exposed on the 4 th day and were completely soften due to fermentation of the tissues on the 7 th day. Bacteria isolated from the tubers were species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Diplococcus. Fungal species isolated using cultural characteristics were Candida and Aspergillus. Tubers on moist sawdust had no microbial growth but developed secondary roots on the 3 rd day of storage. They could be stored up to 3 weeks. The sawdust acted as soil for the tubers while the different gases and heat evolved by the tubers in the sealed boxes had a curing effect on the tubers. The study hence recommends that storage of cassava tubers in moist saw-dust would provide effective preservative method against post-harvest losses...|$|R
