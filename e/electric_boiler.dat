5000|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> is {{a device}} that uses {{electrical}} energy to boil water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} {{components}} in an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> is low, {{it is easy}} to control and maintain.|$|E
50|$|Some feel <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> will be {{competitive}} {{in the market for}} years to come, due to the efficiency, and perks that an <b>electric</b> steam <b>boiler</b> offers over the traditional fire heated boiler. Experts also feel that <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> have a large amount of marketability, which will greatly help keep them relevant in the industry. <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> also have lighter regulations than fire heated boilers, which can make them an attractive choice to some potential buyers.|$|R
50|$|Traditional, fuel-heated boilers {{generally}} require multiple {{different parts}} to operate successfully. In contrast, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are relatively simple devices. Additionally, because <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{do not use}} complicated forms of heat exchange, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> do not contain many of the potential hazards that a commonly present in a fuel-heated <b>boiler.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are also generally easier to maintain {{because they do not}} need tube replacement that fuel-heated boilers often require, due to soot and fuel residue, or any of the fire maintenance required for a fuel-heated <b>boiler.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> have smaller carbon footprints than their traditional cousins: fuel-heated steam boilers, and require less space overall making them a good choice for a smaller operations that are in need of a boiler.|$|R
30|$|To {{integrate}} additional {{wind power}} into the grid, an effective {{method is to}} introduce additional heat suppliers into the heating system to decouple the power from the heat supply. References [11] and [12] proposed a system using <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> with heat storage tanks and demonstrated that this system could {{make a contribution to}} consume additional wind electricity. The <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> could increase the wind electricity consumption and enhance the flexibility of CHP units by replacing part of the heat produced by CHP units. Reference [13] developed a dispatch model to optimize the heat and power production from multiple sources, including CHP units, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers,</b> wind power and conventional units. This study demonstrated that <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> with heat storage tanks were effective at reducing wind curtailment and primary energy consumption. Reference [14] also introduced <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and developed a stochastic partial equilibrium model of the power system. The results showed that the <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> could replace part of the heat production of oil-fired heat boilers and CHP plants and were beneficial for the integration of wind power and fuel saving. Furthermore, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and heat pumps have also been reported [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] to promote wind power integration. Reference [23] described a combination of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and wind generators that exhibited satisfactory performance in integrating wind power.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{fossil fuel}} or {{conventional}} <b>electric</b> <b>boiler,</b> no component of electrode boiler is at high temperature except the water itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} steam with an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> is fairly simple. Electricity is run through a heating element {{that acts as a}} resistor to create heat through resistance. Water from the system or holding tank is then run over or near this hot element in a pipe or tank, heating the water to a suitable temperature, then making the water hot enough to boil and become saturated steam, at which point the saturated steam is transported to wherever it is needed via the steam pipes that exit the body of the <b>electric</b> <b>boiler.</b> Electric steam boilers work in a very similar way to fire heated boilers with the exception of what heats the water.|$|E
5000|$|Operationally, an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> is a {{convenient}} process unit that {{is easy to}} control and that requires no space for fuel storage nor for an exhaust gas stack. There is no blower for combustion air and only minimal pumps required for operation, so the boiler is quiet.|$|E
50|$|Some {{experts that}} work with boilers {{on a day-to-day basis}} feel that <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are {{actually}} superior to fuel heated boilers in a few ways. Those experts say that using <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> may actually be cheaper than using a fuel heated boiler, while also possibly being much more environmentally friendly. The <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> also require less equipment to be installed than a traditional boiler helping to reduce the high installation costs that will come with a fuel heated <b>boiler.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Boilers</b> can fit into smaller areas due to the way they are constructed and the lack of required parts that a fuel heated boiler requires to operate.|$|R

30|$|By {{introducing}} <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{into the}} regional heating system, wind curtailment and coal consumption are reduced simultaneously (relative to the reference case). <b>Electric</b> <b>boilers</b> can consume {{a proportion of}} the extra wind power directly. As a type of flexible heat source, these boilers could accommodate some of the heat requirements of CHP units, expanding their operational flexibility and integrating additional wind power.|$|R
5000|$|... "Boiler The Rabi" [...] — A Rabi {{saying he}} can boil {{water to a}} full boiled temperature, A deadly force which can destroy a person's life, as {{the human body is}} filled with about 70% of water. Later on it is {{discovered}} it is a trick, used with an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> under the table.|$|E
50|$|The Braedstrup {{system is}} {{designed}} to integrate with the national electric grid. The heat pump and <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> are used when there is surplus wind power available on the grid, contributing to {{the stability of the}} system and maximal use of the wind power. The natural gas boiler is used when this renewable electricity is not available.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Eastern" [...] (Russian: [...] "Восточный" [...] "Vostochniy") microdistrict {{is one of}} the [...] "youngest" [...] {{districts of}} the city and {{consists}} of typical five-storey buildings. According to a planned project the district should have been merged with another, the [...] "50th anniversary of the Victory". However this was never followed through. A school, № 1, a kindergarten and a vocational training school can be found here. A pilot heating project was implemented resulting in the construction of an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> house.|$|E
30|$|Even {{though the}} <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{appear to be}} more {{effective}} than thermal inertia at reducing wind curtailment according to Fig.  11, the latter method has a higher potential for reducing coal consumption. The wind curtailment is reduced by 283 MWh and 164 MWh in Cases 2 and 3, respectively, relative to Case 1. Consequently, 0.14 metric tons of coal can be saved when integrating 1 MWh of wind power for considering <b>electric</b> <b>boilers,</b> and introducing the thermal inertia of a heating network can reduce 0.61 t of coal by integrating 1 MWh of wind power. The difference between the two solutions at reducing coal consumption emphasizes the low heating efficiency of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Resistance heating loads such as <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{or space}} heating may be {{connected}} to three-phase systems. Electric lighting may also be similarly connected.|$|R
30|$|When {{introducing}} <b>electric</b> <b>boilers,</b> {{the wind}} power curtailment {{is reduced by}} 282 MWh, and the wind curtailment ratio is 7.5 %. By contrast, the thermal inertia of the heating network decreases the wind curtailment ratio to 11.2 %, and 164 MWh wind curtailment is reduced relative to Case 1. This finding indicates the high effectiveness of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> in reducing wind curtailment relative to thermal inertia, the reason for which is that a proportion of wind power is used for heating in Case 2, consuming curtailed wind power directly.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the buses}} LC 757 (made {{in the year}} 1995) was {{modified}} {{according to the requirements}} Jedlička's Institute in Prague for the transport of handicapped citizens. The vehicle can transport 34 passengers + driver, the 16 passengers + 8 wheelchairs + driver. In front of them are transported passengers, the rear space serves as a [...] "technological": There is a chemical toilet, washbasin, changing tables, kitchen and shower. For the hot water is used <b>electric</b> <b>boiler.</b> To facilitate the onset of the handicapped was installed in a vehicle electric lift.|$|E
5000|$|Freight traffic {{continued}} and in 1976 a second diesel of SBB Tm IV type arrived. When the nostalgia-boom reached Switzerland, ST gave its steam 8522 engine to the Dampfbahn Bern which gave it an overhaul {{and used it}} for some time. Having kept the old passenger coaches, ST began to offer steam train runs. Remarkable thing is that 8522 {{is one of the}} two locomotives that were [...] "partly electrified" [...] during World War 2. An <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> heating should replace rare coal. But when the war was over and supply restarted, pantograph and electric heater were removed.|$|E
5000|$|Electric heating is {{generally}} highly efficient; {{since there is}} no stream of waste combustion gases emitting from the boiler, nearly all the purchased energy appears in the product hot water or steam in useful form. This high efficiency even in small sizes partly offsets the generally higher cost of electric energy compared to fossil fuels. An <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> can be placed in operation quickly, as there is no furnace to reach high temperatures. [...] Environmental impact is displaced to the source of the grid electricity; however, if fossil fuel is being consumed to make electricity, overall efficiency will be lower than direct use of the fuel.|$|E
30|$|To {{reduce the}} coal {{consumption}} and CO 2 emissions and integrate additional wind power into the electricity grid in Northeast China, {{this paper presented}} an optimization model for the joint dispatch of heat and power by considering the energy storage of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and the thermal inertia of district heating systems. Based on actual grid data for Northeast China, the proposed method is applied to four cases with/without considering this energy storage capability. The {{results show that the}} <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and the thermal inertia of the heating network hold great potential for reducing both coal consumption and wind curtailment.|$|R
30|$|The {{model is}} {{subjected}} to physical and operating constraints that include the electricity demand, feasible operation ability of CHP units, wind power generation capacity, the characteristics of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> with a heat storage tank and comprehensive district heating systems.|$|R
30|$|DHW is {{supplied}} by single apartment boilers: <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> in Apartments 1 a, 2 a, 2 b, 3 a, 3 b; a gas boiler in Apartment 1 b. No {{summer air conditioning}} is present. All rooms, including bathrooms, have windows.|$|R
5000|$|Total cost of Turpin High is {{approximately}} 6.5 million dollars. Outstanding {{features of the}} building include a spacious media center with a capacity of 15,000 volumes and seating for 200, large laboratories, shops, and classrooms. The building is kept comfortable year-round {{by a combination of}} forced air and radiation. The heat source is water heated in an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler.</b> Zone air-conditioning is utilized throughout most of the structure. Most areas are carpeted. The gymnasium/ pool complex also includes a small indoor running track on the balcony. Seating capacities are 1,500 for basketball contests and 275 for swimming events. Outdoor facilities include tennis courts, practice fields, a baseball diamond, and parking lots.|$|E
50|$|In construction, {{provision}} {{was made on}} site for a fourth generating unit (to {{the north of the}} existing units), including a fourth stack inside the chimney, but the fourth generating unit was cancelled before construction commenced. One design feature of the power station is the lack of steam driven boiler feed pumps, with units 1 and 2 being provided with three 50% <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> feed pumps and unit 3 with two 50% electric feed pumps. The main turbo-generator was manufactured by Parsons, and many of the major components were interchangeable with the turbo-generators at Hunterston B around 13 mi south, on the Firth of Clyde, also then owned by the South of Scotland Electricity Board.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electric}} {{steam boiler}} {{is intended to}} produce steam for process industry or other uses, such as drying, heat treating, and others. These are generally permanently installed systems with connections to a water supply and piping to transport product steam {{to the point of}} use. In places where electric power is relatively low cost compared to fossil fuels, it may be economically practical to use an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> for steam central heating. For example, in Winnipeg, Canada, during the Second World War, large central electric steam boilers were used for a district heating system, using surplus hydroelectric power. The intent was to conserve coal fuel for more critical wartime needs. [...] Electric boilers may rely on immersion heater resistance heating elements to heat water, or may use electric current passing directly through the water as an electrode boiler.|$|E
2500|$|Some loads such as {{desalination}} plants, <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> {{and industrial}} refrigeration units, {{are able to}} store their output (water and heat.) These [...] "opportunistic loads" [...] are {{able to take advantage}} of [...] "burst electricity" [...] when it is available.|$|R
30|$|These results {{demonstrate}} that in Case 3, the thermal inertia of the heating network is intensively applied, which reduces the total heat supply by almost 12 %. The heat production of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> in Case 4 is 523 GJ, {{less than that}} in Case 2. However, Case 4 achieves the lowest wind curtailment, because the combination of <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and thermal inertia in Case 4 increases the flexibility of CHP units, {{making it possible to}} integrate additional wind power into the grid. Furthermore, although the coal consumption for heating in Case 4 is higher than that of Case 3, the decrease in coal consumption from the electricity load reduction results in Case 4 featuring the smallest total coal consumption.|$|R
30|$|To {{promote the}} {{integration}} of wind power in Northeast China, this paper presents an optimization method for heat and electricity joint dispatching in which the <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> and the thermal inertia of the heating network and buildings are considered. Here, the <b>electric</b> <b>boilers</b> are used as wind power consumers and additional heat sources, while the thermal inertia of the pipelines and the buildings is analyzed using a detailed model to reflect the thermal inertia of the building structure, indoor air, and pipelines {{as well as the}} delay of water flow. In addition, the thermal comfort of end users in different time sections of the day is also considered {{to take advantage of the}} fluctuation of wind power and enhance the flexibility of CHP units.|$|R
50|$|Construction of a 98-mile {{branch line}} from Lometa through San Saba and Brady to Eden was {{commenced}} in 1910 and {{completed by the}} end of the following year. By 1912, AT&SF announced plans to build a new union depot in Galveston that would also house the offices of GC&SF. Their plans were for an eight-story fireproof building made of steel-reinforced concrete and faced with white enameled brick. The waiting room would be 104 feet by 63 feet, and the building would be large enough to contain all of the departments of the GC&SF. An addition to the building was made in 1932, which included another eight-story building and an eleven-story tower. The company planned to spend $35,000 on remodeling the old building so that it would match the new structure. GC&SF also boasted of a new <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> plant, which would heat the entire building.|$|E
50|$|Electric boilers are {{sometimes}} {{looked down upon}} by some experts for multiple factors. These factors stem {{from the fact that}} the electricity that is used to power electric steam boilers has to be generated somewhere. As well as the use of electricity it is not free especially considering that most electric boilers require a good deal of electricity to run at efficient and full capacity, which add on top of the problems of using it to boil water. Generating the power required to run an <b>electric</b> <b>boiler</b> can create just as many if not more pollution/emissions than burning fuel in the traditional boiler. Electricity is expensive, and with expected rises in the price of electricity the use of it in electric boilers will come with a large price. Also one other possibility is in the event of a power outage, or a brownout, the boiler would become unusable, whereas gas boilers do not necessarily need an external power source to run.|$|E
5000|$|The {{heat pump}} uses the natural {{refrigerant}} ammonia {{that has a}} zero global warming potential {{and is not a}} greenhouse gas. The heat source is seawater that is taken in around 8 or 9 °C from a depth of 18 m and is cooled by low pressure liquid refrigerant. Using a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, the system heats district water from 65 °C to 90 °C for use in building heating and hot water systems. The system has an average coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.0 which means 1 unit of electricity is combined with 2 units of heat from the seawater to provide 3 units of heat to the district heating circuit. With the low cost of hydro-based electricity, it is cheaper to run a heat pump than a gas or <b>electric</b> <b>boiler.</b> In addition, the compressor technology used in the Drammen heat pump is the single screw compressor from Vilter (Emerson). Its internal design allows for balanced forces allowing it to perform with a very long bearing life at more than 120,000 hours for normal refrigeration compressors.|$|E
