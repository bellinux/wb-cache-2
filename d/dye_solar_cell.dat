40|$|The {{main issue}} in using low cost metals in <b>dye</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> is the {{corrosion}} {{caused by the}} liquid electrolyte. Contrary to typical applications of metals, the adverse effects of corrosion in <b>dye</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are related to irreversible depletion of charge carriers from the electrolyte rather than consumption of the metal itself. It is calculated that the penetration rate due to corrosion should not exceed 10 − 4 [*]mpy (a couple of nanometers per year) to ensure device lifetime longer than 1 [*]year. This is 10 [*] 000 times slower rate than what {{is considered to be}} a general benchmark value for very low corrosion rate in the field of corrosion science and has a major effect on how corrosion should be investigated in the case of <b>dye</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells.</b> Different methods, their applicability, and limitations to investigate corrosion in <b>dye</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are evaluated here. The issue with most techniques is that they can detect metals that are clearly corroding, but they have significant limitations in proving a metal stable. Our investigation shows that the most reliable information on corrosion is obtained from complete <b>dye</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> that are exposed to working conditions. A combination of color analysis of the electrolyte to such measurement is proposed as a means to extrapolate future performance of the cells and estimate potential lifetimes of the <b>dye</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> in regards to corrosion.

Such white light reflectors are comprised of stacks of different porous optical multilayers, each one displaying a strong reflection in a complementary spectral range, and are designed to leave transmittance unaltered in a narrow red-frequency range in which the sensitized electrode shows negligible absorption, thus allowing us to see through the cell.

The technologies accepted as conventional are those well along in the process of commercialization. The dye-sensitized solar cell, developed in the 1990 s, is a nonconventional solar electric technology that has attracted much attention, perhaps a result of its record cell efficiency above 10 %.

40|$|A new {{interdigital}} {{design for}} large area dye solar modules is developed for {{an area of}} 30 x 30 cm(2). This design requires fewer holes in the glass substrate for electrolyte filling, than the conventional strip design. A complete manufacturing process of this module-ranging from screen printed layers to semi-automated colouring and electrolyte filling-in a laboratory-scale baseline is illustrated. As primary sealing method, a durable glass frit sealing is used. It is shown, that the lead (Pb) content present in many glass frit powders contaminates the catalytic platinum electrode during the sintering process, resulting in a lowering of the fill factor. A screen printable lead-free glass frit paste is developed, which solves this problem. Long term stability tests are presented on 2. 5 cm(2) dye solar cells, which have been completely sealed with glass fit.
