5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for <b>echinococcosis.</b> Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E

For a time, he worked for Martin at the Lister Institute in London where he qualified for membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London. He also received a Diploma of Public Health from the University of Cambridge. He returned to Australia on the transport Orontes in February 1920, to become a research assistant to Sydney Patterson, director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, where Fairley worked on developing a test for <b>echinococcosis</b> along the lines of the test that he had already developed for bilharzia.|$|E

2500|$|Contact with {{farm animals}} {{can lead to}} disease in farmers or others that {{come into contact with}} {{infected}} animals. [...] Glanders primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries and wool mills. Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to clamydiosis, or enzootic abortion, in pregnant women, as well as an increased risk of Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis in pregnant or the otherwise immunocompromised. <b>Echinococcosis</b> is caused by a tapeworm which can be spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated with feces or wool. Bird flu is common in chickens. While rare in humans, the main public health worry is that a strain of bird flu will recombine with a human flu virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. In 2017, free range chickens in the UK were temporarily ordered to remain inside due to the threat of bird flu. Cattle are an important reservoir of cryptosporidiosis and mainly affects the immunocompromised.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} form found in humans is cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> (also known as unilocular <b>echinococcosis),</b> which is caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. The second {{most common form}} is {{alveolar}} <b>echinococcosis</b> (also known as alveolar colloid of the liver, alveolar hydatid disease, alveolococcosis, multilocular <b>echinococcosis,</b> [...] "small fox tapeworm"), which is caused by Echinococcus multilocularis {{and the third is}} polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> (also known as human polycystic hydatid disease, neotropical <b>echinococcosis),</b> which is caused by Echinococcus vogeli and very rarely, Echinococcus oligarthrus. Alveolar and polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> are rarely diagnosed in humans and are not as widespread as cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> but polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> is relatively new on the medical scene and is often left out of conversations dealing with <b>echinococcosis,</b> and alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> is a serious disease that has not only a significantly high fatality rate, but the potential to become an emerging disease in many countries.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, {{this causes}} a disease called <b>echinococcosis.</b> The three types of <b>echinococcosis</b> are cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> caused by E. granulosus, {{alveolar}} <b>echinococcosis</b> caused by E. multilocularis, and polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> caused by E. vogeli or E. oligarthrus. A worm's incubation period is usually long and can be up to 50 years. Cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> is mostly found in South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Italy, Spain, Greece, Russia, and the western United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and California).|$|E
50|$|As with cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> {{ultrasonography}} is {{the imaging}} technique {{of choice for}} alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> and is usually complemented by CT scans since CT scans are able to detect {{the largest number of}} lesions and calcifications that are characteristic of alveolar <b>echinococcosis.</b> MRIs are also used in combination with ultrasonography though CT scans are preferred. Like cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> imaging is the major method used for the diagnosis of alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> while the same types of serologic tests (except now specific for E. multilocularis antigens) are used to verify the imaging results. It is also important to note that serologic tests are more valuable for the diagnosis of alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> than for cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> since they tend to be more reliable for alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> since more antigens specific for E. multilocularis are available. In addition to imaging and serology, identification of E. multilocularis infection via PCR or a histological examination of a tissue biopsy from the patient is another way to diagnose alveolar <b>echinococcosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alveolar hydatid disease (AHD), {{also known}} as {{alveolar}} <b>echinococcosis,</b> alveolar colloid of the liver, alveolococcosis, multilocular <b>echinococcosis,</b> and small fox tapeworm {{is a form of}} <b>echinococcosis,</b> and is a disease that originates from a parasite. Although alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> is rarely diagnosed in humans and is not as widespread as cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> it is also still a serious disease that not only has a significantly high fatality rate but also has the potential to become an emerging disease in many countries.|$|E
50|$|Since polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> is {{constrained}} to such {{a particular}} {{area of the world}} and is not well described or found in many people, treatment of polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> is less defined than that of cystic and alveolar <b>echinococcosis.</b> While surgical removal of cysts was the treatment of choice for the previous two types of <b>echinococcosis,</b> chemotherapy is the recommended treatment approach for polycystic <b>echinococcosis.</b> While albendazole is the preferred drug, mebendazole can also be used if the treatment is to be {{for an extended period of}} time. Only if chemotherapy fails or if the lesions are very small is surgery advised.|$|E
50|$|<b>Echinococcosis</b> is a {{parasitic}} disease of tapeworms of the Echinococcus type. The two main types {{of the disease}} are cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> and alveolar <b>echinococcosis.</b> Less common forms include polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> and unicystic <b>echinococcosis.</b> The disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years. The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst's location and size. Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread {{to other parts of}} the body, such as the lungs or brain. When the liver is affected the person may have abdominal pain, weight loss, and turn slightly yellow from jaundice. Lung disease may cause pain in the chest, shortness of breath and coughing.|$|E
50|$|While {{a number}} of control and {{prevention}} strategies deal with cystic and alveolar <b>echinococcosis,</b> there are few methods to control and prevent polycystic <b>echinococcosis.</b> This is {{probably due to the}} fact that polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> is restricted to Central and South America, and that the way that humans become accidental hosts of E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli is still not completely understood.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{there are}} no human {{vaccines}} against any form of <b>echinococcosis.</b> However, there are studies being conducted that are looking at possible vaccine candidates for an effective human vaccine against <b>echinococcosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the human}} {{manifestation of the}} disease, E. granulosus, E. multilocularis, E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli are {{localized}} in the liver (in 75% of cases), the lungs (in 5-15% of cases) and other organs in the body such as the spleen, brain, heart, and kidneys (in 10-20% of cases). In the patients who are infected with E. granulosus and therefore have cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> the disease develops as a slow-growing mass in the body. These slow-growing masses, often called cysts, are also found in patients that are infected with alveolar and polycystic <b>echinococcosis.</b> The cysts found in those with cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> are usually filled with a clear fluid called hydatid fluid, are spherical, and typically consist of one compartment and are usually only found in one area of the body. While the cysts found in those with alveolar and polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> {{are similar to those}} found in those with cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> the alveolar and polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> cysts usually have multiple compartments and have infiltrative as opposed to expansive growth.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{strategies}} are geared towards prevention {{and control of}} alveolar echinococcosis—most of which {{are similar to those}} for cystic <b>echinococcosis.</b> For instance, health education programs, improved water sanitation, improved hygiene and de-worming of hosts (particularly red foxes) are all effective to prevent and control the spread of alveolar <b>echinococcosis.</b> Unlike cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> however, where there is a vaccine against E. granulosus, there is currently no canidae or livestock vaccine against E. multilocularis.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two species of Echinococcus, E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus are limited to Central and South America. Furthermore, infections by E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus (polycystic <b>echinococcosis)</b> {{are considered to be}} the rarest form of <b>echinococcosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Surgery {{and drugs}} can both {{be used to}} treat <b>echinococcosis.</b> It can be {{prevented}} by deworming dogs, sanitation, proper disposal of animal feces, health education, and livestock vaccination. [...] Cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> {{is found in the}} eastern portion of the Mediterranean region, northern Africa, southern and eastern Europe, the southern portion of South America, and central Asia. Alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> is found in western and northern China, Russia, Europe, and northern North America. [...] It can be diagnosed through imaging techniques and serological tests.|$|E

50|$|A formal {{diagnose}} of {{any type}} of <b>echinococcosis</b> requires a combination of tools that involve imaging techniques, histopathology, or nucleic acid detection and serology. For cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> diagnosis, imaging is the main method—while serology tests (such as indirect hemogglutination, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), immunoblots or latex agglutination) that use antigens specific for E. granulosus verify the imaging results. The imaging technique of choice for cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> is ultrasonography, since {{it is not only}} able to visualize the cysts in the body's organs, but it is also inexpensive, non-invasive and gives instant results. In addition to ultrasonography, both MRI and CT scans can and are often used although an MRI is often preferred to CT scans when diagnosing cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> since it gives better visualization of liquid areas within the tissue.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} {{strategies that are}} currently being used to prevent and control cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> (CE). Most of these various methods try to prevent and control CE by targeting the major risk factors for the disease {{and the way it}} is transmitted. For instance, health education programs focused on cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> and its agents, and improved water sanitation attempt to target poor education and poor drinking water sources, which are both risk factors for contracting <b>echinococcosis.</b> Furthermore, since humans often come into contact with Echinococcus eggs via touching contaminated soil, animal feces and animal hair, another prevention strategy is improved hygiene. In addition to targeting risk factors and transmission, control and prevention strategies of cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> also aim at intervening at certain points of the parasite’s life cycle, in particular, the infection of hosts (i.e. especially dogs) that reside with or near humans. For example, many countries endemic to <b>echinococcosis</b> have implemented programs geared at de-worming dogs and vaccinating dogs and other livestock, such as sheep, that also act as hosts for E. granulosus.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the {{diagnosis}} of alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> and cystic <b>echinococcosis,</b> {{the diagnosis}} of polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> uses imaging techniques, in particular ultrasonography and CT scans, to detect polycystic structures within the patient’s body. However, imaging is not the preferred method of diagnosis since the method that is currently considered the standard is the isolation of protoscoleces during surgery or after the patient’s death and the identification of definitive features of E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli in these isolated protoscoleces. This is the main way that PE is diagnosed, but some current studies show that PCR may identify E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli in patients’ tissues. The only drawback of using PCR to diagnose polycystic <b>echinococcosis</b> is that there aren’t many genetic sequences {{that can be used}} for PCR that are specific only E. oligarthrus or E. vogeli.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rates of}} <b>echinococcosis</b> {{is higher in}} rural areas, {{and there are more}} than one million people {{infected}} currently. [...] Untreated alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> is fatal. [...] It is caused by ingesting parasites in animal feces. There are two versions of the disease: cystic and alveolar. Both versions involve an asymptomatic incubation period of several years. In the cystic version, liver cysts cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting while cysts in the lungs cause chronic cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. In alveolar <b>echinococcosis,</b> a primary cyst develops, usually in the liver, in addition to weight loss, abdominal pain, general feeling of ill health, and signs of liver failure.|$|E
5000|$|Hydatic disease (aka <b>echinococcosis)</b> of the liver, lung, and {{peritoneum}} (caused by the {{larval form}} of the dog tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus) or of the alveoli (caused by E. multilocularis) when surgical excision is not possible. Some suggest that alveolar and cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> require lifelong treatment with albendazole, which only prevents the parasites from growing and reproducing rather than killing them outright.|$|E
50|$|<b>Echinococcosis</b> is {{a disease}} that has been {{recognized}} by humans for centuries. There has been mention {{of it in the}} Talmud. It was also recognized by ancient scholars such as Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Galen and Rhazes. Although <b>echinococcosis</b> has been well known for the past two thousand years, it wasn’t until the past couple of hundred years that real progress was made in determining and describing its parasitic origin. The first step towards figuring out the cause of <b>echinococcosis</b> occurred during the 17th century when Francesco Redi illustrated that the hydatid cysts of <b>echinococcosis</b> were of “animal” origin. Then, in 1766, Pierre Simon Pallas predicted that these hydatid cysts found in infected humans were actually larval stages of tapeworms. A few decades afterwards, in 1782, Goeze accurately described the cysts and the tapeworm heads while in 1786, E. granulosus was accurately described by Batsch. Half a century later, during the 1850s, Karl von Siebold showed through a series of experiments that Echinococcus cysts do cause adult tapeworms in dogs. Shortly after this, in 1863, E. multilocularis was identified by Rudolf Leuckart. Then, during the early to mid 1900s, the more distinct features of E. granulosus and E. multilocularis, their life cycles and how they cause disease were more fully described as more and more people began researching and performing experiments and studies. While E. granulosus and E. multilocularis were both linked to human <b>echinococcosis</b> before or shortly after the 20th century, it wasn’t until the mid 1900s that E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli were identified as and shown as being causes of human <b>echinococcosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{alveolar}} <b>echinococcosis,</b> surgical {{removal of}} cysts combined with chemotherapy (using albendazole and/or mebendazole) {{for up to}} two years after surgery is the only sure way to completely cure the disease. However, in inoperable cases, chemotherapy by itself can also be used. In treatment using just chemotherapy, one could use either mebendazole in three doses or albendazole in two doses. Since chemotherapy on its own is not guaranteed to completely rid the patient of disease, patients are often kept on the drugs for extended periods of times (i.e. more than 6 months, years). In addition to surgery and chemotherapy, liver transplants are being looked into as a form of treatment for alveolar <b>echinococcosis</b> although it is seen as incredibly risky since it often leads to <b>echinococcosis</b> re-infection in the patient afterwards.|$|E
