5|$|It is <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> desert hare (Lepus tibetanus), by {{its lack}} of black near the tip the {{peripheries}} of the ears. It is also <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lepus oiostolus pallipes, by {{its lack of}} grey at the rump. It is also smaller in size and has thinner legs, than both the desert hare and the Lepus oiostolus pallipes.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oligantha is {{most easily}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit. Its foliage {{is also not}} as prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{a member}} of Hygrophoropsis, Aphroditeola olida is also similar in {{appearance}} to H.aurantiaca but can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> false chanterelle by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. Chrysomphalina chrysophylla has a yellowish brown cap and unforked yellow gills. Cortinarius hesleri, an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has a rusty brown spore print and a cortina in young specimens. The poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms (genus Omphalotus) comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species Haasiella splendidissima, sometimes confused with H.aurantiaca, is most readily <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> latter by its pink spore print and gills that do not fork.|$|E

5|$|The nelicourvi weaver can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> related sakalava weaver, {{which has}} {{streaked}} plumage. The somewhat related forest fody and Madagascar fody mostly have streaked upperparts and scarlet {{as the most}} obvious colour.|$|E
5|$|The rasping {{advertising}} call {{is readily}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hwitt-hwitt-hwitt of spotted crake, the monotonous clockwork tak-tak-tak-tak-tak of striped crake, or the quick-quick of Baillon's crake. The corn crake is silent in Africa.|$|E
5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea {{compared}} with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its {{brighter}} flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; {{and in its}} sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of B.oligantha are smaller still, and its foliage is not as prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus helenae is <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{more common}} C.striatus by its faint inner-surface {{plication}} (C.striatus {{has a more}} pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing S.grandis {{from the}} other four New World species of Sphecius (S.convallis, S.hogardii, S. speciosus, S.spectabilis) is difficult. The female S.convallis was {{originally}} <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> female S. grandis by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral tergites on S.convallis and yellow marks on all tergites for S.grandis. However, this {{was found to be}} insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps of the same species.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily <b>distinguished</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.|$|E
