5|$|Fig.8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An <b>interferogram</b> is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the <b>interferogram</b> into an actual spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the <b>interferogram</b> will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an <b>interferogram</b> is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static <b>interferogram</b> analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E

40|$|<b>Interferograms</b> {{obtained}} from Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) {{can be used}} to find high resolution optical spectra. Accompanying high resolution spectra is the corresponding large data volumes. <b>Interferograms</b> generally often contain informational redundancies that can be exploited in lossless coding. Inspecting <b>interferograms</b> shows regions that show short term periodicity. The sort term periodicity is derived by taking the Fourier transform of the points leading up to the desired prediction point. Prediction residuals are then losslessly coded with the Rice entropy coder. This paper describes efforts directed at defining a predictor that will result in efficient lossless coding of <b>interferograms.</b> Compared with <b>interferograms</b> compressed with the Rice coding algorithm, the proposed predictor shows an average improved compression of 7 % across sixteen different <b>interferograms...</b>|$|R
30|$|About 2.6 km to {{the east}} of this uplifted pattern, all co-seismic <b>interferograms</b> also reveal a small area of {{displacements}} away from the radar, stretching 3 km in the NE-SW direction. Although the affected area here is small, the amplitude of the deformation signal is almost the same as for the uplifted area, reaching up to — 8 mm. This deformation is observed with almost the same magnitude in three independent <b>interferograms</b> but is not visible in any pre-seismic <b>interferograms.</b> In order to reduce atmospheric noise, residual orbit error and, in addition, to ensure that the derived signal is actually related to surface deformation, we performed a stack of <b>interferograms.</b> The stacking of independent <b>interferograms</b> improves the ratio of the displacement signal to the atmospheric phase error by a factor of √N, where N is the number of <b>interferograms</b> (Strozzi et al., 2000). We stacked the co-seismic and pre-seismic <b>interferograms</b> separately, having excluded those scenes which have obvious atmospheric effects. The stacking produced cleaner <b>interferograms</b> with reduced noise levels, but preserved the NE-SW trending small negative signal. The stack of the pre-seismic <b>interferograms</b> did not display any distinct features at the event location, but, as previously noted, it revealed very clear concentric fringes at the small lake Halzan Dovny and the Jirem well, and in the marshes and lakes of the Harmagtain Gobi valley.|$|R

25|$|An air-wedge {{shearing}} interferometer {{is described}} in and was employed in set of experiments described in. This interferometer consists of two optical glass wedges (~2-5deg), pushed together and then slightly separated {{from one side to}} create a thin air-gap wedge. This air-gap wedge has a unique property- it is very thin (micrometer scale) and it has perfect flatness (~λ/10). There are four nearly equal intensity Fresnel reflections (~4% for refraction coefficient 1.5) from the air-wedge interferometer (Fig.1): 1-2 from the first glass wedge, and 3-4 from the second one. The angle between beams 1-2 and 3-4 is non adjustable and depends only on the glass wedge. The angle between beams 2-3 is easily adjusted by varying the air-wedge angle. The distance between the air-wedge and an image plane should be long enough to spatially separate reflections 1 from 2 and 3 from 4. The overlap of beams 2 and 3 in the image plane creates an <b>interferogram.</b>|$|E

40|$|Tropospheric inhomogeneities {{can form}} a major error source in {{differential}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} interferometry measurements, which are used in slow-deformation monitoring. Indeed, variations of atmospheric conditions between two radar acquisitions produce variations in the signal path of two images and, thus, additional fringes on differential <b>interferograms.</b> These effects have a strong influence on <b>interferograms</b> and must be compensated to obtain reliable deformation measurements. This paper presents a methodological approach to reduce at both global and local scales tropospheric contributions directly from differential <b>interferograms.</b> It first requires refined knowledge of the stable scatterers {{that can only be}} obtained from the analysis of a large population of multitemporal <b>interferograms.</b> The correction of global-scale atmospheric contribution exploits the correlation between phase and topography.
