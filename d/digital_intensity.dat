40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether <b>digital</b> spatial <b>intensity</b> patterns {{can be developed}} to effect precise in vitro correction of myopic, hyperopic, and astigmatic refractive errors in a silicone light-adjustable lens (LAL). Also, to {{determine whether}} a new spatial intensity pattern for “lock-in ” is effective in vitro. Methods: A digital interferometer/irradiation system was developed to irradiate LALs and measure the power change following irradiation. Light-adjustable lenses were mounted into a wet cell maintained at 35. 0 ± 0. 5 °C (simulated ocular temperature) and allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 2 hours. Ultraviolet light was then applied with spatial light intensity patterns to correct hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism. Light-adjustable lenses were also treated to effect lock-in with a separate spatial light intensity pattern. Treated lenses were characterized for power change and optical quality. In the case of lock-in, exhaustive chemical extraction was also performed to determine the percentage of remaining macromer. Results: Appropriate <b>digital</b> irradiation spatial <b>intensity</b> patterns were created to develop nomograms for in vitro correction of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism in approximate 0. 25 D steps. Power changes were reproducible and did not alter optical quality of the LALs. Further, lock-in dosing of the LALs did not alter optical quality or significantly change LAL power. Conclusions: In vitro nomograms have been developed for a silicone LAL that permit precise correction of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Furthermore, a spatial light intensity pattern has been devised that effects lock-in without significantly altering LAL power or optical quality. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc 2004; 102 : 67 - 7...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{immunostaining}} quantification {{obtained by}} a digital computer-assisted method with the well-established semiquantitative analysis. METHODS: Cytoplasmic staining of galectin- 3 {{was obtained by}} standard immunohistochemical reactions in 25 cases of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The expression index that associates the conventional area fraction of labeled cells with the immunostaining intensity score based on visual qualitative observation {{was used as the}} semiquantitative analysis. A digital computer-assisted method is described based on the use of an image processing program (ImageLab®). Three parameters were obtained: (1) percentage of labeled cells; (2) <b>digital</b> immunostaining <b>intensity,</b> and (3) <b>digital</b> expression index. The proposed method allows numerical analysis of the immunostaining intensity. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the immunostaining intensity obtained by the two methods (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0. 71, P = 0. 0001). The same was observed between expression indexes (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0. 66, P = 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Results obtained with our proposed digital computer-assisted method for immunoexpression analysis were concordant with the semiquantitative analysis. In addition, digital values can also resolve disagreement among different observers about the quality of staining <b>intensity</b> because the <b>digital</b> method does not classify the results into groups, but rather provides a numerical value for each individual case; thus, it increases the diagnostic and, more importantly, the prognostic sensitivity of the immunohistochemical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{inpainting}} is {{the reconstruction}} of a missing or damaged region in a <b>digital</b> image. <b>Intensity</b> values in the missing region are approximated using information near the boundary of the region. Some applications include repair of chipped paintings, repair of rips in paper photographs, and removal of unwanted objects from photographs. In this thesis, we review 2 D digital inpainting techniques, examine the application of 3 D digital inpainting to cell path reconstruction, and propose a new inpainting technique inspired by the cell path reconstruction problem. Cell path reconstruction is the estimation of the shape and position of living cells in videos recorded using fluorescence microscopy. This procedure is necessary because in a particular phase {{of the life cycle}} of some cells, fluorescent light passes through the cells with an undetectable change in wavelength and they vanish from the frame. This leads to misleading results when, for example, the number of cells in a particular frame is counted. We transform the position/shape estimation problem into a 3 D shape reconstruction problem by stacking the frames of the video to form a 3 D volume. In this volume, cell paths form tubes with missing segments where cells have vanished. We apply elastica inpainting to the 3 D tube reconstruction problem and introduce a new 3 D inpainting model to overcome difficulties with a direct generalization to 3 D of 2 D elastica...|$|R

This paper defines the process of image resampling in more detail in terms of general imager system models, the requirements of digital image geometric manipulation and constraints of available digital processing systems. The problem is then formulated as a constrained linear estimation problem with suitable image models and optimization criteria. The resulting reconstruction filters are compared to more heuristic approaches, such as nearest neighbor, bilinear interpolation, Lagrange interpolation, and cubic convolution (cubic and quartic spline interpolators). Finally, the various resampling techniques are compared against theoretical image models, synthetically generated imagery, and actual ERTS MSS data. Nearest neighbor, bilinear, and Lagrange interpolation resamplers are shown to give significantly poorer reconstruction accuracy than TRW Cubic Convolution and the optimal constrained linear estimator...|$|R
40|$|The real {{contribution}} of the business value of Information Technology (IT) is still much discussed {{and the results of}} several studies are divergent. Some authors argue the reason for the differences may lie in the excessive aggregation of the IT construct (BRYNJOLFSSON; HITT, 2003) and organizational performance construct (RAY; BARNEY; MUHANNA, 2004). This research employed a model which seeks to assess the business value of IT through the relationship between the internal resources of IT performance and business processes in the value chain (MOONEY; GURBAXANI; KRAEMER, 1996). After pre-test to check the language of the questionnaire, data were colected from 96 service firms of Belo Horizonte/Brazil through a cross-sectional survey.

40|$|In image processing, edge {{detection}} {{is a valuable}} tool to perform the extraction of features from an image. This detection reduces {{the amount of information}} to be processed, since the redundant information (considered less relevant) can be disconsidered. The technique of {{edge detection}} consists of determining the points of a <b>digital</b> image whose <b>intensity</b> changes sharply. This changes are, for example, due to the discontinuities of the orientation on a surface. A well known method of edge detection is the Difference of Gaussians (DoG). The method consists of subtracting two Gaussians, where a kernel has a standard deviation smaller than the previous one. The convolution between the subtraction of kernels and the input image results in the edge detection of this image. This paper introduces a method of extracting edges using DoG with kernels based on the q-Gaussian probability distribution, derived from the q-statistic proposed by Constantino Tsallis. To demonstrate the method's potential, we compare the introduced method with the tradicional DoG using Gaussians kernels.

40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} {{internet}} use in high-income economies {{has raised the}} spectre of a “digital divide” that will marginalize developing countries because they can neither afford internet access nor use it effectively when it is available. Using a new cross-country data set, this paper investigates two proximate determinants of the <b>digital</b> divide: internet <b>intensity</b> (internet subscriptions per telephone mainline); and access to telecom services. Surprisingly, no gap in internet intensity was found. When differences in urbanization and competition policy are controlled for, low-income countries have intensities as high as those of industrial countries. While income {{does not seem to}} matter in this context, competition policy matters a great deal. Low-income countries with high World Bank ratings for competition policy have significantly higher internet intensities. The paper's finding on internet intensity implies that the digital divide is not really new, but reflects a persistent gap in the availability of mainline telephone services. After identifying mobile telephones as a promising new platform for internet access, the paper uses panel data to study the determinants of mobile telephone diffusion during the past decade. The results show that income explains part of the diffusion lag for the poor countries, but they also highlight the critical role of policy. Developing countries whose policies promote economic growth and private sector competition have experienced much more rapid diffusion of mobile phone service. Simulations based on the econometric results suggest that feasible reforms could sharply narrow the digital divide during the next decade for many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. ...|$|R

Descriptive statistics (e. g., average, variability, and range) of various characteristics are presented, including intensity, intensification rate, major hurricane duration, location, storm motion, size, and landfall observations. IR images are shown along with IR-derived quantities such as the <b>digital</b> Dvorak technique <b>intensity</b> and IR-defined cold cloud areas.
