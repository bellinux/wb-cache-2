50|$|De Langen's main {{contribution}} is {{the discovery of}} the correlation between diet poor in cholesterol and lipids (and meat) in general and (very low) incidence of gallstones, cardiovascular disease and other Western diseases in Javanese population {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. He reported on his findings at the conference of the International Society of <b>Geographic</b> <b>Pathology</b> in 1935. His observation was made on patients admitted to the municipal hospital in Jakarta. Consequently, he studied this phenomenon in defined populations outside hospital. He hypothesized that the traditional Javanese diet, very poor in cholesterol and other lipids, was associated with low level of blood cholesterol as well as incidence of the cardiovascular disease, while the prevalence of CVD in Europeans in Java, living on the Western diet, was significantly higher. De Langen's colleague Isidor Snapper made similar observation in North China in 1940. Since de Langen published his results only in Dutch, his work remained unknown to most of the international scientific community.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{connection}} between arteriosclerosis and dietary cholesterol {{was made by}} the Russian pathologist Nikolay Anichkov, prior to World War I.Another significant contribution to the debate {{was made by the}} Dutch physician (internist) Cornelis de Langen, who noticed the correlation between nutritional cholesterol intake and incidence of gallstones (and soon after, arteriosclerosis and other [...] "Western diseases") in the Javanese population in 1916.

40|$|Extranodal natural killer (NK) /T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, has {{a unique}} <b>geographic</b> distribution. Its <b>pathology</b> is {{characterized}} by marked angio-invasion and tissue necrosis. A typical NK-cell phenotype is usually present: CD 2 +, CD 3 epsilon+, CD 56 +, cytotoxic molecules+ and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) +. Magnetic Resonance Imaging helps to clearly define the local involvement. Positron Emission Tomography helps to demonstrate system spread. Various prognostic variables (International Prognostic Index or the Korean Prognostic Index) should be documented. This may include quantification of plasma EBV DNA. For localized nasal disease, radiotherapy is important, although chemotherapy is often added. Sustainable remission is observed in over half of these patients. For extra-nasal or disseminated disease, systemic chemotherapy becomes the mainstay and the prognosis is usually poor. Doxorubicin-containing regimens are not entirely satisfactory and l-asparaginase containing regimens are being investigated. Patients with poor prognostic features may be considered for an early autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant. Allogenetic transplantation is efficacious but is associated with high transplant-related mortality. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Electronic medical records, {{including}} pathology reports, {{are often}} used for research purposes. Currently, there are few programs freely available to remove identifiers while leaving {{the remainder of the}} pathology report text intact. Our goal was to produce an open source, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant, deidentification tool tailored for pathology reports. We designed a three-step process for removing potential identifiers. The first step is to look for identifiers known {{to be associated with the}} patient, such as name, medical record number, pathology accession number, etc. Next, a series of pattern matches look for predictable patterns likely to represent identifying data; such as dates, accession numbers and addresses as well as patient, institution and physician names. Finally, individual words are compared with a database of proper names and <b>geographic</b> locations. <b>Pathology</b> reports from three institutions were used to design and test the algorithms. The software was improved iteratively on training sets until it exhibited good performance. 1800 new pathology reports were then processed. Each report was reviewed manually before and after deidentification to catalog all identifiers and note those that were not removed. Results 1254 (69. 7 %) of 1800 pathology reports contained identifiers in the body of the report. 3439 (98. 3 %) of 3499 unique identifiers in the test set were removed. Only 19 HIPAA-specified identifiers (mainly consult accession numbers and misspelled names) were missed. Of 41 non-HIPAA identifiers missed, the majority were partial institutional addresses and ages. Outside consultation case reports typically contain numerous identifiers and were the most challenging to deidentify comprehensively. There was variation in performance among reports from the three institutions, highlighting the need for site-specific customization, which is easily accomplished with our tool. Conclusion We have demonstrated that it is possible to create an open-source deidentification program which performs well on free-text pathology reports. </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{possibilities}} of clustering between those electoral wards which display higher than expected incidences {{of cases of}} the lymphomas occurring between 1978 and 1982 are examined. Clusters are defined as being those wards with cases in excess (at a probability of < 10 %) which are geographically adjacent to each other. A separate analysis extends the definition of cluster to include high incidence wards that are adjacent or separated by one other ward. The results indicate that many high incidence lymphoma wards do occur close together and when computer simulations are used to compute expected results, many of the observed results are shown to be highly improbable both in {{the overall number of}} clustering wards and in the largest number of wards comprising a 'cluster'. The <b>geographic</b> <b>pathology</b> of lymphomas requires evidence from reliable data sets which can be analysed {{with a high degree of}} precision. Variation in childhood cancer including leukaemias and lymphomas has been examined at electoral ward level by Craft et al. (1985) in the Northern Health Region of the UK. However, this study is dependent o...|$|E
40|$|Some 99, 000 {{new cases}} of {{cancer of the colon}} are {{expected}} next year, an incidence rate higher than that for both cancer of the lung and cancer of the breast. Evidence from <b>geographic</b> <b>pathology</b> suggests that some environmental factors play a strong role in its etiology. Data obtained in the 1959 survey of one million people by the American Cancer Society and followed since, has failed to show correlation with any of the large number of factors listed. It is suggested that the etiology is one of multiple factors. The synergistic effect of exposure to asbestos and cigarette smoking in the production of bronchogenic carcinoma is demonstrated by data on cohorts of insulation workers. There was also a modest {{increase in the number of}} deaths from gastrointestinal cancer in asbestos workers, but smoking did not seem to act in synergistic fashion at that site, except perhaps in the esophagus. Deaths from cancer occurred almost entirely after a period of 20 years or more from initial exposure. The death rate from cancer tended to increase with duration of exposure, but a distinct rise over the expected was seen in those who had been exposed less than one year to amosite dust. Epidemiological studies can be used for a variety of purposes. Probably the most importan...|$|E
40|$|STUDIES of {{relatively}} isolated populations often {{provide opportunities for}} the examination of disease in a defined environment. Comparing data of different populations {{may lead to the}} identification of significant variables in the aetiology of disease (Kreyberg, 1969; Higginson, 1971). As a contribution to <b>geographic</b> <b>pathology,</b> this study reports the types of lung cancer observed at Chiang Mai University Medical School over a 10 year period. Chiang Mai is the capital of Chiang Mai Province, and in this mountainous region, industrial pollution is all but absent and Western influences are not mnarked. The population is not geographically mobile and the culture and habits are {{different from the rest of}} Thailand. MATERIALS The surgical and autopsy specimens of 31, 181 patients seen during 1961 - 70 were examined histologically at the Chiang Mai Medical School Department of Pathology. In this material 4025 malignant neoplasms were found (13 % varying annually between 10 % and 16 %) including 194 pulmonary tumours. Lung cancer represented 0. 6200 of the total specimens and 4. 8 % of all cancers. Seven cases from the 194 pulmonary tumours (3 - 6 %) were not analysed because the age and sex of the patients were not noted in the case histories. As the standards used initially to classify the lung cancer specimens were no...|$|E
40|$|A {{pathology}} based {{cancer registry}} involving all pathology laboratories in Semarang {{was started in}} 1970. It was possible to measure the "age-standardized minimum incidence rate" (ASR) for two periods : 1970 - 1974 and 1980 - 1981. In the period 1970 - 1974 a total of 1224 cases were recorded, consisting of 388 men and 836 women. The most frequent sites of cancer in men were : the liver (5. 2), skin (4. 3), lung (4. 0), nasopharynx (3. 6) and colon-rectum (2. 5). In women the most frequent sites were : the cervix (19. 8), breast (10. 2), ovary (5. 1), skin (4. 9) and colon-rectum (2. 2). The overall ASR was 37. 8 for men and 61. 9 for women. In the period 1980 - 1981 a total of 883 cancer cases were recorded, consisting of 316 men and 567 women. The most frequent sites in men were the liver (9. 5), lung (7. 6), nasopharynx (6. 1), skin (6. 1) and colon-rectum (3. 2). In women the most frequent sites were the cervix (27. 9), breast (13. 0), skin (6. 7), ovary (3. 9) and colon-rectum (3. 9). The overall ASR was 51. 4 for men and 79. 4 for women. It {{is interesting to note}} the rise in ASR in both men and women and the rise in lung cancer in men. In comparison with Singapore, Semarang has lower ASR for all cancers except skin and cervical cancer. Cancer registration should be developed in other areas of Indonesia. The pattern and <b>geographic</b> <b>pathology</b> of cancer is very important for the formulation of strategies and priorities in cancer control. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim. Helicobacter pylori is etiologically {{associated}} with gastritis and gastric cancer. There are significant geographical {{differences between the}} clinical manifestation of H. pylori infections. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare gastric mucosal histology in relation to age among H. pylori-infected patients from different geographical areas using the same grading system. The prevalence of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were also compared with the respective gastric cancer incidence in the different countries. Methods. A total of 1906 patients infected with H. pylori from seven countries were evaluated. Entry criteria included H. pylori positive cases with antral and corpus biopsies between the ages of 18 and 75 years. The minimum number of cases required from a country was 100. Hematoxylin-eosin stained biopsies from antrum and corpus were scored semiquantitatively using the parameters suggested by the Sydney Classification System. Statistical evaluation was performed using Krusakal-Wallis test and Spearman's rank correlation test. Results. The severity of gastric atrophy varied among the different groups with the highest scores being present in Japan. The lowest scores were found in four European countries and in Thailand. The scores for intestinal metaplasia were low in general except for Xi-an, Japan, and Shanghai. For all the countries, the presence of atrophy in the antrum correlated well (r = 0. 891) with the incidence of gastric cancer. Conclusion. Using a standardized grading system in a large study of H. pylori-related <b>geographic</b> <b>pathology,</b> we found major differences in the overall prevalence and severity of H. pylori gastritis in relation to age. These differences mirrored the respective incidences of gastric cancer in those geographical area...|$|E
