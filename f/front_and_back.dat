40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} pulses that are created at T-points in reaction-diffusion systems on the real line. The pulses are formed by gluing unstable <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> together. We demonstrate that the bifurcating pulses can nevertheless be stable, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions that involve only the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> the <b>back</b> for {{the stability of the}} bifurcating pulses...|$|R
5|$|Bank1 captures {{an image}} of the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of the {{original}} check and the MICR line data {{from the front of the}} check. Bank1 then removes or truncates the original check from the clearing process and uses the check image, MICR data, its own electronic endorsement, and the electronic endorsements to create a substitute check.|$|E
5|$|Five sculptors {{executed}} {{a total of}} thirteen such scenes, {{not only on the}} <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> walls of zoo buildings, but also on all four sides of both brick entrance shelters at Flatbush Avenue. However, the positioning of some of the bas-reliefs makes them less accessible than others.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Blank {{was ranked}} number 82 in Maxims Hot 100. Blank was later {{featured}} {{on both the}} <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> covers of Maxim in December 2011. In 2012, Blank ranked number 38 in Maxims Hot 100.|$|E

50|$|Marvel Masterpieces is {{the name}} of several {{subsequent}} sets of trading cards, printed during 1992-2008, depicting characters and events from Marvel Comics. Featuring large, vividly drawn card <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> detailing trivia, each card showcased a different personality from Marvel's body of work.|$|R

5|$|Lennon {{created the}} Mind Games album cover himself, {{hand-cutting}} the photos. The <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> covers are similar; {{on the back}} sleeve Lennon is more toward the foreground, representing his symbolic walking away from Ono and her apparent mountainous influence on him.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{about the}} product began shortly after Apple {{released}} the iPad 2, which featured <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> cameras {{as well as}} a dual-core Apple A5 processor. Speculation increased after news of a 2,048 by 1,536 pixel screen leaked.|$|E
5|$|The match {{received}} extensive {{media coverage}} in Northern Ireland, {{especially from the}} predominantly nationalist Irish News. The Belfast Telegraph dedicated several pages to the match the following day, including the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> covers, whereas The News Letter, a largely unionist publication, had sparse coverage, highlighting traditional attitudes to Gaelic games in Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The maxillary toothrows are {{parallel}} to each other. The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a cingulum (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike {{in most of the}} closest relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back.</b> Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in heavily armed vehicles at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at {{the front and rear}} of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines, {{the upper}} molars all have one root {{on the inner}} (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in Pseudoryzomys and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and another at the back.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|In {{a two-day}} match against Yorkshire, Miller struck 111 {{including}} three sixes when {{none of the}} teammates passed 30. His innings featured strokes from both the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> foot. The next day, he scored 75 in 83 minutes against Durham and took 2/1 in another win for the RAAF. That {{was the first of}} four back-to-back one-dayers for the RAAF; Miller scored two, 23 and nine against Scottish Services, Greenock and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{crystalline}} silicon modules, the solder material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of lead (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for screen printing <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb {{have been used for}} 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy.|$|E
50|$|The station's art {{was created}} by artist Christofer C. Dierdorff. Entitled The Intimacy of Place, the {{installation}} uses photographs of the <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> <b>backs</b> of the heads of local people, creating intimate portraits that show each individual {{in the context of}} her/his role in the community.|$|R

5|$|Jobs {{unveiled}} the iPad 2 at a March 2, 2011, press conference. About 33% thinner {{than its predecessor}} and 15% lighter, the iPad 2 has a better processor, a dual core Apple A5 that Apple says is {{twice as fast as}} its predecessor for CPU operations and up to nine times as fast for GPU operations. The iPad 2 includes <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application, as well as a three-axis gyroscope. It retained the original's 10‑hour battery life and had a similar pricing scheme.|$|E
5|$|Julia Martha Thomas was {{a former}} schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. Since {{the death of her}} second husband in 1873, she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a garden at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back.</b> The area was not heavily {{populated}} at the time, although her house was close to a public house called The Hole in the Wall.|$|E
5|$|O'Donnell hired Chalkie Davies, a {{photographer}} for New Musical Express {{for two weeks}} to photograph the band on a US tour in early 1978 in order to capture enough pictures suitable for the album artwork. The front cover, featuring Lynott in the foreground, was originally {{supposed to be the}} back cover as the group wanted equal coverage of all members. O'Donnell disagreed and reversed the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> photographs at the last minute. The album had a working title of Thin Lizzy Live but Lynott decided that Live and Dangerous was better.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{distinction}} between close-mid vowels and open-mid vowels is needed, the IPA symbols for the open-mid basic <b>front</b> illabial <b>and</b> <b>back</b> labial vowels, [...] and , can be used. However, {{in keeping with the}} principles of the UPA, the open-mid <b>front</b> labial <b>and</b> <b>back</b> illabial vowels are still transcribed with the addition of diacritics, as [...] and [...]|$|R
