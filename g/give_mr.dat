Scott {{thought the}} film was [...] "edited crisply enough {{to keep it from}} feeling like 90 minutes of C-SPAN and shaped to <b>give</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gore's argument a real sense of drama," [...] and [...] "as unsettling as it can be," [...] Scott continued, [...] "it is also intellectually exhilarating, and, like any good piece of pedagogy, whets the appetite for further study." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mail {{called the}} video [...] "kinky" [...] and wrote that [...] " [...] {{has no plans}} to tone down her racy image." [...] MTV said that the essence of the video was Madonna's 1990 {{compilation}} album The Immaculate Collection, whose inline pictures featured her in bejewelled costumes. The black-and-white footage and the mod-burlesque feel was compared to [...] "Vogue" [...] (1990). According to MTV, elements from Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour were included in the dance choreography. They added that [...] "sheâ€™s thrown in some new , an extended cameo by Pharrell and enough jewelry to <b>give</b> <b>Mr.</b> T an inferiority complex." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com complimented Madonna's [...] "stunning" [...] body in the video, although she had turned 50 in the summer of 2008. He added that the video emphasized Madonna's [...] "amazing staying power as one of the world's top pop stars for 25 years." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 10, 2014, {{a lawsuit}} against Zayat was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff, Howard Rubinsky, was an {{associate}} of the Jelinskys who had also pleaded guilty in the illegal betting operation. His suit alleged breach of contract, claiming that Zayat failed to pay off a $1.65 million line of credit in 2004. Rubinsky said he extended credit to Zayat with Tradewinds Sportsbook so Zayat could bet on horse races via a gambling website set up in Costa Rica. Zayat's lawyer described the suit as [...] "a meritless claim", filed a motion to dismiss in 2015 alleging lack of evidence, and argued that {{the statute of limitations}} of six years had run. Zayat stated in court documents that he had met and loaned money to Rubinsky, but said, [...] "I can say unequivocally that I did not <b>give</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rubinsky any money as payment on any debt ... I agreed to give him money because {{he told me he was}} ill and broke." [...] On June 4, 2015, a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed Rubinsky's lawsuit, citing both Rubinsky's difficulty in proving his case and the expired statute of limitations. In a related matter, June 1, 2015, days before American Pharoah was to run in the 2015 Belmont Stakes, the New York Times reported that Rubinsky's lawyer, Joseph Bainton, filed a $10-million libel suit against Zayat for comments to the press, including the characterization of Rubinsky's other lawsuit as [...] "extortion, a fraud and blackmail." [...] That suit was dismissed on August 5, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{there was}} a desperate {{shortage}} of gunpowder, the provincial congress decided in November 1775 {{to send him to}} Philadelphia to study the working of the only powder mill in the colonies, in the hopes that {{he might be able to}} build a second one in Massachusetts. [...] Revere called on the mill's owner, Oswald Eve, armed with a letter from Continental Congressmen Robert Morris and John Dickinson asking Eve to [...] "Chearfully & from Public Spirited Motives <b>give</b> <b>Mr.</b> Revere such information as will inable him to Conduct the business on his return home." [...] Eve showed Revere around the mill, but refused to give him detailed drawings unless he was first paid a substantial bribe. [...] Despite this chilly reception, Revere was able to discern useful information from the visit. [...] He also acquired, through the work of Samuel Adams, plans for another powder mill. [...] This information enabled Revere to set up a powder mill at Stoughton (present-day Canton). [...] The mill produced tons of gunpowder for the Patriot cause.|$|E
2500|$|When Mr Gladstone {{visited the}} North, you well {{remember}} when word {{passed from the}} newspaper to the workman that it circulated through mines and mills, factories and workshops, and they came out to greet the only British minister who ever gave the English people a right {{because it was just}} they should have it ... and when he went down the Tyne, all the country heard how twenty miles of banks were lined with people who came to greet him. Men stood in the blaze of chimneys; the roofs of factories were crowded; colliers came up from the mines; women held up their children on the banks that it might be said in after life that they had seen the Chancellor of the People go by. The river was covered like the land. Every man who could ply an oar pulled up to <b>give</b> <b>Mr</b> Gladstone a cheer. When Lord Palmerston went to Bradford the streets were still, and working men imposed silence upon themselves. When Mr Gladstone appeared on the Tyne he heard cheer no other English minister ever heard ... the people were grateful to him, and rough pitmen who never approached a public man before, pressed round his carriage by thousands ... and thousands of arms were stretched out at once, to shake hands with Mr Gladstone as one of themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Equity {{is a body}} {{of rules}} that {{developed}} in England separately from the [...] "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The Lord Chancellor on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so. This meant equity came to operate more through principles than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to {{take good care of}} the entrusted property. In the early case of Keech v Sandford [...] a child had inherited the lease on a market in Romford, London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford {{that he did not want}} the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to <b>give</b> <b>Mr</b> Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. The Lord Chancellor, Lord King, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote, ...|$|E
