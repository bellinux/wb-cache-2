5|$|With the {{commencement}} of hostilities between Japan and the British Empire, {{it became clear that}} the three hospital ships currently serving Australia—Manunda, Wanganella, and Oranje—would not be able to operate in the shallow waters typical of Maritime Southeast Asia, so a new hospital ship was required. Of the Australian Merchant Navy vessels able to operate in this region, none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship, and a request to the British Ministry of Shipping placed Centaur at the disposal of the Australian military on 4 January 1943. The conversion work began on 9 January and Centaur was commissioned as an Australian Hospital Ship on 1 March. During her conversion, Centaur was painted with the markings of a hospital ship as detailed in Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 ("Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention"); white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull, white superstructure, multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship's status would be visible from both sea and air, and an identification number (for Centaur, 47) on her bows. At night, the markings were illuminated by a combination of internal and <b>external</b> <b>lights.</b> Data on the ship's markings and the layout of identifying structural features was provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of February 1943, who passed this on to the Japanese on 5 February. This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAfter {{our recent}} {{demonstration}} of a 3 D-printed <b>external</b> <b>light</b> trap {{on a small}} solar cell, we now consider its potential for large solar panels. An <b>external</b> <b>light</b> trap consists of a parabolic concentrator and a spacer that redirects the photons that are reflected by the solar cell back towards the solar cell. These retro-reflections enable higher absorptance and improved power conversion efficiency. Scaling a single <b>external</b> <b>light</b> trap such that it covers a large solar panel has disadvantages in terms of height and cost of the <b>external</b> <b>light</b> trap. These disadvantages can be overcome by deploying an array of concentrators as the top part of the <b>external</b> <b>light</b> trap. We present an optimization study of concentrator arrays for <b>external</b> <b>light</b> trapping. We fabricated 3 D-printed <b>external</b> <b>light</b> traps with a square, hexagonal and circular compound parabolic concentrator to test their suitability for concentrator arrays. The 3 D-printed traps were placed {{on top of an}} organic solar cell which resulted in a significant enhancement of the external quantum efficiency. The required transmittance of these concentrator arrays is calculated {{as a function of the}} parameters of both the concentrator and the solar cell. We compare the theoretical and experimentally determined optical performance of the different concentrators.

40|$|Gaze {{tracking}} systems usually utilize near-infrared (NIR) lights and NIR cameras, {{and the performance}} of such systems is mainly affected by <b>external</b> <b>light</b> sources that include NIR components. This is ascribed to the production of additional (imposter) corneal specular reflection (SR) caused by the <b>external</b> <b>light,</b> which makes it difficult to discriminate between the correct SR as caused by the NIR illuminator of the gaze tracking system and the imposter SR. To overcome this problem, a new method is proposed for determining the correct SR in the presence of <b>external</b> <b>light</b> based on the relationship between the corneal SR and the pupil movable area with the relative position of the pupil and the corneal SR. The experimental results showed that the proposed method makes the gaze tracking system robust to the existence of <b>external</b> <b>light...</b>|$|R
