25|$|The {{bodies of}} water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. One sign of high {{productivity}} and growth rate in the oceans <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of algae.

Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to the well-being of the food chain.|$|E

Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of factors that can lower the {{probability}} of a successful anger management intervention. One such obstacle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the individual's motivation. Overall low readiness is an impediment to the effectiveness of anger management due to the lower attendance rates and negative effect on the therapeutic alliance. Involuntary assignment to an anger management program, for example court mandated sessions, will result in a lower average motivation level than voluntary admission. In one study with incarcerated inmates, there was a correlation found between individual readiness and improvement.|$|E

This is generally hardware-enforced by some CPU architectures that provide different CPU modes at the hardware or microcode level. Rings are arranged in a hierarchy from most privileged (most trusted, usually numbered zero) to least privileged (least trusted, usually with the highest ring number).

25|$|One {{indicator}} {{to measure}} the technical efficiency of water utilities <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of non-revenue water.

In Durban it stood at an estimated average of 31% between 2002 and 2006. In Cape Town the estimates fluctuated significantly between 10% and 37%, suggesting that the estimates may not be reliable.
