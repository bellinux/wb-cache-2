25|$|Sussex {{recorded}} {{a big victory}} at Hove, smacking the Bangladeshi bowlers at will before bowling them out twice for a pittance, which did not exactly give the Bangladeshis confidence {{a week before the}} first Test at Lord's. Michael Yardy was the star of the match, notching up 35 fours and two sixes in a towering 257 - the highest score of the English first class season so far - which led Sussex to 549 for 7 declared. In reply, Habibul Bashar <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> bouncer from Jason Lewry when on 22 not out, and thus had to retire, and things only went downhill from there. The Bangladeshis could only manage a total of 323 runs from two innings (127 and 196), with 16-year-old wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim the only one who passed forty runs with a two-hour 63 in the second innings, before being stumped off a delivery by the Man of the Match, Yardy - who recorded his first career five-wicket haul, taking five for 83.|$|E
500|$|Because of his damaged kidney, Hoffman was {{not allowed}} to play {{football}} or wrestle. Hoffman went to Savanna High School in Anaheim as had Glenn, which put pressure on Hoffman following his more talented older brother. Ed, who did not trust that coaches would protect Hoffman's arm, stopped allowing his son to pitch after he was 12 years old. Standing at just [...] and , Hoffman played shortstop at Savanna, but nobody offered him a scholarship out of high school. He grew three inches over the summer and continued playing at Cypress College, and later for the University of Arizona from 1988 through 1989. [...] Arizona was afraid of the liability if Hoffman's remaining kidney <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> baseball. [...] "I told them the one kidney I have is on my right side. That's not the side that faces the pitcher when I hit, so it was O.K. They bought it", said Hoffman. He led Arizona in hitting in 1988 with a [...]371 batting average, 35 points better than teammate J. T. Snow. Other notable teammates included Scott Erickson and Kevin Long. Hoffman exhibited a strong throwing arm playing shortstop.|$|E
2500|$|Neely singled as did Kuhn; Neil fanned but Thomas got {{his third}} {{straight}} hit and both tallied. Big Tot <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pitched ball and Smith was safe on a fielder's choice with one out. Woodruf flied out to right. Tyner slammed one to center which Jetty juggled and everybody advanced {{a pair of}} sacks. Ryan was safe on another error and two runs came over. Neely beat out his second hit of the inning and Kuhn walked. Neil walked. Thomas was safe on an error and Big Tot McCullough picked one over the right field fence, clearing the sacks--but oh, what's the use? Why continue? ...|$|E
50|$|The club, {{left without}} a place to play, moved to the Stadium Nord which was smaller than Grimonprez-Jooris (18,154 seats) and did not fulfill UEFA demands. This {{situation}} forced the team, who had qualified for 2005-06 UEFA Champions League, {{to play at the}} Stade de France for its European matches.

One month later, Börner won that season's World Cup on the 1500 m, having performed the best over 8 World Cup races on that distance during that season.

2500|$|In the {{following}} days, while at {{work with the}} other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her {{when they first met}} and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads for the bathroom to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of interactive entertainment, and fast driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of [...] "The Hound", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.|$|E
2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{snowplow}} and I {{forgot all about}} the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the last}} final meters, Stefan Schumacher <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> arm from a {{supporter}} {{and as a}} result made an awkward move away from the supporters {{to the middle of the}} road, which resulted in George Hincapie falling down. Before the move it looked like Schumacher was going to become second and Hincapie third, which would make Hincapie the winner with an advantage of 1 second. Since Hincapie crashed he did not take any bonus seconds for ending in the top three and because Schumacher managed to restart his sprint and end third he took 4 bonus seconds and so won by 1 second. The jury took about twenty minutes deciding if Schumacher should be removed to the back of the peloton but in the end they concluded that Schumacher did not make the move on purpose and thus Schumacher won the Eneco Tour 2006.

5000|$|Again, {{the players}} must {{take control of}} the Neo Arc (which, again, is a pun on Newark, New Jersey) policemen, Garcia and Cliff, but this time they are on a mission to destroy the evil army of Vanguard who are attacking the city (and also named after the player's tank from Blazer); as with the {{original}} Steel Gunner, it creates the illusion of not having a scoring system (like The Return of Ishtar and Yokai Dochuki), but, unlike its predecessor, it does not have the text [...] "1UP", [...] "HI-SCORE" [...] and [...] "2UP" [...] on its title screen, which further enforces the illusion. Some of the enemies from the original game make comebacks, but have undergone a makeover since the first time Neo Arc saw them, in 1990 - and several new enemies have also been introduced as well. Again, the players can shoot anything on the screen, including background objects, and even innocent bystanders (of which there are only eight types now as opposed to ten); but again, if they should do the latter it will cause them to lose energy as if they <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> enemy.|$|R

Ouellet deployed with fellow Pearl Harbor ships [...] and [...] to join the [...] battle group known as [...] "Battle Group Delta". The frigate spent time in Subic Bay, Philippines before transiting the Strait of Malacca {{on the way to}} Diego Garcia, BIOT.

The warship then joined the rest of the battle group in the North Arabian Sea in support of Operation Earnest Will. Ouellet was detached from Battle Group Delta and proceeded with [...] with port visits to Phuket, Thailand and Singapore. The frigate then detached from Cochrane and proceeded to Subic Bay, RPI where she had a 3-week stay before the battle group caught up and proceeded home with her.

We went to Belgium, where the Nr4 Troops Brigade and the No10 Commando were billeted. We were an attached unit of 14 men. We entered our LCT's Buffalo's amphibious vehicles to go to Walcheren where we experienced heavy German Artillery.
