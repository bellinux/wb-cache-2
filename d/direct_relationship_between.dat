Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and The Art of War in developing their theories, seeing a <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E

We first consider a basic model, which represents only <b>direct</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> the {{documents in the}} collection and the terms or keywords used to index them. Next, we study two versions of an extended model, which also represents <b>direct</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> documents.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{probabilistic}} document retrieval model based on Bayesian networks. The network {{is used to}} compute the posterior probabilities of relevance of the documents in the collection given a query. These computations {{can be carried out}} efficiently, because of the specific network topology and conditional probability tables being considered, which allow the use of a fast and exact probabilities propagation algorithm. In the initial model, only <b>direct</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> the terms in the glossary and the documents that contain them are considered, giving rise to a Bayesian network with two layers. Next, we consider an extended model that also includes <b>direct</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> documents, using a network topology with three layers. We also report the results of a set of experiments with the two models, using several standard document collections. ...|$|R

The sample consisted of 1, 795 adolescents (48 % females) aged 11 to 18 years (M= 14. 2, SD= 1. 68).

25|$|The {{accepted}} {{theory of}} {{heat in the}} 18th century viewed {{it as a kind}} of fluid, called caloric; although this theory was later shown to be erroneous, a number of scientists adhering to it nevertheless made important discoveries useful in developing the modern theory, including Joseph Black (1728–99) and Henry Cavendish (1731–1810). Opposed to this caloric theory, which had been developed mainly by the chemists, was the less accepted theory dating from Newton's time that heat is due to the motions of the particles of a substance. This mechanical theory gained support in 1798 from the cannon-boring experiments of Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson), who found a <b>direct</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> heat and mechanical energy.|$|E
