40|$|Positive {{psychology}} {{has emerged}} {{as an antidote to}} the negativistic focus of mainstream psychology and human <b>flourishing</b> has recently been identified as its underlying aim. <b>Flourishing</b> is also the aim of positive education, an applied area of positive psychology that uses wellbeing theories and research on students in educational settings.

To address this gap, I present a series of exploratory studies aimed at contextualising <b>flourishing.</b> Higher education was selected as an appropriate setting for this work as positive education is limited at tertiary level and would benefit from contextualised understandings of <b>flourishing.</b> Findings of the studies – both qualitative and quantitative – provided novel and insightful understandings of <b>flourishing</b> as it is understood by students in higher education, aided the development and validation of a psychometric tool that measures context-specific <b>flourishing</b> in higher education, and enabled the exploration o...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flourishing</b> is characterised by {{a growth}} and self-expansive orientation, where the {{emphasis}} is on continued growth. <b>Flourishing</b> individuals are associated with greater self-development, generativity, growth, resilience as well as enjoy enhanced physical and mental health outcomes.

We test this with a large sample of NZ employees using the Self Determination Theory variables of Three Needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness).

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a practical {{guide for the}} development of <b>flourishing</b> students. <b>Flourishing</b> is defined as a positive psychological state characterised by positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishments with various positive work/life outcomes (Seligman, Flourish: A visionary new understanding of happiness and well-being, 2011). Within an academic setting, recent research has alluded to the relationship between <b>flourishing</b> students and academic performance (Van Zyl and Rothmann, Journal of Psychology in Africa 22 (3), 2012). Howell (Journal of Positive Psychology 4 (1) : 1 – 13, 2009) found that <b>flourishing</b> students were less likely to procrastinate, had higher levels of self-control, adopted a mastery-approach towards their goals and reported higher levels of academic performance. Further, Seligman (Flourish:A visionary new understanding of happiness and well-being, 2011) argued that <b>flourishing</b> students has a higher probability to experience fruitful and rewarding careers. Therefore, it is imperative to equip students with the necessary skills to enhance <b>flourishing</b> early in their academic careers.

40|$|<b>Flourishing</b> is the {{ultimate}} end-state in psychology and a key-concept {{in the field of}} positive psychology research. Flourishers are those individuals with both high levels of hedonic well-being and eudaimonic well-being. Although many researchers have focused on one or another of these domains, only a few have investigated the comprehensive state of <b>flourishing.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the prevalence of <b>flourishing</b> and its association with socio-demographics, personality traits and situational factors. This study used data from the second wave of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study- 2 (NEMESIS- 2), a national representative sample of adults in The Netherlands (n = 5303; 2010 – 2012). Findings were compared to having either high hedonic well-being or high eudaimonic well-being. Results showed that 37 % of the respondents were flourishers, mainly characterized by high levels of conscientiousness and extraversion and low levels of neuroticism. The situational factors of social support and positive life-events were significantly associated with <b>flourishing</b> when the analysis was controlled for socio-demographics and personality traits. <b>Flourishing</b> was most distinct from high hedonic well-being and showed parallelism with high eudaimonic well-being. More research is needed to establish a preferred <b>flourishing</b> instrument with validated cut-off points for <b>flourishing</b> and to understand the processes of situational factors that may underlie the promotion of <b>flourishing.</b> We recommend longitudinal designs and experience sampling studies to investigate the unique and modifiable predictors of <b>flourishing.</b> In addition, future research should include intervention studies that examine through which hedonic and eudaimonic pathways <b>flourishing</b> can be achieve...|$|R

This study aims to identify dimensions of employee <b>flourishing,</b> and to investigate the antecedents and outcomes thereof in the southern African work and organizational context. The findings of various studies were reviewed, and data gathered from a sample of managers in South Africa (N = 505) was used to explore the dimensions, antecedents, and outcomes of <b>flourishing.</b> The results showed that <b>flourishing</b> individuals feel good (i. e., are satisfied with their jobs and experience positive emotions at work), function psychologically well (i. e., are energetic, dedicated, self-determined, find meaning and purpose at work, and experience harmony), and function socially well (in terms of social acceptance, social growth, social contribution, social coherence, and social integration).
