40|$|My thesis {{investigates the}} {{functions}} of <b>dreams</b> <b>and</b> sleep within Shakespeare’s wider design of comedy and tragedy. Methodologically, it combines its focus on genre with a strong historicist component in order to reconstruct the early modern understanding of <b>dreams</b> <b>and</b> sleep that influenced Shakespeare’s approach to this material. Comparing Shakespeare’s representations of <b>dreams</b> <b>and</b> sleep with those in classical culture, from which dramatic genre, dream theory, sleep theory, and the deployment of <b>dreams</b> within comic <b>and</b> tragic structures originally derive, I argue that Shakespeare uses devices of <b>dreams</b> <b>and</b> sleep to support his deviation from those classical conventions of comedy and tragedy that he found incompatible with his aspiration towards a fuller, darker, and more complex representation of human nature, behaviour, and character. To that effect, I discuss how <b>dreams</b> <b>and</b> sleep in Shakespeare’s comedies introduce tensions that are neither resolved nor absorbed by the respective endings; and I show how <b>dreams</b> <b>and</b> sleep in the tragedies and tragic histories help emphasise human agency and responsibility {{at the expense of}} the ideas of fortune and supernatural determinism found in classical tragedy...|$|R

5|$|It {{is unknown}} when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet's nurse {{refers to an}} {{earthquake}} she says occurred 11 years ago. This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed {{in support of the}} different dates. But the play's stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night's <b>Dream</b> <b>and</b> other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life. According to scholars, the novel's main themes are nature versus nurture, rebirth, and the differing {{experiences}} of what society constructs as polar opposites—such as those found between men and women. It discusses the pursuit of the American <b>Dream</b> <b>and</b> explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings are}} neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in a <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|Stories also link Bahuchara {{to gender}} {{variance}} after she becomes divine. One myth concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince {{grew up to}} be impotent. One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince in a <b>dream</b> <b>and</b> ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify impotent men and command them to do the same. If they refuse, she punishes them: for their next seven incarnations they will be impotent. This myth is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.|$|E
