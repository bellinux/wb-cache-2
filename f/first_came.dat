We derive conditions under which providing a nonpreemptive priority allows both classes of users to use the facility and get a higher expected public net benefit than the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. The class that is provided the higher priority may or not be the class that dominates in the public optimum under the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. That means that introducing a priority scheme may switch the class that is given preference in the public optimum. It is shown that there exist situations where the class that is granted the higher priority for service could be levied a lower price than the class that is granted the lower priority. In the case where the users alone have perfect information on the value from using the facility, we derive conditions under which a non preemptive priority is superior to the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. The preemptive priority resume queue is not necessarily always superior to the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue.
