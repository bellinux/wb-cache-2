5|$|Doctors {{were the}} first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also realize their {{professional}} life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices</b> with baffling illnesses, most notably lymphadenopathy, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E
5|$|Burchard was {{appointed}} as treasurer of York by King Richard I of England on 15 September 1189, but his appointment {{was at first}} opposed by the newly chosen Archbishop of York, Geoffrey. Along with Burchard, Richard also appointed Henry Marshal the dean; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Because of Geoffrey's objections, his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted. Burchard and Marshal retaliated by accusing the archbishop-elect of being a murderer {{as well as the}} son of a prostitute. When Geoffrey visited York in October 1189, both Burchard and Marshal requested their installation <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices,</b> but Geoffrey refused to do so until he himself was confirmed in his archbishopric by the papacy. Geoffrey's refusal to install the royal nominees meant the archbishop-elect was out of favour with Richard, and the king refused to allow Geoffrey's officials to travel to Rome to request confirmation of the archbishopric.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of January 29, Mậu and Khiêm alerted the rebel troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion {{and an assortment of}} Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices</b> at 02:00. Lodge was kept fully informed throughout the night. As the time approached, Khánh donned his paratrooper uniform and headed to the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over the government without a shot being fired.|$|E

5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices</b> and blame the deaths on the communists.|$|E
5|$|Puppet theater, waterwheel-powered: The {{mechanical}} toys of Roman Egypt, {{especially the}} weight-driven puppet theater of Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD), {{are well known}} and discussed by historians such as Beck, Prou, and de Rochas d'Aiglun. In China, Zhang Heng (78–139) wrote of plays with artificial fish and dragons, while a 6th-century text Xijing Zaji states that when Liu Bang (reigned as Emperor Gaozu of Han from 202–195 BC) came upon the treasury of the deceased Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210) in 206 BC, he found an entire mechanical orchestra of 1m (3ft) tall puppets dressed in silk and playing mouth organs, all powered by pulling ropes and blowing into tubes. As written in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the engineer Ma Jun (fl. 220–265)—already associated with the differential gear system of the south-pointing chariot—invented a mechanical theater powered by a rotating wooden waterwheel for the entertainment of Emperor Ming's (r. 226–239 AD) court. With the waterwheel in motion, a number of mechanical puppets performed tricks, such as singing girls who played music and danced, other puppets who would beat drums and sound flutes when one puppet entered the scene, puppets dancing on balls, throwing swords, hanging upside down on rope ladders, etc. Other mechanical puppets dressed as government officials did tasks <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices,</b> puppets dressed as laborers did jobs of pounding and grinding (trip hammer and millstone), while others watched cockfighting, all moving simultaneously. Water-powered puppet theaters {{in the tradition of}} Ma Jun were created in later dynasties as well.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{were joined}} by General Trần Thiện Khiêm, the disaffected {{commander}} of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon, {{and an assortment of}} Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers and their units. Other notable recruits were Diem loyalist and former chief of the Civil Guard, Duong Ngoc Lam, who was under investigation for corruption, and General Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris. The cabal scheduled the coup for 04:00, 30 January. On 29 January, Thi followed Khánh to the capital. The plotters and their agents met in obscure locations spots around town. On the night of 29 January, the rebel troops assumed their positions around Saigon. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices</b> at 2:00. At 03:00, Khánh took over the Joint General Staff Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, and by dawn, the coup had succeeded without a shot being fired as Minh's junta was caught unaware. The popular Minh was allowed to stay on as a ceremonial but powerless head of state, but his colleagues were taken into custody. Nevertheless, Minh remained disgruntled and persistently tried to regain his influence through political means. On 2 February 1964, Thi was appointed to be commander of the 1st Division based in Huế, as part of I Corps. He stayed in the post until 21 October and on 14 November, he took control of the entire corps. This corps oversaw the five northernmost provinces of central Vietnam and the 1st and 2nd Divisions.|$|E

He promised protection against Poland, assured the annexation of the Matthias conquests to Hungary, and pledged to keep the Hungarian clerks and counselors <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices.</b> Otherwise, he threatened to use force to gain the submission of the Hungarian Kingdom. To enforce his influence over the royal election, he ordered numerous copies of the Peace Treaty of Wiener Neustadt to be printed and distributed among the elector nobility.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the office of}} stadtholder was indispensable, the States of the five provinces with a vacancy could and would have {{appointed}} a successor, though not necessarily someone from the Nassau families. As a matter of fact, there were the precedents of Willem IV van den Bergh and Adolf van Nieuwenaar in Gelderland in early Republican times. But the Holland regents did not feel a pressing need to appoint anyone, especially in view of recent events. They acted very quickly to undo the effects of William's coup, freeing the captive regents and reinstating them <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices.</b> The Gecommitteerde Raden (executive committee) of the States of Holland moved immediately to reassert their authority over the army and convened a plenary session of the States. Next Holland proposed in the States General that a so-called Great Assembly (a kind of constitutional convention) should be convened at short notice, to amend the Union of Utrecht.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrayal}} of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in {{a vision of a}} hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the Carolingian renaissance. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>offices</b> and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.|$|E
