5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep <b>fryers</b> be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E

After Bart {{points out that}} they need larger amounts of grease, the pair drive to Krusty Burger, where they attempt steal grease from the <b>fryers.</b> After loading it into Marge's car, two employees of The Acne Grease and Shovel Company steal it, claiming they control the grease and shoveling business in the city.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep <b>fryers</b> are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E

500|$|In May 1997, the [...] "Tower Burger", a {{fried chicken}} fillet burger with the {{addition}} of a hash brown, was first launched in the United Kingdom.

In 2013, KFC rolled out Lavazza coffee across all of its UK outlets. As of 2014, KFC UK is trialling serving only halal meat at 96 of its outlets.|$|E
500|$|KFC {{initially}} used stove-top covered cooking pots to fry its chicken. In the 1960s, the officially recommended {{model was}} the L S Hartzog developed [...] "KFC 20-Head Cooker", a large device that cost $16,000. The Hartzog model had no oil filtration system, meaning that filtering {{had to be}} done manually, and the pressure <b>fryers</b> occasionally exploded, often causing harm to employees. In 1969, inventor and engineer Winston L. Shelton developed the [...] "Collectramatic" [...] pressurized fryer to overcome the problems KFC faced in quickly frying chicken to meet growing customer demand. The Collectramatic used precision time and temperature controls and self-filtered the cooking oil – all while meeting Colonel Sanders’ legendary high quality standards. Fred Jeffries, then vice president of purchasing at KFC, claimed that the invention helped fuel the company's rapid expansion and success: ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{a number}} of franchisees bought the Collectramatic, which {{had the support of}} Colonel Sanders from 1970 onwards, John Y. Brown had given tacit {{approval}} to franchisees to exclusively use the older L S Hartzog fryer, saying [...] "Though those old pots were damn dangerous, at least we knew they worked! I was mostly afraid these new <b>fryers</b> would break {{down in the middle of}} business." [...] Brown warned franchisees that they were in violation of their contract if they used the Collectramatic. Brown held his ground on the issue until he learned that his father, John Y. Brown Sr., who owned multiple KFC franchises, was successfully using the Collectramatic in every franchise he owned. [...] The issue was eventually resolved after Heublein purchased KFC, acquired Hartzog and nullified the contract. The Collectramatic has been an approved pressure fryer for KFC from 1972 onwards.|$|E

Pól Brennan, who had married a US citizen, was detained and removed from the United States to the Republic of Ireland on either 20 or 21 August 2009.

In 2000 the British government announced that the extradition requests for Brennan, Artt and Kirby were being withdrawn {{as part of the}} Good Friday Agreement. The men officially remain fugitives, but in 2003 Her Majesty's Prison Service said they were not being [...] "actively pursued". Dermot McNally, who had been living in the Republic of Ireland and was tracked down in 1996, and Dermot Finucane, received an amnesty in January 2002, allowing them to return to Northern Ireland if they wished to. However, Tony McAllister was not granted a similar amnesty. As of 2008, two escapees, Gerard <b>Fryers</b> and Séamus Campbell, had not been traced since the escape.

2500|$|The modern fish-and-chip shop ("chippy" [...] or [...] "chipper" [...] {{in modern}} British slang) {{originated}} in the United Kingdom, although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe. Early fish-and-chip shops had only very basic facilities. Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat, heated by a coal fire. The fish-and-chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format, with the food served, in paper wrappings, to queuing customers, over a counter {{in front of the}} <b>fryers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Presented as Davey's Fried Fish & Chip Potato Restaurant, {{the fish}} and chip shop opened in 2011, and {{represents}} the typical style of shop found in the era as they were becoming rapidly popular in the region - the brick built Victorian style fryery would most often have previously been used for another trade, and the attached corrugated iron hut serves as a saloon with tables and benches, where customers would eat and socialise. Featuring coal fired ranges using beef-dripping, the shop is named [...] in honour of the last coal fired shop in Tyneside, located in Winlaton Mill, and which closed in 2007. Latterly run by brothers Brian and Ramsay Davy, it had been established by their grandfather in 1937. The serving counter {{and one of the}} shop's three <b>fryers,</b> a 1934 Nuttal, came from the original Davy shop. The other two <b>fryers</b> are a 1920s Mabbott used near Chester until the 1960s, and a GW Atkinson New Castle Range, donated from a shop in Prudhoe in 1973. The latter is one of only two known late Victorian examples to survive. The decorative wall tiles in the fryery came to the museum in 1979 from Cowes Fish and Game Shop in Berwick upon Tweed. The shop also features both an early electric and hand-powered potato rumblers (cleaners), and a gas powered chip chopper built around 1900. Built behind the chapel, the fryery is arranged so the counter faces the rear, stretching the full length of the building. Outside is a brick built row of outdoor toilets. Supplementing the fish bar is the restored Berriman's mobile chip van, used in Spennymoor until the early 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|... the United States was {{producing}} {{in excess of}} 11 billion liters (2.9 billion U.S. gallons) of recycled vegetable oil annually, mainly from industrial deep <b>fryers</b> in potato processing plants, snack food factories and fast food restaurants. [...] If all those 11 billion liters could be recycled and used to replace the energy equivalent amount of petroleum (an ideal case), almost 1% of US oil consumption could be offset. Use of used vegetable oil as a direct fuel competes with some other uses of the commodity, which has effects on its price as a fuel and increases its cost as an input to the other uses as well. Utilizing recycled vegetable oil {{as a replacement for}} standard petroleum-derived fuels like gasoline would reduce the price of gasoline by preserving the supply of petroleum. If demand was relegated towards alternative fuels like biofuels, it would reduce the demand for petroleum and subsequently reduce the price of gasoline.|$|E
