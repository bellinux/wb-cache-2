500|$|Though {{her crew}} did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time, West Honaker had been {{selected}} {{to be one of}} the blockships for the Allied invasion of France, then in the planning stages. Blockships dispatched from Boston, like West Honaker, were loaded with [...] "tons of sand and cement" [...] before their final U.S. departures. West Honaker sailed from Boston on 25 March 1944 as a part of Convoy BX-101 to Halifax and, from there, Convoy SC-156 to Cardiff. In his book Beyond the Palisades, Cesar Poropat, West Honakers chief engineer, reports that after the ship's cargo was discharged, the ship was suddenly boarded by shipyard workers who cut holes in [...] "strategic places" [...] and positioned [...] "mysterious packs" [...] around the hull. The crew suspected, correctly, that these packs were explosives and that the ship was being prepared for sinking. Though there is no specific mention of this occurring on West Honaker, other blockships selected for the Normandy beachhead had their existing antiaircraft weapons moved higher on the ship and supplemented by additional guns.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, Arsenal {{made the}} bold but {{ultimately}} unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager, despite {{his lack of}} managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club. Like his two immediate predecessors, Wright was not very successful, although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition, in the 1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 1962–63. In his final season, Arsenal finished 14th, their lowest position in 36 years, and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury — 4,554 in a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966. [...] The only Arsenal player to figure in England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning squad was George Eastham, who did not play at all during the tournament. Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board {{in the summer of}} 1966, and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee. Though the club's directors did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time, Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years.|$|E

500|$|In September, {{the album}} entered Billboards album charts; the highest {{position}} Freewheelin reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one {{million copies in}} the US. Dylan himself came to acknowledge Freewheelin as the album that marked {{the start of his}} success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: [...] "Although I didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." [...] Besides [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" [...] and [...] "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" [...] have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of global success. John Lennon recalled: [...] "In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all. Paul got the record (The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan) from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once Phoumi's counter-coup succeeded on 14 December 1960, Lair {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Vientiane. Fitzgerald promptly joined him there. Fitzgerald {{saw that the}} PARU's flawless performance in the counter-coup was based on reliable inside information, and decided that Lair and his special forces police should remain in Laos. This series of events marked {{the start of the}} Laotian Civil War. Once established there, Lair reached out to contact Vang Pao. He flew via Air America Sikorsky H-34 to the Lao village of Tha Vieng to meet the Hmong leader on 19 January 1961. Vang Pao told Lair that his people could not live under Vietnamese communist rule. [...] "Either we fight or we leave. If you give me weapons, we fight," [...] he told Lair. He promised he could call up 10,000 tribesmen for military training. They would follow him, he promised, and he pledged loyalty to the King of Laos. The approximately 4,300 Hmong who had accompanied him at Tha Vieng indicated that Vang Pao already had a sizable following. Although Lair did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> first, he was about to inherit a tradition of resistance to the Vietnamese. In the late-1800s the Hmong had founded zones of resistance under the command of local village chiefs. Now, many of their descendants would join the CIA effort. Lair saw the Hmong guerrillas as a valuable supplement to the Royal Lao Army's regular forces. His seniors agreed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. I know Oz pretty well, but Ojo doesn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all. I'm {{sorry for}} his uncle and poor Margolotte and I'd {{like to help}} save them. May I go?" ...|$|E

60|$|I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> once; <b>it</b> was Sheba's ring which Maqueda had lent {{to me in}} {{proof of}} her good faith when I journeyed for help to England.
