25|$|On May 13, 1965, local {{investigators}} and the FBI formally named Blanton, Cash, Chambliss, and Cherry as {{the perpetrators of}} the bombing, with Robert Chambliss the likely ringleader of the four. This information was relayed to the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI,</b> J.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act is in title V, and relates to National Security Letters (NSLs). An NSL is a form of administrative subpoena used by the FBI, and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the CIA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. Title V allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a Special Agent in charge of a Bureau field office, where previously only the Director or the Deputy Assistant <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> were able to certify such requests.|$|E

25|$|Chief {{among the}} Post's {{anonymous}} sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant {{was identified as}} William Mark Felt, Sr., deputy <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> {{during that period of}} the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with Time magazine, the Washington Daily News and other publications.|$|E
