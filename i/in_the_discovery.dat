5|$|Born in Walkerton, Indiana, Urey studied {{thermodynamics}} under Gilbert N. Lewis at the University of California. After {{he received}} his PhD in 1923, he was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. He was a research associate at Johns Hopkins University before becoming {{an associate professor of}} Chemistry at Columbia University. In 1931, he began work with the separation of isotopes that resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of deuterium.|$|E

5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them {{on the first floor of}} the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery,</b> Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E
5|$|Kincaid missed {{commencement}} exercises at the University of Washington due to {{his appointment}} as the entomologist attached to the Harriman Alaska Expedition. During that trip, completed before his 27th birthday, he collected about 8,000 specimens of insect, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> and naming of more than 240 new species, including Mesenchytraeus harrimani, which he named after the expedition's patron, E. H. Harriman.|$|E
5|$|Mystery Science Theater 3000 had {{the design}} of its main setting, the {{starship}} Satellite of Love, based on the bone-shaped satellite featured in the match cut from prehistoria to the future. The one-eyed design of the robot Gypsy led the show to do various scenes comparing it to HAL 9000, including {{a scene from the}} , where the opening featuring Mike Nelson jogging along the walls of the Satellite of Love parodies the scene where Frank Poole does the same <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Discovery.</b>|$|E

5|$|The early {{investigation}} into the size and nature of quasars drove the development of interferometry techniques in the 1950s; the Lovell telescope had an advantage due to its large collecting area, meaning that high sensitivity interferometer measurements can be made relatively quickly using it. As a result, the telescope featured heavily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of quasars.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a body found in sewage after being reassigned to different departments. Their inquiry results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a bizarre fluke-like man—the product of the Chernobyl disaster—that soon goes on a rampage in the sewers of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the outer planets has since been {{revolutionized}} {{by the use of}} unmanned space probes. The arrival of the Voyager spacecraft at Saturn in 1980–1981 resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of three additional moons—Atlas, Prometheus and Pandora, bringing the total to 17. In addition, Epimetheus was confirmed as distinct from Janus. In 1990, Pan was discovered in archival Voyager images.|$|E

Cena wrestled for the UPW until March 2001. Cena returned to UPW for one night in 2003, losing to Frankie Kazarian by disqualification.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
50|$|As this {{coherence}} breaks down, {{however, the}} adequacy of science as a universal mode of understanding is challenged. Such are the historical origins of the critique of bourgeois science (beginning with Marx, and finding expression eventually, in some form, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discoveries</b> of Einstein, Gödel, and Quine).|$|R

5|$|Much of {{the early}} work {{leading up to the}} {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Technion in the laboratory of Avram Hershko, where Aaron Ciechanover worked as a graduate student. Hershko's year-long sabbatical in the laboratory of Irwin Rose at the Fox Chase Cancer Center provided key conceptual insights, though Rose later downplayed his role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery.</b> The three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in discovering this system.|$|E
5|$|The Cargador del Ancestro ("Ancestor Carrier") {{consists}} of four fragments of sculpture that had been reused in the facades of four different buildings during {{the latter part of}} the Late Preclassic. Monuments 215 and 217 were discovered in 2008 during excavations of Structure 7A, while Stela Fragments 53 and 61 had been unearthed in previous excavations. Archaeologists discovered that although Monuments 215 and 217 possessed different themes and were executed in differing styles, they in fact fitted together perfectly to form part of a single sculpture that was still incomplete. This prompted a revision of previously found sculpture fragments and resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of two further pieces, originally found in Structures 12 and 74.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{supernova}} discovery steadily increased {{throughout the}} twentieth century. In the 1990s, several automated supernova search programs were initiated. The Leuschner Observatory Supernova Search program was begun in 1992 at Leuschner Observatory. It was joined {{the same year}} by the Berkeley Automated Imaging Telescope program. These were succeeded in 1996 by the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory, which was primarily used for the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). By 2000, the Lick program resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of 96 supernovae, making it the world's most successful Supernova search program.|$|E

5|$|WASP-44 was {{observed}} between July and November 2009 by the WASP-South, a station of the SuperWASP planet-searching program {{based at the}} South African Astronomical Observatory. Observations of the star revealed a periodic decrease in its brightness. WASP-South, along with the SuperWASP-North station at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the Canary Islands, collected 15,755 photometric observations, allowing scientists to produce a more accurate light curve. Another set of observations yielded a 6,000 point photometric data set, but the light curve was prepared late and was not considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> paper.|$|E
5|$|Anning {{searched for}} fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, {{particularly}} {{during the winter months}} when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{victory at}} the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 {{proved to be a}} major local set back for the Viet Cong, indefinitely forestalling an {{imminent}} movement against the Australian base at Nui Dat and challenging their previous domination of Phuoc Tuy province. In the months that followed the two infantry battalions of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR) and 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR)—had conducted a number of search and destroy, village cordon and search, and route security operations in an attempt to further extend their control, and to separate the local people from the influence of the Viet Cong. Such operations usually resulted in contacts between the Australians and small groups of Viet Cong, while during cordon and search operations of Binh Ba and Hoa Long a number of villagers suspected of sympathising with the communists were apprehended and handed over to the South Vietnamese authorities. Several search operations were also conducted by the Australians in areas suspected of containing Viet Cong base camps, and these often resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of recently used and quickly evacuated camps, hospitals and logistic bases which had then been destroyed. Meanwhile, both battalions had also continued an extensive patrolling and ambushing program around the task force base at Nui Dat.|$|E
