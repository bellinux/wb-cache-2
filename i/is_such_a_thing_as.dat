25|$|The biblical {{concept of}} righteousness {{was rooted in}} the covenant-making God who had ordered {{creation}} for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern {{for the poor and}} needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy. Satan {{raises the question of whether}} there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.|$|E

500|$|The Stoics {{admitted}} {{between the}} good and the bad a third class of things – the indifferent (adiaphora). Of things morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and the worst includes sickness and poverty. Chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent things as [...] "good", but the wise person, said Chrysippus, uses such things without requiring them.

Throughout the night, as Kawaguchi's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses, Edson remained standing about [...] behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123, exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts. Said Marine Captain Tex Smith, who was in position to observe Edson {{for most of the}} night, [...] "I can say that if there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> one man holding a battalion together, Edson did it that night.

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "Pixar's ninth {{consecutive}} wonder", {{saying it was}} imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that {{the main difference between}} the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter declared that WALL-E surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the [...] "heart, soul, spirit and romance" [...] of the best silent films. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings. He praised Burtt's sound design, saying [...] "If there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> an aural sleight of hand, this is it." ...|$|E

[...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering if there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard it all before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't {{want to hear it}} again."

2500|$|Non violence, or ahimsa, is {{a central}} part of Hinduism {{and is one of the}} {{fundamental}} Yamas - self restraints needed to live a proper life.

2500|$|The main crisis {{came when}} a German u-boat sank the British ocean liner RMS Lusitania in May 1915. International law {{required}} a warning so that {{passengers and crew}} could board life boats. [...] No warning was issued and the ship sank in 18 minutes, with a thousand deaths including over 100 Americans. Wilson said, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a man being too proud to fight. There <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a nation being so right {{that it does not}} need to convince others by force that it is right". Many reacted to these remarks with contempt. Wilson protested to Berlin but its reply was evasive. Secretary of State Bryan, strongly opposed to war, resigned, and was replaced by Robert Lansing. The White Star liner the SS Arabic was then torpedoed, with two American casualties. Wilson threatened a diplomatic break unless Germany repudiated the action; Germany then gave a written promise: [...] "liners will not be sunk by our submarines". Wilson had won a promise that merchant ships would not be sunk without warning; and most importantly he had kept the U.S. out of the war. Meanwhile, Wilson requested and received funds in the final 1916 appropriations bill to provide for 500,000 troops. It also included a five-year Navy plan for major construction of battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines—showing Wilson's dedication to a big Navy.|$|E

2500|$|Authorities {{have not}} agreed {{on how the}} notion arose in Greece: {{sometimes}} Pythagoras {{is said to have}} been Pherecydes' pupil, sometimes to have introduced it with the doctrine of Orphism, a Thracian religion that was to be important in the diffusion of reincarnation, or else to have brought the teaching from India.
