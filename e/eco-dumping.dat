40|$|This article {{consists}} of two parts. Firstly, a general introduction poses major constraints of the conceptual processes of globalization and regionalization of the international economy Current and recognition of subtle practices in the neo global market. Secondly, we analyze problems and implications around four points of political-economic: a) proposal for a synthetic notion of "globalization fragmented"; b) a critical view on tools and temptations of protectionism covert industrialized countries to the progressive loss of international competitiveness; c) and d) the content and functionality of certain neo-founded arguments in the phenomena of social dumping and <b>eco-dumping</b> embodied in international trade.

40|$|While {{in the era}} of {{globalization}} a stronger competition among industries yields effi-ciency gains, the international competition for attracting new plants is often accused to favor an <b>eco-dumping.</b> Environmental as well as employment policies are a mat-ter of political majorities. The present paper compares different political systems: in a direct democracy voters are straightforwardly asked for their favored policy, whereas in a representative democracy voters can only opt for a political represen-tative who then, in turn, decides on an appropriate policy at a subsequent stage. As globalization has different impacts on the policy equilibrium {{depending on the type of}} democracy, we are interested in answering the question whether representative democracies seem to be better prepared for the process {{of globalization}} than direct democracies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{environmental}} regulations {{on the international}} competitiveness of domestic industries have become an increasing concern in the trade liberalisation process in the 1990 s. This paper examines the significance of environmental policy for trade. A generalised GNP function, which incorporates both technology changes and increasing returns to scale is set up and a flexible translog function form is used to approximate this generalised GNP function. Seemingly unrelated regression is employed to estimate a system of sectoral share equations derived from the generalised GNP function. The basic hypothesis {{is that while the}} environmental factor is not a significant determinant of the international competitiveness of environmentally sensitive industries, technology is. The result supports this hypothesis and suggests that socalled <b>eco-dumping</b> is not an effective strategy in this context. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{endogenous}} formation of climate coalitions {{in the tradition of}} the issue-linkage literature. In particular, we propose a preferential free trade agreement on which a climate coalition should be built. The basic idea is that the benefits of free trade provide strong incentives for free riders to join the coalition. As a framework, a multi-stage strategic trade model is used in which a country may discourage greenhouse gas emissions by setting an emissions cap effective on a permit market. In addition, a discriminatory import tariff is imposed on dirty goods. However, at the heart of our approach are the trade privileges granted to coalition members shifting the terms of trade favourably without prodiving incentives towards <b>eco-dumping.</b> As a main result, we find that trade liberalisation is much more effective in building climate coalitions than a single-issue environmental agreement. The parametrical simulation of the model in particular shows that participation in joint emission reduction is higher, consumption patterns are more environmentally friendly, and coalitional welfare is improved. As a policy implication, negotiations on climate treaties and free trade arrangements should be integrated...|$|E
40|$|In recent {{debates on}} trade {{liberalisation}} the concern {{has often been}} expressed that with more competitive international trade governments will be worried that by setting tougher environmental policies than their trading rivals they will put domestic producers at a competitive disadvantage, and in the extreme case this could lead to firms relocating production in other countries. The response by governments to such concerns will be to weaken environmental policies (‘eco-dumping’). In competitive markets such concerns are ill founded, {{but there is a}} small amount of literature which has analysed whether governments will indeed have incentives for <b>eco-dumping</b> in the more relevant case of markets where there are significant scale economies; even here there is no presumption that the outcome will involve <b>eco-dumping.</b> In this paper we extend the analysis of strategic environmental policy and plant location decisions by analysing the location decision of firms in different sectors which are linked through an input-output structure of intermediate production. The reason why we introduce inter-sectoral linkages between firms is that they introduce an additional factor, relative to those already analysed in the literature, in the plant location decision, which is the incentive for firms in different sectors to agglomerate in a single location. This has a number of important effects. First, there is now the possibility of multiple equilibria in location decisions of firms. Following from this there is the possibility of catastrophic effects where a small increase in an environmental tax can trigger the collapse of an industrial base in a country; however there is also the possibility that a country which raises its environmental tax could attract more firms to locate in that country, {{because of the way the}} tax affects incentives for agglomeration. Finally, and again related to the previous effects, there is the possibility of a hysteresis effect where raising an environmental tax in one country can cause firms to relocate to another country, but subsequently lowering that tax will not induce firms to relocate back into the original country. We consider a simple model with two countries, two industries, an upstream and a downstream sector, and two firms per industry. The analysis proceeds through a three-stage game: in the first stage the governments of the two countries set their environmental policies; in the second stage the firms in both industries choose how many plants to locate and where; in the third stage firms choose their output levels, with the demand for the upstream firms being determined endogenously by the production decisions of the downstream firms. We assume that there are no limits to production capacity, so that firms do not build more than one plant in any country. However, firms may build plants in different countries because of positive transport costs. Although the model appears very simple, it cannot be solved analytically, so all the conclusions must be drawn from numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|I address {{environmental}} issues {{of trade and}} investment liberalization. In the first chapter, I adopt a political-economy approach with special-interest groups cum electoral competition to endogenize environmental policy when voters have some equity ownership in polluting firms. The political-economy approach is motivated {{by the fact that}} the environment is a commonly cited topic in election competition, and environmental policy is jointly determined by the lobby behavior of environmentalists and industrialists. In the equilibrium, among all local producer groups, only the producer group which has the largest total private ownership makes its campaign contribution and becomes politically active. When there is no abatement opportunity, key determinants of the environmental policy are the transboundary nature of pollution, the level of pollution disutility, trade barriers, foreign environmental policy, the number of firms in the politically active producer group, and equity ownership structures of polluting firms. Results when there is an abatement opportunity with abatement costs failing on fixed costs or marginal costs are also shown. For both the developed country (the source country of international investments) and the developing country (the recipient country of international investments), environmental consequences of increased trade liberalization, increased inward (or outward) international investments, increased public ownership of pollution-intensive firms, and increased local equity participation requirement imposed on multinationals are presented. ^ In the second and third chapter, I adopt a framework featuring vertical connection between polluting sectors. This framework is motivated by prevailing industry characteristics such as chains of production and different vertical connections between upstream and downstream sectors in pollution-intensive industries like petrochemical and chemical industries. The key determinants of <b>eco-dumping</b> possibility in free-trade economies are whether the upstream market is segmented or integrated, types of vertical connections between upstream and downstream segments, the output ratio in vertically-related segments, and the difference in marginal profits in two segments. ...|$|E
