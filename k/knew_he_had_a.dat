5|$|Laís Bodanzky {{read the}} biographical book Canto dos Malditos by Austregésilo Carrano Bueno {{for the first}} time in 1996, when she was signed to assist with the {{direction}} of a documentary on the subject. She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; he was close to giving up until he read and was touched by Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book.|$|E
25|$|These {{performances}} {{caught the}} attention of Harry Jenkins, the Tasmanian-based recruiting scout for Richmond. Acting on Jenkins' recommendation, club secretary Graeme Richmond flew to the island state to watch Hart in action, but he missed seeing Hart play. Nevertheless, Richmond was prepared to sign Hart sight unseen. Hart's mother warned that he would need suitable clothing to wear to work, which he didn't have. Richmond countered by offering the youngster a suit and six shirts, then posted papers to the Hart household, which were readily signed. At a time when untried players were asking VFL clubs for large signing on fees, Richmond <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bargain. Aged 17, Hart crossed Bass Strait determined to develop his precocious talent, which was unusual; most Tasmania players played a number of seasons in the local competition before crossing to Victoria as mature age recruits.|$|E
500|$|Sam Waley-Cohen (Oscar Time, 2nd): [...] "The {{plan was}} always {{to come with}} one smooth run. We <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> huge jump in him so I {{was just trying to}} get him to pop a little bit and save and not get too keen. He did {{everything}} I asked of him." ...|$|E

60|$|It was spoken lightly; {{because the}} man was serious, but Vane <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> ally who would support him with unflinching staunchness.|$|R

500|$|Despite Jerkens's {{reputation}} as the [...] "Giant Killer," [...] Secretariat's stunning loss can possibly {{be attributed to a}} viral infection, which caused a low-grade fever and diarrhea. [...] "I was learning then that anything could happen in horse racing", said Chenery. [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> low-grade infection. But we decided he was strong enough to win anyway, and we were wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Lastly, {{the court}} {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the admissions were voluntary because Thomas <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> right to silence, because he did not have any practical opportunity to exercise the right. The court concluded that the trial judge had made an error by separating the interview from the circumstances, and that in the circumstances Thomas had no real choice whether to answer questions: [...] "Even the threat 'Confess or be tortured' can be said to involve a choice, and a chance that torture may not be applied. But it could never be regarded as a free choice in the relevant sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> power of strength that I have never felt before..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1976, Ted was {{planting}} {{trees on}} his apple farm {{when one of}} his neighbor's kids mentioned that he and his friends were buying women's magazines to get pictures of a then-unknown blond beauty, Farrah Fawcett. [...] Ted <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good lead and quickly made the arrangements to get a shoot with Fawcett. [...] Ted wanted a bikini shot, but Fawcett instead used a one-piece red swimsuit to hide a large scar on her stomach. [...] The poster, with Fawcett's right nipple protruding very visibly through the swimsuit material, was released around {{the same time as the}} TV series starring Fawcett Charlie's Angels aired. [...] The swimsuit poster with the visible nipple pointed outward, the first time such a thing occurred in the USA on a poster, went on to sell millions of copies - unheard of in the poster business - and it became known as the [...] "Farrah Phenomenon" [...] which propelled Pro Arts into a multimillion-dollar company.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's beastly unfair," [...] said Stalky, [...] "when I {{took all}} the trouble to pawn it. Beetle never <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> watch. Oh, I say, Rabbits-Eggs gave me a lift into Bideford this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a horse thief, and we {{are going}} to take him to our camp," [...] {{answered}} Tucker, somewhat uneasily, for he had seen Pawnee Brown before and <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> man of strong character with whom to deal.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> bad head," [...] and he {{made the}} confused, {{wavering}} sign of the hand which signifies crazy or foolish, and the mother rose and went away sobbing.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Allan the Fair doesn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> namesake. And Allan the Dark {{has kept}} the secret from {{everybody}} but the Somersetshire clergyman (whose discretion he can depend on) and myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> daughter, but I reckon {{you must}} be her. And now, if it ain't botherin' you too much, I'd sure be obliged if you'd show me the way out." ...|$|R
60|$|At length, by merest accident, {{we found}} {{ourselves}} {{in the vicinity of}} old John's little house. I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good well, and so we went in to get a drink, for our ham and biscuits had made us very thirsty.|$|E
60|$|The Trackless listened gravely, but he {{expressed}} neither assent or dissent. I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> respect for both {{my father and}} myself; but it was asking {{a great deal of}} him to credit that the world was round; nor did he understand how one could be turned over in the manner Jaap pretended.|$|E
60|$|It struck me, if I {{could get}} Marble to attempt practising {{a sort of}} ruse, it would have the effect to prevent his resorting to club-law, towards which I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong natural disposition, and of which I was still a little afraid. With this object, then, I {{conceived}} the following scheme.|$|E
6000|$|Mattawa {{looked up}} at Gordon with a grin. [...] "If {{you want to do}} some drilling, you can start right now," [...] he remarked. [...] "Guess Nasmyth doesn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> back on him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] remarked Uncle John, [...] "if we'd <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance, we wouldn't {{have worried}} so {{because we were}} held up. In fact, if we'd <b>known</b> <b>he</b> would get well, we needn't have gone at all." ...|$|R
50|$|Ford never married, had no children, and was {{considered}} decidedly eccentric, although his eccentricity {{was said to be}} more prominent when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> audience; <b>he</b> was also fond of slightly surrealist practical joking >.|$|R
60|$|She let Mrs. Bolton {{go to the}} door, and she did {{not rise}} to meet the doctor; she saw from his smile that he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> moral rather than a {{physical}} trouble to deal with, but she did not relax the severity of her glare in sympathy, as she was tempted from some infinite remoteness to do.|$|E
6000|$|My master, {{in a few}} words, made me a very gracious reply; {{allowed me}} the space of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag, my fellow-servant (for so, at this distance, I may presume to call him), to follow my instruction; because I told my master, “that his help would be sufficient, and I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{tenderness}} for me.” ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} before Aleck came in to dress. It was late and he was in a hurry, for he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> rival, a man named Jim Johnson, and he did not want Johnson to get to the widow's home ahead of him. He washed up and donned his {{clothing}} with rapidity, and never noticed that anything was wrong with the coat.|$|E
5000|$|... ‘I said, [...] "Like yours," [...] and he said, [...] "No, no, no, an Irish accent." [...] I {{realized}} <b>he</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> Irish accent, {{and that}} was the music he heard in his head.’" ...|$|R
60|$|And so {{the plans}} {{went out to}} the builders, and in a little while Kipps was {{committed}} to two thousand five hundred pounds worth of building. But then, you <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> income of twelve hundred a year.|$|R
60|$|BARBARA. I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> soul to be saved. Let {{him come}} down here; and I'll {{do my best}} to help him to his salvation. But he wants to send his cheque down to buy us, and go on being as wicked as ever.|$|R
60|$|The Publican durst not {{be his own}} mediator, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> blemish, and was infirm, and {{therefore}} he stands back; for {{he knew that it}} was none of him that his God had chosen to come near unto him, to offer the fat and the blood. (Eze 44:13-15) The Publican therefore was thus far right: he took not up the room himself, neither with his person, nor his performances, but stood back, and gave place to the high priest that was to be intercessor.|$|E
60|$|Challoner {{was silent}} {{for a minute or two}} while Clarke smoked impassively. The former <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{determined}} man to deal with and believed moreover that he had spoken the truth. Still, the fellow, although in some respects to be pitied, was obviously a dangerous rascal, embittered and robbed of all scruples by injustice. There was something malignant in his face that testified against him, and, worse than all, he had come there resolved to extort money as the price of his connivance in a wrong.|$|E
6000|$|The Publican durst not {{be his own}} mediator; he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> blemish, and was infirm, and {{therefore}} he stands back; for {{he knew that it}} was none of him that his God had chosen to come near unto him, to offer [...] "the fat and the blood;" [...] Ezek. xliv. 13-15. The Publican, therefore, was thus far right; he took not up the room himself, neither with his person nor his performances, but stood back, and gave place to the High-priest that was to be intercessor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't able to {{send him}} to school to-day," [...] {{continued}} the woman, with a false grace of manner. [...] "He came home last night so ill--he was violently sick--I thought I should have to send for the doctor.--You <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> weak heart." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{deal with}} Fox, Titus wanted [...] "Dad is Dead" [...] {{to be the}} pilot.
