Especially important for Vainio had been the song Kauan sitten ("Long Ago") which he had recorded in the early 1970s. Vainio's most important collaborator during his last years was producer Jaakko Salo.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> revealed, {{and one of}} his officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism {{is expressed}} in his anti-natalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him {{over the loss of}} a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E

5|$|Bauer {{concludes that}} Brand was a courageous {{man who had}} passionately wanted to help the Jewish people, but <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> plagued after the mission by suspicion, {{including}} from {{other members of the}} Aid and Rescue Committee, because of his failure to return to Budapest. After the British released him, he joined the Stern Gang, who were fighting to remove the British from Palestine. He and Hansi Brand lived {{for the rest of their}} lives in Israel, at first moving to the Givat Brenner kibbutz, then Tel Aviv, with their two sons.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 to remove his remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The remains were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. <b>His</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Buckles joined actor Gary Sinise in 2007 {{to lead a}} Memorial Day parade, {{and that}} evening <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> {{featured}} on NBC Nightly News. With the death of 108-year-old Harry Richard Landis in February 2008, Buckles became the last surviving American veteran of World War I. The following month, he met with United States President George W. Bush at the White House. The same day, he attended {{the opening of a}} Pentagon exhibit featuring photos of nine centenarian World War I veterans, with Defense Secretary Robert Gates in attendance. That summer, he visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|Chodkiewicz was not {{particularly}} involved {{in the politics of}} the Commonwealth, although his high office and wealth gave him significant influence; for the most part he used his political influence, and base of support in Lithuania, to gather support for his military plans, increased the size of the army, and personal gratifications. <b>His</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> dominated by warfare, if not on the front lines, then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the Radziwiłł family and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough taxes to support the army he wanted.|$|E
5|$|Honorius died on 30 September 653, {{the last}} of the Gregorian missionaries. He was buried at the Church of St. Augustine's in Canterbury. He was later revered as a saint, with his feast day being 30 September. His relics were {{translated}} to a new tomb in 1091, and around that same time a haigiography of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> written by Goscelin.

It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He {{developed}} dementia, {{and became}} completely blind and increasingly deaf. He {{was incapable of}} knowing or understanding either that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818. At Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, {{and for the last}} few weeks of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> unable to walk. He died at Windsor Castle at 8:38pm on 29 January 1820, six days {{after the death of his}} fourth son, the Duke of Kent. His favourite son, Frederick, Duke of York, was with him.

He became sicker, and the {{attending}} physician warned that <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters.
