Water samples collected from tubewells in the affected places contained arsenic above the normal level (10 microgram a litre as specified by the World Health Organisation). The affected blocks include Basanti.|$|E
500|$|The racial {{situations}} {{in the play}} provoke thoughts of how hard {{it must have been}} to be black in the South. In the dialogue, some of the blacks are called [...] "niggers" [...] by the white characters in the story. (Contrary to what is sometimes thought, black slavery is not depicted in the play; U.S. slavery was abolished by 1865, and the story runs from the 1880s to the late 1920s.) At first, it <b>is</b> <b>shocking</b> to believe they are allowed to use a word that negative at all in a play... But in the context in which it is used, it is appropriate due to the impact it makes. It reinforces how much of a derogatory term [...] "nigger" [...] was then and still is today.|$|E
500|$|Colby Hall of Mediaite {{called the}} {{sequence}} [...] "a jaw-dropping critique of global corporate licensing, worker exploitation and over-the-top dreariness of how western media companies (in this case, 20th Century Fox) {{takes advantage of}} outsourced labor in developing countries." [...] Melissa Bell of The Washington Post felt Banksy's titles had helped revive The Simpsons [...] "edge", but after [...] "the jarring opening, the show went back to its regular routine of guest cameos, self-referential jokes and tangential story lines." [...] Marlow Riley of MTV wrote [...] "as satire, [...] a bit over-the-top. What <b>is</b> <b>shocking</b> is that Fox ran Banksy's ballsy critique of outsourcing, The Simpsons, and the standards and human rights conditions that people in first world nations accept. It's uncomfortable and dark, and not what's expected from the modern Simpsons, which mainly consists of 'Homer hurts himself' jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|Due {{in part to}} her {{appearance}} in the episode, Edwards was shortlisted for WalesOnline's [...] "Daffta" [...] award for best actress, but lost in the public vote to Eve Myles. For Hallowe'en 2014, ezine Den of Geek listed [...] "31 scary TV episodes that truly terrified us". Phoebe-Jane Boyd selected [...] "The Harrowing", commenting on its divergence from previous episodes of Inside No. 9 and the clash of humour and horror tropes. Describing the character of Andras, she explained that [...] "Seeing him jerkily moving towards [...] with glee, hissing 'mischief'...' straight into camera, <b>is</b> <b>shocking,</b> unexpected, and above all, just horrible." [...] "The Harrowing", particularly its final scene, was selected as Empire Online's 17th greatest television moment of 2014. [...] "Though there are dark laughs in the episode", it was claimed on the website, [...] "the ending is pure nightmare fodder, the babysitter helpless as a Castiel-possessed man advances, hissing, 'Mischief!' Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, we both salute you and request you contribute to our therapy bills".|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a B+. The review stated that [...] "untangling this web of shifting allegiances and identities requires intense concentration. Hang on, though; the payoff's worth it". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, noting that it was [...] "X-Files in top form". He praised how the character of Samantha Mulder was presented, saying that [...] "In the seasons to come, {{we end up with}} enough Samantha's [...] to fill a clown-car, but here, the reveal <b>is</b> <b>shocking,</b> effective, and unsettling"; and also felt that the episode's flashforward cold open was particularly well-handled. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, wrote that [...] "Colony" [...] presents a moral dilemma for the characters, noting that [...] "on the surface Mulder's quest appears righteous, however, the results of his quest would suggest otherwise", and adding [...] "generally the ideology that focuses on a single life's (be that human or alien) importance is successful, whereas Mulder's ideology of finding the truth at all costs is not". Duchovny's portrayal of Fox Mulder in this episode has been cited {{as an example of the}} character's reversal of traditional gender roles—his openness and vulnerability when confronted with what he believes is his prodigal sister casts him [...] "in a pattern typically engendered as female." ...|$|E
500|$|Rousseau's unknown fate in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{was heavily}} {{discussed}} among critics. [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{felt that the}} relationship between Rousseau and Alex after their reunion remained unexplored, which made Rousseau's death a wasted opportunity for a powerful death scene. BuddyTV's Don Williams believed that Rousseau would survive, mainly because he had been waiting to see her flashback for four seasons, and thought her death would ensure it would not happen. Dan Compora from SyFy Portal was disappointed in her death scene, noting, [...] "I wasn't shocked to see Danielle get killed, but the scene felt like it was tossed in just in case this had to serve as the season finale." [...] Compora felt that Rousseau deserved more screen time in the episode leading up to her death. [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman described it as [...] "a rude and lazy {{way to get rid of}} Rousseau". John Kubicek, also of BuddyTV, found her death scene unsatisfactory, commenting, [...] "Then we have that entirely tacked on scene at the end which felt so artificial, like I accidentally flipped over to a different show. While I agree Danielle Rousseau being shot with an arrow <b>is</b> <b>shocking,</b> is this really what the show has come to? Arbitrarily putting a recurring character's life in peril to pose as a cliffhanger?" ...|$|E

500|$|Marco Pérez (who plays Andrade in the film) {{referred}} to Espinosa's performance as [...] "a fascinating freshness", praising her musical {{training for the}} role and her attention to detail, further detailing that [...] "it {{would have been easy}} to create a sensationalized, one-dimensional portrait of Gloria, but Sofía goes behind the public persona {{to the heart of the}} woman". The film premiered in Mexico on January 1, 2015, as it was distributed by Universal Pictures with about 1,000 copies. Espinosa and Pérez received positive reviews for their performances from Jessica Oliva of Cine Premiere magazine, who stated that the actors [...] "seem to blend in with their characters. Sofía Espinosa stands out with her voice (singing all the songs), and her physical interpretation and charisma, while Marco Pérez, Sergio Andrade, manages to embody the duality of that genius of the industry, perverse and visionary at the same time". Sofía Ochoa Rodríguez and Verónica Sánchez of En Filme were [...] "surprised by [...] performance" [...] as it was [...] "very close to Gloria Trevi's, albeit with a nasally accent, and cadence which lets through the hoarse, sarcastic and melancholic style that permeates on every one of the songs the actress sings. Her acting work and physical resemblance let her move naturally from comedy to pain, loneliness to longing, to the easy smile, to the dance, to the jumps on stage and the twinkle in her eyes". In contrast, David Noh of Film Journal International was not impressed by Espinosa's acting, saying that she [...] "lacks appeal and is quite ordinary in a role that calls for some of the electricity the very young Jennifer Lopez managed to ratchet up in her musical biopic, Selena". Gloria Trevi praised the work of Espinosa in the film, stating that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>shocking</b> to see yourself on film, the girl [...] did an extraordinary job". Espinosa won the Diosa de Plata and the Ariel Award for Best Actress for Gloria.|$|E

2500|$|According to Ethan Haimo, {{understanding}} of Schoenberg's twelve-tone {{work has been}} difficult to achieve owing in part to the [...] "truly revolutionary nature" [...] of his new system, misinformation disseminated by some early writers about the system's [...] "rules" [...] and [...] "exceptions" [...] that bear [...] "little relation to the most significant features of Schoenberg's music", the composer's secretiveness, and the widespread unavailability of his sketches and manuscripts until the late 1970s. During his life, he was [...] "subjected to a range of criticism and abuse that <b>is</b> <b>shocking</b> even in hindsight" [...]|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Loevy was {{embarked}} on four major projects. The first of these was The Child Dreams (1994), an adaptation of a new play (1993) by noted Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin. The play itself was a remarkable achievement, inspired originally by the saga of the Saint Louis, but transformed over time into an [...] "operatic" [...] metaphor about death {{and the loss of}} faith in messianic redemption that transcends any historical setting. In the words of theater critic Michael Handelzaltz, [...] "It is a moving play, evoking compassion and identification. It <b>is</b> <b>shocking,</b> farcical, warped, grotesque, and amazing." ...|$|E

Judging another contest he wrote how, upon recital, there must be 'allure (en) and profundity (yūgen)... an aura of its own that hovers about the poem much as a veil of haze among cherry blossoms, the belling of a stag before the autumn moon, the scent of springtime in the plum blossom, or the autumn rain in the crimson leaves upon the peak'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} its fruit {{have made the}} tree well known. [...] This fruit is a globular berry, with variation {{in the number of}} seeds, sometimes with eight and sometimes without any. [...] It bears at its apex the remnants of the styles and sits in the enlarged and persistent calyx. [...] It ripens in late autumn, is pale orange with a red cheek, often covered with a slight glaucous bloom. [...] One joke among Southerners is to induce strangers to taste unripe persimmon fruit, as its very astringent bitterness <b>is</b> <b>shocking</b> to those unfamiliar with it. [...] Folklore states that frost is required to make it edible, but fully ripened fruit lightly shaken from the tree or found on the ground below the tree is sweet, juicy and delicious. [...] The peculiar astringency of the fruit is due to the presence of a tannin similar to that of Cinchona. [...] The seeds were used as buttons during the American Civil War.|$|E

We know {{that the government of}} President Musharraf will find itself under enormous pressure to go after the culprits and keep the country calm and stable, but Amnesty International calls on President Musharraf – and on the security forces – to exercise restraint and uphold the rule of law. The killing of Benazir Bhutto must not be allowed to become a setback to civilian governance or indeed lead to a further crackdown on civil liberties." [...] AI United States Government Relations Director Alex Arriaga said: [...] "Pakistan is at a dangerous crossroads. If it cannot rely on an independent judiciary, some of the most dangerous aspects of martial law will become enshrined in its legal and political system, leaving the people’s human rights in the balance. The United States government must press its ally, which has used the 'War on Terror' to justify its actions, {{and put an end to}} this slippery slope. Without these steps, the Bush administration will further acquiesce that fundamental rights can be denied, and those who oppose Musharraf are likely to face intimidation – or even death." ...|$|E
