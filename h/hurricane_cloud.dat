Upper-level easterly vertical wind shear limited {{the amount of the}} initial strengthening. However, an increase in convective banding led to its upgrade to Tropical Storm Boris on June 4, 500 mi southwest of Manzanillo. Further strengthening occurred due to an anticyclone aloft fostered additional development, and by June 5, Boris became a hurricane.

Strengthening continued, and the storm reached its peak strength with winds of 90 mph and a minimum central pressure of [...] The <b>hurricane's</b> <b>cloud</b> pattern became elongated along a southwest-northeast axis on June 6 due to an increased amount of vertical wind shear. Boris was downgraded to a tropical storm later in the day on June 6. The deep convection of the tropical storm decreased, as Boris moved over cooler waters.

While the other children have agreed to the separation Tāwhirimātea, the god of storms and winds, is angered that the parents have been torn apart. He cannot bear to hear the cries of his parents nor see the tears of Ranginui as they are parted, he promises his siblings that from henceforth {{they will have to}} deal with his anger. He flies off to join Rangi and there carefully fosters his own many offspring who include the winds, one of whom is sent to each quarter of the compass. To fight his brothers, Tāwhirimātea gathers an army of his children - winds and clouds of different kinds, including fierce squalls, whirlwinds, gloomy thick <b>clouds,</b> fiery <b>clouds,</b> <b>hurricane</b> <b>clouds</b> and thunderstorm clouds, and rain, mists and fog. As these winds show their might the dust flies and the great forest trees of Tāne are smashed under the attack and fall to the ground, food for decay and for insects (Grey 1956:3-6, Tregear 1891:54, Biggs 1966:448-449).Then Tāwhirimātea attacks the oceans and huge waves rise, whirlpools form, and Tangaroa, the god of the sea, flees in panic. Punga, a son of Tangaroa, has two children, Ikatere father of fish, and Tu-te-wehiwehi (or Tu-te-wanawana) the ancestor of reptiles. Terrified by Tāwhirimātea’s onslaught the fish seek shelter in the sea and the reptiles in the forests. Ever since Tangaroa has been angry with Tāne for giving refuge to his runaway children. So it is that Tāne supplies the descendants of Tūmatauenga with canoes, fishhooks and nets to catch the descendants of Tangaroa. Tangaroa retaliates by swamping canoes and sweeping away houses, land and trees that are washed out to sea in floods (Grey 1971:5-6).|$|R

40|$|Many natural {{phenomena}} can be nicely represented by concepts of moving regions. For example, <b>hurricanes,</b> rain <b>clouds,</b> pollution zones, etc., change shape and position over time. Current models of moving regions {{have proven to}} be difficult to translate effectively to implementation for two reasons: i) algorithms for operations, such as intersection, are difficult to implement, and ii) creating in-stances of moving regions from data sources is difficult. In this paper, we create a new model of moving regions at the abstract, discrete, and implementation levels that overcome the difficulties of previous models. The CMR model focuses moving region rep-resentation at temporal instants, allowing the model to focus on temporally static regions; thus, algorithms for data collection and operations can be implemented using largely 2 -dimensional algo-rithms, which are well understood. The result is a model that aligns well with data collection techniques, can be implemented easily, and allows complex movement patterns to be easily depicted. 1...|$|R

Before TRMM, no data set exists that can show globally and definitively the presence of these hot towers in cyclone systems. Aircraft radar studies of individual storms lack global coverage.

40|$|Cloud flare-ups {{along the}} inner eye {{wall of a}} {{hurricane}} lead to enhancement of cloud scale divergence, which in turn leads to a large local enhancement of the departure from balance laws {{and can lead to}} local supergradient winds. This scenario is tested using the results from a mesoscale microphysical model at horizontal resolution of 1. 33 &#x 2009;km for the simulation of hurricane Katrina. Rainwater mixing ratio tags growing cloud elements. The departure from balance laws includes terms such as the local, horizontal and vertical advections of divergence, divergence square and a term invoking the gradient of vertical velocity. It is noted that these terms collectively contribute to a substantial local enhancement of the departure from balance laws. Departures from balance laws are related to the radial gradient wind imbalances in a storm-centred coordinate. In this study, several examples, from the hurricane Katrina simulations, that display this scenario of rapid intensification are illustrated.

It developed a well-defined eye, prompting the NHC to estimate peak winds of 120 mph; this made it the fifth major hurricane season of the season. However, increasing southwesterly wind shear quickly imparted weakening, causing the eye to deteriorate by early on October 16. Shortly thereafter, the NHC reported that Paul {{was no longer a}} major hurricane. During the afternoon hours of October 17, Paul was downgraded to a tropical depression, and hours later, the storm was declared a remnant low. The remnant low of Hurricane Paul persisted for another day, before dissipating on October 18.

40|$|Mineral {{dust and}} ice cloud {{observations}} from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) {{are used to}} assess the relationships between desert dust aerosols and ice clouds over the tropical Atlantic Ocean during the <b>hurricane</b> season 2008. <b>Cloud</b> property histograms are first adjusted for varying cloud top temperature or ice water path distributions with a Bayesian approach to account for meteorological constraints on the cloud variables. Then, histogram differences between dust load classes are used to describe the impact of dust load on cloud property statistics. The analysis of the histogram differences shows that ice crystal sizes are reduced with increasing aerosol load and ice cloud optical depth and ice water path are increased. The distributions of all three variables broaden and get less skewed in dusty environments. For ice crystal size the significant bimodality is reduced and the order of peaks is reversed. Moreover, it is shown that not only are distributions of ice cloud variables simply shifted linearly but also variance, skewness, and complexity of the cloud variable distributions are significantly affected. This implies that the whole cloud variable distributions have to be considered for indirect aerosol effects in any application for climate modelling...|$|R
