5|$|Like other abelisaurids, Majungasaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} {{with a short}} snout. Although the forelimbs are {{not completely}} known, they were very short, while the hind limbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very rough texture and thickened bone {{on the top of}} its snout, and the single rounded <b>horn</b> <b>on</b> the roof of its skull, which was originally mistaken for the dome of a pachycephalosaur. It also had more teeth in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the city proper begins around 660 BCE, when Greek {{settlers}} from Megara established Byzantium on the European side of the Bosphorus. The settlers built an acropolis adjacent to the Golden <b>Horn</b> <b>on</b> {{the site of the}} early Thracian settlements, fueling the nascent city's economy. The city experienced a brief period of Persian rule {{at the turn of the}} 5th century BCE, but the Greeks recaptured it during the Greco-Persian Wars. Byzantium then continued as part of the Athenian League and its successor, the Second Athenian Empire, before gaining independence in 355 BCE. Long allied with the Romans, Byzantium officially became a part of the Roman Empire in 73 CE. Byzantium's decision to side with the Roman usurper Pescennius Niger against Emperor Septimius Severus cost it dearly; by the time it surrendered at the end of 195 CE, two years of siege had left the city devastated. Five years later, Severus began to rebuild Byzantium, and the city regained—and, by some accounts, surpassed—its previous prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} {{meant that}} Trentham Hall, Leveson-Gower's estate in Staffordshire, became Horn's new residence. There, he met {{and fell in}} love with Diana Dupont, the French tutor of Leveson-Gower's daughters. The two married on 28 September 1785, and subsequently moved to London, where Dupont gave birth to the couple's first child, Charles Edward <b>Horn,</b> <b>on</b> 21 June 1786. Horn published his first composition, Six Sonatas for the Piano, Violin, and Violoncello (Op. 1), earlier that year in May. Subscribers to the work included such luminaries as Muzio Clementi, Johann Peter Salomon, George IV (then the Prince of Wales), and Lady Caroline Waldegrave. The latter introduced Horn to Queen Charlotte, who appointed him as her personal music tutor; he instructed the Queen twice a week from 20 October 1789 to 9 October 1793. While in her service, he maintained two homes, one in London and the other in Windsor. He was also engaged from June 1789 to October 1812 to teach music to the royal princesses. During his employment in the royal household, he composed a set of three Sonatas (Op. 2), which he dedicated to the Queen.|$|E

5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the <b>horn</b> <b>on</b> his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts from the beginning. To truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this boss is defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the {{schooner}} Isaiah K. Stetsen sank off {{the coast}} of Massachusetts during a storm. Mess Attendant First Class Arthur J. Flores and Seaman John E. Gomez, assigned to USRC Acushnet, volunteered to save survivors of the schooner and were awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for their heroism. That same year, USRC Algonquin, which was stationed in the Caribbean, set sail with fifteen Hispanic-Americans (a fourth of the cutter's complement) to San Juan, Puerto Rico to assist the Puerto Ricans battling fires that threatened to destroy parts of that city. In 1915, the City of San Juan, Puerto Rico, paid tribute to the crew of the cutter Algonquin and presented them with an Official Resolution of Thanks. The Coast Guard was already formed by September 1918, with the merger of United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Life-Saving Service, when Seaman Richard E. Cordova became the first Hispanic Coast Guardsman to perish in a military conflict when his cutter, the USCGC Tampa, was torpedoed and sunk with all its crew by a German U-Boat during World War I. The Coast Guard can be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. Boatswains Mate First Class Pablo Valent and Surfman Indalecio Lopez, members of the Texas Brazos Life-Saving Station crew were awarded the Coast Guard Silver Lifesaving Medal and The Grand Cross Medal from the American Cross of Honor Society for their assistance in the rescue of the crew of the schooner Cape <b>Horn</b> <b>on</b> September 16, 1919. In 1935, Chief Boatswains Mate Pablo Valent was given command of the Port Isabel (Texas) Boat Station, becoming the first Hispanic-American to do so.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for Burley's account, and more likely, is that the boat they found was from the H Fölsch & Co, Hamburg's 899 ton barque Iquique. She went missing after being spoken with at Cape <b>Horn</b> <b>on</b> 1 June 1883. There were 30 crew on board.|$|E
25|$|The other {{caterpillars}} in {{this size}} range are almost universally Sphingidae, which are seldom hairy {{and tend to}} have diagonal stripes on their sides. Many Sphingidae caterpillars bear a single curved <b>horn</b> <b>on</b> their hind end. These are actually not dangerous, but large-haired caterpillars should generally not be touched except by experts.|$|E

25|$|Montanoceratops was {{a typical}} {{primitive}} ceratopsian in many respects, distinguished from the later species {{by the presence of}} claws, rather than hooves, and by having teeth in its upper jaw, rather than a toothless beak.

25|$|The salute {{was carried}} out with Queen Mary {{replying}} with her one working air horn in response to Queen Mary 2 sounding her combination of two brand new horns and an original 1934 Queen Mary <b>horn</b> (<b>on</b> loan from the City of Long Beach). Queen Mary originally had three whistles tuned to 55Hz, a frequency chosen because it was low enough that the extremely loud sound of {{it would not be}} painful to human ears.|$|E

25|$|The {{ornamental}} purse-lid, {{covering a}} lost leather pouch, {{hung from the}} waist-belt. The lid consists of a kidney-shaped cellwork frame enclosing a sheet of <b>horn,</b> <b>on</b> which were mounted pairs of exquisite garnet cellwork plaques depicting birds, wolves devouring men (or the ancient motif of the Master of Animals), geometric motifs and a double panel showing animals with interlaced extremities. The maker derived these images from the ornament of the Swedish-style helmets and shield-mounts. In his work they are transferred into the cellwork medium with dazzling technical and artistic virtuosity.|$|E
25|$|The yard had {{a square}} plan, and was {{inspired}} by the impluvium of a Roman house. Its first order was constituted by two arched porticoes with doric columns, and the second and the third made up with two open galleries surmounted by an architrave. This was born by ionic columns, and was adorned with the coats of arms of the Alicorni (a silver unicorn with a golden <b>horn</b> <b>on</b> a green field) sculptured on the small pilasters of the balustrade at the first floor ("piano nobile"), and on the corinthian pilasters at the second floor.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{despite some}} probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under Suleiman Baltoghlu could {{not enter the}} Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had {{previously}} stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden <b>Horn,</b> <b>on</b> 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened {{the morale of the}} defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan. Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.|$|E

25|$|In {{general the}} skull is rather flat, its height being {{less than three}} times its length, which cannot be exactly {{determined}} because the praemaxillae are lacking. The maxilla, which has a long front branch, bears fourteen teeth, as can be deduced from the tooth sockets: the teeth themselves have been lost. There is a small maxillary fenestra, which does not reach {{the edge of the}} antorbital depression and is located behind a promaxillary fenestra. The lacrimal bone has a distinctive rounded <b>horn</b> <b>on</b> top. The lower branch of the postorbital bone is transversely wide. The jugal bone is short and deep and pneumatised.|$|E
25|$|The Temple Mount, {{where the}} Foundation Stone is located, is thought by {{commentators}} of the Qur'an {{to be the}} place to which Muhammad traveled in the Night Journey. Although the Qur'an does not specifically mention Jerusalem in name as the ascension site, labelling the site as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Hadith, the recorded sayings of Muhammad, specify that the site is indeed the Foundation Stone in Jerusalem. According to Islamic belief, angels visited the site 2,000 years before the creation of Adam. It is also {{thought to be the}} place where Israfil, the angel of the trumpet, will sound his <b>horn</b> <b>on</b> Resurrection Day.|$|E
25|$|Nasutoceratops {{also shows}} a unique {{combination}} of traits {{that are in}} themselves not unique. The <b>horn</b> <b>on</b> the nose is low and narrow, with an elongated base. The squamosal has a high ridge on its upper surface, running {{from the direction of}} the eye socket towards the squamosal rim. The skull frill is more or less circular with its widest point at the middle edge. The osteoderms on the frill edge, the epiparietals and episquamosals, do not have the form of spikes but are shaped like simple low crescents. The rear frill edge is not notched but instead has an epiparietal on the midline.|$|E
