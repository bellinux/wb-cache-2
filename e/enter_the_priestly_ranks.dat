50|$|In 1982 Shinsō Itō (born 1942 as Masako Itō), {{the third}} {{daughter}} of Shinjō and Tomoji, completed her Buddhist training {{and became a}} successor in the Shinnyo dharma lineage. Shinjō announced her to become his successor in 1983 and gives her <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> name 'Shinsō'. A ceremony to confirm this dharma succession was held at Daigo-ji monastery on April 24, 1984. After Shinjō's passing on July 19, 1989 Shinsō Itō becomes the head of Shinnyo-en. In 1992, Shinsō Itō was conferred Daisōjo, <b>the</b> highest <b>priestly</b> <b>rank</b> in traditional Shingon Buddhism, by the Daigo-ji Shingon Buddhist monastery.

2500|$|Ignacia felt {{strongly}} against the Spanish law that prohibited native Filipinos from <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> or religious life. The Spanish Mother Jerónima de la Asunción opened the first convent in the Philippines in 1621 but Filipinas {{could not be}} admitted. In hopes of changing this racially structured ecclesiastical limitation, Ignacia began to live alone in a vacant house {{at the back of}} the Colegio Jesuita de Manila, the Jesuit headquarters. She led a life of public prayer and labour which attracted other Filipino laywomen to live with her. She accepted them into her company and, though they were not officially recognised as a religious institute at the time, together they became known as the Beatas de la Virgen María (English: [...] "Religious of the Virgin Mary") living at the Beatería de la Compañía de Jesús (English: [...] "Convent of the Society of Jesus"). [...] For their chapel they used the old San Ignacio Church (destroyed in the Second World War) and the Jesuit priests were their spiritual directors.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code of Exodus, {{instead of}} the Molten Sea is {{described}} a bronze laver, which was to rest on a bronze foot (presumably just meaning a stand). In a later part of <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code, in <b>the</b> passage describing the actual creation of the Temple furniture, the text explains that this laver was {{to be used for}} the Israelite priests to wash their hands and feet when they <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary.|$|R

50|$|Sixteen of Eleazar's {{descendants}} {{were selected}} to head priestly orders while only eight of Ithamar's descendants were so chosen. The passage states that this was done because of the greater number of leaders among Eleazar's descendants. Lots were drawn to designate the order of ministering for the heads of <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> orders when they <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> temple in Jerusalem. Each order was responsible for ministering during a different week and shabbat, and were stationed as a watch at the Tabernacle. All of the orders were present during biblical festivals. See also Kohen. Their duties involved offering the daily and Jewish holy day sacrifices (korbanot in Hebrew), and blessing the people in a ceremony known as nesiat kapayim ("raising of the hands"), the ceremony of <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Blessing.|$|R

50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code, Deuteronomy is only {{remotely}} related, {{according to}} textual criticism, {{and there are}} certainly no verbal parallels. Some of the institutions and observances codified in <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code are indeed mentioned, mainly burnt-offerings, peace-offerings, heave-offerings, the distinction between clean and unclean, and rules about leprosy. However, they are destitute of the central significance {{with which they are}} placed in <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code.|$|R

25|$|Although such {{scholars}} {{speculate that}} the deuteronomist is a later author than <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> source, scholars believe {{that much of the}} Deuteronomic Code was a reaction against the regulations introduced by <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code, and that here it reflects the earlier situation. In the Book of Ezekiel, which some scholars believe predates <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code, meaning that according to their view <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code must post-date the Babylonian Exile, there is no mention whatever of a tithe appointed for the Levites, and in the Deuteronomic Code, though Levites have a share of the ma'aser sheni, their share is seemingly voluntary, and it can alternatively be given to strangers, widows, and/or paternal orphans; in <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code, however, donation of the tithe to the Levites is compulsory. Of course, if the ma'aser sheni tithe, also mentioned in Leviticus, were originally different from ma'aser rishon, there is a simpler explanation for the variation.|$|R
50|$|It is termed <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code due to {{its large}} concern with ritual and the Jewish priesthood, and also, in {{critical}} scholarship, it {{is defined as the}} whole of the law code believed to be present in <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Source except for the Holiness Code. Under the documentary hypothesis, while some scholars believe that <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Code was created to rival the Ethical Decalogue and Covenant Code, others believe was intended as only supplementary to the Holiness Code.|$|R
40|$|The article with Leviticus 11 {{and with}} some {{of the ways in which}} it has been used in the ecotheological. Leviticus 11 is part of <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> text and Priestly {{theology}} has mostly been criticised for its legalism and ritualism as well as for its stifling of spontaneity. Recently our understanding of <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> worldview has vastly improved and scholars tend to show more appreciation of <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> cosmology, where Israel finds its place amongst other nations, but where there is also a place for animals in relation to humanity. The well-known Torah scholar Jacob Milgrom has insisted for more than forty years that there is an ethical system of “reverence for life” behind these laws. And the anthropologist Mary Douglas has argued that a respect for animal life is part and parcel of <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> world-view and is clearly expressed in <b>the</b> <b>priestly</b> sacrificial system.

50|$|It {{was said}} that Bagoas became very wealthy by confiscating the sacred {{writings}} of the Egyptian temples and giving {{them back to the}} priests for large bribes (Diod. XVI. 51).

50|$|Some textual {{scholars}} {{regard the}} two accounts as {{different versions of}} the same events at Meribah, with the version in the Book of Exodus being from the JE source, and the version in the Book of Numbers being from <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Source; <b>the</b> latter account, like <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Source in general, is considered to be an attempt to supplant the JE version of the narrative, which doesn't treat Aaron as being as important as the Aaronid writer of <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> Source would have liked.|$|R

50|$|The entire book of Leviticus is {{composed}} of Priestly literature. Most scholars see chapters 1-16 (<b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> code) and chapters 17-26 (the Holiness code) {{as the work of}} two related schools, but while the Holiness material employs the same technical terms as <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> code, it broadens their meaning from pure ritual to the theological and moral, turning the ritual of <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> code into a model for the relationship of Israel to God: as the tabernacle is made holy by the presence of the Lord and kept apart from uncleanliness, so He will dwell among Israel when Israel is purified (made holy) and separated from other peoples. The ritual instructions in <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> code apparently grew from priests giving instruction and answering questions about ritual matters; the Holiness code (or H) used to be regarded as a separate document later incorporated into Leviticus, but it seems better to think of the Holiness authors as editors who worked with <b>the</b> <b>Priestly</b> code and actually produced Leviticus as we now have it.|$|R
