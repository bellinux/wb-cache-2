25|$|The {{equations}} included here describe {{sediment transport}} for clastic, or granular sediment. They {{do not work}} for clays and muds because these types of floccular sediments do not fit the geometric simplifications <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>equations,</b> and also interact thorough electrostatic forces. The equations were also designed for fluvial sediment transport of particles carried along in a liquid flow, such as that in a river, canal, or other open channel.|$|E
25|$|The reduced mass of {{the system}} <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>equations</b> {{is close to the}} mass of a single {{electron}}, but differs from it by a small amount about equal to the ratio of {{mass of the}} electron to the atomic nucleus. For hydrogen, this amount is about 1837/1836, or 1.000545, and for deuterium it is even smaller: 3671/3670, or 1.0002725. The energies of spectroscopic lines for deuterium and light hydrogen (hydrogen-1) therefore differ by the ratios of these two numbers, which is 1.000272. The wavelengths of all deuterium spectroscopic lines are shorter than the corresponding lines of light hydrogen, by a factor of 1.000272. In astronomical observation, this corresponds to a blue Doppler shift of 0.000272 times the speed of light, or 81.6km/s.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{characteristic}} speed U and sound speed are essentially the same, {{it can be}} rewritten as the second equation. This equation has the same structure as the one for the point monopole shown above.

Here the cavity is excited by an annular jet which oscillates symmetrically around the sharp edges of the cavity. It appears to be a circular version of the edge tone (discussed below) in which the symmetry of the otherwise dipole source of the edge tone is converted to a monopole source.|$|E
