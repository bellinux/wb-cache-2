40|$|Abstract Trimming {{procedures}} {{are an important}} part of the sequence analysis pipeline inan EST Sequencing Project. In <b>general,</b> <b>trimming</b> is done in several phases, each one detecting and removing some kind of undesirable artifact, such as low quality sequence,vectors or adapters sequence, and contamination. However, this strategy often results in a phase being unable to recognize its target because part of it was removed during aprevious phase. To remedy this drawback, we propose a new strategy, where each phase detects but does not remove its target, leaving this decision to a post processing stepoccurring after all phases. Our tests show that this strategy can significantly improve the detection of artifacts. 1 Introduction EST Sequencing Projects are developed with the objective of quickly obtain the gene index of an organism. The gene index is the list of the genes that exist in the genome of the organism. An EST (Expressed Sequence Tag [1]) is a complementary DNA (cDNA), that is a copy of an mRNA molecule. When we sequence a cDNA we obtain the nucleotide sequence of a gene that exists in the genome and was expressed by the cell...|$|E

40|$|Many {{estimation}} methods of truncated and censored regression models {{such as the}} maximum likelihood and symmetrically censored least squares (SCLS) are sensitive to outliers and data contamination as we document. Therefore, we propose a semipara- metric <b>general</b> <b>trimmed</b> estimator (GTE) of truncated and censored regression, which is highly robust and relatively imprecise. To improve its performance, we also propose data-adaptive and one-step trimmed estimators. We derive the robust and asymptotic properties of all proposed estimators and show that the one-step estimators (e. g., one-step SCLS) are as robust as GTE and are asymptotically equivalent to the original estimator (e. g., SCLS). The infinite-sample properties of existing and proposed estimators are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. ...|$|R

The work we present here utilises the 2 D parameter space {{on which the}} trim curves are defined whose projection on the parametrically represented PDE surface is then trimmed out.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} unicycle and rider, with a uniquely realistic tyre force and moment representation, is set up {{with the aid of}} multibody modelling software. The rider’s upper body is joined to the lower body through a spherical joint, so that wheel, yaw, pitch and roll torques are available for control. The rider’s bandwidth is restricted by low-pass filters. The linear equations describing small perturbations from a straight-running state are shown, which equations derive from a parallel derivation yielding the same eigenvalues as obtained from the first method. A nonlinear simulation model and the linear model for small perturbations from a <b>general</b> <b>trim</b> (or dynamic equilibrium) state are constructed. The linear model is used to reveal the stability properties for the uncontrolled machine and rider near to straight running, and for the derivation of optimal controls. These controls minimize a cost function made up of tracking errors and control efforts. Optimal controls for near-straight-running conditions, with left/right symmetry, and more complex ones for cornering trims are included. Frequency responses of some closed-loop systems, from the former class, demonstrate excellent path-tracking qualities within bandwidth and amplitude limits. Controls are installed for path-following trials. Lane-change and clothoid manoeuvres are simulated, demonstrating good-quality tracking of longitudinal and lateral demands. Pitch torque control is little used by the rider, while yaw and roll torques are complementary, with the former being more useful in transients, while the latter has value also in steady states. Wheel torque is influential on lateral control in turning. Adaptive control by gain switching is used to enable clothoid tracking up to lateral accelerations greater than 1 m s− 2. General control of the motions of a virtual or robotic unicycle will be possible through the addition of more comprehensive adaptation to the control scheme described...|$|R

40|$|Trim defines {{conditions}} for both design and analysis based on aircraft models. In fact, we often define these analysis points more broadly than the conditions normally associated with trim conditions to facilitate that analysis or design. In simulations, these analysis points establish initial conditions comparable to flight conditions.

Linear models are typically derived at trim points. Control systems are designed and evaluated at points defined by trim conditions. And these trim conditions provide us a starting point for comparing one model against another, one implementation of a model against another implementation of the same model, and the model to flight-derived data.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the binding mechanism of TRIM 5 to retrovirus capsid, we had previously selected N-tropic murine leu-kemia virus (N-MLV) mutants escaping from rhesus macaque TRIM 5 (rhTRIM 5) by passaging the virus in rhTRIM 5 -ex-pressing cells and selecting for nonrestricted variants. To test the commonality of {{the findings from the}} rhTRIM 5 study, we have now employed a similar genetic approach using human TRIM 5 (huTRIM 5). Consistent with the rhTRIM 5 study, the mapped huTRIM 5 escape mutations were distributed across the capsid exterior, confirming the extended binding surface be-tween virus and restriction factor. Compared to the results of the previous study, fewer escape mutations were identified, with particular mutants being repeatedly selected. Three out four huTRIM 5 escape variants showed resistance to all primate TRIM 5 s tested, but two of them sacrificed viral fitness, observations that were not made in the rhTRIM 5 study. Moreover, differences in amino acid changes associated with escape from hu- and rhTRIM 5 s suggested a charge dependence of the restric-tion by different TRIM 5 s.

40|$|Instead of formulating {{the state}} {{space of a}} quantum field theory over one big Hilbert space, it has been {{proposed}} by Kijowski [Kijowski 1977] to represent quantum states as projective families of density matrices over a collection of smaller, simpler Hilbert spaces. One can thus bypass the need to select a vacuum state for the theory, and still be provided with an explicit and constructive description of the quantum state space, at least {{as long as the}} label set indexing the projective structure is countable. Because uncountable label sets are much less practical in this context, we develop in the present article a <b>general</b> procedure to <b>trim</b> an originally uncountable label set down to countable cardinality. In particular, we investigate how to perform this tightening of the label set in a way that preserves both the physical content of the algebra of observables and its symmetries. This work is notably motivated by applications to the holonomy-flux algebra underlying Loop Quantum Gravity. Building on earlier work by Okolow [arXiv: 1304. 6330], a projective state space was introduced for this algebra in [arXiv: 1411. 3592]. However, the non-trivial structure of the holonomy-flux algebra prevents the construction of satisfactory semi-classical states. Implementing the general procedure just mentioned {{in the case of a}} one-dimensional version of this algebra, we show how a discrete subalgebra can be extracted without destroying universality nor diffeomorphism invariance.

40|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is {{a method}} of statistical inference which combines two sources of information, prior information and data, into the posterior distribution. It is widely applied in different areas and {{has the advantage of}} being "data driven". This dissertation develops Bayesian statistical models in complex design surveys and women’s reproductive study. Highly disproportional sample designs have large weights, which can introduce undesirable variability in estimates of population statistics. Previous work developed Bayesian "weight smoothing" or "weight pooling" models to produce <b>general</b> model-based weight <b>trimming</b> estimators of population statistics, but application has been limited to the context of stratified and post-stratified sample designs. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we extend "weight smoothing" estimators to a more general class of complex sample designs that include multi-stage cluster samples and/or strata that "cross" the weight strata. As women mature, menstrual cycles typically begin to decline slowly in length and stabilize until a point at which the hormone cycles begin to break down, leading to a rapid increase in variability and a concomitant increase in cycle length until the onset of menopause. In order to study the structure of menstrual cycle lengths, we build a Bayesian change point model for the mean and variability of cycle lengths for data from the TREMIN cohort, a 70 -year long longitudinal study of multiple cohorts of women’s reproductive life. This Bayesian hierarchical model summarizes the cycle length profiles at both a subject and population level. We integrate multiple imputation in our Bayesian estimation procedure to deal with different forms of missingness. Based on results from this analysis, menstrual patterns are classified into subgroups using a K-medoids algorithm. We then relate these subgroups to age of menopause, age at menarche, number of births, as well as to existing standard menopausal transition markers. Our results suggest mean and variance changepoints, which are identified using data throughout women’s late reproductive life, provide more comprehensive information about menopausal transition than previously defined transition markers...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation is to explore the physics behind the waterjet/hull interaction, {{and in particular the}} negative thrust deduction often reported in the semi-planing speed range. Another objective is to propose a validated numerical technique for computing the hydrodynamics of waterjet-driven hulls. The parameters that {{play a role in the}} waterjet/hull interaction are split into global effects (i. e. sinkage and trim variations) and local effects (other effects caused by the intake suction) and each are addressed individually in this thesis. Investigation of these parameters is carried out in two different ways. First, assuming the flow to be potential flow, an algorithm is developed for modelling the water/hull interaction. Then, in the second part of the thesis, a technique employing a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver is employed for modelling the flow and understanding the interaction effects. The algorithm used in the first part is called the Pressure Jump Method in this thesis. This method is based on the equilibrium condition that the resistance forces are balanced by the thrust force created by the head increase through the waterjet pump. The Pressure Jump Method is coupled with a potential flow solver capable of non-linear free-surface modelling. Validation and verification of the method are accomplished by comparing the computational results with experimental data available from a test case. The resistance increment of the hull is also estimated using the Pressure Jump Method and the dominant parameters, which contribute to the thrust deduction, are determined. <b>General</b> sinkage and <b>trim</b> changes between the bare hull and the self-propelled hull are also estimated by approximating the waterjet- propelled hull as a flat plate with a rectangular hole representing the intake opening. In the second part of the thesis, a technique using a RANS solver with a Volume of Fluid (VOF) free-surface representation combined with a body force representation of the pump is developed and validated against measurements. Using the results of this technique, the thrust deduction fraction is studied in detail from very low to high speeds. It is revealed that, in the lower speed range, the transom clearance plays an important role in the behaviour of the thrust deduction fraction. Therefore, the transom clearance phenomenon is studied in detail. The reasons for the waterjet-driven hull resistance increment are identified through studying the hydrostatic and the hydrodynamic pressure resistance as well as the frictional resistance variations over the entire speed range. The difference between the net thrust and the gross thrust of the waterjet system, which has been a controversial issue, is also studied in this thesis and it is seen that this difference may well be the reason for the negative thrust deduction. Other issues investigated in the thesis are the shape of the capture area and the streamtube within which all water going into the intake is contained, the importance of the velocity profile at the intake and exit, the pressure distribution at the exit and the diameter and position of the vena-contracta...|$|R
