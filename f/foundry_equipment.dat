5000|$|There is no {{metallurgical}} {{standard for}} pot metal. Common metals in pot metal include zinc, lead, copper, tin, magnesium, aluminium, iron, and cadmium. The primary advantage of pot metal {{is that it}} is quick and easy to cast. Because of its low melting temperature, it requires no sophisticated <b>foundry</b> <b>equipment</b> or specialized molds. Manufacturers sometimes use it to experiment with molds and ideas (e.g., prototypes) before casting final products in a higher quality alloy.|$|E

50|$|Model {{engineers}} typically make models by machining {{working parts}} from stock metal and metal castings. Some models are intended as utilitarian working models, others as highly meticulous display models, or sometimes {{a combination of}} both. The most elaborate models involve hand manufacture of thousands of parts, taking thousands of hours to complete, often {{over a number of}} years or even decades. The model engineer is often guided by commercially available drawings, however some draw their own designs, or even work without drawings. Similarly, most model engineers will buy castings when required, but some buy or make <b>foundry</b> <b>equipment</b> to cast metal themselves.|$|E

50|$|Heugh died in 1867 and his {{business}} interests were acquired by George Grant Allan who became a partner of David Thom, though Allan's ownership was not established until 1871. Their <b>foundry</b> fabricated mining <b>equipment,</b> stamp mills, and mining tools. By 1868, it employed approximately 150 men. There were machine shops and boiler works. The works, driven by a 60 horse power steam engine, consumed 1800 tons of pig iron, 300 tons of wrought iron, and 700 tons of coal. In one month of 1872, the North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company made a $30,000 purchase.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper Fullface Italic (1929) Cooper {{designed}} a matching italic for Cooper Fullface, {{but it was}} never released.

It is unfortunate, as the accompanying italic is perhaps Cooper’s masterpiece, a lively Bodoni-esque italic with more than a bit of influence from 19th Century display types, particularly in the treatment of the ball serifs on the uppercase “A”, “J”, “M”, and “N”. Cooper Fullface Italic stood as the missing bookend to Cooper’s career as a type designer for over a half-century. A digital version based on Cooper's original drawings was released by the Wordshape Type Foundry in 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{powerhouse}} is {{a rectangular}} brick {{building with a}} gabled concrete roof supported by riveted steel Fink trusses. The end walls are five bays wide with stepped parapets at the gables. Original window openings have been bricked in. Side elevations are three bays wide, also with infilled window openings. The structure sits on a concrete foundation that incorporates outflow works. The main room in the powerhouse accommodates a Pelton wheel turbine and a 2300 volt generator made by Western Electric, together with a small 125VDC exciter generator. The main generator was rewound during upgrade work in the 1940s. The turbine room is served by a 20-ton traveling crane made by the Whiting <b>Foundry</b> <b>Equipment</b> Company. Three other rooms house batteries, a workshop, and a third room formerly housed switchgear.|$|E
5000|$|The EBT {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} a complete, {{original}} railroad rather than a collection of pieces from various locations, as most tourist railroads are. All six of the [...] narrow gauge steam locomotives that operated on the railroad in its last years as a coal hauler are still on site, and some are used for the excursion trains. Other original equipment includes a [...] switcher steam locomotive (non-operational), operating track-gang cars, the M-3 motorcar (built from scratch by the EBT with an engine and transmission from an automobile), and the M-1, a motorcar (doodlebug) based on scaled-down J. G. Brill and Company plans built by the EBT in 1927. The majority of rolling stock that operated on the railroad in its later coal-hauling years remains on the property in varying condition, including over a dozen flatcars, several boxcars and well over 150 hoppers. Tourist trains use original EBT passenger equipment, as well as converted EBT freight cars. The original railroad maintenance shops have a pair of Babcock & Wilcox boilers, a 19th-century stationary steam engine, and an overhead line shaft system (steel shafts, wood and iron pulleys and leather and canvas belts) that powers antique machine tools, sheet-forming machines, <b>foundry</b> <b>equipment,</b> blacksmithing tools and woodworking machines. Most all 33 mi of the railroad's original main 30 mile line is still in place, though only 5 mi are currently used. In recent years disused trackage from Rockhill Furnace southward and Robertsdale southward have been cleared and gauged for use with speeders and handcars (track-gang cars).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Performance of a direct-reading handy {{equipment}} for dust counting in workroom air, PDR (MIE, USA), was field-tested {{in comparison with}} the results of low-volume air samplinggravimetry. Application in 64 workplaces of various type dust work with dust concentrations of up to 1. 6 mg/m 3 showed that the agreement was generally good with a correlation coefficient (r) > 0. 64. The calculated regression line had a slope close to one, and the intercept on the axis was next to nil, suggesting that the measurement with PDR is essentially the same with that by low-volume air sampling. Further analysis by types of dust work disclosed that the correlation was best when examined in 12 foundries with r as large as 0. 95. In contrast, r was small (0. 52) in 11 welding workplaces, possibly due to smaller particle size of dust generated during welding.

40|$|Raw oil {{extracted}} from Nigerian variety of water melon seed {{was used as}} sole binder for foundry sand cores. Specimens were characterized for foundry properties that included baked tensile, green and baked compressive strengths; baked collapsibility, green permeability, bulk density and shatter index to determine {{the efficacy of the}} oil in the absence of additives for core application.

Cores bonded with the oil were unsuitable for classes I and II iron/steel and non ferrous castings including copper, aluminium and magnesium alloy due to the poor baked tensile strength and collapsibility values.

40|$|The {{project was}} to design, manufacture, and test a {{tabletop}} die cast system {{to be used as}} lab equipment in MET 257 – Casting Processes. The motivation for this project was the MET 257 – Casting Processes instructor’s desire to physically demonstrate the die casting process, but they were unable to find a system that would meet all of their requirements.
