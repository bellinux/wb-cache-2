40|$|In this study, an {{electrical}} immersion heater {{mounted on a}} water tank has been investigated. Themain aim was to reduce heat transfer and to utilize the maximum energy available from heater toheat the water. To observe the effects of essential geometrical and operating parameters on thesystem performance, different computational test cases were run for three different designs. In the first case of simulation, the immersion heater of existing design mounted on a water tankhas been analyzed. The cold-water tank with inlet and outlet and given appropriate boundaryconditions was used to see the temperature contours inside the water tank and temperature of theimmersion layer itself. In the second case, an insulation plate has been introduced in the immersion heater head in orderto reduce heat loss by considering the possible heat leakage through the gap inside the heaterhead by radiation. In the third case, an <b>insulation</b> <b>ring</b> has been introduced in the immersion heater head as asubstitute for the insulation plate which has the same aim as second case. The results obtained from the CFD simulation shows the thermal performance of immersionheater in a water tank for three different cases. The results are helpful in optimizing both heatingelement and immersion heater by introducing different changes to optimize the design. It showsthat the redesigned immersion heater and storage tank can provide improved working conditions. Also, at early design stages, CFD simulations {{could be used as}} an effective tool to optimizethermal storage tank parameters, so it may add value to the storage tank and immersion heaterperformance and efficiency, by optimizing the whole thermal heating system design and size. Different materials and geometry design are tested giving the minimum heat losses from thesystem and uniform temperature distribution in the water heater...|$|E

50|$|In {{many high}} voltage {{applications}} corona is an unwanted side effect. Corona discharge from high voltage {{electric power transmission}} lines constitutes an economically significant waste of energy for utilities. In high voltage equipment like televisions, radio transmitters, X-ray machines and particle accelerators the current leakage caused by coronas can constitute an unwanted load on the circuit. In air, coronas generate gases such as ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO), and in turn nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and thus nitric acid (HNO3) if water vapor is present. These gases are corrosive and can degrade and embrittle nearby materials, and are also toxic to people. Corona discharges can often be suppressed by improved <b>insulation,</b> corona <b>rings,</b> and making high voltage electrodes in smooth rounded shapes. However, controlled corona discharges are used {{in a variety of}} processes such as air filtration, photocopiers and ozone generators.|$|R
40|$|In the article, its co-authors assess {{different}} {{options of}} application of chrysolitecement pipes {{in hot water}} supply networks either in combination with or instead of steel pipes. The co-authors have proven expedient application of chrysolite-cement pipes both {{in the event of}} trenchless pipe laying, and in cases of other pipe laying methods, especially in rural areas. Permanent loads, including weight and soil pressure (q), own weight of pipes, ownrp. weight of the heat carrier, influence of temperature and humidity of the heat carrier, andinternal pressure were considered in the research into the properties and installation conditions of chrysolite-cement pipes. The research findings have proven that chrysolitecement pipelines demonstrate a 35 – 50 % safety factor in the event of subterranean trenchless pipe laying at the depth of. 8 + meters, depending on the pipe diameter, types and consistency of the soil, and traffic intensity of the motor road above the pipeline. Analysis of temperature fields of a chrysolite-cement pipeline demonstrates that chrysolite-cement pipes can be laid using a simplified thermal insulation pattern due to their low heat conductivity, if the pipe wall is sufficiently thick. Boiler ash widely available in rural areas can be used for insulation purposes, or, alternatively, no thermal insulation can be used. Any works associated with the laying of pressurized chrysolite-cement pipelines are to comply with all design-related requirements. The works pre-construction assignments, excavation works, delivery, visual examination and installation of pipeline elements, thermal insulation of pipes, pipeline strength and tightness testing, thermal <b>insulation</b> of <b>ring</b> joints. Any pipes and joints are to be thoroughly examined and tested. Arrangement of hot water supply networks made of chrysolite-cement pipes is efficient in terms of their steel consumption rate, labour resources consumption rate, capex and reduced costs. The bigger the pipe diameter, the higher the efficiency of hot water supply networks made of chrysolite-cement pipes.
