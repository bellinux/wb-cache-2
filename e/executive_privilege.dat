The White House {{maintained that the}} U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other {{senior members of the}} Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of <b>executive</b> <b>privilege.</b> Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged {{in a number of}} conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> regarding its refusal to turn over documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E
25|$|Historically, two doctrines {{concerning}} {{executive power}} have developed that enable {{the president to}} exercise executive power {{with a degree of}} autonomy. The first is <b>executive</b> <b>privilege,</b> which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, , that <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Bill Clinton attempted to use <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, , that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.|$|E

5000|$|Yoo {{suggested}} {{that since the}} primary task of the President {{during a time of}} war is protecting U.S. citizens, the President has inherent authority to subordinate independent government agencies, and plenary power to use force abroad. Yoo contends that the Congressional check on Presidential war-making power comes from its power of the purse. He says that the President, and not the Congress or courts, has sole authority to interpret international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions [...] "because treaty interpretation is a key feature of the conduct of foreign affairs". His positions on executive power are controversial because the theory can be interpreted as holding that the President's war powers afford him <b>executive</b> <b>privileges</b> which exceed the bounds which other scholars associate with the President's war powers.|$|R

25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain <b>executive</b> <b>privileges.</b> Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|R

40|$|Parliaments risk {{becoming}} the main losers of internationalisation; {{a process that}} <b>privileges</b> <b>executives</b> and experts. Still, parliamentarians have developed a range of responses {{to catch up with}} international decision-making: they coordinate their actions with other parliamentarians; engage in international parliamentary forums; and some even opt to pursue political careers at the supranational level, such as in the European Parliament. This volume provides a thorough empirical examination of how an internationalising context drives parliamentarians to engage in inter-parliamentary coordination; how it affects their power positions vis-à-vis executive actors; among themselves; and in society in general. Furthermore, building upon these empirical insights, the book assesses whether parliamentary democracy can remain sustainable under these changing conditions. Indeed, if parliaments are, and remain, central to our understanding of modern democracy, it is of crucial importance to track their responses to internationalisation, the fragmentation of political sovereignty, and the proliferation of multilevel politics...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Communication. To understand the role of mediated messages in organizational socialization, this study analyzes the constructions of class and gender in popular business advice books (BABs). The books are used as training tools in many organizations, so to understand the role of BABs in indoctrinating employees into organizational culture, this study asks the following research questions. What are the ideological messages regarding work and organizing within BABs? What do the ideological messages of BABs reveal about power in organizing? In what ways to BABs gender the workplace? One function of BABs is to articulate norms that institutionally reproduce capitalist modes of work. Thus BABs serve as tools for organizational indoctrination and larger scale social control. Analysis finds these BABs construct ideal, submissive, and compliant employees by diagnosing unruly employees as psychologically dysfunctional and subsequently prescribing therapeutic cures that align individual interests with those of the organization. By focusing the reader on the inner psychological-self, the books diffuse resentment towards <b>executive</b> class <b>privilege.</b> This study concludes that BABs serve to sell readers on socio-economic class stratification by constructing professional middle class norms for work and personal life. Specifically the books construct perceptions of choice, norms of success and failure, attitudes towards education and money, and a spiritual faith in American corporations. Consequently, the books de-politicize by feminizing the professional middle class...|$|R

25|$|The {{issue of}} access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in United States v. Nixon, the Court ruled {{unanimously}} (8 to 0) that claims of <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice William Rehnquist—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the winter}} months Nixon {{continued}} to deflect accusations of wrongdoing and vowed {{that he would be}} vindicated. Meanwhile, in the courts and in Congress, developments continued to propel the unfolding saga toward a climax. On March 1, a grand jury indicted seven former administration officials for conspiring to hinder the investigation of the Watergate burglary. The grand jury, it was disclosed later, also named Nixon as an unindicted conspirator. In April the House Judiciary Committee voted to subpoena tapes of 42 presidential conversations, and the special prosecutor subpoenaed more tapes and documents as well. The White House refused both subpoenas, citing <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> once more.|$|E

This relatively brief book is divided into chapters that highlight the various areas where the protection of individual rights have been at issue throughout U. S. history. Chapters include the Rights of Blacks (Chapter 3), The Rights of Women (Chapter 4), The Rights of Children (Chapter 5), Protecting Religious Liberty (Chapter 6) and The Rights of Native Americans (Chapter 6). Each chapter traces the history of some of the most significant issues in our nation’s past, using brief explanations of significant Supreme Court cases and instances where the exercise of Presidential power failed to protect individuals and highlighting when Congress exercised or attempted to exercise its political will to protect those rights...|$|R

500|$|There was a {{temporary}} {{lull in the}} Jay Treaty furor after Washington signed it on August 24. The following year, however, it flared up again, when the House of Representatives inserted itself into the debate. This time the fight was not only over {{the merits of the}} treaty, but also about whether the House had the power under the Constitution to refuse to appropriate the money necessary for a treaty already ratified by the Senate and signed by the president. Citing its constitutional fiscal authority (Article I, Section 7), the House requested that the president turn over all documents that related to the treaty, including his instructions to Jay, all correspondence, and all other documents relating to the treaty negotiations. He refused to do so, invoking what later became known as <b>executive</b> <b>privilege,</b> and insisted that the House did not have the Constitutional authority to block treaties. A contentious debate ensued, during which, Washington's most vehement opponents in the House {{went so far as to}} publicly call for his impeachment. Through it all, Washington responded to his critics by using his prestige, political skills, and the power of office in a sincere and straightforward fashion to broaden public support for his stance. On April 30, the House voted 51–48 to approve the requisite treaty funding. Jeffersonians carried their campaign against the treaty and [...] "pro-British Federalist policies" [...] into the political campaigns (both state and federal) of 1796, where the political divisions marking the First Party System became crystallized.|$|E
500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both <b>executive</b> <b>privilege</b> and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E

2500|$|Burr's 1807 {{conspiracy}} trial {{became a}} national issue. Jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the verdict by telling Congress that Burr's guilt was [...] "beyond question", but the case came before his longtime political foe John Marshall, who dismissed the treason charge. Burr's legal team at one stage subpoenaed Jefferson, but Jefferson refused to testify, making the first argument for <b>executive</b> <b>privilege.</b> Instead, Jefferson provided relevant legal documents. After a three-month trial, the jury found Burr not guilty, while Jefferson denounced his acquittal. Jefferson subsequently removed Wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the U.S. military. Historian James N. Banner criticized Jefferson for continuing to trust Wilkinson, a [...] "faithless plotter".|$|E
2500|$|In May 1973 the Senate {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} the Watergate scandal. The investigation, known as the [...] "Watergate hearings," [...] was televised and widely watched. As the various witnesses gave details, not only of the Watergate break-in, but of various other alleged acts of malfeasance by various administration officials, Nixon's approval rating plummeted. On June 25, Dean named Nixon as having helped to plan the burglary's cover-up, and the following month, White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office. These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox. Nixon refused to release them, citing <b>executive</b> <b>privilege.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Although not {{specifically}} {{mentioned in the}} Constitution, Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate {{and the power to}} compel cooperation with an investigation. The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress's power to legislate. Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it is as broad as Congress's powers to legislate. However, it is also limited to inquiries that are [...] "in aid of the legislative function;" [...] Congress may not [...] "expose for the sake of exposure." [...] It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress's investigation power is the operations of the federal government, but Congress's ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the President or his subordinates is often-discussed and sometimes controversial (see <b>executive</b> <b>privilege),</b> although not often litigated. As a practical matter, the limitation of Congress's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose ("in aid of" [...] its legislative powers) functions as a limit on Congress's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government, without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress, must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers. The courts are highly deferential to Congress's exercise of its investigation powers, however. Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate, and the courts have interpreted Congress's regulatory powers broadly since the Great Depression.|$|E
