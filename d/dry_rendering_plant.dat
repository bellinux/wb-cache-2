40|$|The chemical, {{physical}} and organoleptic characteristics of commercially produced lard {{and the costs}} of producing lard by the open kettle, prime steam and <b>dry</b> <b>rendering</b> methods were examined in this study. It was observed that several factors may be responsible for variations in characteristics of lard and in costs of rendering lard. In general, plants using the open kettle rendering method were small plants operating at small volumes of production and using simple processing techniques. These plants were operated at a fraction of their capacity. The prime steam method of rendering lard was used by plants which produced large quantities of lard, used elaborate processing methods and operated at about 50 percent of their lard <b>rendering</b> capacity. <b>Plants</b> using the <b>dry</b> <b>rendering</b> method operated at about 60 percent of capacity. Their average annual production was somewhat less than that for plants using the prime steam rendering method. Several processing steps were involved in producing lard by the <b>dry</b> <b>rendering</b> method. These variations in volumes of production, complexity of processing procedures and rendering capacities were associated with the methods of rendering the lard considered in this study. Such factors complicate the evaluation of the relationships between methods of rendering, costs of rendering and characteristics of lard produced...|$|R

40|$|A study {{based on}} the literature, an on- farm audit and expert knowledge, was carried out to {{determine}} 1) the risks of spread of animal diseases among farms; 2) odour nuisance due to carcasses at the rendering plant; and 3) measurements to reduce these risks. It was concluded that the possible risks of spread of animal diseases among farms due to the removal of carcasses mainly {{has to do with}} the entrance of the place from where the carcasses are collected by the driver of the truck, the contact of the grab of the haulier with the cadaver container or place and driving with the haulier which is not fully closed. The true size of the risk of spread of disease is unknown and is probably different for each pathogen. Strict hygiene measurements by the driver and farmer can reduce the risk of spread of animal diseases due to cadaver removal. According to the interviewees at the expert assessment session, the odour nuisance at the <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> due to carcasses is mainly caused by bacterial conversion of proteins. Cooling of carcasses contribute to the slowing down of the conversions. No unambigious answer could be obtained as to the cooling temperature: not lower than - 7 °C because of the processing at the <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> and preferably not higher than 5 °C. Frequent removal of carcasses from the farms and a quick handling at the <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> may also reduce odour nuisance at the <b>rendering</b> <b>plant.</b> Risk analyses, pig, carcasses, disposal, spread of disease, odour nuisance, pig farms, <b>rendering</b> <b>plant,</b> Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{occupational}} {{and public health}} guidance does not distinguish between <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> workers and cullers/poultry workers in terms of infection risk in their respective roles during highly pathogenic avian influenza poultry outbreaks. We describe an operational approach to human health risk assessment decision making at a large <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> processing poultry carcasses stemming from two separate highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H 5 N 1) outbreaks in England during 2007. Methods During the first incident a uniform approach assigned equal exposure risk to all rendering workers {{in or near the}} production line. A task based exposure assessment approach was adopted during the second incident based on a hierarchy of occupational activities and potential for infection exposure. Workers assessed as being at risk of infection were offered personal protective equipment; pre-exposure antiviral prophylaxis; seasonal influenza immunisation; hygiene advice; and health monitoring. A repeat survey design was employed to compare the two risk assessment approaches, with allocation of antiviral prophylaxis as the main outcome variable. Results Task based exposure assessment during the second incident reduced the number of workers assessed at risk of infection from 72 to 55 (24 % reduction) when compared to the first incident. No cases of influenza like illness were reported in workers during both incidents. Conclusions Task based exposure assessment informs a proportionate public health response in <b>rendering</b> <b>plant</b> workers during highly pathogenic avian influenza H 5 N 1 outbreaks, and reduces reliance on extensive antiviral prophylaxis. </p...|$|R

50|$|Lard may be {{rendered}} by either of two processes: wet or <b>dry.</b> In wet <b>rendering,</b> pig fat is {{boiled in water}} or steamed at a high temperature and the lard, which is insoluble in water, is skimmed off {{the surface of the}} mixture or separated in an industrial centrifuge. In <b>dry</b> <b>rendering,</b> the fat is exposed to high heat in a pan or oven without the presence of water (a process similar to frying bacon). The two processes yield somewhat differing products. Wet-rendered lard has a more neutral flavor, a lighter color, and a high smoke point. Dry-rendered lard is somewhat more browned in color and flavor and has a lower smoke point. Rendered lard produces an unpleasant smell when mixed with oxygen.|$|R
