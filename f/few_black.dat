5|$|One notable {{section of}} Riverside is Silvertown, a {{subdivision}} developed in 1887 for African Americans. Initially isolated from largely white Riverside to the east, it was eventually {{absorbed into the}} growing neighborhood. As such, Silvertown residents became some of the <b>few</b> <b>black</b> plantation house owners in Riverside through the period of segregation. A few one-story wood-frame houses in the area may date to the original development, including one pantation house owned by a woman and then her daughter from 1887 into the 1980s.|$|E

After originally committing to Kansas State University, he decided to pursue his collegiate career at the historically black school Jackson State University (MS) where his older brother Eddie played football. He was never recruited by the University of Kansas, according to then-coach Don Fambrough as Payton claimed in his autobiography.|$|E

5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its <b>few</b> <b>black</b> officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks {{that came from the}} camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day of}} the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Robinson {{was drafted}} and {{assigned}} to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, <b>few</b> <b>black</b> applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.|$|E
5|$|Small first played cricket in Trinidad for a club of low social status. After {{establishing}} {{himself in}} the Trinidad team, he soon {{made a name for}} himself as a batsman and was one of the <b>few</b> <b>black</b> batsmen in the West Indies team at the time. For Trinidad, he was one of the cricketers instrumental in breaking the dominance of the Barbados cricket team in the Inter-Colonial Tournament. He first played for West Indies in 1912–13 and, after the First World War, was chosen to tour England twice. He was moderately successful on the 1923 tour, but was less effective in 1928. Small played in the middle of the batting order; he bowled either medium-fast or off breaks. He died in 1958.|$|E

5|$|The Green Book was {{published}} locally in New York, but its popularity {{was such that}} from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the United States Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the Green Book's publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946. Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities {{in most of the}} United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were <b>few</b> <b>black</b> residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which– unusual for the oil industry at the time– were franchised to African Americans.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a <b>few</b> <b>black</b> hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E
5|$|ZIPRA leader Joshua Nkomo {{publicly}} {{claimed responsibility}} for shooting down the Hunyani {{in an interview with}} the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though <b>few</b> <b>black</b> Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.|$|E

In Southern states where <b>few</b> <b>blacks</b> voted, Black leaders seized the opportunity to work inside the new federal agencies as social workers and administrators, with an eye to preparing a new generation who would become leaders of grass-roots constituencies that could be mobilized at some future date for civil rights.|$|R
5|$|Constantine {{first went}} to the St Ann's Government School in Port of Spain, then {{attended}} St Ann's Roman Catholic School until 1917. He displayed little enthusiasm for learning and never reached a high academic standard, but showed prowess at several sports and was respected for his cricketing lineage. He played for the school cricket team, which he captained in his last two years, by which time he was developing a reputation as an attacking batsman, a good fast-medium bowler and an excellent fielder. His father prohibited him from playing competitive club cricket until 1920 for fear of premature exposure to top-class opposition while too young; in addition, he first wanted his son to establish a professional career. Upon leaving school Constantine joined Jonathan Ryan, a firm of solicitors in Port of Spain, as a clerk. This was a possible route into the legal profession; however, {{as a member of}} the black lower-middle class, he was unlikely to progress far. <b>Few</b> <b>black</b> Trinidadians at this time became solicitors, and he faced many social restrictions owing to his colour.|$|E
5|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, the {{southern}} African territory of Southern Rhodesia had been a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom for 16 years, having gained responsible government in 1923. It was unique in the British Empire and Commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking dominion status. In practice, it acted as a quasi-dominion, and was treated as such {{in many ways by}} the rest of the Commonwealth. Southern Rhodesia's white population in 1939 was 67,000, a minority of about 5%; the black population was a little over a million, and there were about 10,000 residents of coloured (mixed) or Indian ethnicity. The franchise was non-racial and in theory open to all, contingent on meeting financial and educational qualifications, but in practice very <b>few</b> <b>black</b> citizens were on the electoral roll. The colony's Prime Minister was Godfrey Huggins, a physician and veteran of World War I (1914–18) who had emigrated to Rhodesia from England in 1911 and held office since 1933.|$|E
25|$|The first visual {{adaptation}} of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from Alexandra Palace on 25 January 1949 by the BBC, which starred Russell Napier as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena.

A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.|$|E

25|$|Following the World War II, {{gospel music}} moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate. In 1950, black gospel was {{featured}} at Carnegie Hall when Joe Bostic produced the Negro Gospel and Religious Music Festival. He repeated {{it the next}} year with an expanded list of performing artists, and in 1959 moved to Madison Square Garden. Today, black gospel and white gospel are distinct genres, with distinct audiences. In white gospel, {{there is a large}} Gospel Music Association and a Gospel Music Hall of Fame, which includes a <b>few</b> <b>black</b> artists, such as Mahalia Jackson, but which ignores most black artists. In the black community, James Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America in 1969.|$|E

However, he and Elisabeth settled into an otherwise mundane family life, reconciling with Ian. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Alec held a number of jobs including, from 1991 to 1996, managing director of a professional football team (the Black Aces). Although not an ordained priest, he became a reserve chaplain in the new Zimbabwe National Army. Alec and Elisabeth produced three children - two daughters and one son. Ian Smith's family role as a grandfather offered him some solace after Janet's death in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Another racial {{discrimination}} suit was filed in October 2010 when 30 African American firefighters accused DCFEMS of tolerating a racist work environment. The suit named about 10 white male firefighters who were accused or convicted of crimes — including assault (sometimes with knives), sexual harassment (emailing images of their genitals to female colleagues), illegal {{possession of a}} firearm, public nudity in the firehouse, and stalking — but had not been disciplined. But black firefighters accused or convicted of similar crimes were punished. The lawsuit also alleged that the department purposefully allowed the 2006 promotions list (which had many black candidates on it) to expire so that a 2010 list (which had <b>few</b> <b>black</b> candidates) could be acted on instead. The suit asked for class action status for the department's 1,000 black firefighters.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the plans}} created during {{attempts}} to desegregate the schools of Little Rock was by school superintendent Virgil Blossom.

This original proposal was scrapped and replaced with one that more closely met a set of minimum standards worked out in attorney Richard B. McCulloch's brief. This finalized plan would start in September 1957 and would integrate one high school, Little Rock Central. The second phase of the plan would take place in 1960 and would open up a few junior high schools to a <b>few</b> <b>black</b> children. The final stage would involve limited desegregation of the city's grade schools at an unspecified time, possibly as late as 1963.|$|E
