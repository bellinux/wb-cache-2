25|$|In March 2007, {{the village}} of Kiryas Joel sued the county to stop it from selling off a million gallons (3,780 m³) of excess {{capacity}} at its sewage plant in Harriman. Two years prior, the county had sued the village to stop its plans to tap into New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, arguing that the village's environmental review for the project had inadequately addressed concerns about the additional wastewater it would generate. The village <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> an early ruling which sided with the county.|$|E
25|$|File:Hayden and Dhoni.jpg|Here the batsman {{has played}} a shot and missed, with the wicketkeeper {{receiving}} the ball. The 'keeper, believing that in playing his shot the batsman has ventured beyond his popping crease, has broken the stumps with the ball {{in an attempt to}} dismiss him 'stumped'. He <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to the umpire to review and either accept or refuse the dismissal. It now falls to the umpire to adjudge whether the batsman had indeed ventured beyond his crease, a decision that in modern cricket is assisted by technology and replays.|$|E

25|$|Brewers {{have the}} option of using a liquid (LME) or dry (DME) form of it. Each has its pros and cons, so the choice is {{dependent}} solely on the individual brewer's preferences. Some brewers choose to work only with LME, because they feel it works best for the result they wish to achieve. Also, it requires one fewer processing step, so it <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to those favoring the purest form of product available. However, it is very sticky and, therefore, messier to work with and has a shorter shelf life, and some feel the results are just as good with DME.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015 Adamcik {{gained a}} hearing for post-conviction relief with state Sixth District Magistrate Judge Mitchell W. Brown. He claimed that {{testimony}} from character witnesses could {{have changed the}} outcome of the sentencing, but that his former attorney, against Adamcik's parents' wishes, chose not to call upon these witnesses. Adamcik said that his attorney believed that the prosecution would have submitted even more damaging evidence. In March 2016 Judge Brown denied his request for post-conviction relief. Adamcik <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> Judge Brown's decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. A hearing will be held on November 9, 2017.|$|E
25|$|Appeal in {{a cartoon}} {{character}} corresponds {{to what would}} be called charisma in an actor. A character who <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> is not necessarily sympathetic – villains or monsters can also be appealing – {{the important thing is}} that the viewer feels the character is real and interesting. There are several tricks for making a character connect better with the audience; for likable characters a symmetrical or particularly baby-like face tends to be effective. A complicated or hard to read face will lack appeal, it may more accurately be described as 'captivation' in the composition of the pose, or the character design.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the aquifers could be recharged on geological time scales by a sequence of sublimation of the frozen seeps, atmospheric circulation of the vapor to the southern polar ice cap, redeposition of this onto the cap, basal melting under the ice mass, and groundwater circulation on a global scale. This mechanism <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> as it requires little conjecture about radically different past climate, and fits well with independent theories {{on the origins of}} the martian outflow channels at chaos terrains as major aquifer breaches. However, the hydrostatic head supplied by this mechanism could not feed the numerous channels at elevations greater than the base of the southern polar cap.|$|E
25|$|The {{defense has}} {{obtained}} city records showing that Moore {{was up to}} date in her rent payments. Prosecutors clarified that the dispute was not about the rent but rather a scheme by Bonie to increase those payments by coercing Moore to file false documentation that would have boosted her Section 8 subsidies. To bolster this theory, in late 2015 they subpoenaed the unedited footage from an interview Bonie gave to a local cable channel that had closely covered the case. The cable channel has vigorously opposed giving up the footage to the police. It <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> the judge's decision requiring them to let him review footage and release relevant portions to the police. A month-long trial in July 2016 ended with the jury acquitting Bonie of murder charges but convicting him of the lesser included charge of manslaughter.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 2016, the Pennsylvania Superior Court {{announced}} that it refused to hear Cosby's appeal to have the case dismissed. The court also lifted a temporary stay of the pre-trial hearing and sent the case {{back to the original}} court. At a preliminary hearing on May 24, a judge found that there was enough evidence to proceed with a trial, despite the fact that Constand did not testify, which is allowed under Pennsylvania law. He set a pre-trial hearing for September 6, 2016. Cosby <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> this decision based upon the belief {{they have the right to}} cross examine the accuser. On October 12, 2016 Cosby lost this appeal. The State Supreme Court is set to review the Pennsylvania law in a separate case, Cosby's lead attorney, Brian McMonagle, said that he would try and add Cosby's case to this appeal in hopes of having it thrown out.|$|E

25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|E

McElmeel wrote in An Author a Month (for Nickels), [...] "This {{is an example of}} Hutchins's more realistic drawings and of a reversible text." [...] A reversible text refers to a story which proceeds in the forward direction, and concludes with the protagonist returning to a development introduced at the story's inception. The American Library Association gave Don't Forget the Bacon! favourable mention in its review of the book, [...] "The picture book crowd (kindergarten through second grade) will adore Pat Hutchin's story of a grocery list and a bad memory." [...] In an article for The Washington Post, associate professor and director of the reading clinic at Western Maryland College, Joan Coley, observed that the repetitive nature of the story <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to children.|$|E

500|$|Nicholas Fraser {{writes that}} Evita {{is the perfect}} popular culture icon for our times because her career foreshadowed what, by the late 20th century, had become common. During Evita's time it was {{considered}} scandalous for a former entertainer {{to take part in}} public political life. Her detractors in Argentina had often accused Evita of turning public political life into show business. But by the late 20th century, Fraser claims, the public had become engrossed in the cult of celebrity and public political life had become insignificant. In this regard, Evita was perhaps ahead of her time. Fraser also writes that Evita's story <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to our celebrity-obsessed age because her story confirms one of Hollywood's oldest clichés, the rags to riches story. Reflecting on Eva Perón's popularity {{more than half a century}} after her death, Alma Guillermoprieto writes that, [...] "Evita's life has evidently just begun." ...|$|E
500|$|Angola's Lusa {{reported}} that Portugal, the former coloniser, issued advisories to its citizens {{to stay in}} their homes It also rejected claims of an [...] "untoward" [...] attitude by Angola. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that [...] "the Portuguese government <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> for a halt to the violence and respect for the law." [...] Portas later called for the detained civilian leadership to be released. Defence Minister José Pedro Aguiar-Branco said that the Portuguese military was ready to evacuate its citizens. [...] "It is our responsibility and our job to ensure adequate preparedness in the event that the evacuation be necessary." [...] Portugal also issued a travel warning for its citizens. On 15 April, it was announced that two naval vessels and an aircraft {{were on their way to}} somewhere in West Africa ready for a possible evacuation of 4,000–5,000 Portuguese citizens. On 1 October, Portugal's UN Ambassador José Filipe Moraes Cabral echoed the statement of Angola at the same meeting.|$|E
500|$|The third {{reason the}} product was brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding LTO products; instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it instead would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Chicken Fries were part of that goal, with the re-introduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older products <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product by allowing a company to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain already which is already established to deliver the product ingredients. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] product the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations.|$|E

500|$|The song {{attracted}} widespread praise {{by music}} critics, {{many of whom}} ranked it among West's best songs. [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal compared elements of the song to the rock band The Strokes, and stated that it contained {{some of the best}} lyrics ever written by West. Dan Vidal of URB largely praised the track, writing that it was an excellent song overall, though wrote that [...] "in my personal opinion, I don’t really think Kid Cudi can sing; and I’m not sure why his generally off-key caterwauling <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to people, but here it’s hypnotically on point – matching perfectly with the track’s imposing tone." [...] MTV wrote that the song featured West at his most boastful lyrically, musing that [...] "while his lyrics are razor sharp, the production here is softer, resulting in a melodic finger wag to his naysayers rather than searing jabs." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters praised the performance by West on the song but felt that neither guest appearance ultimately left much of an impression. On the other hand, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman felt that both Cudi and Raekwon fit perfectly on the guitar-driven track.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "progressive" [...] {{refers to}} {{the wide range of}} {{attempts}} to break with standard pop music formulas through extended instrumentation, personalized lyrics, and individual improvisation. The premise involved popular music that was created with the intention of listening, not dancing, and opposed the influence of managers, agents, or record companies. Progressive music was also mainly produced by the performing artists themselves. In 1970, a journalist at UK publication, Melody Maker, described progressive pop as music made that <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to the masses, but less disposable than the [...] "six weeks in the charts and the 'forget it' music of older pop forms." [...] Some stylistic features include changes in key and rhythm or experiments with larger forms. In terms of tonal structure, progressive pop is similar to rock and roll in overthrowing harmony as its basic organizing structure. However, unlike rock and roll, progressive pop inverts received conventions, playing with them ironically, disrupting them, or producing shadows of them in new and unexpected forms. Electronic techniques such as echo, feedback, stereo, loudness, and distortion may be used to give the music the impression of space and lateral extension.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Western vampires, Marceline subsists off {{shades of}} the color red, including [...] "low-grade" [...] shades such as pink. Since she is only sated by the color itself, blood <b>is</b> <b>appealing</b> to her simply because it is red. However, Ward has noted that she [...] "drinks blood sometimes". When Marceline is deprived of red, she enters into a [...] "feral" [...] state, and will instinctively try to kill others and drink their blood. Like traditional Western vampires, she is vulnerable to sunlight and is capable of turning into a bat of varying size. Marceline also possesses several powers, such as levitation, invisibility, the ability to shape-shift, and self-healing; she gained each of these powers after absorbing the essence of several powerful vampires, as documented in Stakes. Marceline is also a survivor of the Mushroom War. Hints of her past are sprinkled through the series; in [...] "Memory of a Memory" [...] a trip into Marceline's mind shows her as a child wandering around the outskirts of a destroyed city, and [...] "I Remember You" [...] features her meeting Simon Petrikov in a ruined city.|$|E
