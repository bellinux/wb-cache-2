5|$|The Pacific weather proved {{favourable}} but by August the {{two ships}} had {{lost sight of}} each other and continued their voyage separately. On 23 August Prince of Wales rounded Cape Horn alone and headed northeast and north on a path to Rio. Throughout the voyage her crew had been heavily reliant on a diet of salted meat and by early September scurvy had incapacitated the majority. Mason died from the condition on 9 October, and another 13 men were too ill to leave their bunks. When Rio was finally sighted on 13 October the crew were too sick to bring the ship to port. She drifted helplessly in the outer harbor until Rio's <b>harbourmaster</b> sighted her the following morning and had additional seamen rowed out to assist. Twelve of Prince of Wales sickest crew members were hospitalised in Rio while the remainder recovered on board.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} year of the colony, the <b>harbourmaster</b> was {{appointed}} to perform the postal services for the colony. A General Post Office was proclaimed in St Georges Terrace in 1835, and in 1841 a Postmaster General was appointed. The colonial Posts and Telegraph Department took over control of Perth's telegraph services in 1871, and telephone services in 1889. The Perth General Post Office was relocated to St Georges Terrace between 1887 and 1890, however by 1910 this accommodation was inadequate for the services provided. In 1900 there were 175 post offices across Western Australia, together with 160 telephone exchanges. The Commonwealth took over control of postal and telecommunication services at Federation in 1901.|$|E

500|$|Glatton {{remained}} in Dover Harbour, an obstruction to shipping, with her hull visible {{at low tide}} as the Harbour Board could not afford the £45,000 quoted on average by salvage companies. Finally they asked the <b>Harbourmaster,</b> Captain John Iron, if {{he could do it}} for less. He estimated it would cost about £5,000 if he was granted use of the salvage craft already at Dover. The Board accepted his offer and work began in May 1925. Some [...] of silt were removed from underneath Glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away from the wreck. Four lifting lighters, with a capacity of , were hired, but they would not suffice to lift a water-logged [...] ship. It was necessary to seal all of the holes on her topside and pump air into each compartment at a rate of [...] per minute to restore her buoyancy. The first attempt to lift her began on 2 December 1925 and was successful in breaking the suction holding her to the bottom in combination with the rising tide. That was enough for the first try and the major lifting effort began the following day. Slowly she was moved, taking advantage of the tides, until on 16 March 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to the western pier of the submarine harbour, close by the shore. The total cost was considerably more than originally estimated, but still far less than that quoted by the salvage companies, at no more than £12,000. There she remains, buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal.|$|E

2500|$|Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed {{ignorance of}} the {{arrangements}} made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a [...] licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the <b>harbourmaster,</b> who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III Passenger Certificate from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator {{and a range of}} safety devices. Darlwyne had no radio, no distress flares, and carried only two lifebelts. Bown had apparently begun enquiries [...] with the Falmouth Harbour Commission, but neither he nor Darlwyne possessed any of the licences needed for the boat to operate commercially.|$|E
2500|$|The Treaty of Paris, {{signed by}} France, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia on 20 Nov 1815, ended the Napoleonic Wars {{and a large}} fleet was no longer needed. [...] The Admiralty set about {{decommissioning}} ships and retiring officers. [...] However, Stirling and the Brazen received a stay of execution, as they were needed again in the West Indies. [...] Spain was losing its grip on the north of South America and rival factions were struggling for power. [...] So close to the West Indies, Britain {{had an interest in}} the establishment of secure government on the mainland, but needed to be careful to avoid offending Spain, now an ally. The Brazen arrived at Barbados in June 1816 and on [...] 20 July Stirling and the Barbados <b>Harbourmaster</b> were sent to survey the coast of Venezuela and gain intelligence regarding the attitudes of the population and the disposition of the various revolutionary factions.|$|E
2500|$|After the Board of Trade {{report was}} published, the coroner reopened the inquests, {{which had been}} adjourned pending any {{recommendations}} from the enquiry for criminal proceedings. Verdicts of death by misadventure were recorded in each case. The coroner expressed the wish that, {{as a result of}} the tragedy, regulations concerning licences would be much more strictly enforced. In this he echoed the Board of Trade report, which had stated that regulations relating [...] to boat licensing [...] "date from the Victorian era", and were wholly inadequate in modern conditions. [...] The Falmouth <b>harbourmaster</b> had told the enquiry that, without further staff, it would be impossible to check all the boats in the harbour; furthermore, he said, the £5 maximum fine for operating an unlicensed boat was not a deterrent. In Parliament on 15 March 1967 the trade minister Joseph Mallalieu said that he had no plans to introduce further legislation for the licensing of pleasure boats plying for hire, but proposed to increase the penalties for infringement of existing regulations.|$|E
