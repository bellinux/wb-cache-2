500|$|Shel Talmy, the {{producer}} on the track, {{has gone on}} record and put the controversy to rest {{in an interview with}} The Guardian, saying [...] "contrary to myth, Jimmy didn't play on 'You Really Got Me'." [...] In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying [...] "Oh, Crikey! I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' but I did play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it.

500|$|Darryl {{thinks his}} {{popularity}} {{with the staff}} will make him a shoo-in, so he thinks {{he does not have}} to <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> like everyone else. He is caught off-guard when he actually must <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> and they ask for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly extensive four-page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully parries, but Gabe ends up screaming at him and acting like a lunatic. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) during her interview, saying she is not a [...] "real candidate". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have pre-fired her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. When the discussion gets out of control, with Ryan (B. J. Novak) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim is the guy making him manager, Jim cuts it short and brings the committee back to the conference room to make up their minds.|$|E
500|$|Don Draper (Jon Hamm) {{is being}} interviewed by a {{reporter}} from Advertising Age and declines to speak about his personal life. As a result, he comes across as arrogant and a cipher in the published story, a fact that senior partners Roger Sterling (John Slattery) and Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) lament, as they had hoped the interview would act as advertising for the company. The effects of the bad publicity is brought home just after Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) has sold a Jai Alai special to ABC, {{but it must be}} pulled because the client, Pete Campbell's (Vincent Kartheiser) college friend, Horace Cook Jr., nicknamed [...] "Ho Ho", fires the agency because Draper did not mention the client in his interview. Because of the agency's narrow client base, the loss is financially detrimental. Bert suggests Don <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with The Wall Street Journal to make amends, but Don demurs. Meanwhile, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) comes up with an idea to regain the Sugarberry Ham account. She hires two actresses to fight over a ham in a grocery store. The plan goes awry when the fight turns real and one of the women presses charges against the other for assault, and Peggy has to ask Don for bail and hush money. Don disapproves of the stunt (which was carried out behind his back), but Peggy points out that they did retain the account. Also new part-time member of the creative team has been added: Joey, who Peggy has a friendly relationship with.|$|E

500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview,</b> he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director Rick Sloane {{was shocked}} at his {{treatment}} {{at the conclusion of}} Hobgoblins, in which Sloane himself was mercilessly mocked over the film's end credits. In a 2008 interview, however, Sloane clarified his comments, saying that [...] "I laughed through the entire MST3K episode, until the very end. I wasn't expecting the humor to suddenly be at my own expense. I was mortified when they dragged out the cardboard cutout and pretended to <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with me. I was caught off guard. I had never seen them rip apart any other director before on the show." [...] However, he credits the success of the MST3K episode with inspiring him to make a sequel to Hobgoblins, released in 2009.|$|E

Upon entering the UK in 2005, she began volunteering with the Burma Campaign UK. She attended one rally in traditional Karen dress, and was asked on the spot to be the master of ceremonies.

[...] Since then, the Swedish Agriculture Minister, Eskil Erlandsson, has said that [...] "he was satisfied that Australia appeared to be responding to international concerns about mulesing and that bans or boycotts were not necessary".

2500|$|The Notorious Bettie Page, {{released}} in 2005, {{is about the}} 1950s pinup model who became a cult icon of sexuality and who helped popularize pornography. Harron shows Page {{as the daughter of}} religious and conservative parents, as well as the fetish symbol who became a target of a Senate investigation of pornography. For this film, Harron did historical character research, and interviewed several of Page's friends as well as her first husband. Page was legally bound to another project and was thus unable to <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview,</b> but not being attached to Page meant that Harron was free to create a subjective representation of her. Harron saw Page as an unwitting feminist figure who represented a movement for women's sexual liberation, ironically similar, yet dissimilar to Solanas.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1884, Gordon {{had no interest in}} the Sudan and had just been hired to work as an officer with the newly established Congo Free State. Gordon [...] despite or rather because of his war hero status [...] disliked publicity and tried to avoid the press when he was in Britain. While staying with his sister in Southampton, Gordon received an unexpected visitor, namely William Thomas Stead, the editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, whom Gordon reluctantly agreed to <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with. Gordon wanted to talk about the Congo, but Stead kept on pressing him to talk about the Sudan; finally after much prompting on Stead's part Gordon opened up and attacked Gladstone's Sudan policy, coming out for an intervention to crush the Mahdi. Gordon offered up a 19th-century version of the domino theory, claiming: The danger arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering Mahometan [...] Power established close to your frontiers will exercise upon the population which you govern. In all the cities of Egypt it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done they may do; and, as he has driven out the intruder, they may do the same. Stead published his interview on 9 January 1884 {{on the front page of}} the Pall Mall Gazette alongside the leader (editorial) he had written entitled [...] "Chinese Gordon for the Sudan". Urban wrote: [...] "With this leader, William Stead's real motive in going to Southampton revealed itself at last. As to who tipped him off that the general would be staying here for just a couple of nights, we can only speculate".|$|E

2500|$|In season 2, {{although}} she has initial success with getting the all-ages club TRIC opened, and with encouraging Haley to perform at the club, which eventually fuels Haley's {{desire to be a}} singer, Peyton begins to get involved with cocaine. She feels alone, as her father is away again, and she does not know where Jake is. She feels down that everyone is dealing with their issues and not helping her or realizing that she is upset and going through a difficult time in her life. She is accused of being a lesbian by Felix Taggaro and faces public humiliation when he writes DYKE on her locker, just so his sister, Anna Taggaro, will not be presumed a lesbian (it is later revealed that Anna is bisexual, but also uses the word gay to assert her sexuality). Hope comes for Peyton, who is in deep despair and about to buy some cocaine, when Jake comes back into her life; it turns out that an argument between Lucas and Peyton made Lucas realize that he had not been there for Peyton, and felt she needed someone else. As a result, {{he was the one who}} called Jake, knowing that Jake would have a positive effect on her. This does, and sparks a turnaround for Peyton, and she and Jake fall in love. This happiness is short-lived, as Nicki comes back wanting custody of Jenny. Nicki eventually takes Jenny away from Jake and runs off, causing Jake to run after her, which leaves Peyton alone and heartbroken. Soon, someone named Ellie Harp gets in contact with Peyton saying that she is from Alternative Press magazine and wants to <b>do</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview.</b> When Peyton starts receiving strange e-mails from someone named WATCHMEWATCHU, she begins to suspect that it is Ellie. Ellie, however, denies sending the e-mails and shockingly informs Peyton that she is her mother. The finale ends with a crying, bewildered Peyton on a beach, and Lucas coming to comfort her. [...] "Looks like it's just me and you this summer," [...] he says. The two share a meaningful hug.|$|E
