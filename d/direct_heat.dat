25|$|The lower {{temperature}} of cooking (the boiling point of water) {{is a significant}} safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than <b>direct</b> <b>heat,</b> so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food in a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces {{the time needed to}} heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels. Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.|$|E

2500|$|This type of {{device is}} {{generally}} considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in {{the same way a}} dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces.

2500|$|The {{production}} of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra {{can be made}} by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying system [...] is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce drying time. In hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. [...] Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. [...] After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). [...] Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. [...] This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun. [...] In India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. [...] Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. [...] Coconut meat can be dried using <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire.

Also, in the previous work, the surface system was either power generation only or heating only. This thesis includes the subsurface system in the analysis and the surface application of this work is treated as an important parameter. Due to {{the interaction between the}} surface and subsurface systems, the load conditions and geologic conditions play important roles in determining the optimum operation. The analysis indicates that the well separation should be large enough to insure a constant production temperature during the project life time. For high temperature resources(higher than about 435 K), power generation yields the best performance and is therefore recommended. The relative desirability of the combination (heating and heat pumps) requires consideration of the load condition, resource temperature and other geologic conditions. Such evaluations for these automatically determine the appropriate ranges of <b>direct</b> <b>heating.</b> The optimum operation of each system is also dependent on the same parameters as well as the injection temperature. Analysis also has been done on a given well system with a small well separation. In such a case, operation must be continued after thermal breakthrough in order to obtain a moderate output {{for the life of the}} system. Power generation and the combination do not have good performance with this model. <b>Direct</b> <b>heating,</b> with careful control of flow rate, appears to be the preferred system.

6000|$|A few rude cairns were erected on {{the crest}} of the pass, covered with wands, red banners, and votive offerings of rags. I found a fine slab of slate, inscribed with the Tibetan characters, [...] "Om Mani Padmi hom," [...] which Meepo allowed me to take away, as the reward of my exertions. The ridge is wholly formed of angular blocks of white gneissy granite, split by frost.* [It was not a proper granite, but a highly {{metamorphic}} felspathic gneiss, with very little mica; being, I suspect, a gneiss which by metamorphic action was almost remolten into granite: the lamination was obscure, and marked by faint undulating lines of mica; it cleaves at all angles, but most generally along fissures with highly polished undulated black surfaces. The strike of the same rock near at hand was north-west, and dip north-east, at various angles.] There was no snow on the pass itself, but deep drifts and glaciers descended in hollows on the north side, to 17,000 feet. The rounded northern red shoulder of Kinchinjhow by Cholamoo lake, apparently 19,000 feet high, was quite bare, and, as I have said, I ascended Donkia to upwards of 19,000 feet before I found the rocks crusted with ice,* [Snow, transformed into ice throughout its whole mass: in short, glacial ice in all physical characters.] and the ground wholly frozen. I assume, therefore, that 19,000 feet at this spot is not below the mean level at which all the snow melts that falls on a fair exposure to the south: this probably coincides with a mean temperature of 20 degrees. Forty miles further north (in Tibet) the same line is probably at 20,000 feet; for there much less snow falls, and much more melts in proportion.* [Two secondary considerations materially affecting the melting of snow, and hence exerting a material influence on the elevation of the snow-line, appear to me never to have been sufficiently dwelt upon. Both, however, bear directly upon the great elevation of the snow-line in Tibet. From the imperfect transmission of the heating rays of the sun through films of water, which transmit perfectly the luminous rays, it follows that the direct effects of the rays, in clear sunshine, are very different at equal elevations of the moist outer and dry inner Himalaya. Secondly, naked rock and soil absorb much more heat than surfaces covered with vegetation, and this heat again radiated is infinitely more rapidly absorbed by snow (or other white surfaces) than the <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> of the sun's rays is. Hence, at equal elevations the ground heats sooner, and the snow is more exposed to the heat thus radiated in arid Tibet, than in the wooded and grassed mountains of Sikkim.] From the elevation of about 19,300 feet, which I attained on Donkia, I saw a fine illustration of that atmospheric phenomenon called the [...] "spectre of the Brocken," [...] my own shadow being projected on a mass of thin mist that rose above the tremendous precipices over which I hung. My head was surrounded with a brilliant circular glory or rainbow.* [Probably caused by spiculae of ice floating in the atmosphere, the lateral surfaces of which would then have an uniform inclination of 60 degrees: this, according to the observations of Mariotte, Venturi, and Fraunhoefer being the angle necessary for the formation of halos.] ...|$|E
