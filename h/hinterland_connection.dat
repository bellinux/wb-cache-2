To address competitiveness, Aronietis et al.

The port selections of shippers and forwarders are analyzed by Langen (2007), who focuses on Australia and highlights that shippers and forwarders have similar views, although shippers indicate less price-elastic demand.|$|E

This paper presents the PRD port system development to date and identifies the underlying forces driving the port system evolution. In particular, the unique process by which the PRD port system went from one gateway port to two ports and the undergoing regionalization with specialization is examined. The network strategy is stressed in shaping the port system structure. With the advantage of a hinterland regionalization, Shenzhen, among the gateway ports in PRD, has acquired the market share from Hong Kong. Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports move from the hinterland-dominated regionalization to a more balanced regionalization based on an established inland transport network, whereas Hong Kong undergoes a foreland regionalization. If the <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection</b> remains relatively weak, the gateway function of the port in Hong Kong will further decline, but its transhipment role will further dominate.

40|$|The {{economic}} situation and comparative {{advantages of the}} Port of Rijeka {{are no more than}} important preconditions of its development and competitive ability. No adequate connection of the Port of Rijeka to its catchment area is possible without a modern rail and road traffic. The researches and analyses of the port <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection</b> current state, the results of which are provided in these documents, clearly indicate the need to upgrade the existing railway tracks and build a new level Rijeka – Zagreb railway line. This line is a vital condition for ensuring both, a strong growth of the port performances and its competitive ability vis-a-vis other neighbouring ports. The level railway line Rijeka – Zagreb with Rijeka railway junction adequately upgraded, should be therefore regarded as strategic traffic project and conditio sine qua non for the future development of the Port of Rijeka. However, no solution of the Rijeka railway junction problem will be possible without finding the right way for better connection of some of the port terminals. When considering the integral solution of the rail traffic in the greater Rijeka Basin, {{it is important to know}} that the access to individual port terminals, the connection with the railway in Istria through the Učka Tunnel and connection with the port terminals on the Island of Krk are of great importance for the Port of Rijeka future development.

40|$|Ports {{are very}} {{important}} for the national economy as well as social well-being since they are mostly involved with the import and export of goods. Moreover, world business increasingly focuses on activities which can add value to end customers. As a result, recent market activities become more aggressive in terms of port competition. For this reason, this study attempted to ascertain the port competitiveness of Laem Chabang Port (LCP), Thailand. At first, factors that are considered to be the most relevant to port competitiveness, are identified by means of reviewing the literatures, namely port location, services, <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection,</b> telecommunication and port charges. In addition, the current situation of maritime trade is analysed in different regions, which is Asia, Southeast Asia and Thailand. Moreover, the background of LCP is described, including its performance in the past decade. This study aims to provide in-depth information on current practices and perceptions of the port, therefore, these factors are further carried out in an empirical section. In order to do so, interviews are conducted in this study. The sample group of this study are shippers, carriers, freight forwarders, which use LCP for import and export, Port Authority of Thailand, and local government organisation. Based on each port competitiveness factor, LCP is carefully evaluated in order to indentify its competitive advantages. Moreover, LCP is critically compared to its main competitor, Singapore Port, the world top container port. Finally, a SWOT analysis is implemented so as to identify its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. By doing so, it helps LCP to manage development plans in the future in order to enhance its competitive advantages and become even more successful port in the global seaborne trade.

40|$|Transport {{infrastructure}} {{plays an}} important role in the national economy, especially in an open and globalized economy. In a framework of a dynamic industrial environment, this thesis investigates the relationship between business location decisions and performance of strategic transport infrastructure. In this line of thought, port regional attractiveness and competitiveness is a main determinant. This study has found that transport infrastructure has a positive and significant impact on Belgian economic growth in the period of 1990 - 2010 in addition to the traditional growth stimulating factors. Port infrastructure investments, particularly, had a significant influence above the direct and indirect effects they have on GDP and employment, because they contribute to broader economic effects such as the economic openness degree and network effects. The emphasis, consequently, becomes the investigation of this contribution of modern port infrastructure to economic growth and development. To scrutinise the significance of this growth stimulating role of modern ports this thesis has identified a few derived factors originated in the dynamic environment and the related requisites for a modern port. In this process, a modern port develops to a commercial location which is able to fulfil the requirement of the spontaneous industrial environment. Based on this evolution of a port to a commercial location and the formation of a commercial cluster, port development and its improved regional competitive edge become important determinants of national competitiveness and economic growth. In this context, and to assist commercial cluster formation in a port, the most important factors to improve a port’s attractiveness from the port users’ point of view and based on a survey, are identified and ranked as port cost, quality of <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection,</b> geographical location, productivity, and capacity...|$|E

One of the Masterplan’s goals is to achieve a win-win situation between coastal protection and the maintenance and improvement of the maritime access to the port of Zeebrugge. The <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection</b> of the port of Zeebrugge by means of inland vessels is a major issue. Therefore, a specific type of inland vessels is conditionally allowed {{to make use of the}} 16 nautical miles long sea trajectory between Zeebrugge and the mouth of the Western Scheldt estuary to connect the port with the inland waterway network. Detailed information about the wave climate in the area between the eastern dam of the port of Zeebrugge, Pas van het Zand, Scheur-Oost/Wielingen, Vlissingen, Breskens and the coastline is essential to maximize the efficiency of the sea-river traffic in the present situation, and to decrease the requirements of inland vessels for safe navigation on a coastal route between the port of Zeebrugge and the mouth of the Western Scheldt.

40|$|The study takes a {{comparative}} approach by investigating {{the situation in}} the hinterlands of two different port areas in Europe: Antwerp (Belgium) and Gdansk-Sopot-Gdynia agglomeration (Poland). Both port centres have an important road <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection</b> that faces competition from other alternative modes of freight transport. However, the Port of Antwerp is already one of the leading ports of the continent while the ports of Gdansk and Gdynia are at the stage of building their competitive position. Also the importance of inland waterways in the transport systems in these countries is different - Belgium has a functioning network of waterways while Poland still has to develop it. The Belgian case is the E 313 motorway, which makes the connection between Antwerp and Li 8 ge and further on also Germany. The motorway has competition from both rail and inland waterways, especially in dealing with port-bound traffic. The Albert Canal, which runs mainly in parallel with the motorway, is currently being subject to capacity expansion through the extension and elevation of a number bridges that cross the canal. Rail could specifically benefit from the potential re-activation of the Iron Rhine - an almost parallel connection to the motorway E 313 between Antwerp and the German Ruhr area. The Polish case is focused on possible scenarios of freight traffic between Baltic port centre of Gdansk and Gdynia with important international harbour and fast developing regional centre - Bydgoszcz-Torun. At present the main connections between those urban areas are the state road 1, section of motorway A 1 and railway CE- 65. Gdansk, Torun and Bydgoszcz are also linked with Vistula river (part of international inland waterways E- 40 and E- 70) but so far it is not used extensively. The cases are analyzed separately. The added value of the paper is the comparative analysis which allows making conclusions that are valid for both environments. The results are of high relevance to policy makers in charge of alleviating port hinterland problems, and also to ports in the current highly competitive environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} Synchro {{modality}} is effectively an {{evolution of a}} multimodal supply chain. It integrates different transport modes and gives shippers and logistics service providers the freedom to deploy different modes of transportation in the same chain and in a flexible way so as to gain the desired outcome according to their priorities in a certain trip. Time, costs and emissions are certainly the three most relevant parameters when talking about a multimodal transportation chain. In most cases the logistics provider has set priorities to conform with, and obviously above mentioned constrains influence each other in an adverse way. With the development of ICT technologies and systems installed on board and on shore and with a simple decision support system fed with input from tracking and tracing systems or traffic monitoring systems, one can easily and flexibly plan his transportation job and maintain his set priority while in parallel keeping the remaining two parameters in control. Down times for example could be eliminated and efficiency gains could be achieved with decreased environmental footprint. The Port of Piraeus is the largest Greek seaport {{and one of the}} largest ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. It exhibits an impressive container traffic growth rate over the last 4 years triggered by its partial privatization and a recently completed <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection</b> to the rail network, which associated the port with the South-Eastern European corridor e. g. the route Far Eastern ports–Piraeus–Prague. The current paper will present an easy to use simple tool to continuously assess even during the transportation event all the alternative modes for a given destination in terms of time cost and emissions. An analytical fully parameterized model will be the basis for this tool which will be run for the chain Shanghai–Piraeus–Prague. The overall scenario is as follows: A container ship is arriving from China to the Piraeus Container Terminal. One of its containers is destined to an inland Enterprise in Prague. The most common way for transportation to Prague is rail, but also truck could be an alternative solution and of course a combination of a Short Sea Shipping part to Thessaloniki and then truck or train to Prague. Emphasis in the calculations will be given to emissions for all the modes and relations will be shown with time and cost. The tool developed is based on the case study above, being however open architecture software it can be expanded and applied to other ports and routes. The final outcome will be an easy and user friendly tool with the possibility to alter different input parameters and receive quickly a useful decision support system for the shipper or the logistics providers. Finally, there are two loops foreseen for the runs of the program. The required input parameters at each stage are either directly fed to the program if available (e. g vessels ETA and position through GPS, VTS, ETC) or calculated if this is not the case...|$|E

40|$|When the new locks of the Panama Canal are {{finished}} in 2015 Post Panamax vessels {{are able to}} sail through the Panama Canal. This will increase the container traffic intensity through the Caribbean. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) wants to anticipate on this expansion of the Panama Canal by investing in a US$ 1. 5 billion transshipment port in the Caribbean. Jamaica is an interesting location to realize this port, because of its ideal central position in the Caribbean and its location lies {{in the doorway of}} the Panama Canal. CHEC aims for the Goat Islands in Jamaica as their location for the new port. Normally the Jamaican government welcomes foreign investments of CHEC with open arms, but the Goat Islands are an environmentally protected area. Recently, this led to many complains by environmentalists. The new port can only be successful if it has a good competitive position with respect to other ports. The new port in Jamaica is a location with high potency to accommodate the container vessels which have ports at the East Coast of North America as destination. To attract shipping companies to the new transshipment port in Jamaica the price and efficiency of the new port must be competitive with other ports. As the new port of Jamaica doesn’t have a large hinterland and focusses mainly on transshipment, shipping companies are not bounded to Jamaica and can switch easily to other ports. The most competitive ports are Mariel (Cuba) and Freeport (the Bahamas). This report proposes designs and alternative locations for the new port. To find the ideal location for a new port in Jamaica different potential areas are selected and studied. The first steps resulted in sixteen possible locations for the port. Two Multi Criteria Analyses (MCA’s) resulted in a selection of four locations. Those possible locations for the new port are: the Goat Islands, Jackson Bay, Maccary Bay, and Little Bay. The best location is not found, because all the four locations are well-matched for their designed level of detail. Therefore the recommendation is made that all the four locations should be designed in a higher level of detail, so the decision makers can make well informed choices for the people of Jamaica. Because the media attention, the Jamaican government, and CHEC are more focusing on the Goat Islands than on the other locations, the location Goat Islands is designed further into detail. For designing the port the total surface of the port of 12 km 2 is divided into port area for transshipment (4 km 2) and area for the use of industry (8 km 2). The transshipment area has a quay length of 3 kilometer, which provides enough berthing space to handle seven Post Panamax ships and one Panamax ship simultaneously. The maximum expected throughput of 7 million TEU per year is found. The transshipment area is also designed into further detail. Super Post Panamax ship-to-shore cranes, multi trailer systems and rail mounted gantry cranes are most suitable for the port. The <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection</b> is also designed. A road connection is needed and a railway connection is designed as an option. The industrial surface can be used for many different facilities. These facilities are the assembling of gantry cranes for the Americas and creating cement and steel for export purposes. These activities need quay length which is included in the design of the total layout. Also space is reserved for a manufacturing facility, a logistics center, a LNG power plant, and a major IT facility. The extreme wave conditions for the new port are investigated to come up with the design loads. Extreme waves with a return period of 1 / 200 years give a surge level of 2. 0 meter and wave heights of 4. 0 meters at the port entrance. Behind the port is found a higher surge level of 2. 5 meters. Next to the extreme conditions the downtime of the port due to waves is established. Tropical storms are not strong enough to cause downtime, because of the sheltered area of Portland Bight. Only during hurricanes the port is not operational. The economical, social, and environmental impacts of the new port are described. For the new port the most favorable port model and a finance scheme are found. A private service port model with full concession in combination with a Build, Operate, and Transfer contract (BOT) is advised. The land will still be owned by the Jamaican government, but CHEC will fulfill both the functions of port authority and port operator. An environmental impact assessment has to be performed, because there are more issues besides the destruction of Little Goat Island, harming the fish sanctuary, and the impact on the total Portland Bight. Also these three issues should be investigated in detail. A SWOT analysis is carried out to find the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The main opportunity and threat is the change in expected throughput. To deal with this uncertainty an adaptive port planning is designed.

40|$|At present, {{the problem}} of the {{greenhouse}} effect pushes people {{to pay more attention to}} the effects of emission. Carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases. And freight transportation represents the primary contributor of CO 2 emission compared to other sectors. Thus, the emission of container transport, which is the main method of transportation all over the world, is the main research object in this thesis. The impact of CO 2 emission is a hot topic in transportation that will be highlighted in the near future. One question will challenge our conventional modeling and traffic operations: How can the World Container Model be extended to model the effects of CO 2 -emission cost and what effects on international container flows are expected? The World Container Model (WCM) is used as a fundamental model in this thesis. Due to the threat of climate change, changes in energy policy and so on, the future circumstances of container flows are less certain. The World Container Model (WCM) has been developed as an efficient tool to analyze possible shifts in future container transport demand and the impacts of relevant transport policies. It is a strategic model for the movement of containers on a global scale and predicts yearly container flows over the world’s shipping routes. However, the WCM does not take into account the effects of CO 2 emission, which is not the expected model that operators want. The effects of CO 2 emission in the transport process, especially the costs, play a more and more important role in the consideration of international container transport. During the process of choosing transport routes, there are some relationships with the effects of emission. That is to say, before transport routes are chosen, not only the cost of the transport but also the environmental effects will be taken into account in this thesis research. (Liao, Lu, & Tseng, Carbon dioxide emissions and inland container transport in Taiwan, 2011) In other words, an extended WCM is designed and developed that takes into account the costs of CO 2 emission. The new model offers a desirable contribution that provides insight into a range of new possible structures of global trade patterns as well as consequences for the transportation system. The first part of the main research question is answered first. The World Container Model has been extended with a new scenario executed in the model. This new scenario is designed to add the cost of CO 2 emission into the cost of travel time and transfer. There are three important factors in the function: maritime (0. 025 euro per TUE), hinterland (0. 57 euro per TEU) and transfer. During the process of calculation, these factors are changed by adding the respective unit cost of the corresponding CO 2 emission (during maritime and hinterland transport, at terminal). In this way, the unit cost per container move increase. Then the effects of CO 2 emission should be visible from the outcomes of the model. With this extended World Container Model, the second part of the main research question can be answered. From the outcomes, the effects of CO 2 emission cost on international container flows can be analyzed. The outcomes reveal that the competitiveness of ports on a global scale changes. It is noteworthy that some ports, like Amsterdam, previously with small throughputs and transhipment, experience a new opportunity for development and prosperity. However, some important ports, like the port of Rotterdam, retain their competitiveness thanks to their advantages of geographic location and insistence on policies for controlling emission. In short, due to the impact on the cost of extra CO 2 emitted, the routes of maritime container transport have been reselected and throughput has been redistributed. Afterwards, these effects are further analyzed in consideration of two scenarios. Based on the analysis and the scenarios that have been modeled using the extended World Container Model, the applicability of this model and the analysis for the effects of different policies and measures can be tested and verified. Scenario A: slow steaming (the speed of vessels slows down) Scenario B: CO 2 price (the price of CO 2 emission changes as time passes) For scenario A: most of the European ports retain their attractiveness, which is enhanced by the growth of their throughput. Meanwhile, with the decreasing speed, the throughputs of these ports will increase further. For instance, the port of Antwerp is one of the ports that will probably lose their competitiveness in container transportation in Europe, if the measure of slow steaming shall be taken to reduce the CO 2 emission. The similar situation could also occur in the ports of Amsterdam, Le Havre and Bremen. For scenario B: with an increased CO 2 tax, most of the European ports like Rotterdam and Hamburg will experience greater chances for development because of the large number of containers being imported and exported. In contrast, the ports of Antwerp, Amsterdam, Le Havre and Bremen show negative outcomes of throughputs from the extended World Container Model. This finding may imply that these ports will face challenges in response to an increase in the CO 2 price in the future. In both scenarios, the ports of Antwerp, Amsterdam, Le Havre and Bremen show negative outcomes of throughputs from the extended World Container Model. On the contrary, other ports in Europe, like Rotterdam and Hamburg, retain their competitiveness in future international container traffic. The different situations may occur due to the effects of handling cost. For example, the handling cost at the port of Rotterdam is less expensive than that at the port of Antwerp, mainly because the port of Rotterdam has more efficient handling equipment and better <b>hinterland</b> <b>connection.</b> Finally, the method used to calculate the total volume of CO 2 emission is introduced. It is achieved by data modeling on the basics of the extended WCM. The port of Rotterdam, as a case, is studied with analysis of all scenarios and the calculation of CO 2 emission. For scenario A: with the speed of vessels slowing down, the throughputs of the port of Rotterdam increase. Beyond doubt, this results in the growth of CO 2 emission at the area of the terminal. But for maritime container transport, the total volume of CO 2 emission is decreased along with the speed cut, mainly because of the reduction in the number of routes towards and away from the port of Rotterdam (the number of routes to or from Rotterdam decreases from 2, 290 to 2, 140). For scenario B: with the growth of the CO 2 tax, the port of Rotterdam still retains its attractiveness as one of the largest ports in the world. Its throughput and transhipment continue to increase. On the other side, for maritime transport, the CO 2 emitted by containers moving towards and away from Rotterdam will be reduced as the CO 2 tax increases. To conclude, this report has proposed a method of predicting global container transport that incorporates travel time and traffic CO 2 emission in the composite route choice cost function, which provides reasonable suggestions on the effects of a given scenario to reduce the emission. According to the results of the scenarios, the port of Rotterdam will experience positive effects with the growth of throughput and transhipment. When considering increasing CO 2 emission in the future, Rotterdam still needs to focus on improving the efficiency of handling at terminal. Such consideration depends on operation performances and terminal configurations. This measure works only over the long term and the costs are high but it is very effective. The impacts and probabilities should be adjusted over time. In response to increasing CO 2 emission, the strategy should also focus on energy conservation and renewable energy. These considerations also correspond with the actual situation, which confirms the outcomes of our extended WCM reasonably. The other ports in Europe, like Antwerp, which exhibit negative effects as a result of scenarios, need to be more careful. The extended WCM in this research has shown that it can be used to assess the effects of a wide range of developments. As a strategic tool for policy development, it is able to assist the port to support decisions and take appropriate measures.

40|$|Now, {{more than}} ever, issues of port {{competitiveness}} are important, {{also in a}} context of containerized cargo. In a survey conducted amongst major shipping lines, the quality of <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> is the second most important criterion for competitiveness of a port after the cost factor. However, most seaports, major as well as smaller, are often affected by congestion on those hinterland links. This paper tries to assess some of the effects that infrastructure pricing can have on the competitiveness of the seaports. It is essential to identify the determinants of port competitiveness. In order to do that, a total of 30 literature sources were reviewed. Some older sources were reviewed, but the main attention is on the most recent literature. We focused on the criteria that other authors identify as important and also on the methodology that they use. In order to test the information obtained in the literature review and evaluate the criteria identified in the literature, interviews with shipping lines were held. Top management people were interviewed covering 11 shipping lines that operate 45. 7 % of the world fleet of container vessels. The input provided by respondents from shipping companies enabled us to identify decision makers in port selection, evaluate the importance of each port selection criterion for shipping companies, by applying those to a set of selected ports in Europe and compare their attractiveness. An evaluation by shipping companies of the importance and properties of different hinterland transport modes was obtained. According to the input provided by the respondents from shipping lines, the most important port competitiveness criteria for shipping companies are the cost of transport operations and the quality of <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections.</b> Previous research has shown that infrastructure pricing measures can be an efficient instrument for influencing the characteristics of the use of <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections.</b> With the help of the Freight Model Flanders, a number of purpose-made scenarios were run. The scenarios were based on possible developments in the economy and in other parts of worldwide logistics networks, as well as on possible policy that could be introduced by the government. For interpreting the results, an important hinterland link for the Port of Antwerp was chosen: motorway E 313, which serves as a freight connection between the Port of Antwerp and Germany. It is in a geographical position where it features competition from both rail and inland waterways, especially in dealing with port-bound traffic. The results of this study show that not only in a Flemish context, but also in case of similar port hinterlands featuring strong road use and availability of rail and/or inland waterway infrastructure, pricing can be a factor that increases the competitiveness of the port. However, adverse effects are also possible in certain situations. The results are of high relevance to port authorities and policymakers in charge of alleviating port hinterland congestion problems...|$|R

Based on technology development and time-critical global production patterns ports are confronted with rising expectations {{on the performance of}} their sea and land side operations {{as well as on the}} seamless distribution of goods to the hinterland. In order to assess the comparative performance of ports in supply chains it has been accepted that efficiency ratings determined through benchmarking can be powerful tools. Next to simple key performance indicators complex production functions have experienced approval due to their ability to compare independent multiple input and output criteria. To benchmark container terminals the frontier function Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been applied frequently in the past ten years.

For the impact assessment, most freight transport models use a generalized cost approach for the purchasers' costs which amount the operators' costs passed on to the users of transport services and the actual users' costs (e. g. time costs). At present, no comprehensive model exists for the Port of Hamburg. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the expected impacts of infrastructure measures for the Port of Hamburg's hinterland accessibility.

40|$|Historically, {{seaports}} {{served as}} a location where merchant goods could be discharged, stored and sold at the local market. Neither further value added services in the port area nor prompt hinterland transportation where in {{the main focus of}} port operators and local authorities. Accompanied by changes in technology development, international production networks and the growing importance of just in time delivery demands on goods handling in ports and on distribution to the hinterland the concept of logistics gained importance. Today, maritime logistics comprises planning, design, execution and management of material and information flows alongside the maritime supply chain from ship to port to the hinterland and vice versa. Accompanying, competition increasingly takes place between maritime supply chains including <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> instead of between single ports. In order to determine a port's individual performance in an international network and to identify future improvement opportunities the concept of benchmarking has been applied frequently. The ability to collect relevant data quickly and to apply basic calculations led to a dominance of key performance indicators (KPI) and causal Input-Output (I-O) models as main methods to compare ports. Nevertheless, due to their simplicity KPI and I-O models are not able to display complex relationships which do not necessarily have a direct impact on each other. In recent years Date Envelopment Analysis (DEA) received growing attention in the area of maritime logistics research as a popular method to measure performance and efficiency of container ports and container terminals respectively. Next to different input and output factors such as number of gantry cranes or container throughput the most important differentiation criteria are the number and location of ports. Especially, attention of past DEA research projects has been drawn to the main container ports worldwide in regard to total throughput. Moreover, single countries such as Spain, Italy and Korea have been analysed in detail as well. Thus, one potential gap of DEA utilization at present exists in analysing import flows of containers to the hinterland and hinterland connectivity of port terminals in general keeping the whole supply chain in mind. Therefore, in a next step input and output criteria and potential Decision Making Units (DMU) of the port-hinterland link have to be determined before calculation runs start and conclusions about the efficiency of port <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> can be made...|$|R

This study proposes to identify the ULCS trend and the critical impact of the ULCS upon the ports within the Greater China Region (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan). This exploratory study adopts the inductive approach by collecting data from desk research and semi-structured interviews. The research is conducted by the conceptual framework and follows the procedure which displays and analyses both the quantitative data and qualitative data collected. The research findings provide a new conceptual framework which identifies the three key main factors conceptualised from the literature review and indicates the three sub-factors which link up the main factors, and also, uncovers the gap between the insights of shipping lines and container terminals. The study concludes that the ULCS trend is anticipated remaining a growth and the critical impacts of the ULCS upon ports are going to be port infrastructure and facilities in the short term and port <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> and cargo throughput in the long run.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of port choice and container terminal selection for deep-sea container carriers. The paper focuses on the research question: on what basis do deep-sea container operators select container ports (strategy) and container terminals (financial reasons) in the Hamburg-Le Havre range over others? In answering this research question, three dimensions are addressed in detail: the buying decision characteristics; port choice strategy; and terminal selection. The results show that strategic considerations at company level are important. For port choice the most important criteria from a carrier's perspective are: availability of hinterland connections; reasonable tariffs; and immediacy of consumers (large hinterland). In addition to these criteria, shipping lines attach great value to often neglected factors, such as feeder connectivity, environmental issues and the total portfolio of the port. The study reveals that port selection and terminal selection {{are not the same}} with terminal selection criteria mainly depending on: handling speed; handling costs; reliability; and <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections.</b> The analysis also brought forward that the decision making is different per container carrier, per trade and per port type, implying that a one size fits all approach is not relevant...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this article is}} the weak usage of rail freight in Belgium and Europe, both as a sustainable mode of land transportation in itself as well {{as a part of the}} intermodal chain. The results are obtained by transversal research on rail freight transport in Belgium, taking into account the European context. This interdisciplinary research develops a road map for the creation of three integrated scenarios: a best case, medium case and worst case scenario for rail freight development, based on a detailed SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities, threats) analysis. It includes the most probable future developments for rail freight transport and <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections.</b> These developments are obtained from literature review and discussions with a heterogeneous panel of experts in the fields of (i) optimal corridor and hub development, (ii) macroeconomic impact, (iii) sustainability, (iv) effective market regulation and (v) governance and organization for a well-functioning intermodality. The Delphi approach is used in combination with a survey analysis. Frequency tables and the H-index allow defining a ranking and selection of SWOT elements. The obtained scenarios allow future research to quantify and measure the impact of future developments and decisions towards the Belgian rail freight market. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Taking the European experience as an example {{and not as a}} pilot project, expansion of short sea shipping can be achieved everywhere on the globe. Although short sea shipping offers many advantages to policy makers such as improvement of the efficiency of intermodal transport, environmental friendliness and enhancement of competitiveness, it also reveals the inadequate infrastructure of ports and <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> and the gap between the policy makers and market forces.

30|$|The {{deployment}} of mega container ships with {{a capacity for}} 18, 000 [*]+[*]TEU on major trade lanes is a recent trend within the ocean shipping industry. Larger ships pose multiple challenges to ports and <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> {{as well as to}} the beneficial cargo owners. To achieve maximum utilization of their larger vessels, carriers have entered cooperative global alliances on predetermined routes, resulting in new discharge patterns at U.S. ports. These multi-partner networks involve several competing firms which voluntarily and interactively engage in service delivery. Container carriage is increasingly competitive, and requires continuing cost reductions. There is increasing evidence, however, that cargo shippers are less satisfied with the service their supply chains are receiving. Standardizing process performance through supply chain integration and removing inefficiency will be needed to stabilize the international shipping market, but the question remains how ocean carriers will be able differentiate themselves and create improved supply chain performance. This paper suggests an answer through a simple standard performance measurement model. We will suggest that old systems of carrier competition could evolve to greater cooperation and coordination between business competitors, a state sometimes called “coopetition”, by development of standard setting processes for sharing information while retaining specific service delivery structures to provide differentiated value to customers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generic framework on port logistics development and its interaction with hinterland regions. Although earlier {{work on the}} topic (e. g. by Ferrari et al., 2006; Kuipers and Eenhuizen, 2004) offers valuable insights in the subject, it contains limitations in geographical applicability. Ports indeed face dissimilarities in, for instance, locational characteristics (a. o. distance from the sea and nautical accessibility) and <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections.</b> Only when a model for determining seaport-located logistics activities takes into account these issues of dissimilarity among ports, the framework {{could be applied to}} a variety of seaport ranges worldwide. In this paper we aim to provide a first version of such a framework. More particularly, by means of a survey conducted in the Port of Busan the shortcomings of traditional approaches are illustrated. We then propose a more encompassing model, which seems to explain fairly well the attractiveness of Busan in terms of logistics activities. This framework explicitly adds port and hinterland characteristics to the list of factors decisive in the choice of the location of logistics activities. Finally, we would like to remark that our research on this topic is still ongoing and results for surveys planned in New York and Antwerp will be reported in a later stage...|$|R
40|$|The seaport-hinterland {{interaction}} {{plays an}} increasingly important role in shaping supply chain solutions of shippers and logistics service providers. Scarcity concerns combined with concerns over the reliability of transport solutions have led seaports and hinterland corridors {{to take up a}} more active role in supply chains. This contribution looks at port developments and logistics dynamics in Europe and proposes some steps towards a further integration between seaports and the hinterland. The key point put forward in this paper is that the competitive battle among ports will increasingly be fought ashore. <b>Hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> are thus a key area for competition and coordination among actors. The paper approaches port-hinterland dynamics from the perspective of the various market players involved, including port authorities, shipping lines, terminal operators, transport operators (rail, barge, road and short sea) and logistics service providers. The paper will address the impact of horizontal and vertical relations in supply chains on the structure of these chains and on the relationships between seaports and the intermodal hinterland. Who takes or should take the lead in the further integration of ports and inland ports and what actions have been taken so far by the market players in this respect, will be examined. The incentives for market players to vertically or horizontally integrate will be analyzed against the backdrop of the nature of the market in which the various players operate. ...|$|R

New markets areas have been emerged in Europe due to collapse of planned economy and integration of Europe. Also the transport routes to the markets are changing. The Hel-sinki-Tallinn sea route can be considered as a fast route to the new markets in the Cen-tral and Eastern Europe. The Helsinki-Tallinn sea route is also a potential route to the Western European markets. This study provides an analysis of transport and cargo flows between Finland and Esto-nia for regional and local planners. The main purpose of the study is to clarify the pre-sent situation of the seaborne cargo flows on the Helsinki-Tallinn route and how the cargo flows will develop in the future. The study focuses on the following thematic enti-ties: the Finnish and Estonian seaborne transport system and cargo flows, the structure and volume of the cargo flows on the Helsinki-Tallinn route, the hinterland cargo flows on the Helsinki-Tallinn route and the transport methods used on the Helsinki-Tallinn route. The study was carried out as a desk research, a statistical analysis and an inter-view study during the spring–autumn 2011. The study reveals that during the period 2002 – 2010 the volume of the seaborne cargo traffic between Finland and Estonia has increased significantly while the trend of the trade volume between Finland and Estonia has remained nearly constant. This indicates that the route via Estonia is increasingly used in the Finnish foreign trade. Because the ports of Helsinki and Tallinn are the main ports in the cargo traffic between Finland and Estonia, the role of the Helsinki-Tallinn route as a sea leg in the <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> of Finland has increased. The growth of the cargo volume on the Helsinki-Tallinn route was estimated to continue on the annual level of 10 % during the next couple of years. In the long run the growth of the cargo volumes depends on the economical and indus-trial development of the former Eastern European countries. If the IMO’s sulphur regu-lations will come in force, the Helsinki-Tallinn route will become one of the main routes also to the Western European markets, besides of the route via Sweden. The study also shows that the fast and reliable connections year round on the Helsinki-Tallinn route have made it possible for service and logistics companies to reconsider their logistics strategies in a new way in the both side of the Gulf of Finland. Anyway, the ropax concept is seen as the only economical profitable solution on the Helsinki-Tallinn route because cargo and passenger traffic are supporting each other.

To maintain its position the government decided to improve the <b>hinterland</b> <b>connections</b> by building the Betuweroute. In the Netherlands the discussion strengthened if it is necessary to build the track. This report will deal with the question if the carriers will use the track, because the building of the track is only useful if the utility is good. Because the Betuweroute is a solution for a future problem the conclusion is based on forecasts. The Rotterdam Municipal Port Management expects the road haulage to and from the harbour to grow between 66 and 141 % between 1995 and 2020. This means that in the best case the traffic will increase with ''just" four truck loads per minute per direction plus the growth of the other industry of the Netherlands. The capacity of the road network is not high enough to deal with this demand. To prevent that the roads will congest, the government wants to achieve a shift of road haulage to rail transport and inland shipping. The government will do this by charging road transport, which will make inland shipping and rail more interesting for carriers. Rail transport and inland shipping are additional modes of transport. This means that not just one of the two can handle the demand shifted from road haulage. The capacity of inland shipping is high enough to deal in part with the extra demand, but the capacity of the rail network is not. The capacity has to be increased. The best solution to do this is the Betuweroute.
