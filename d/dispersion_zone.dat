Doubts from the chemical physics community about the application of its unusual properties to this field are tried to be removed.

Here, a numerical study of the dynamics in a subterranean estuary subject to tidal forcing is presented.

30|$|Basically, {{fresh water}} is less dense than salt water {{and so it}} floats on top. Therefore, saline water is found below fresh water {{discharge}} from higher altitude in coastal areas. Also, the boundary between salt water and fresh water is not distinct; the <b>zone</b> of <b>dispersion,</b> transition <b>zone,</b> or salt-water interface is brackish with salt water and fresh water mixing. It then means that salinity will increase with depth where both fresh water and saline water occur. As such, the increase in salinity will produce consequent decrease in electrical resistivity of water, and thus resistivity varies with depth within groundwater well in coastal aquifer. These variations could then be mapped by methods capable of detecting differences in salinity. Thus, we employed electrical resistivity, geochemical and physical measurements of well water and seawater samples in this work.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: As the point-based {{rainfall}} observation {{design has}} implications in correctly representing spatially continuous rainfall values, therefore methods ranging from simple arithmetic mean to isopleths and Thiessen’s polygon-based weighted means have been generally employed by hydrologists {{in order to}} obtain mean basin rainfall. The utility of these methods is important especially for analysing the spatial distribution of network and thereafter to suggest locations. Hence, advanced mathematical versions using network theory, geostatistical approach and optimum path analysis have been used to select the optimum design even in the preliminary stage of investigation. At a catchment level, an application of various interpolation methods using geostatistics is demonstrated here in case of Betwa river, one of the important southern tributary of Yamuna river after Chambal. The script for these methods was written in Geographical Information System (GIS) Software – ILWIS (Integrated Land and Water Information System) and it was run for normal rainfall parameters using data from Indian Meteorological Department. In the geostatistical analysis, it was found that trend surface, moving average and kriging based interpolated map provided good estimates of spatial accuracy of mean basin rainfall within 10 - 12 % of coefficient of variation when compared with normal rainfall at control stations. Among kriging methods, ordinary kriging was found to be best in terms of least root mean square deviation from validation results. Error map based on anisotropic kriging resulted into least amount of absolute error within 10 % of estimation in rainfall from the measured normal values. The error can be further reduced if more rain-gauges are located in spatial <b>dispersion</b> <b>zone...</b>|$|E

Background {{materials}} were obtained based on its investigation of an examination horse rearing stable Czech warmblooded in Nový Dvůr (part of Municipal's stables in Pisek, sp). Stallions were measured in the years 2009 - 2010 in the age of 7 - 32 months. During this time it was measured 13 physical proportions, including four basic proportions ? height at withers (KVH) and height at withers measured by a tape (KVP), girth of a chest (OH) and girt of a shin (OHol). The growth curve and the behaviour of growth have been ascertained of the particular measurements. Then it was compared with literature. The greatest differences at results were observed in comparison with growth standards for height of withers. It was found that most of the measured stallions is classed in a growth zone + 1 (90. 6 % of cases). The remaining 9. 4 % of cases were included in the range + 2. The problem is also in the way, of definitiv of current standard, the current standard is determinated by one specific number (average value) and not spread within a certain range. The direct relationship with KVH also increased height at withers measured by tape.

40|$|This Master s thesis {{describes}} two CFD studies particle plug propagation in bent {{pipes and}} critical velocity determination in dilute slurry flows. The {{objective of this}} study is to extend an understanding of these phenomena and to test the capabilities of the CFD software ANSYS Fluent in modelling of particle flows. In addition, contribution to 1 D modelling of particle flows is considered as another important goal of this project. The particle plug propagation is simulated by Eulerian Granular model while the critical velocity determination is simulated using Discrete Phase Model (DPM). The obtained results regarding the propagating particle plug show that Eulerian Granular model in ANSYS Fluent is capable to reproduce the particle plug movement in pipes, specifically the dispersion and transition zones are well captured and show a good qualitative fit with the experimental measurements. The detailed model selection study is conducted which could be potentially used in similar research works. In addition, a slip relation for 1 D particle modelling is proposed which is capable to reproduce the particle <b>dispersion</b> <b>zone</b> at the plug front in an accurate way. DPM model in ANSYS Fluent demonstrated a reasonably good performance in predicting critical velocity in slurry flows, but the value of the velocity is underestimated. Also, it is obtained that the critical velocity is independent on the particle volume fraction which is not the same as in the experimental observations. The obtained results need more investigations with regards to mesh dependency and missing physics in the default DPM model. Further work might address to predicting the value of the particle volume fraction in the dispersion and transition zones of the particle plug using different specularity coefficients. It could useful to obtain a grid independent solution in terms of the value of the first layer thickness. The proposed slip relation for 1 D modelling might be further improved and generalized if all the parameters are described by a single variable, for example, average particle fraction. As for the critical velocity modelling, the better predictions might be obtained if important factors such as particle-particle interaction and Shields parameter are included in the simulations...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{surface melting}} and {{alloying}} are important techniques {{to improve the}} properties of a material locally without affecting the bulk. In ceramic components these methods {{can be used to}} optimise the fracture toughness, friction and wear but also the thermal and electrical conductivity [1]. In order to predict the results of the modification process and to reduce the development time numerical models which simulates the physical processes are gaining importance. The process is characterised by a moving solid-liquid phase boundary during the laser induced melting [2]. Shear forces at the surface of the melt pool lead to convection streams within the liquid phase which determines the mass transport and particle flow of the dispersed phase. Therefore, the modelling of the temperature and the velocity field within the molten region can be used to predict the geometry of the melt pool and the distribution of the second phase particles, respectively. Numerical computations has been performed {{on the basis of a}} finite element model (FEM) in order to get more insight in the heat and particle transport during melting and solidification. The model considers the liquid-solid phase change and also the heat and mass transport due to convection within the molten pool. Commercial software packages (FEMLAB, PHOENICS) has been used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations which describes the fluid flow within the melt pool due to the surface tension gradient which is induced by the localised heat source travelling with a constant speed. Temperature dependent material properties like the thermal conductivity and the heat capacity has been included in the model. In order to simulate the phase change at the moving liquid-solid boundary on a fixed grid the enthalpy-porosity model has been implemented in the FE-model, which fixes the velocity components to zero in the solid phase and allows for a reconstruction of the solid-liquid interface. The results of the calculations give quantitative information about the temperature and the velocity field during the laser process in the ceramic substrate. Above the melting temperature of the ceramic a velocity field appears in the melt pool which is induced by the negative surface tension gradient. Further calculations on the basis of two-phase flow models and particle tracking algorithms has been performed to evaluate the particle distribution after introducing additional materials into the melt. Detailed numerical studies have been performed to calculate the extension of the melt pool and the volume fraction of the particles for a wide range of process parameters like the laser power density and scanning velocity. The calculated results have been confirmed by experiments. It could be shown that the extension of the melt pool and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>zone,</b> as well as the particle distribution depend not only on the laser process parameters process parameters but also on the thermodynamic properties of the ceramic...|$|E
40|$|Seawater {{intrusion}} {{in coastal}} aquifers threatens {{the development of}} coastal areas in many countries around the globe. In spite {{of the number of}} studies that have examined seawater intrusion in different heterogeneous coastal systems and hydrogeological settings, a situation where the coastal aquifer consists of two permeable layers separated by an aquitard with major abstraction from the upper aquifer (as is the case in the Al-Batinah area of Oman) has not been studied yet. This thesis focuses on such a situation and aims to extend existing knowledge about seawater intrusion dynamics and the consequent quality deterioration in such coastal aquifers. A good understanding of the seawater intrusion patterns is essential for improved management of coastal water resources. Shallow groundwater abstraction is expected to speed up seawater intrusion in the upper aquifer compared with that for the lower aquifer. As a consequence, an unstable condition with a complex flow and transport pattern develops. With time, a saline boundary layer (SBL) forms as salt is transported across the aquitard into {{the upper part of the}} lower aquifer, in time inducing instability and convective mixing. The system remains stable when the SBL is confined entirely within the aquitard. The extent and sensitivity of this unstable mixing and the consequential lower aquifer contamination are expected to depend on the hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics of the aquitard and of both upper and lower aquifers. Intensive two-dimensional (2 D) numerical simulations have been performed for different aquitard properties and selected characteristics of upper and lower aquifers to gain an insight into the dynamics of the densitydriven flow. The impacts of different remedial strategies on the transport process are examined. The transport pattern in a three-dimensional (3 D) system is also explored for selected cases. Both qualitative and quantitative measures have been used to analyse the results. These include selected salinity levels (standards for domestic and irrigation purposes), maximum depth of penetration (MDP), and total mass present in the lower aquifer (MtL). The literature presents several numerical codes for solving variable density groundwater flow and transport problems. In this thesis, a finite difference simulator SEAWAT- 2000  is selected and sensitivity of its results to spatial and temporal discretizations and numerical solution techniques is first tested against the Elder-Voss and Souza benchmark problem (EVS). The results are shown to be sensitive to the level of spatial and temporal resolutions for the chosen numerical scheme. A high-resolution mesh is necessary to minimize incorrect seeding of fingers and consequential artificially induced salinization due to numerical errors. The numerical simulations show that the pattern of contaminant-spread from buoyancy induced mixing in the layered coastal aquifer has a complex structure, described as a moving zone of instability. The instability occurs first in the seaward part of the SBL and then moves landward. With time the seaward part of the system begins to stabilize as the vertical density gradient reduces, but instability develops in the landward direction. As a result, previously adopted dimensionless criteria such as Rayleigh Number (Ra), wavelength (@) and wave number (µ) are not readily suited to analyse system stability. Factors that affect the timing of instability onset include SBL thickness and its solute concentration (C), and the upward vertical (Vv) and horizontal flow velocities (VH) within the lower aquifer. Large upward Vv retards the formation of the SBL while large VH increases the dispersion term, which smooths out the initial perturbations and thus impedes the occurrence of the instability. Investigation of the influence of aquitard parameters shows that increases in some (e. g., aquitard dispersivity, and porosity) promote the occurrence of instability and intensify the convective mixing by promoting the growth of the SBL. On the other hand, decreases in some lower aquifer parameters (e. g., smaller lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity) enhance the growth of the initial perturbations of the SBL into fingers. The growth of the SBL alone does not imply occurrence of instability as large flow velocity or high dispersion within the lower aquifer can refresh the bottom part of the SBL, and hence impede the trigger of instability. Factors or conditions that speed up seawater intrusion within the lower aquifer decrease the degree of convective mixing. This is because the unstable vertical density contrast between the upper and lower aquifers does not then develop, and the system regains stability more rapidly compared with cases where the seawater intrusion in the lower aquifer is slow. A higher abstraction rate (Q) speeds up the seawater intrusion and promotes SBL development, and hence an early occurrence of instability. For a specific set of aquifer parameters, the time for the lower aquifer to become unsuitable for domestic or irrigation purposes shortens as the abstraction rate increases. Different management options like discontinuous abstraction, alternating abstraction from the two aquifers, and short-term abstraction regimes are examined for their effects on the convective mixing. For a management option to be effective in reducing the degree of convective mixing, the seawater intrusion in the upper aquifer should be retarded or reversed so that the salt supply to the SBL is reduced. Subjecting both aquifers to continuous abstraction of approximately equal rates results in relatively similar intrusion rates, thereby impeding the onset of instability. While the work in this thesis is not based on an actual case-study, the Al-Batinah region in Oman is used as a reference for model conceptualisation since seawater intrusion in layered coastal aquifers is of major concern there. Given that the rainfall rate is very small in such arid regions, natural recharge (direct from rainfall) is not effective in reversing seawater intrusion in a useful timeframe. However, artificial recharge (through injection wells) can improve the groundwater quality when abstraction is stopped. The <b>dispersion</b> <b>zone</b> in the upper aquifer decreases, thereby slowing the growth of fingers. If abstraction from the upper aquifer continues, obviously a higher recharge rate is needed to reduce the degree of the convective mixing as well as the seawater intrusion in the upper aquifer. When the lower aquifer is recharged, the fingers are smoothed of and the system can become stable even if abstraction continues. With higher recharge rates, the system becomes stable more quickly. Abstraction from the saline wedge is also investigated as a remediation strategy. With cessation of the inland abstraction, saline water abstraction retards the seawater intrusion and so diminishes the size of the developed fingers. Alternating inland abstraction and saline water abstraction does not assist in effective reduction of the convective mixing given that the isochlors recede toward the sea during saline water abstraction and intrude again during inland abstraction. For a management or remedial strategy to be effective in stabilizing, or reducing the intensity of, buoyancy-induced mixing in the lower aquifer, it must induce strong enough horizontal velocity, VH, in the lower aquifer (to eliminate the developed fingers and prevent perturbations at SBL bottom boundary), large upward velocity, Vv (to resist SBL development), or decreases in the seawater intrusion rate in the upper aquifer so that the unstable condition (dense fluid overlying less dense fluid) does not develop. Although the convective mixing patterns are different in 2 D and 3 D simulations, results show that there are similarities in the basic features of finger growth, coalescence, and their response to an increase in the abstraction rate. Based on the limited simulations, the 2 D results are broadly similar to those of the 3 D case and, with appropriate caution; 2 D modelling can provide useful information for water resources management in the aquifer situations studied. The study provides an improved understanding of the fingering process in layered coastal aquifers and thereby contributes to the rational management of layered coastal aquifers...|$|E

A first-order approach in the log conductivity variance is adopted in order to get closed form solutions for the principal statistical moments of the traveltime.

The early branch of f(tau) is a power law, with exponent variable between - 1 and - 0. 5; the behavior is mainly determined by unsaturated transport. The subsoil response is slower than that of the soil. The subsoil is mainly responsible for the tail of f(tau), which in many cases resembles the classic linear reservoir model. The resulting shape for f(tau) is similar to the Gamma distribution. Analysis of the f(tau) moments indicates that the mean traveltime is weakly dependent on the hillslope size. The traveltime variance is ruled by the distribution of distances of the injected solute from the river; the effect is coined as source <b>zone</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The spreading due to the K heterogeneity is less important and obscured by source <b>zone</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The model is tested against the numerical simulation of Fiori and Russo (2008) with reasonably good agreement, with no fitting procedure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{classical}} one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation (ADE) {{gives an}} inadequate description of tracer cloud {{evolution in the}} River Severn, U. K. A solute transport model incorporating the effects of tracer storage in dead zones is presented in which the channel is conceived as being divided into two parallel regions. The bulk flow region occurs in the central part. Its longitudinal dispersive properties are described by the ADE. Adjacent to this, an additional cross-sectional area is defined in which tracer can be stored temporarily in regions of slowly moving water called dead zones. Exchange between the two regions follows a first order rate equation. Applying the model to the River Severn shows that a dispersing cloud's evolution occurs in two distinct stages with a rapid transitional phase. Initially, shear-dispersion is dominant while the tracer particles mix fully over the bulk flow. Once this has occurred, dead zone storage accounts well for the non-Fickian evolution of the cloud. After the transitional phase the dead zone storage mechanism clearly dominates over shear-dispersion. Overall, the combined shear flow <b>dispersion</b> ? dead <b>zone</b> model (D-DZM) provides a much better, physically consistent description of the tracer cloud's evolution than the simple classical ADE approach can do alone.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a dynamic model library of {{components}} for process lines was developed. The analysis addressed characteristic aspects of liquid food process lines, and new models were developed for fluid transitions, <b>dispersion,</b> mixing <b>zones</b> and first-order chemical reactions in pipes and heat exchangers. The computational efficiency {{and accuracy of}} the models were analysed. It was demonstrated that classical models of fluid propagation in process lines could be combined with modern numerical methods to obtain computationally efficient dynamic models for the simulation of dispersed convective flow, with and without chemical reactions. In particular it was demonstrated that a transport delay model was well suited for the simulation of thermal transients due to fluid transitions in heat exchangers. It was shown that the model could be extended to account for dispersion with a method that, although classical in approach, enables a certain freedom {{in the choice of}} degree of discretization depending on the demand for accuracy vs. computational speed. Further extension of the model with first-order chemical reactions to account for microbial deactivation was demonstrated. The usefulness of the dispersed-convection model to predict the extent of mixing zones and the amount of product rejects in continuous processing was demonstrated. The relevance concerning product traceability is discussed and the concept ?fuzzy traceability? introduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{show that}} by {{applying}} accidental degeneracy, we can obtain a triply-degenerate {{state at the}} zone center in the band diagram of two dimensional (2 D) photonic crystal. The <b>dispersion</b> near the <b>zone</b> center comprises two linear bands and an additional flat band crossing at the same frequency. If this triply-degenerate state is formed by the degeneracy of monopole and dipole excitations, we show that the system can be mapped to an effective medium with permittivity and permeability equal to zero. While “Dirac cone ” dispersions can only be meaningfully defined in 2 D systems, {{the notion of a}} Dirac point can be extended to three dimensional (3 D) classical wave systems. We show that a simple cubic photonic crystal composed of core-shell spheres exhibits a 3 D Dirac-like point {{at the center of the}} Brillouin zone at a finite frequency. Using effective medium theory, we can map our structure to an isotropic zero refractive index material in which the effective permittivity and permeability are simultaneously zero at the Dirac-like point frequency (ωD). The Dirac-like point is six-fold degenerate and is formed by the accidental degeneracy of electric dipole and magnetic dipole excitations, each with three degrees of freedom. We found that 3 D Dirac-like points at k = 0 can also be found in simple cubic acoustic wave crystals. Different from the case in the photonic system, the 3 D Dirac-like point in acoustic wave system is four-fold degenerate, and is formed by the accidental degeneracy of dipole and monopole excitations. Using effective medium theory, this acoustic wave system can also be described as a material which has both effective mass density and reciprocal of bulk modulus equal to zero at ωD. For both the photonic and phononic systems, a subset of the bands has linear <b>dispersions</b> near the <b>zone</b> center, and they giv...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} US Department of Energy (DOE) Clean Coal Technology (CCT) {{program is}} to furnish the energy {{marketplace}} {{with a number of}} advanced, more efficient, and environmentally responsible coal utilization technologies through demonstration projects. These projects seek to establish the commercial feasibility of the most promising advanced coal technologies that have developed beyond the proof-of-concept (POC) stage. This document serves as a DOE post-project assessment of the Confined <b>Zone</b> <b>Dispersion</b> Project in CCT Round 3. In 1990, Bechtel Corporation entered into a cooperative agreement to conduct the demonstration project. The Seward Power Station of Pennsylvania Electric Company (now GPU Genco) was the host site. DOE funded 43 percent of the total project cost of $ 12, 173, 000. The project was started in June 1990 and was scheduled to be completed in June 1993. As a result of various operating problems, the schedule was extended into 1994 without additional cost to DOE. Bechtel provided the additional financing and GPU Genco provided electricity, steam, and water to operate the unit. The independent evaluation contained herein is based primarily on information from Bechtel's final technical report (1994) as well as other references cited. Confined <b>Zone</b> <b>Dispersion</b> (CZD) is a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process that removes sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }). A finely atomized slurry of reactive lime, calcium hydroxide or Ca(OH) {sub 2 } is injected into the flue-gas duct work, between the air preheater and the second-stage ESP. The lime reacts with the SO{sub 2 }, forming dry solid reaction products. The downstream ESP captures the 2 reaction products along with the fly ash entrained in the flue gas. The CZD process was demonstrated on Unit 5, a 147 -MWe utility unit with two flue gas ducts. One of the ducts was extended to provide the requisite residence time and retrofitted with the CZD lime injection equipment...|$|R

The resulting Hamiltonian has a form of generalized singlet-triplet t-t’-J model for p-type superconductors and form of usual t-t’-J model for n-type superconductors. In the mean field approximation in X-operator representation we derived equations for Gorkov type Green functions. The symmetry classification of the superconducting order parameter in the case of tetragonal lattice resulted in dx 2 −y 2 - and dxy-types of singlet pairing for both p- and n-type superconductors while s-type singlet pairing don’t take place.

40|$|The {{corrector}} magnets and {{the main}} quadrupoles of the LHC dispersion suppressors are powered by a special superconducting line (called auxiliary bus-bars line N), external to the cold mass and housed in a 50 mm diameter stainless steel tube fixed to the cold mass. As the line is periodically connected to the cold mass, the same gaseous and liquid helium cools both the magnets and the line. The final sub-cooling process (from around 4. 5 K down to 1. 9 K) consists in the phase transformation from liquid to superfluid helium. Heat is extracted from the line through the magnets via their point of junction. In <b>dispersion</b> suppressor <b>zones,</b> approximately 40 m long, the sub-cooling of the line is slightly delayed {{with respect to the}} magnets. This might {{have an impact on the}} readiness of the accelerator for operation. In order to accelerate the process, a special heat exchanger has been designed. It is located in the middle of the dispersion suppressor portion of the line. Its main function consists in providing a local point of heat extraction, creating two additional lambda fronts that propagate in opposite directions towards the extremities of the line. Both the numerical model and the sub-cooling analysis are presented in the paper for different configurations of the line. The design, manufacturing and integration aspects of the heat exchanger are described...|$|R
