The Sixth Sense, then in its fourth week, is a close second after pulling in $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another horror film, 2012's The Possession with $21.1 million.|$|E

5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile {{began after}} the Civil War and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government.

The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their second album, Led Zeppelin {{completed}} several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E
5|$|Fowler's {{performance}} in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an anterior cruciate (knee) ligament injury that {{kept him out of}} action for half the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997.

5|$|In April 1771, Louis Stanislas' {{education}} was formally concluded {{and his own}} independent household was established, which astounded contemporaries with its extravagance: in 1773, the number of servants reached 390.

5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S.

On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam.

5|$|Owing {{to several}} {{academic}} commitments, work on Theory of Literature {{did not begin}} until 1945, after Wellek and Warren received a stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation {{over a period of}} two summers. Wellek and Warren began dividing their responsibilities, at first evenly, but with more work done by Wellek as Warren dealt with the illness, and later loss, of his wife Eleanor in 1946. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> writing Wellek transferred to Yale University (1946) and Warren to the University of Michigan (1948), but collaboration continued.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{continue}} on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with ex-members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, {{decided to focus}} on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remains a member of As I Lay Dying. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.|$|E

5|$|Smetana was {{naturally}} gifted as a composer, {{and gave}} his first public performance {{at the age of}} 6. After conventional schooling, he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague. His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for Sweden, where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg, and began to write large-scale orchestral works. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> his life Smetana was twice married; of six daughters, three died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{play was}} {{performed}} for nine nights, {{by the standards}} of 18th century London a very respectable run. Johnson received £195 17s. for the performances. Robert Dodsley published the playscript on 16 February 1749 and Johnson received an additional £100. Perhaps ironically, in view of its later eclipse, this made Irene the most financially lucrative work Johnson had yet written: <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> his career, only the Dictionary earned him more money.|$|E
5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} little {{to suggest that}} culture in Scotland caught up with developing societies to the south <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> improved climatic conditions. Some finds nonetheless indicate the presence of relatively large and well-organised hunter-gatherer societies. No Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered in Scotland to date. Substantial finds at the village of Dunragit were announced in 2014 including arrowheads, urns and bead necklaces from the Mesolithic. Initial press reports provided no firm dates for these artefacts.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately Hercule {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} after attempts to board Mars failed. Both ships were battered and burnt, with the French suffering at least 290 casualties and the British 90. Hercule was conveyed to Britain in the aftermath and later repaired and served in the Royal Navy until 1810. Both L'Héritier and the deceased Hood were highly praised for their conduct during the battle, which is noted as being a very rare example <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> an action between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman defeat, {{the fleet}} was laid {{up at the}} Golden Horn and left largely {{unattended}} for the following twenty years. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> inactivity, Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn.

On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the repatriation effort, Montana was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 so her original name could be used for one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which placed aggregate tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.|$|E
