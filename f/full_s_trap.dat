30|$|Contemporary {{co-ordinate}} numbering of the HBV genome assigns {{a position}} of 1 to the first “T” nucleotide after the EcoR 1 restriction site (G|AA T TC) when sequenced in the forward direction. Prior to this convention, {{the start of the}} Core region (position 1901 in the contemporary system) was considered to be the first position of the HBV genome. The HBV genome is circular and position 1 happens to occur within the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> (surface) ORF. Therefore, the full nucleotide sequence of the S gene straddles position 1, and the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> ORF does not run contiguously within a linear sequence in the standard orientation. Thus, the start of the S ORF varies depending on the genotype, being 2854 for genotype A, 2848 for genotypes B to F and H, and 2884 for genotype G. In all genotypes, the S ORF ends at position 835. Extracting the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> gene sequence from linear sequence data therefore requires additional sequence processing.|$|R

40|$|Furan, a {{possibly}} carcinogenic compound to humans, and furfural, {{a naturally}} occurring aroma compound, {{can be produced}} in heat - processed foods [1, 2]. Therefore, their simultaneous determination is important for food safety and quality purposes. Headspace techniques coupled to gas chromatography - mass spectro metr y (G C - M S) are often used to analyze process - induced compounds. Although headspace <b>trap</b> (H <b>S</b> <b>Trap)</b> extraction has been recently used for furan quantitation in bread crust [3], this technique has not been used for the simultaneous determination of furan and furfural before. This work presents an optimal design of experiments (O - D O E) approach using random blocks for the multicriteria optimization of H <b>S</b> <b>Trap</b> extraction of furan and furfural from sponge cake for their quantification by G C - M S. A bias related to sample preservation was observed during preliminary tests and eliminated in further assays by considering it as a blocking factor. A tailor - made experimental plan including four instrumental factors (i. e. thermostatting temperature and time, dry purge time, pressurization cycles) and two sample preparation variables (i. e. ratio of water and sample weight [dry basis] and total amount [dry basis]), considering the blocking factor was designed. Response surface models (P - value < 0. 0001; R 2 0. 974 for a ll mode ls) resulted in the identification o f most linear and so me quadratic terms and a few second order interactions as influencing the extraction of furan, furfural and their internal standards, d 4 - furan and d 4 - furfura l. Interestingly, one of the samp e preparation variables, namely the ratio of water and samp le weight (dry basis), showed no effect on furfural extraction, while different profiles for furan and d 4 - furan were observed regarding this factor. A set of optimal conditions for a H <b>S</b> <b>Trap</b> extraction method was, for the first time, success fully defined by using the optima design of experiments methodology and a desirability function...|$|R

40|$|Abstract] Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} health issues in the western world. The ongoing care that the AD patient requires typically causes high stress levels, fatigue, irritation and depression in the caregiver, as well as socio-economical problems. The current study aimed to introduce a support program for carers of AD patients, in order to improve their quality of life. A Questionnaire for Carers and an Anxiety State Feature Questionnaire (STAI) was used to assess the carers. Results showed an overall improvement in the carers' health.
