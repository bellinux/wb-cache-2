40|$|It is {{well known}} that a graph G of order p ≥ 3 is Hamilton-connected if d(u) + d(v) ≥ p + 1 for each pair of nonadjacent {{vertices}} u and v. In this paper we consider connected graphs G of order at least 3 for which d(u) + d(v) ≥ |N(u) ∪ N(v) ∪ N(w) | + 1 for any path uwv with uv ∉ E(G), where N(x) denote the neighborhood of a vertex x. We prove that a graph G satisfying this condition has the following properties: (a) For each pair of nonadjacent vertices x, y of G and for each integer k, d(x, y) ≤ k ≤ |V(G) | − 1, there is an x − y path of length k. (b) For each edge xy of G and for each integer k (<b>excepting</b> <b>maybe</b> one k η 3, 4) there is a cycle of length k containing xy.

40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} {{efficient}} organization of files grows {{with the computer}} storage capabilities. However, a classical hierarchical file system offers little help in this matter, <b>excepting</b> <b>maybe</b> the case of links and shortcuts. OrcFS proposes {{a solution to this}} problem. By redefining several file system concepts, it allows the user to set custom metadata, in the form of “(property, value) ” pairs, to express relationships between files. Using it, the system automatically creates a classified view of its components, in which those having similar characteristics are grouped together. A virtual hierarchy is generated, which provides multiple access paths to the same file. This assures that the data can be classified in a more flexible way and the navigation can be done more intuitively. The traditional concept of directory is extended, to accommodate the user-defined properties. In OrcFS, both classical navigation and query interrogation are possible. The enhanced system is compliant with the Linux’s VFS interface, thus no changes need to be made to existing applications and they may be used in OrcFS. A prototype of the project was implemented in user-space using the FUSE library to reimplement system calls. The performed tests proved that even if introducing new data in the OrcFS implies some overhead, this is negligible compared with the gain obtained when searching for files in an immense file tree structure.

By May 2014, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, so the show was reduced to a single showing weeknights at 6:30pm local time. The show debuted on Toronto's CBLT in July 1966. The 2002 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, TV station CBKST by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction.
