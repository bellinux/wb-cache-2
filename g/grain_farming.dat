As is the case for Tasmania as a whole, Meander's residents are primarily Australian born84.6% compared to 83.6% for Tasmania and 69.8% for Australiaand have both parents born in Australia (75.5%, the same percentage as Tasmania). With few exceptions English is the only language spoken, and more than 80% of residents reported ancestry from Australia or Great Britain. The population has a similar median age to the rest of Tasmania41 years compared to 40but older than the 37 years for the rest of Australia. 47% of residents reported some religious affiliation, 65% of these Anglican and the remainder other Christian churches. All occupied homes are separate buildings, 81.3% of which are owned outright or mortgaged, higher than the 67% for all of Australia. Household income is lower than the state or county; $770 per week for Meander compared to $948 for Tasmania and $1234 for Australia.|$|E

40|$|The {{sources of}} the 51 cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> {{analyzed}} in this report were Telfarm/MicroTel at Michigan State University, plus the AgriSolutions offices in East Lansing, Adrian, Mt. Pleasant, and Alpena. Farm types were assigned using the 1992 Census of Agriculture's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) definitions. Basically, any farm with 50 {{percent or more of}} value of farm sales from one item becomes a farm of that type. Cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> have 50 percent or more of value of combined sales from corn, soybeans, wheat, all varieties of navy beans, oats, and other small grains. This report is a summary of the financial and production records kept by cash grain farmers enrolled in the Telfarm/MicroTel record program through Michigan State University Extension., or were accounting clients of AgriSolutions in Michigan. Farm records were included if a Finan summary was completed on 1999 data including beginning and ending balance sheets, plus income and expenses. The summary was included if cash discrepancy was less than 10 % of gross cash inflow, and if the debt discrepancy was less than $ 1, 000. The averages are reported in the tables below; it should be recognized that considerable variability exist in the data. The unweighted mean of the net farm income for the 51 farms was $ 39, 049; the standard deviation of the mean was $ 92, 641; and the median was $ 16, 184. The unweighted mean of acrescropped (owned plus rented) on the 46 farms that reported crops and yields was 1, 153 acres; the standard deviation of the mean was 1, 083 acres and the median was 805 acres. This report has three purposes: 1) to provide statistical information about the financial results on cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> during 1999; 2) to provide production costs for comparative analysis and forward planning; and 3) to provide information on the trends in resource use, income and costs during the last few years. For cash <b>grain</b> <b>farm</b> averages for 1995, see Staff Paper No. 96 - 86, Michigan Farm Database, New Directions for 1995; it contains averages of 48 cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> calculated with Finansum. Staff Paper No. 97 - 27, Business Analysis Summary for Cash <b>Grain</b> <b>Farms,</b> contains averages of 37 cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> for 1996. Staff Paper No. 98 - 21, 1997 Business Analysis Summary for Cash <b>Grain</b> <b>Farms,</b> contains averages of 38 cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> for 1997. Staff Paper No. 99 - 35, 1998 Business Analysis Summary for Cash <b>Grain</b> <b>Farms,</b> contains averages of 60 cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> for 1998. These staff papers are available from the author, or {{from the bottom of the}} list at: [URL] Finansum allows rapid analysis of group averages with some degree of choice over how the results are presented. I prefer to show the average of the high or low 25 percent by net income, but only if the 25 percent means 6 or more farms. The farm was accepted in the average regardless of whether the farm was a proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation. Finansum will produce a variety of report options; I included a subset in this publication. The farms included in the averages below are not a random sample. They kept their financial records with Michigan State University's Telfarm/MicroTel accounting project, or had their accounting supervised by AgriSolutions. A higher percentage of these farms use debt capital than do all farms in the state. The averages may be representative of bigger and better managed cash <b>grain</b> <b>farms.</b> This document may be found and downloaded from the following: [URL] Production/Industries,...|$|R
5|$|After invading Britain in 43AD the Romans {{crossed the}} Humber Estuary in 71AD {{to invade the}} Northumbrian {{territory}} of the Parisi tribe. From their bridgehead at Petuaria they travelled northwards and built roads along the Wolds to Derventio, present day Malton, and then westwards to the River Ouse where they built the fort of Eboracum. There is evidence of extensive use of the light soils of the Wolds for <b>grain</b> <b>farming</b> in the Roman era. Several Roman villas which were the centres of large agricultural estates have been identified around Langton and Rudston. In the low-lying lands {{on either side of}} the Wolds there was an increase in the number of settlements between 500BC and 500AD as the land became drier and more accessible due to a fall in sea level. The lower-lying land was used for stock breeding. During the last years of Roman occupation Anglo-Saxon raiders were troubling the area and, by the second half of the 5thcentury, settlement by Anglian invaders was taking place in east Yorkshire. Village names containing the elements -ing, -ingham or -ham are Anglian settlement names. As Christianity became established in the area from the 7thcentury onwards, several cemeteries like the one at Garton on the Wolds show evidence of the abandonment of pagan burial practices. In 867AD the Great Danish Army captured the Anglian town of York, and the remnants of the army settled in Yorkshire from 876AD when their leader Halfdan shared out the land among them. Scandinavian settlements have names including the elements -by and -thorpe. Scandinavian rule in the area came to an end in 954AD with the death of their ruler Eric Bloodaxe.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{efficiency}} of Estonian <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> after Estonia s transition to a market economy and during the accession period to the European Union (EU). The non-parametric method Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to estimate the total technical, pure technical and scale efficiency of Estonian <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> in 2000 2004. Mean total technical efficiency varied from 0. 70 to 0. 78. Of the <b>grain</b> <b>farms</b> 62 % are operating under increasing returns to scale. Solely based on the DEA model it is not possible to determine optimum farm scale and the range of Estonian farm sizes operating efficiently is extensive. The most pure technically efficient farms were the smallest and the largest but the productivity of small farms is low compared to larger farms because of their small scale. Therefore, they are the least competitive. Since pre-accession period to the EU, large input slacks of capital have replaced the former excessive use of labour and land. This raises the question about the effects on efficiency of the EU s investment support schemes in new member states. vo...|$|R
