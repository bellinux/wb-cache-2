500|$|Jackson's {{music and}} choreography have {{inspired}} numerous performers. Virgin Records executive Lee Trink expressed: [...] "Janet is an icon and historic figure in our culture. She's {{one of those}} gifted artists that people look up to, that people emulate, {{that people want to}} believe in... there's not that many superstars that stand the test of time." [...] Sarah Rodman of the Boston Herald remarked: [...] "For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child." [...] Music critic Gene Stout commented she [...] "has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves." [...] 'N Sync and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance. Kesha, Beyoncé, Toni Braxton, Aaliyah, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Crystal Kay, Kelly Rowland, Rihanna, and Brazilian singer Kelly Key have all named her an inspiration, while others such as Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas of TLC, Cassie, Nicki Minaj, Keri Hilson, and DJ/singer <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown,</b> have all expressed desire to emulate her. Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: [...] "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style." [...] Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated [...] "scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson" [...] who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as [...] "Janet-come-lately's." [...] Other artists who have drawn comparison to her include Mýa, Brandy, Tatyana Ali, Christina Milian, Lady Gaga, Namie Amuro, and BoA. Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that [...] "s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic Queen of Pop, Beyoncé emerges as her likely successor." [...] Joan Morgan of Essence magazine remarked: [...] "Jackson's Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted. So when you're thinking of asking Miss Jackson, 'What have you done for me lately?' remember that Britney, Ciara and Beyoncé live in the house that Janet built." ...|$|E

50|$|Havana Browns {{become very}} {{attached}} to their family and do not thrive when left alone for long periods. They are curious and interactive {{and need to be}} a part of all that you do. It is common for the <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown</b> to become best companions with the family dog. Many owners also find it surprising how easily they can travel with their <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown</b> without the cats objection.|$|E
50|$|Early this century, a {{group of}} breeders in England again began trying to {{recreate}} {{the vision of the}} early Havana breeders. They made good progress in isolating the chocolate genetics and were consistently producing chocolate, lilac and pointed kittens. In 2011 a registered <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown</b> was imported from Europe and bred back to their Havana orientals. This cats contribution, along with selective breeding for type, began to direct the look of some English Havanas away from its Oriental siblings, and moved them more {{in the direction of the}} <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown.</b> In June 2014 under the breed name Suffolk, this cat gained recognition by the GCCF. The alternative name was used because the GCCF uses the name Havana to refer to a self chocolate Oriental Shorthair, from which they wished to be distinguished. Although a <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown</b> is used in the breeding program of the Suffolk, they are not to be confused as the same breed. The Suffolk is much closer to the Chestnut/Havana Oriental than to the <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown</b> is an {{intelligent}} cat that often uses its paws both to examine objects and {{to communicate with}} its owners. Curiosity brings them to the door as visitors arrive rather than preferring to be hidden as many cats will do. In fact, don't be surprised if a <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown</b> places paws on your thigh and offers a meow of introduction. It is playful and curious, but rarely destructive unless left without companionship. While many are 'lap cats', a few are more content just to sit quietly beside their human companions. On the other hand, you will find {{quite a lot of}} Havana Browns who prefer to ride on the shoulders of their human and help with daily activities. They love to play in and groom your hair - it happens so frequently that you will often find <b>Havana</b> <b>Brown</b> owners who don't even notice their cat doing it until it is pointed out by an observer. It is an odd trait that most all Havana Browns share.|$|E
