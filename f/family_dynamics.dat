5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and <b>family</b> <b>dynamics.</b> It was at this point that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} one of {{its worst}} decline in viewers and several key changes took place to boost the ratings. Network Ten drama executive, Dan Bennett revealed that the show would return to its focus on relationships and <b>family</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Writers created and introduced a new family, the Parkers, who already had a link to Ramsay Street {{in the form of}} Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor).

5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to <b>family</b> <b>dynamics</b> or trauma.|$|E

While Don and Charlie's parents met Charlie's educational needs, Don's needs were neglected. Second, the episode explained the absence of Mrs. Eppes. While creating the series, Heuton and Falacci included Mrs. Eppes in the family. During the show's development, CBS asked the creators to eliminate the role of Mrs. Eppes. The episode was also the first episode to end with a family moment. Falacci and Heuton felt that the family moments would show that the series was about a family.|$|R

25|$|Baller (2006) {{examines}} <b>family</b> <b>dynamics</b> and mobilization for the Revolution {{in central}} Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that {{living and working}} on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons {{took charge of the}} farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 1970s, Friel {{had moved}} away from overtly {{political}} plays to examine <b>family</b> <b>dynamics</b> {{in a manner that}} has attracted many comparisons to the work of Chekhov. Living Quarters (1977), a play that examines the suicide of a domineering father, is a retelling of the Theseus/Hippolytus myth in a contemporary Irish setting. This play, with its focus on several sisters and their ne'er-do-well brother, serves as a type of preparation for Friel's more successful Aristocrats (1979), a Chekhovian study of a once-influential family's financial collapse and, perhaps, social liberation from the aristocratic myths that have constrained the children. Aristocrats was the first of three plays premiered over a period of eighteen months which would come to define Friel's career as a dramatist, the others being Faith Healer (1979) and Translations (1980).|$|E

25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: <b>family</b> <b>dynamics,</b> mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E

40|$|Having a {{child with}} type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{has an impact on}} the <b>family’s</b> <b>dynamics,</b> but less is known about the specific influence the child’s gender exerts. The parents attending a routine diabetic review clinic were asked to complete the Family Adaptation and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES-IV), and associated measures of family communication and satisfaction with family life. 53 mothers and 10 fathers completed the questionnaires, and the results revealed that mothers found communication within the family poorer if the index child was a girl, and felt less satisfied with family life. The fathers reports tended to echo this view. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed, and it is suggested that routine review of children with T 1 D should maintain awareness that family functioning may be experiencing strain, particularly if the index child is a girl...|$|R

This multifunctional song is (a) a father’s moral instruction to his children (“face your fears”), (b) a bit of levity, (c) a sweet stretch showcasing this <b>family’s</b> <b>dynamics,</b> and (d) a hint that bad things can come at you from everywhere, whether from the television set (featuring terrifyingly distorted musical performers) or even a doting grandmother (who, jokingly, fashions herself into a demon goddess).

500|$|Bridget Louise [...] "Didge" [...] Parker is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Eloise Mignon. In 2007 {{the show was}} revamped to boost falling ratings in Australia. As part of this, the show's focus returned to <b>family</b> <b>dynamics</b> and the character of Bridget and her family were created and introduced. Bridget made her first on-screen appearance on 23 July 2007. She arrived in Erinsborough from Sydney with her father and mother, Steve and Miranda. During her time in Neighbours, Bridget's storylines included being run over by Susan Kennedy, {{falling in love with}} Declan Napier, finding her birth mother and falling pregnant at seventeen. In March 2009, the decision was taken to write the Parker family out of the show after both Mignon and Steve Bastoni quit. Mignon wanted to return to her studies and she had had enough of Neighbours. Bridget died on-screen on 21 July 2009 after suffering internal injuries, which she sustained in a car crash. The character was popular with viewers and her pregnancy storyline was voted the best of 2008 during a poll on the official website.|$|E
500|$|Peggy's {{breast cancer}} storyline was devised at the {{suggestion}} of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea [...] "that had been knocking about for a long time." [...] In Lesley Henderson's book, Social Issues in Television Fiction, an EastEnders researcher explains that: [...] "A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with.

There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: [...] "EastEnders is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work.

500|$|The {{psychologist}} Kenneth Zucker and {{the psychiatrist}} Susan Bradley called Sexual Preference a [...] "classic study". Zucker and Bradley maintained that its data {{are consistent with}} those of previous clinical research, including Bieber et al.′s Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals (1962), with Bell et al.′s finding that [...] "detached-hostile father" [...] is relatively characteristic of a majority of the white homosexual men in their study and a minority of white heterosexual men being similar to what was reported by Bieber et al. Zucker and Bradley wrote that the psychoanalytic perspective that views homosexuality as a mental disorder and explains it in terms of <b>family</b> <b>dynamics</b> influenced the way in which Bell et al. conducted their inquiry, and that Sexual Preference must be understood in the context of sexual politics. They suggested that because homosexuality had been delisted as a mental disorder for eight years by the time the book was published, Bell et al. faced a problem if their data [...] "showed a departure from an ideal of optimal functioning in homosexual men". Zucker and Bradley argued that, because of their concern for homosexuals, and also influenced by political correctness, Bell et al. deliberately minimized the [...] "observed significant effects" [...] shown by their study, though they noted that this was also in part an objective interpretation of weak effects. Zucker and Bradley wrote that prior to Bell et al.′s study, researchers were aware that phenomena usually interpreted as parents influencing their children could be interpreted instead as the reverse, and that Bell et al. recognized that [...] "the direction of effects" [...] was a [...] "problematic aspect of their research design". In Zucker and Bradley′s view, resolving the [...] "direction-of-effects issue" [...] raised by Bell et al. through retrospective studies comparing homosexual with heterosexual men will be difficult, and that until then the issue will remain [...] "a matter of theoretical taste." ...|$|E
