5000|$|... meta-Methoxyamphetamine (MMA), {{also known}} as 3-methoxyamphetamine (3-MA), is a {{stimulant}} drug from the amphetamine family. It has similar effects in animal drug discrimination tests to the more widely known derivative 4-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), although with a slightly different ratio of monoamine release, being a combined serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine releasing agent rather than a fairly selective serotonin releaser like PMA. 3-Methoxyamphetamine has similarly appeared on the illicit market as a designer drug alternative to MDMA, although far more rarely than its infamous positional isomer. It produces <b>gepefrine,</b> a cardiac stimulant, {{as one of its}} major metabolites.|$|E
