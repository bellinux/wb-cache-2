40|$|Abstract. The LatinSat-A and –B {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} into low Earth orbit in December of 2002. Built by SpaceQuest, these 11 kg microsatellites carry commercial UHF payloads. Their attitude control systems employ a novel magnetic actuator {{that can provide}} large torques while using very little power. At {{the core of the}} device is a rod of Alnico alloy, capable of storing a 13 Am 2 magnetic dipole. Copper windings around this rod connect to a high-voltage pulse generator. High power pulses can degauss or permanently reverse the polarity of the magnet. A hall-effect sensor provides magnetic <b>field</b> <b>telemetry</b> to the flight computer, and allows for closed-loop control. Once the polarity of the rod is set, no additional power is required to maintain it. Previous SpaceQuest microsatellites have used permanent magnets in their ACS to align them with the Earth’s field. These spacecraft complete two pitch rotations per orbit, so that the side that faces the Earth over the northern hemisphere faces space over the southern hemisphere. The LatinSats can degauss and then reverse their magnets each time they pass over the magnetic equator. This should allow a single side to face the Earth at all times...|$|E

40|$|The thermal ecologies of two elevationally {{isolated}} {{populations of}} adult female Tasmanian Tiger Snakes (Notechis ater sp.) were investigated using stomach implanted radiotelemetry and a comprehensive microclimate monitoring programme. The study sites were Egg Islands, in the Huon Valley in southeastern Tasmania, and at Lake Crescent, {{on the lower}} Western Central Plateau of Tasmania. The study had four primary ims: (i) to determine the microclimatic conditions associated with retreat site and basking site selection; (ii) to record and compare behavioural thermoregulatory response to micrometeorological variation; (iii) to monitor diel rhythmicity and range of body temperatures; (iv) to determine voluntary thermal limits and eccritic body temperatures. This information was used in two ways: firstly, to identify the preferred physical microhabitat of this species; and secondly, to develop two predictive models of adult female Tiger Snake activity. The first is a relatively simple empirical model based on microclimatic correlates of body temperature; the second, a biophysical approach involving analysis of the snake's energy budget. Development of the first model required identification of those environmental parameters and quantities which: (i) trigger emergence; (ii) {{determine the amount of}} time necessary for the daily warm-up phase in differing micrometeorological conditions; (iii) allow the animal to move about within its home-range; and (iv) trigger entry into retreat sites. In order to develop the second model detailed information on body temperatures and on the pertinent microclimatic variables within the animal's immediate vicinity were required. It also required information on the physical dimensions and behavioural characteristics of the animal. In addition, other questions relating to the thermal ecology of this species are asked. The determined correlates of body temperature and daily patterns of activity included total down-welling radiation, global radiation, ground surface temperature, ground heat-flux, and inground temperature. Cloud cover and wind direction were found to influence the snakes thermoregulatory behaviour. The telemetry results, determined in a temperature gradient chamber, showed elevational differences in eccritic mean body temperatures and voluntary thermal limits of non-gravid females, but similar temperatures for gravid females. The <b>field</b> <b>telemetry</b> showed diel rhythmicity and the range of body temperatures for four Egg Island females which showed differences between gravid and non-gravid females. The empirical model was found to explain daily activity and validate assumptions made necessary to develop the biophysical model.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Avian {{movement}} behavior provides {{insight on}} patterns of {{regional and local}} fidelity, habitat and resource requirements, the scale at which individuals perceive the landscape, and the relative influence of the spatial array of resources. Shorebirds (suborder: Charadrii) are a diverse and mobile group of wetland associated species. Large numbers of shorebirds utilize seasonally flooded wetland habitats in the Willamette Valley of northwest Oregon; however, there is little information on fidelity and movements of birds in the region or at other inland sites. Thus, we quantified winter fidelity and movement patterns of radio-tagged Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) in the Willamette Valley in 1998 - 1999 and 1999 - 2000. Prior to <b>field</b> <b>telemetry,</b> we evaluated use of a leg-loop harness design for attachment of radio-transmitters.

Therefore, we determined that the modified harness design was a suitable method for attachment of transmitters to shorebirds. Monitoring of radio-tagged Dunlin and Killdeer indicated interspecific differences in regional fidelity and residency patterns.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of the largest herbivores (elephants and rhinoceroses) from many forests in tropical East Asia may have severe consequences for plant species that depend on them for seed dispersal. We assessed the capacity of Malayan tapirs Tapirus indicus-the next largest nonruminant herbivore in the region-as {{a substitute for the}} lost megafauna in this role by studying their ability to disperse the seeds of nine fleshy-fruited plants with seeds 5 - 97 mm in length. We combined information from feeding trials, germination tests, and <b>field</b> <b>telemetry</b> to assess the effect of tapir consumption on seed viability and to estimate how far the seeds would be dispersed. The tapirs (N= 8) ingested few seeds. Seed survival through gut passage was moderately high for small-seeded plants (e. g., 36. 9 % for Dillenia indica) but very low for medium- (e. g., 7. 6 % for Tamarindus indica) and large-seeded (e. g., 2. 8 % for Artocarpus integer) plants. Mean seed gut passage times were long (63 - 236 h) and only the smallest seeds germinated afterwards. Using movement data from four wild tapirs in Peninsular Malaysia we estimated mean dispersal distances of 917 - 1287 m (range= 22 - 3289 m) for small-seeded plants. Malayan tapirs effectively dispersed small-seeded plants but acted as seed predators for the large-seeded plants included in our study, suggesting that they cannot replace larger herbivores in seed dispersal. With the absence of elephants and rhinos many megafaunal-syndrome plants in tropical East Asia are expected to face severe dispersal limitation problems. © 2011 The Author(s).

40|$|Abstract. The FAST {{magnetic}} field investigation incorporates a tri-axial fluxgate magnetometer for DC and low-frequency (ULF) {{magnetic field}} measurements, and an orthogonal three-axis searchcoil system for measurement of structures and waves corresponding to ELF and VLF frequencies. One searchcoil sensor is sampled up to 2 MHz {{to capture the}} magnetic component of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR). Because of budget, weight, power and telemetry considerations, the fluxgate was given a single gain state, with a 16 -bit dynamic range of – 65536 nT and 2 nT resolution. With {{a wide variety of}} FAST <b>fields</b> instrument <b>telemetry</b> modes, the fluxgate output effective bandwidth is between 0. 2 and 25 Hz, depending on the mode.

The instruments are operating nominally. Early results have shown that downward auroral field-aligned currents, well-observed over many years on earlier missions, are often carried by accelerated electrons at altitudes above roughly 2000 km in the winter auroral zone.

40|$|To gain {{information}} on the microhabitat use, home range and movement of a species, it is often necessary to remotely track individuals in the <b>field.</b> Radio <b>telemetry</b> is commonly used to track amphibians, but can only be used on relatively large individuals. Harmonic direction finding {{can be used to}} track smaller animals, but its effectiveness has not been fully evaluated. Tag attachment can alter the behaviour of amphibians, suggesting that data obtained using either technique may be unreliable. We investigated the effects of external tag attachment on behaviour in the laboratory by observing 12 frogs for five nights before and five nights after tag attachment, allowing one night to recover from handling. Tag attachment did not affect distance moved or number of times moved, indicating that the effects of tag attachment are unlikely to persist after the first night following attachment. We then compared harmonic direction finding and radio-telemetry using data collected in the field. We fitted rainforest stream frogs of three species with tags of either type, located them diurnally and nocturnally for approximately two weeks, and compared movement parameters between techniques. In the field, we obtained fewer fixes on frogs using harmonic direction finding, but measures of movement and habitat use did not differ significantly between techniques. Because radio telemetry makes it possible to locate animals more consistently, it should be preferred for animals large enough to carry radio tags. If harmonic direction finding is necessary, it can produce reliable data, particularly for relatively sedentary species...|$|R

We conducted a 4 -year observational <b>field</b> study using <b>telemetry</b> to evaluate the determinants of migration timing in Atlantic salmon postspawners (kelts). We found that individuals with low energy reserves migrated early to the risky but productive marine habitat, whereas individuals with greater energy reserves stayed in the safe but less productive river habitat until staying became energetically more costly than migrating. For males, the likelihood of overwintering in the river instead of migrating in autumn increased 27 -fold with each increase in body condition index, whereas almost all females overwintered in the river. Among spring migrants, body condition was the strongest determinant of migration timing, and females left the river about 5 days later than males.

40|$|Abstract: Globally, {{freshwater}} ecosystems harbour a disproportionately high biodiversity, yet {{rates of}} loss {{are higher than}} {{for those in the}} terrestrial or marine environment. In Europe, a major reason why member states fail to meet Water Framework Directive requirements to ensure water bodies achieve good ecological status is due to the impact of a high density of river infrastructure, the legacy of a long history of river engineering. Fish passes are widely installed to mitigate for the environmental impact of barriers, yet efficiency is rarely evaluated. Today the need for robust and standardised methods to evaluate fish passes is recognised. This requires identification of areas where understanding is limited, {{and the development of a}} coherent programme of fish pass evaluation so that knowledge gaps may be closed. Coherent <b>field</b> evaluation (<b>telemetry)</b> studies should quantify delay and the efficiency of: a) attraction, b) entrance, and c) passage. Comparisons of efficiencies obtained against predefined goals should be biologically relevant, focusing on values expected to maintain sustainable populations taking into account cumulative impacts of barrier networks. Achieving this would represent a “great leap forward”; but is only half the challenge. It is likely that a standardised evaluation will highlight the high degree of variability in efficiency and that most fish passes perform at levels below expectation. Thus, there is an equally important need to understand why fish passes provide only half-way technologies and partial solutions, and in some cases prove to be ecologically damaging. The main focus of future research should be to improve fish pass design through collaborative and holistic experimental studies that return to fundamental first principles to enhance understanding of fish performance (e. g. swimming, leaping, climbing) and behaviour (e. g. motivation, response to hydrodynamics, acoustics and other stimuli), the results of which are validated in the field...|$|R

In particular, it shows that techniques employed {{in the field of}} radio astronomy are applicable to the testing of large steerable antennas used in the <b>fields</b> of <b>telemetry,</b> space communications and radar. The subject is covered in considerable detail so that the thesis has special significance for antenna engineers unfamiliar with the techniques of radio astronomy. The thesis shows that {{the use of}} extraterrestrial sources for measuring the performance of large antennas is superior to alternative approaches, such as near-field measurements, focused aperture measurements, and far-field measurements involving the use of a balloon, airplane, or satellite. A historical background of extraterrestrial radio emission is presented. This is followed by discussions of the fundamental relationships of radio emission and detection. It is noted that signals from extraterrestrial sources are virtually indistinguishable from noise, with the desired signal varying randomly with time. The effects of atmospheric absorption and refraction on these noise - like signals are examined and the characteristics of emission from the sun, moon, Cassiopeia A, Cygnus A, Taurus A, Virgo A, and various quasars are discussed. Details involving the determination of antenna performance parameters are given including the relationships between the temperature of a source, the temperature of an antenna, the effective area, the aperture efficiency, and the gain of an antenna. Special emphasis is placed on the subject of pointing calibration where it is shown that residual errors after calibration can be as low as 2. 90 millidegrees in azimuth and 3. 45 millidegrees in elevation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{techniques}} are described for determining uncontrolled attitude {{motion of the}} orbital station Mir by means of processing on board measurements of the Earth magnetic <b>field</b> strength and <b>telemetry</b> information about the station orientation parameters and angular rates. The measurement data of the same type, collected on a time interval about a few hours, are processed simultaneously {{by means of the}} least squares methods and integration the station attitude motion equations. The estimations of the mathematical model parameters and initial conditions of an attitude motion are obtained as a result of such processing. The techniques allowed to determine the real station attitude motion in September - December 1999. The motion is divided on two segments. In the first segment (September 7 - 24), the station rotated around its axis of the minimal moment of inertia, which made small oscillation near the normal to the orbital plane. Such mode of the station attitude motion was used {{for the first time in}} the Russian practice. In the second segment (September 24 - December 7), the station was in the mode of biaxial rotation at first and then, after some weeks, it passed to the single axis rotation around the normal to the orbital plane but around the axis of the maximal moment of inertia.

40|$|The {{birth of}} the first low earth orbit {{satellite}} network for packet switched data, was received with much enthusiasm. This enthusiasm was quickly dampened as solution developers went into Chapter 11 (protected liquidation in the USA) and faded away because the introduction of new technology to the market has not been so obvious - the aspects of commercialisation was not taken care off with the necessary caution. The basis {{of this study is to}} establish and assess reasons why commercialisation has been so difficult for solution developers using {{low earth orbit satellite}} communication in the high technology market, while it has been such a long awaited technology in the remote monitoring and <b>telemetry</b> <b>fields</b> In today's economy, the marketing of innovative technologies is of critical importance. Innovations succeed or fail in the marketplace based not just on the soundness of the technology, but also on a company's skills at bringing that technology to market and getting it adopted by customers. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to consumer or industrial marketing often prove inadequate when it comes to the introduction of new products in domains such as telecommunications. This study concentrates on and defines the additional aspects surrounding the commercialisation of discontinuous high technology products in new industrial markets.

40|$|A {{new systems}} {{hardware}} and software architecture is presented. Time-tagging is accomplished on multiple packets of information flowing concurrently at extremely high data rates. In the <b>telemetry</b> <b>field</b> to date, {{there has been a}} serious problem with the inability to properly time-tag multiple incoming data elements simultaneously. It is crucial when flight testing missiles or other aircraft to determine precisely the sequence of events. The hierarchical modified dataflow architecture contains a supervisor module which manages an Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) Time Acquisition Module and several acquisition and processing n-dules within a system. The high speed serial bussing techniques u t i l i z e d allow the time module to source time information to any one or all of the other modules simultaneously. Each module operates autonomously and time-tagging is allowed at any intermediate stage of processing. Archiving of data with the time tag allows high speed retrieval and pro-cessing of time "slices " of data. Temporal inter-relationships between many thousands of data types is determinable in real-time or post-processing.

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} and {{increasing use of}} solar-powered satellite transmitters to tag wild birds, there are few published articles that detail how transmitters should be attached to different species and even fewer assessments of the overall <b>field</b> success of <b>telemetry</b> projects. The scarcity of this information {{makes it difficult to}} plan and budget for telemetry projects effectively. In this paper we present relevant information from a study involving a total of 47 individual ducks of two Afrotropical anatid species, Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiaca and Red-billed Teal Anas erythrorhyncha, using solar-powered GPS satellite transmitters of two different sizes (30 g and 22 g respectively) at three very different southern African sites (Strandfontein wastewater treatment works in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, Barberspan Nature Reserve in the North West Province of South Africa, and Lake Manyame in north-central Zimbabwe). We present a full description of harness design and attachment and a survivorship analysis of the transmitters. Our results suggest that the 30 g units last longer than the 22 g units, with approximately 60 % and 30 % respectively of these PTTs lasting longer than a year; 45 % and 5 % respectively lasting longer than two years; and 20 % and 0 % respectively lasting longer than three years. We strongly encourage the publication of comparable data sets so that future studies that rely on telemetry data can be planned with a realistic set of assumptions and limitations in mind...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} body {{temperatures of}} free-ranging green iguanas (Iguana iguana) on Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles), and how metabolic {{costs and benefits}} of food processing affect body temperatures. Body temperatures of free-living iguanas were mea-sured by radio telemetry. We also used a model, with activity data and operative temperature from taxidermic mounts as inputs, to estimate body temperature of free-ranging animals. Estimated body temperature was highly correlated with telemetered body temperature (mean difference 0. 8 °C). Thus, our model for estimating lizard body temperatures may be useful in <b>field</b> studies where <b>telemetry</b> is not possible. Data from both telemetry and estimation with the model showed that green iguanas maintained relatively constant body temperatures (minimum 32. 9 ± 1. 4 °C; maximum 36. 6 ± 2. 9 °C; mean ± 1 SD) during the midday period (0945 - 1545). Temperature measurements of taxidermic mounts and ambient air showed that body temperatures between 29 °C and 40. 5 °C could readily be attained on Curaçao. Hence, the range of potential body temperatures was much greater than the range of actually achieved body temperatures. Thermoregulatory behavior, food intake, and locomotor activities were recorded along with temperature measurements. Relations between body temperature, daily metabolizable energy intake (MEI), and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were used to examine whether or not observed body temperatures coincide with temperatures at which energy gain from ingested food is high. Our data show that, in these herbivorous reptiles, food intake and digestion explain most of the variation in the observed field body temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — {{this study}} was {{performed}} to implement a modern wireless communication system for data collection and communication by using GSM Communication Network as a platform based on SMS. The system depends on EasyPIC 5 microcontroller development board as a modern digital communication system together with a smartg 100 (GSM) development boards; both development boards are developed and manufactured by mikroElektronika. This system is {{used to measure the}} water level in a <b>field,</b> and implement <b>telemetry</b> over wireless communication network system which Present a solution for irrigation system as an application. In this research a Pressure Sensor (E-Tape Million Pressure sensor) and handmade sensor are used to measure water level value, and calibrating the results. Water level measurement system includes a control center (Base station), a GSM modems, and a telemetry unit (Sub Station), on the other hand the author developed friendly user interface for the wireless telemetry by means of Visual Basic which connect the base station with substations, and create a data base to save a historical data of measured water level. In this Research the author developed an alarm system by using buzzer and flashing leds to warn if there are any errors at any station. Compared to other telemetry systems, in this system the measured data does not sent continuously but it is only sent when the data value is changed, so it provides a minimum size of data reserved in the room service and reduce the cost, on the other hand the other systems send measured data continuously so it reserve the channel all the time and increase the cost. On the other hand in this system we have two way actions, and alarm system which determine the error, where, and how to fix...|$|R
40|$|Lake trout {{populations were}} extirpated {{from the lower}} four Great Lakes by 1960 and from Lake Champlain by 1900. The decline of lake trout populations fueled a wave of restoration-based {{research}} that spanned the Great Lakes and filled {{in many of the}} gaps in our knowledge of lake trout behavior and ecology. However, remarkably little is known about lake trout spawning behavior, even less about sex-specific differences in spawning site use. Lake trout use specific spawning sites, and may return to the same site year after year. More males are caught on spawning sites than females and are present at spawning sites earlier in the spawning season. The focus of this project is to describe the spawning movements of male and female lake trout within and among spawning seasons and spawning sites. I used acoustic telemetry in Lake Champlain to look at specific questions of spawning site fidelity and whether or not there were differences in male and female movements. I hypothesized that males show site fidelity and remain at a preferred site during the spawning season, whereas females 2 ̆ 7 sample 2 ̆ 7 multiple spawning reefs to maximize their reproductive success. I established an acoustic telemetry array of ten acoustic receivers placed over eight spawning sites and implanted acoustic transmitters (tags) in 44 male and 48 female lake trout over two years. During two spawning seasons, males spent more time on spawning sites than females. Both male and female lake trout that were active on monitored sites during the spawning season selected a single preferred site. There was no difference in the number of sites visited by males and females. Of the lake trout detected during both spawning seasons, most returned to their capture site in the subsequent spawning season, showing evidence of site fidelity. I also developed a binomial rolling residence test (BRR test) to improve the current method of assessing the duration of a fish 2 ̆ 7 s residence at a single receiver. I measured daily detection probabilities (DP) at a given distance from a receiver site. The BRR test evaluates a tag 2 ̆ 7 s residence every minute by moving a one-hour time window centered on time t across the duration of the data. The daily DPs are incorporated into a binomial test of the null hypothesis that a fish is not within x meters of the receiver at time t. I performed a 48 -hour stationary residence test using two onsite tags and two offsite tags and compared the performance of the BRR test to three residence assessment methods found in the literature. The results showed that the BRR test performs better than all of the time-threshold residency evaluations in our 48 -hour stationary residence test. We suggest that this method has the potential to advance the <b>field</b> of <b>telemetry</b> by improving the interpretation of telemetry data...|$|R
