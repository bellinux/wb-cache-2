PURPOSE A 3 -dimensional (3 D) high-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) histomorphometric analysis of cadaveric proximal humeral <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosities</b> (GTs) was performed to guide optimal positioning of lateral row anchors in posterior-superior (infraspinatus and supraspinatus) TOE rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS Thirteen fresh-frozen human cadaveric proximal humeri underwent micro-CT analysis. The histomorphometric parameters analyzed in the standardized volumes of interest included cortical thickness, bone volume, and trabecular properties. RESULTS Analysis of the cortical thickness of the lateral rows demonstrated that the entire inferior-most lateral row, 15 to 21 mm from {{the summit of the}} GT, had the thickest cortical bone (mean, 0. 79 mm; P =. 0001), with the anterior-most part of the GT, 15 to 21 mm below its summit, having the greatest cortical thickness of 1. 02 mm (P =. 008).

40|$|Aims: There {{is still}} {{considerable}} controversy {{as to whether}} or not the margins of a cuff tear, lined with an inflammatory infiltrate, should be excised during surgical suture. We have verified whether this problem could be resolved in advance by inviting patients to take an anti- inflammatory drug before surgical treatment. Material: Thirty-eight patients were randomly either treated with an anti-inflammatory drug for two weeks. During the arthroscopic repair, few fragments of supraspinatus edge were excised and microscopically evaluated. Results: No significant differences emerged among samples belonging to the two groups. ln all cases, we observed inflammatory infiltrate lined tear edges. Fibrocytes and newly formed vessels were detected near the margin. Dystrophic calcifications were observed in both groups. Distant from the edge, the tendon appeared hypocellular; containing areas with myxoid or fatty degeneration. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that an anti-inflammatory drug is unable to resolve the inflammatory infiltrate. This incapacity is reasonably due to a scarce blood supply to the cuff, which, in case of rupture, is deprived of vessels coming from the <b>great</b> <b>tuberosity.</b> Further studies are needed to understand how to eliminate the inflammatory process and clarify whether it might be an obstacle to cuff healing and promote a re-tearing of the sutured cuff...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{modalities}} {{of treatment}} {{are being used}} {{for the management of}} proximal humerus fractures. Primary hemiarthroplasty in proximal humerus fracture is indicated in three or four part fracture or fracture dislocations. It is also indicated if fracture involves a large area of articular cartilage loss and viability of head is doubtful. We studied the functional outcome of hemiarthroplasty in comminuted proximal humerus fracture. Materials and Methods: 29 patients of three or four part proximal humerus fractures, (according to Neer's classification) who underwent primary shoulder hemiarthroplasty were included in this retrospective study. 20 patients were of more than 55 years of age. Functional evaluation based on Constant score and radiological assessment by periodic X-rays were done. All patients were operated in a 'beach chair position'. The lesser and <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosities</b> were dissected with their tendinous attachments and were later reattached to the proximal humerus for stability of the prosthesis. Cemented prosthesis was used in all cases. Results: Three patients died and two patients were lost to followup {{during the course of the}} study, so 24 patients were finally included in the study. Mean Constant score was 56. 62 (range 42. 5 - 65. 5) after mean followup of 18. 28 months (range 12 - 24 months). Mean anterior elevation was 118. 2 ° (range 75 °- 150 °) and mean active abduction was 102 °(range 50 °- 135 °). Nineteen patients (79. 16 %) were satisfied about their functional outcome. Proximal migration of tuberosity was present in four patients. These patients had decreased abduction with impingement. One patient had higher placement of prosthesis and one patient had radiolucency at bone cement interface. There were no heterotopic ossification, dislocation, superficial, or deep infection. Conclusion: This study showed that hemiarthroplasty in a grossly comminuted proximal humerus fracture is a viable alternative to osteosynthesis. Tuberosity healing plays a main role in good range of motion and better functional outcome after shoulder hemiarthroplasty...|$|R
5000|$|Although the subscapularis is {{the major}} and most {{powerful}} muscle of the rotator cuff and has an enormous meaning in the gleno-humeral stability and dynamic it is neglected in the clinical literature. Despite its importance and impact on conservative or surgical treatment, operative planning and approach or post-surgical prognosis. Lo and Burkhart even tagged the subscapularis tendon hypercritically as the [...] "forgotten tendon". That arises by the gap of the described tear prevalence in cadavers between 29 and 37% and in clinical studies around 27%. This is likely related to the difficulties in radiological, arthroscopic and even open surgical assessment of this particular muscle and its tendon, especially for inferior tears. For example, even full-thickness tears can be mimicked by intact tendon fibers or overlying scars attached to the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity.</b> Since the strong stabilizing effect of the coraco-humeral ligament a possible muscle retraction can be expeditiously underestimated.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThere are no {{published}} studies on bone {{density of the}} <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> of the humerus, which could influence the stability of reinsertion by suture anchors. The goal of our {{study was to determine}} the influence of age, gender and the type of tear on the quality of bone in the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity.</b> MethodologyNinety-eight patients over the age of 60 were included, 41 without a rotator cuff tear and 57 with an isolated stage 1 or 2 supraspinatus tear and fatty infiltration (FI) ≤ 2. The areas of measurement included cancellous bone located under the cortex of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity.</b> Measurements were obtained either across from the tear or from the middle facet with <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> if the cuff was not torn. We measured average, maximum and minimum bone density and the standard deviation (SD) in each region with Osirix software. ResultsThe two groups were similar for age (73), investigated side and mean densities (0. 282 g/cm 2 vs 0. 210 g/cm 2). Age over 70 was a predictive factor for osteoporosis of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> whether or not a rotator cuff tear was present (P< 0. 0001). There was less trabecular bone in women with cuff tears (P= 0. 009). Stage 2 cuff retraction was predictive of osteoporosis of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> (P= 0. 0001). ConclusionThis is the first study in the literature to evaluate bone density of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> in relation to the presence or not of a rotator cuff tear in an elderly population. Female gender, age over 70 and stage 2 cuff retraction are factors responsible for osteoporosis of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> of the humeral head. The osteoporosis is not severe, and normally the quality of bone of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> should not limit stability of suture anchors. Level of evidence 3...|$|E

Two radiologists with different experience levels evaluated 61 MRAs. Assessment was independent, blinded and non-sequential. For 40 MRAs, surgical reports were available to assess diagnosis accuracy and influence of observer experience. The assessed lesions were cuff lesions, Hill-Sachs lesions, bony and classic Bankart lesions, <b>greater</b> humeral <b>tuberosity</b> fractures, SLAP lesions and joint capsule lesions. Reproducibility was quantified using kappa coefficients. Accuracy was evaluated with sensitivity and specificity rates, positive and negative predictive values. Differences {{in the percentage of}} correctly diagnosed MRAs between the radiologists were tested using McNemar's test for paired proportions. Inter-observer k-values ranged from 0. 03 for joint capsule lesions to 0. 45 for humeral head lesions. The overall kappa was 0. 21 (95 % CI; 0. 12 - 0. 30).

40|$|SummaryMalunion of a {{proximal}} humerus fracture {{is difficult}} to manage once bone union has been achieved in a wrong position. Malunion may be encountered after conservative treatment or internal fixation of fractures, and also around a joint prosthesis. The malunion can involve the <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>tuberosities,</b> humeral head, bicipital groove, or the entire epiphysis. The nature of the malunion must be precisely characterized. Malunion can affect bone structures and the articular surface; any resulting displacements must be carefully measured. Clinical assessments will help to evaluate the functional repercussions and determine the need for correction. Radiographic imaging and CT scan guide the treatment plan. Arthroscopic surgery (acromioplasty or tuberoplasty) {{can be used to}} treat biceps tenosynovitis or impingement syndrome in cases where full correction of the malunion is not required. Corrective surgery of a metaphyseal malunion is used to realign the proximal humeral into the proper position.

40|$|Introduction: Radiographic {{findings}} of the shoulder joint {{have been reported in}} patients with rotator cuff tear, <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> changes are among the most reported. The aim of this work is to assess the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> sclerosis as a radiographic sign of rotator cuff tear and its relation to the tear size. Patients and methods: This study was conducted from July 2009 until May 2013 in a retrospective fashion and included 425 patients, 250 females (58. 8 %) and 175 males (41. 2 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to report an arthroscopic {{treatment}} method for <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> malunion. Eight patients with malunion of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> were treated by arthroscopic acromioplasty, detachment of rotator cuff, tuberoplasty of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> and repair of the rotator cuff. On the basis of the UCLA rating scale, the overall score increased from 11. 1 (range 9 – 14) to 30. 2 (range 25 – 35) postoperatively, with one excellent result, six good results, and one poor result. All patients had less pain than preoperatively. Full activity level was achieved in two patients, five patients had only slight functional restriction, and one patient had mild limitation in activities of daily living.

40|$|Shoulder {{adhesive}} capsulitis is a pathological condition {{characterized by an}} involvement of the glenohumeral capsula and ligaments with a progressive and severe reduction {{of the range of}} motion. Frozen shoulder often comes on for seemingly no reason at all (primary type) but may follow a trauma or shoulder sugery (secondary type). There are three phases to frozen shoulder: - Freezing (painful phase, 1 - 8 months) - Frozen (stiff phase, 9 - 16 months) - Thawing (recovery of mobility, 12 - 40 months) Methods Authors refer their experience from 2002 to 2005 with 25 severe frozen shoulders. Fifteen patients (6 males and 9 females {{with a mean age of}} 57 years: range 26 to 68 years) underwent arthroscopic capsular release and closed manipulation (group A). A second group of 10 patients (6 females and 4 males with a mean age of 52 years, range 35 to 65 years) were treated with intra-articular corticosteroid injections and rehabilitation (Group B). In group A this syndrome followed a shoulder trauma in only two patients and a rotator cuff tear with progressive loss of motion in four patients; no etiologic cause was found in nine patients. Among these patients, authors report a case of a 37 years female who developed a frozen shoulder after a <b>great</b> <b>tuberosity</b> fracture occurred during alpine skiing. In group B one patient present a MRI with a partial supraspinatus tear and one snowboarder developed frozen shoulder after surgical treatment for a partial articular tear. All the patients were evaluated by international functional scoring scales (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form –ASES-, Constant and Murley, Simple Shoulder Test and UCLA). Results The pre-operative range of motion of the shoulder in group A was measured with goniometry (side to side); the mean abduction of the involved shoulder was 60 °; the mean external rotation 20 °, the mean flexion 75 °; during the internal rotation patients were never able to reach the lumbo-sacral vertebra. Under general anesthesia, twelve patients underwent shoulder manipulation and arthroscopic capsular release, while in three patients authors performed a mobilization of the shoulder after the arthroscopic release. A subacromial bursectomy was executed in all cases; an acromioplasty was done only in three patients with subacromial impingement and a tenotomy of the long head of biceps was done in one patient because of sever tendinosis. All the patients with a rotator cuff tear (four) underwent an arthroscopic suture (in two cases delayed after recovery of full range of motion). At a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 3 to 45 months) were reviewed all the patients of group A. They all referred an improvement in range of motion and a decrease of pain. Post- operative physical examination showed a mean abduction of nearly 150 °, a mean ER of 45 ° and a mean flexion of 165 °; fourteen patients were able to reach the lumbo-sacral junction during the internal rotation. All the postop functional evaluation scales also showed relevant improvements. There was any case of fracture, dislocation or other complication. Results of group B are still under review because of their short follow up; however preliminary results are encouraging. Conclusion In patients with severe {{adhesive capsulitis}}, the goal of treatment is pain reduction and recovery of shoulder mobility. Patients with frozen shoulder unresponsive to traditional conservative treatment can be effectively treated with arthroscopic capsular release and closed manipulation. Anyway, the second group of patients treated by intra-articular corticosteroid injections seems to show encouraging preliminary results, resolving in some cases the frozen shoulder and avoiding surgical treatment. More detailed studies are necessary to establish if gleno-humeral infiltrations may represent first choice treatment in severe adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{treatment}} of fracture-dislocation of the shoulder, {{in which the}} <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>tuberosities</b> are fractured and a large capital fragment is dislocated are not usually very good (Neer, Brown and McLaughlin 1953; Knight and Mayne 1957). The production of this four-fragment fracture, as described by Codman (1934), makes closed reduction hard to achieve and open reduction very difficult. When this injury occurs in an elderly patient conventional methods of management may be sufficient to provide restoration of some movement.

Materials and Methods: Of the 518 cases included in this study, a group of 234 cases had a chronic rotator cuff tear and a control group of 284 cases had an intact rotator cuff in shoulder MRI. The degree of degenerative changes was classified according to the length of spur and morphological change of acromion and <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> through the true anteroposterior simple radiograph in supraspinatus outlet view. The degree of tear (partial-thickness or full-thickness tear) and the size of complete rotator cuff tear were analyzed according to the MRI findings of shoulder. The authors also evaluated the correlation between the degree and size of torn rotator cuff and the degenerative change of acromion and <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity.</b> Results: There were significant differences in the size and extent of torn rotator cuff according to the age, sex and degenerative change of acromion and <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> of humerus (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} iatrogenic humeral neck fracture after attempted closed reduction in patients older than 40 years who present with a first-time anterior dislocation. Design: Retrospective cohort study, evidence-based medicine level IV. Patients: Ninety-two patients older than 40 years (mean 66. 6 years of age) with a first-time anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Intervention: Closed reductions by the emergency medicine physicians under conscious sedation, in the emergency department. Main Outcome Measurements: Prevalence of iatrogenic fracture on postreduction radiographs. Results: Nineteen (20. 7 %) patients were diagnosed with a concomitant <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> fracture on initial radiograph. In the postreduction radiographs, 5 patients (5. 4 %) were identified with a postreduction humeral neck fracture, {{and all of them}} had a <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> fracture on initial radiographs. A highly significant association (P < 0. 0001) was observed between the finding of a <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> fracture on the initial radiographs and the occurrence of iatrogenic humeral neck fracture after close reduction. Discussion: Previous case reports have described an iatrogenic humeral neck fracture with reduction attempt of shoulder dislocation. In our retrospective study, 21 % of the cohort of patients older than 40 years had a concomitant <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> fracture; 26 % of them had an iatrogenic humeral neck fracture after reduction attempt under sedation in the emergency room.

Neer developed a classification system based on fracture pathoanatomy and on the presence or absence of displacement of one or more of the four major bony segments (surgical neck, anatomic neck, <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>tuberosity).</b> The AO classification system included the concept ofperfusion of the articular segment. Edelson divided humeral head fractures into five basic types that correspond to some degree to the Neer classification, but dijfer significantly regarding the most complex patterns offracture. Furthermore, an interohserver reliability study indicated the improved usefulness of the 3 -D concept in providing a common language among clinicians for classifying these injuries. Finally, Hertel developed a classification system for better understanding the predictors of humeral head ischemia. In conclusion, a fracture must be classified for understanding its severity and guiding the treatment. Radiographics are often not sufficient for establishing the number offragments and the entity of their dislocation. 3 D-CT scans allow medial hinge condition and other predictors of humeral head ischemia to be better understood...|$|R

H 577 P RS 2016 Lamxxxi, 395 pagesBackground: The {{proportion}} of the world's population {{over the age of}} 65 years and of older adults living with dementia is increasing exponentially. From a physical perspective, aging is associated with a decline in strength, balance, and mobility that increases the risk for falls and affects the independent living capacity of older adults. As reduced activity levels lead to the deterioration of physical function, early identification and intervention are needed to improve the health and lifespan of older adults. Whole-body vibration therapy (WBV) could be a potentially effective intervention to enhance the benefits of exercise and improve physical function among older adults. As WBV is simple to use, it could be particularly suitable for older adults with cognitive impairments. The overall aim of this thesis was to consolidate existing knowledge regarding the therapeutic effects of WBV training on balance and mobility in older adults, and to provide new insights into the application of WBV training for older adults with dementia. These aims were achieved through a set of six integrated studies. Study 1 (Chapter 2) : This systematic review aimed to examine the effect of WBV on balance, mobility and falls among older adults. The databases used included MEDLINE, the Excerpta Medica database, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Library Databases of Systematic Reviews, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), PubMed, and Science Citation Index (last search in October 2011). Randomized controlled trials that investigated the effect of WBV on balance, mobility or falls in older adults were included in this review. The PEDro score was used to examine the methodological quality of the selected studies. The effect of WBV on balance, mobility and fall-related outcomes were extracted. The data extraction and rating were performed by a researcher and the results were confirmed by the principal investigator. Meta-analysis was done if 3 or more studies measured the same outcome of interest. Among 920 articles screened, fifteen articles (thirteen trials) satisfied the criteria and were included in this review. Methodological quality was good for six of the studies (PEDro score= 6 - 7). Meta-analysis revealed that WBV has a significant treatment effect in Tinetti Total Score (p< 0. 001), Tinetti Body Balance Score (p= 0. 010) and Timed-Up-and-Go test (p= 0. 004). No significant improvement was noted in Tinetti Gait Score after WBV training (p= 0. 120). The effect of WBV on other balance/mobility outcomes and fall rate remains inconclusive. To conclude, WBV may be effective in improving relatively basic balance ability and mobility among older adults, particularly frailer ones. More good-quality WBV trials are required. Study 2 (Chapter 3) : This was a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at reviewing the effect of exercise on physical functioning and quality of life in people with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods and results: An electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and The Cochrane Library Databases of Systematic Reviews. The last search was performed on April 25, 2015. Two independent researchers screened and selected randomized controlled trials studying the effect of physical exercise on physical functions and quality of life in individuals with cognitive impairment as the primary diagnosis. Information on participants' characteristics, training protocols, outcomes measures of interest, compliance, and adverse effects were extracted. Metaanalysis was conducted if five similar studies measured comparable outcomes. Thirty seven clinical trials were included. This review revealed strong evidence in support of using supervised physical exercise training to improve strength, mobility, step / stride length, walking speed and quality of life in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Moderate evidence also supported the use of exercise in improving balance, flexibility, endurance, and activities of daily living. The effects on dual-tasking ability, functional performance, and falls remained inconclusive. Less severe cognitive impairment was a determinant of better response to exercise training. To conclude, individuals with cognitive impairments should engage in supervised integrated exercise for about 60 minutes a day and 2 - 3 days a week to improve physical functioning and quality of life. Study 3 (Chapter 4) : Objective: This study aimed to investigate how WBV frequency, amplitude, exercise and their interactions influenced leg muscle activity in elderly adults. Study Design: An experimental study with repeated measures design that involved a group of ambulatory, community-dwelling elderly adults (n= 30; 23 women; mean age= 61. 4 ± 5. 3 years). Main outcome measures: Muscle activity of the vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), and gastrocnemius (GS) was measured by surface electromyography (EMG), while participants were performing seven different exercises during 4 WBV conditions (condition 1 : frequency= 30 Hz, amplitude= 0. 6 mm, intensity= 2. 25 units of Earth's gravity (g); condition 2 : 30 Hz, 0. 9 mm, 3. 40 g; condition 3 : 40 Hz, 0. 6 mm, 3. 65 g; condition 4 : 40 Hz, 0. 9 mm, 5. 50 g) and a no-WBV condition in a single experimental session. Results: Significantly greatermuscle activity was recorded in VL (3 % to 148 %), BF (16 % to 202 %), and GS (19 % to 164 %) when WBV was added to the exercises, compared with the same exercises without WBV (p≤ 0. 015). The effect of vibration intensity on EMG amplitude was exercise-dependent in VL (p= 0. 002), and this effect was marginally significant in GS (p= 0. 052). The EMG activity induced by the four WBV intensities was largely similar, and was the most pronounced during static erect standing and static single leg standing. Conclusions: The EMG amplitude of majority of leg muscles tested was significantly greater during WBV exposure compared with the no-WBV condition. Low-intensity WBV can induce muscle activity as effectively as higher-intensity protocols, and may be the preferred choice for frail elderly adults. Study 4 (Chapter 5) : This was an experimental study aimed at examining the transmission power and purity of vertical (synchronous) whole-body vibrations upon its propagation in the human body among older adults. Methods and results: Forty older adults were tested (33 women; mean age: 60. 3 ± 5. 7 years). Four vibration frequencies (25, 30, 35, 40 Hz), two amplitudes (0. 6 and 0. 9 mm), and six different postures were tested (total 48 conditions). Skin-mounted triaxial accelerometers were placed at the medial malleolus, tibial <b>tuberosity,</b> <b>greater</b> trochanter, third lumbar vertebra, and forehead. The transmissibility of vibration was computed as the ratio of the root-mean-square-acceleration at different body sites to that of the platform. Signal purity was expressed by the percentage of total transmitted power within ± 1 Hz of the nominal frequency delivered by the platform. It was found that signal transmissibility was dependent upon the interaction between frequency and posture and, to a lesser extent, the interaction between amplitude and posture. Increasing frequency and amplitude was associated with lower transmissibility. Significant resonance was noted at the medial malleolus. Among different postures, tip-toeing led to the lowest transmissibility. Single-leg standing had the highest WBV transmission to the hip, while erect standing had a significantly higher transmissibility to the head than other postures. The purity of the vibration signal was well conserved as the vibrations were transmitted from the feet to the upper body. To conclude, WBV transmissibility is highly influenced by signal frequency, amplitude and posture. These parameters should be carefully considered when prescribing WBV to older adults. Study 5 (Chapter 6) : This was a randomized controlled trial that aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of whole body vibration (WBV) on enhancing the outcomes of a comprehensive exercise training program to improve physical function among institutionalized older adults. Methods and results: Seventy-three institutionalized older adults were randomly allocated to one of three training groups: group 1, a comprehensive strength and balance training program combined with WBV; group 2, a comprehensive strength and balance training program without WBV; and group 3, social and recreational activities consisting of upper limb exercises only. All participants completed 3 training sessions per week for 8 weeks. Measured outcomes included assessment of mobility, balance, lower limb strength, walking endurance, and self-reported balance confidence. Outcomes were measured pre- and post-intervention. Participants were also followed up for 1 year {{after the end of the}} training session to record the incidence of falls that required medical attention. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the post-intervention change of measured variables, from baseline, between-groups. The intent-to-treat analysis identified a significant time × group interaction for lower limb strength, evaluated using the time to complete 5 repetitions of sit-to-stand (p= 0. 048). Post-hoc analysis identified the interaction effect to be contributed by the improvement in lower limb strength for the exercise group without WBV, compared to a decline in strength in the control group (p= 0. 030). No significant time × group interaction was identified for other outcomes (p≥ 0. 065). To conclude, adding WBV did not enhance the effect of a comprehensive exercise program on the physical function of institutionalized older adults. Although our exercise program was effective in improving lower limb strength, there were no therapeutic effects on balance and mobility. A longer program duration and more challenging balance activities may be needed to improve balance and mobility in these individuals. Study 6 (Chapter 7) : This was a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the feasibility, safety, and therapeutic effectiveness of WBV in improving lower limb strength, balance, and mobility among individuals with mild or moderate dementia. Methods and results: Fifty-four older adults (40 women; mean (SD) age: 79. 8 (6. 1) years) with mild or moderate dementia were recruited from two day-care centers. They were randomly allocated to either the WBV training group (intervention group) or usual care in the daycare center (control group). The intervention period lasted for nine weeks (18 sessions). All subjects were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and three months after the intervention ended. The primary outcome was functional mobility, measured using the Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test. The following secondary outcomes were evaluated: balance, using the Berg Balance Scale; lower limb strength, using the time to complete 5 repetitions of sit-to-stand; quality of life, using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease questionnaire; and balance confidence, using the Activities specific Balance Confidence scale. The feasibility and safety of the WBV intervention were evaluated in terms of attendance rate, the incidence of adverse events, and feedback provided by trainers. The attendance rate for the training was high (86. 0 %) with a very low incidence of adverse events: 2 of the 27 participants reported mild knee pain. WBV did not provide additional benefits compared to usual care for the primary outcome and for all secondary outcomes assessed. To conclude, WBV training is feasible and safe to use with people with mild or moderate dementia. However, nine weeks (18 sessions) of vertical WBV (30 Hz, 2 mm peak-to-peak amplitude) did not yield further improvement in physical function and quality of life than a usual activity program, provided at a daycare center, among community-dwelling older adults with dementia. Conclusion: The transmission of WBV through the human body is complex and will be highly influenced by the intensity of WBV and by exercise postures used for training. Although WBV does augment activation of lower limb muscles during exercise, our two randomized controlled trials did not provide evidence of the effectiveness of WBV in improving physical function among institutionalized older adults or among community-dwelling older adults with mild or moderate dementia.

40|$|We {{examined}} cultured osteoblasts {{derived from}} paired {{samples from the}} <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> and acromion from eight patients with large chronic tears of the rotator cuff.

By contrast, we found that cells from both regions were {{able to respond to}} dexamethasone, a well-established promoter of osteoblastic differentiation, with the expected increase in alkaline phosphatase activity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Twelve patients, {{ranging in}} age from thirty-four to seventy-two years (average, fifty-three years), were {{evaluated}} an average of five years (range, two to eight years) after open reduction and internal fixation of a two-part displaced fracture of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> of the proximal part of the humerus. The indication for operative reduction was one centimeter or more of displacement of the fracture as seen on the di-agnostic radiographs. The anterosuperior deltoid-split-ting approach, combined with rotation of the humerus, allowed adequate exposure of the retracted tuberosity. Internal fixation of the <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> with heavy, non-absorbable sutures and careful repair of the rotator cuff permitted early passive motion.

All patients have received an early (one week after the injury) rehabilitation program based on physical analgesic therapy means, techniques for recovering range of motion, strengthening exercises, proprioceptive stabilization exercises and usability advices.

40|$|Background: Diagnosing {{impingement}} syndrome without {{rotator cuff}} tear usually {{depends on the}} physical examination and roentgenography, and obtaining objective evidence for this condition is at best difficult. The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain whether quantitatively assessing this condition with using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) can diagnose impingement syndrome and predict the postoperative results. Methods: Before executing arthroscopic or open treatment, SPECT was performed on 73 patients and 24 volunteers and these people were followed up for 2 years. Any increased uptake on SPECT was investigated by using the axial view, which demonstrated the greatest uptake for the acromion, distal clavicle, <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity,</b> lesser tuberosity and the coracoid process of the operated and non-operated sides. Results: The patients who were diagnosed as having impingement syndrome with or without rotator cuff tear showed increased uptake on the operative side compared to the non-operated side in the assessed locations. The <b>greater</b> <b>tuberosity</b> of the humerus could be used for quantitative measurement as a postoperative prognostic factor.
