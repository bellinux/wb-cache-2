40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether steroids that induce lung maturation have acute effects on <b>higher</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>function</b> {{in the human}} fetus. Methods: Cortical auditory-evoked responses (CAERs) were recorded from 10 singleton fetuses between 29 and 34 gestational weeks by fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) using transabdominal auditory stimulation prior to and within 3 hours after administering 2 12 mg of betamethasone, at an interval of 18 and 24 hours. Results: The components of the CAER complex were categorized according to their latency: P 2 pm (186 þ 20 ms, 90 %), N 2 pm (260 þ 34 ms, 50 %), P 3 pm (474 þ 36, 50 %). In almost all of these cases the peak latencies of the fetal P 2 pm (P. 042) and P 3 pm (P. 043) were delayed after exposure to betamethasone (Wilcoxon rank test).

40|$|Advances in {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) have moved the technology beyond its application solely as a diagnostic test to become a tool for addressing questions of in vivo pathophysiology and <b>higher</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>function</b> in humans. Diffusion-weighted MRI measures the apparent rate of translational movement of water molecules through brain parenchyma. This measurement {{can be used to}} determine axonal orientation within white matter, to define regions of tissue edema, and to permit early identification of ischemic neuronal injury related to impairment of Na+-KATPase activity in experimental and human stroke. Changes in various aspects of cerebral perfusion&mdash;blood volume, blood flow, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation&mdash;can be mea-sured with MRI, and altered cerebrovascular circulation and regional brain activation can thereby be inves-tigated.

40|$|Abstract Background Traditional {{electroencephalography}} {{provides a}} critical assessment of pain responses. The perception of pain, however, may involve {{a series of}} signal transmission pathways in <b>higher</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>function.</b> Recent {{studies have shown that}} a mathematical method, the neuronal avalanche model, may be applied to evaluate higher-order network dynamics. The neuronal avalanche is a cascade of neuronal activity, the size distribution of which can be approximated by a power law relationship manifested by the slope of a straight line (i. e., the α value). We investigated whether the neuronal avalanche could be a useful index for nociceptive assessment. Findings Neuronal activity was recorded with a 4 × 8 multichannel electrode array in the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Under light anesthesia, peripheral pinch stimulation increased the slope of the α value in both the ACC and S 1, whereas brush stimulation increased the α value only in the S 1. The increase in α values was blocked in both regions under deep anesthesia. The increase in α values in the ACC induced by peripheral pinch stimulation was blocked by medial thalamic lesion, but the increase in α values in the S 1 induced by brush and pinch stimulation was not affected. Conclusions The neuronal avalanche model shows a critical state in the cortical network for noxious-related signal processing. The α value may provide an index of brain network activity that distinguishes the responses to somatic stimuli from the control state. These network dynamics may be valuable for the evaluation of acute nociceptive processes and may be applied to chronic pathological pain conditions. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} non-motor {{symptoms}} (NMS) of Parkinson’s disease (PD), particularly the neuropsychiatric symptoms of visual hallucinations, apathy and impulse control disorders. A clinical cohort study and pathology study were performed. PD patients (N= 94) were recruited and each underwent neurological examination for motor {{aspects of the}} disease, detailed multi-domain cognitive assessment including executive and visuoperceptive function, and a battery of validated non-motor assessments for symptoms including mood, apathy, sleep, fatigue, psychosis, autonomic function, disability and health-related quality of life (QOL). A subgroup (N= 50) also had detailed ophthalmological examination. In the autopsy study, the presence of ante-mortem visual hallucinations (VH) in PD donors was correlated with Lewy body (LB) density and distribution at different cortical locations. The clinical study examined the impact of NMS on QOL and found that NMS, particularly depression, had stronger association with QOL than motor scores, but despite this NMS were often under-reported by their treating neurologist. A significant proportion of pathologically confirmed PD patients presented exclusively with NMS and this led to misdiagnosis and, in some cases, inappropriate investigations and treatment. An aetiological model of VH was proposed and examined; factors investigated included dopaminergic medication, <b>higher</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>function,</b> sleep and ophthalmic pathology. Clinical associations of VH were {{rapid eye movement sleep}} behaviour disorder, autonomic function, and executive and visuoperceptive cortical function. There was however no clear association with co-existing ophthalmic pathology. In the post-mortem analysis, LB involvement at corresponding cortical areas was confirmed, including frontal (executive) and temporal and trans-entorhinal (visuoperception) cortices.

The aims of this study were to understand the age-related change in ERPs in {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 13 years and to establish a normal reference value for Taiwanese children for use in future study of neurocognitive dysfunction in children. MethodsUsing an auditory oddball paradigm, ERPs were recorded in 63 mentally and physically normal children ages 6 to 13 years. Parietal, central, and frontal ERP long-latency components (N 1, P 2, N 2, P 3) were measured in each test participant. ResultsLinear regression analysis demonstrated a significant linear decrease in P 3, P 2, N 2, and N 1 latencies and a significant linear increase in P 3, P 2, and N 1 amplitudes in children between the ages of 6 and 13 years. P 3 latency was significantly longer in children ages 6 – 7 years than in older children. The parietal P 3 latency decreases 6. 7 msec per year from ages 6 to 13 years. A wide variation in P 3 latency in the children ages 6 – 7 years and a significant increase in P 3 amplitude in those ages 12 – 13 years were observed from our data. A significant increase in P 2 amplitude was also observed in children older than 10 years. ConclusionThe authors conclude that there exists an age-related change in ERP latency and amplitude during childhood. A negative correlation between ERP latencies and age and a positive correlation between ERP amplitude and age were found in this study. The authors emphasize that the auditory ERP value in children is not equal to that of adults. A normative auditory ERP value in children should be established prior to clinical application...|$|E

The analyses were completed on the combined scores obtained from a sample of normal, brain-damaged, and psychiatric populations. A second version of the LNNB {{was published}} in 1985 as a largely parallel version of Form I, but included changes in stimulus materials, administration procedures, and scoring procedures. The present study completed factor analyses on same eleven clinical scales using data generated with the newer LNNB Form II. The statistical procedures and criteria employed in the present investigation were identical to those used earlier on Form I to allow for comparisons between the two resulting sets of factor structures. The patient populations were different, however, in that all subjects in the current study were receiving inpatient care in a private psychiatric hospital which specializes in long-term treatment. Despite the changes in materials and procedures and the difference in subject parameters, the factors identified in the present investigation are similar to those seen in the Form I studies. However, two trends were observed when comparing the two sets of factor structures. First, in the present study several items were excluded from the statistical procedures because they were performed perfectly by almost everyone and the resulting scores lacked statistical variance.
