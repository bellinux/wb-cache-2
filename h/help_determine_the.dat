5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M.

5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} the season, several {{meteorological}} services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), Coastal Carolina University (CCU), Colorado State University (CSU), and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014–16 El Niño event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of between 66 and 103 units.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes {{within a particular}} year. According to NOAA, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1950 and 2005 contained 10.3 tropical storms, 6.2 hurricanes, 2.7 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index, {{but the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season are occasionally considered as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of the}} differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|In advance of, and during, each {{hurricane}} season, several {{forecasts of}} hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts.

5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{being an}} entirely new class of {{celestial}} bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering {{whether or not they}} exist would yield insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. If they exist they might contain material left over from the earliest period of planet formation, and <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> conditions under which the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet's surface appear older than it actually is. If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints on planet formation and suggest that other processes have been at work in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.|$|E
5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked through the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would <b>help</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E
