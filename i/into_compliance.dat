5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought <b>into</b> <b>compliance</b> with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company {{became the}} first company {{in the nation to}} be prosecuted and fined for failing to {{implement}} a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act. The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come <b>into</b> <b>compliance.</b> Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E

40|$|Historically, tax {{compliance}} {{has been a}} highly interdisciplinary avenue of research to which economics, psychology, law, sociology, history, political science, and accountancy have made valuable contributions. It is less well understood, however, whether we can glean useful insights <b>into</b> tax <b>compliance</b> by moving beyond the social sciences. In particular, the literature pays {{little attention to the}} relevance of biology. This paper therefore examines the potential opportunities and limitations of introducing biological concepts <b>into</b> tax <b>compliance</b> research...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is on the burden imposed by all aspects of {{compliance}} with tax obligations in New Zealand (NZ). It explores the levels of research <b>into</b> tax <b>compliance</b> costs undertaken in NZ and the outcomes of that research, and compares this data with comparable international experience. It establishes that NZ has a sound track record of research <b>into</b> tax <b>compliance</b> costs, at least at the government level, and certainly so far as research <b>into</b> business tax <b>compliance</b> costs is concerned. The outcomes of that research also suggest that NZ compares favourably with many other developed countries including its OECD counterparts in terms of the compliance cost burden faced by business and non-business taxpayers...|$|R

25|$|Faubus's {{opposition}} to desegregation was likely both politically and racially motivated. Although Faubus had {{indicated that he}} would consider bringing Arkansas <b>into</b> <b>compliance</b> with the high court's decision in 1956, desegregation was opposed by his own southern Democratic Party, which dominated all Southern politics at the time.

40|$|Simplifying {{procedures}} and improving legislation generally {{lead to a}} reduction in the compliance costs. The introduction of pre-filled tax returns clearly simplifies the tax compliance procedure. Before the introduction of pre-filled tax returns for personal income taxpayers in Slovenia, tax legislation was also modified. This paper presents the results of research <b>into</b> the <b>compliance</b> costs for personal income taxpayers before and after the simplification of the compliance procedure in Slovenia, irrespective of tax legislation itself not being simplified. The results indicate that pre-filled tax returns reduce compliance costs for personal income taxpayers by around 73 %. Nevertheless, this is only a tentative estimate, since several assumptions are taken <b>into</b> account. <b>compliance</b> costs, personal income tax, pre-filled tax return, Slovenia...|$|R

Cooley maneuvers Morton into confessing the truth of Gelman's assertions to Senator Anderson who subsequently re-opens the subcommittee's hearings, thus enraging the President. When the President's attempts to buy Anderson's cooperation fail he places enormous pressure on Majority Leader Robert Munson to entice Anderson <b>into</b> <b>compliance.</b> In a moment of great weakness that Munson will regret {{the rest of his}} life, Munson provides the President a photograph, acquired quite innocently by Munson, that betrays Anderson's brief wartime homosexual liaison.|$|E

25|$|In early 2008, the FAA {{issued a}} Special Federal Air Regulation (SFAR) {{directed}} at MU-2B operations.

The agency also required that a fully functional autopilot be available for single-pilot operations, and that FAA-approved checklists and operating manuals be on board at all times. Unusual for this SFAR, pilot experience in other aircraft types cannot be used to comply with MU-2 operational requirements. For instance, the requirement to perform landings within the preceding 90 calendar days before carrying passengers is altered by this SFAR to require those landings {{be made in the}} MU-2.|$|E
