40|$|This thesis {{was focused}} on {{laboratory}} testing of usage of the selected plant material Iris sibirica (flowers) as dyeing plants. In the experiment, which {{was an integral part}} of the thesis, we prepared the dye bath in nine different ways with two dyeing intervals (30 and 60 minutes). Altogether we dyed thirty-six pieces of fabric. Specifically, there were: basic filtrate dipped cloth filter base with cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> soda, basic filtrate with cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> salt, a basic filter cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> a vinegar base filtrate with cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> bleach, basic filtrate added substance - soda with cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> soda, basic filtrate added ingredient - salt with a cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> salt, basic filtrate added ingredient - vinegar with a cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> vinegar, basic filtrate added substance - bleach with a cloth <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> bleach. The dye baths and their dyeing potential were tested on cotton fabric. From all the dye baths were obtained highly saturated colors. Color range of samples was from light yellow - orange trough purple to dark green. However, given the procedure without the use of mordants degraded colors of cloth samples in 60 days to shades of orange-brown. Results of the experiment showed that the iris flowers provide a very wide range of colors and these plants are perspective coloring material, however, the color instability is a pointer that leads to the necessity of using metal stains...|$|R
50|$|The wet lefse is <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> water, {{and then}} placed within a towel which {{has also been}} <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> water and wrung out. Many people {{maintain}} that <b>dipping</b> <b>in</b> salted or seawater enhances the flavor. The dry lefse regains its bread-like texture in about 60 minutes. Often that time is used to prepare such ingredients as eggs or herring which are wrapped in the lefse once it has softened.|$|R
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} an injury-plagued one for Ginóbili, who {{suffered}} foot and ankle injuries that hindered {{his ability to}} play. He managed 65 games in the regular season, but saw a <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> major statistics {{as compared to the}} previous season. During the playoffs, he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. To persuade them, Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E
5|$|However some {{properties}} have so {{far gone}} unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which {{may be due to}} unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. One possible explanation of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it loses its electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small dust particles partially corotate with the planet, they will move outward during the shadow pass creating an outward extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain a <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> the particle distribution and ring's brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.|$|E
50|$|His {{opinion is}} based on the {{remarkable}} subtlety of the used wheat flour, which is close to grain sizes of modern flours, as well as the incision and the <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> holes. Such <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> holes are also known from an ancient Egyptian find dating around 2000-1778 BCE as well as from mosaics at the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna dating to the 6th Century. However, the <b>dipped</b> <b>in</b> hole on the Ovelgönne bread roll is the earliest prehistoric evidence for this technique in Europe.|$|R

5|$|In 1983, Reynolds {{fell ill}} with {{multiple}} myeloma, {{a type of}} blood cancer that often attacks the bones, {{and was forced to}} stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{failed to}} reach the quarter-final stages of a ranking event {{for the first time}} this season: losing 4–5 to Joe Swail in the last 16. This began a run of poor form that saw O'Sullivan lose in the opening round of the Masters 2–6 to Jimmy White and then in the second round of the Thailand Masters 4–5 to Shokat Ali (losing the {{deciding}} frame on a re-spotted black). O'Sullivan returned to winning ways, by capturing the Irish Masters title by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, before he experienced another <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> form losing to Mark Davis in opening round of the Scottish Open.|$|E

5|$|Juventus and Buffon {{began the}} 2009–10 season strongly, {{although}} the squad suffered a severe <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> form {{as they were}} eliminated from the Champions League, finishing third in their group. They were subsequently eliminated in the Round of 16 of the Europa League against Fulham. Juventus were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia to eventual champions Inter, and finished the Serie A season in a disappointing seventh place, only qualifying for the 2010–11 Europa League through the playoff round. Buffon was often sidelined that season, due to several recurring injuries. In 2010, Buffon was voted goalkeeper of the decade by IFFHS.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c was {{the first}} Kepler target to be {{observed}} using Spitzer {{with the hope of}} detecting a shallow transit <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> a light curve. At the time of Kepler-10c's discovery, Spitzer was the only facility capable of detecting shallow transits in the Kepler data to an extent at which the data could be meaningfully analyzed. The planet was also the third transiting planet that was validated through an analysis of statistical data (rather than actual observation), after the planets Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. In Kepler-10c's confirmation paper, the Kepler team discussed how a large fraction of planets in Kepler's field of view would be confirmed in this statistical manner.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E

5|$|The {{behavior}} of double-dipping involves consuming chips and dip, taking {{a bite of}} the chip, and then re-dipping it into a <b>dip.</b> <b>In</b> March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated {{that they would not}} consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.|$|E
5|$|The half-lives of {{nobelium}} isotopes increase smoothly from 250No to 253No. However, a dip {{appears at}} 254No, and beyond this the half-lives of even-even nobelium isotopes drop sharply as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode. For example, the half-life of 256No is almost three seconds, {{but that of}} 258No is only 1.2milliseconds. This shows that at nobelium, the mutual repulsion of protons poses a limit to the region of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series. The even-odd nobelium isotopes mostly continue to have longer half-lives as their mass numbers increase, with a <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> the trend at 257No.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{playing fields}} to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that {{has evolved into}} a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to a <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E

5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
5|$|For most of November and {{the early}} part of December, Gourcuff {{suffered}} a <b>dip</b> <b>in</b> form in league play going scoreless and also not providing any assists. Manager Laurent Blanc later stated that Gourcuff had lacked confidence since returning from his injury following Gourcuff's second penalty miss of the season in the club's midweek 1–0 victory over Montpellier on 16 November. However, three days later, Gourcuff returned to form scoring a goal and providing the assists on the other three goals in Bordeaux's 4–1 win over Lorient. On 20 December, he was declared by magazine France Football the French Player of the Year for 2009 beating out the likes of Nicolas Anelka, Hugo Lloris, Thierry Henry, and Franck Ribéry; the latter having won the award the past two seasons prior.|$|E
