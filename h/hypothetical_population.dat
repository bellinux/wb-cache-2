25|$|National LEB figures {{reported}} by statistical national agencies {{and international organizations}} are indeed estimates of period LEB. In the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, LEB was 26 years; the 2010 world LEB was 67.2 years. For recent years, in Swaziland LEB is about 49, and in Japan, it is about 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of 60 or 70 would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 may have few people dying at precisely 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate {{of death in the}} first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, LEB can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low LEB will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, LEB will be about 36, but about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood; in the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>population</b> above, life expectancy at 5 would be another 65. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used along individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.|$|E

40|$|Background Reliable {{information}} on {{causes of death}} is a fundamental component of health development strategies, yet globally only about one-third of countries have access to such information. For countries currently without adequate mortality reporting systems there are useful models other than resource-intensive population-wide medical certification.

This paper provides methods for addressing appropriate sample size considerations in relation to mortality surveillance, with particular reference to situations in which prior {{information on}} mortality is lacking. Methods The feasibility of model-based approaches for predicting the expected mortality structure and cause composition is demonstrated for populations in which only limited empirical data is available.

40|$|I {{explore the}} sample size in {{qualitative}} research that is required to reach theoretical saturation. I conceptualize a population as consisting of sub-populations that contain different types of information sources that hold a number of codes. Theoretical saturation is reached after all the codes in the population have been observed once in the sample. I delineate three different scenarios to sample information sources: "random chance," {{which is based on}} probability sampling, "minimal information," which yields at least one new code per sampling step, and "maximum information," which yields the largest number of new codes per sampling step. Next, I use simulations to assess the minimum sample size for each scenario for systematically varying <b>hypothetical</b> <b>populations.</b> I show that theoretical saturation is more dependent on the mean probability of observing codes than on the number of codes in a population. Moreover, the minimal and maximal information scenarios are significantly more efficient than random chance, but yield fewer repetitions per code to validate the findings.

Application of the measures to risk models for <b>hypothetical</b> <b>populations</b> and for postmenopausal US women illustrate several points. First, model performance is constrained by the distribution of true risks in the population. This complicates the comparison of two models if they are applied to populations with different covariate distributions. Second, the Brier Score and the Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) are more useful than the concordance statistic for quantifying precision gains obtained from model expansion. Finally, these precision gains are apt to be small, although they may be large for some individuals. We propose {{a new way to}} identify these individuals, and show how to quantify how much they gain by measuring the additional covariates. Those with largest gains could be targeted for cost-efficient covariate assessment. Comment: 17 pages, 3 tables, and 5 figure...|$|R

An orbit based on a 9 day arc and the asteroid's location near Mars' L 5 (trailing Lagrangean) longitude led E.

Subsequent observations strengthened the possibility, and later calculations confirmed it. Thus 1990 MB is the first known asteroid in 1 : 1 resonance with a planet other than Jupiter. The existence of 1990 MB (a small body most likely between 2 and 4 km in diameter) provides remarkable confirmation of computer simulations.

However, some genetic models have shown that under some conditions, population subdivision can favor heterozygosity and allelic diversity, and small populations may adapt to inbreeding. Here I investigate the relationship between population subdivision and genetic diversity for the marsupial Micoureus paraguayanus (Tate, 1931) using the program Vortex. <b>Hypothetical</b> <b>populations</b> of 100 and 2000 individuals were partitioned into 1, 2, 5 or 10 populations that were linked by varying rates of dispersal and also by sex-biased dispersal. Results suggested that heterozygosity and allelic diversity declined rapidly when a population was subdivided. Genetic and demographic stochasticity diminished the effectiveness of selection against recessive lethal alleles. Dispersal partly reversed the impacts of population subdivision. However, even high rates of dispersal did not eliminate demographic fluctuations or prevent extinction. Although gene flow largely prevented genetic divergence between populations, dispersal did not prevent heterozygosity from being lost more rapidly in subdivided populations than in single populations of equivalent total size. The dynamics of small, fragmented populations were critically dependent on interactions between demographic and genetic processes.

40|$|Comparisons of the {{strength}} and form of phenotypic selection among groups provide a powerful approach for testing adaptive hypotheses. A central and largely unaddressed issue is how fitness and phenotypes are standardized in such studies; standardization across or within groups can qualitatively change conclusions whenever mean fitness differs between groups. We briefly reviewed recent relevant literature, and found that selection studies vary widely in their scale of standardization, but few investigators motivated their rationale for chosen standardization approaches. Here, we propose that the scale at which fitness should be relativized should reflect whether selection {{is likely to be}} hard or soft; that is, the scale at which <b>populations</b> (or <b>hypothetical</b> <b>populations</b> {{in the case of a}} contrived experiment) are regulated. We argue that many comparative studies of selection are implicitly or explicitly focused on soft selection (i. e., frequency and density-dependent selection). In such studies, relative fitness should preferably be calculated using within-group means, although this approach is taken only occasionally. Related difficulties arise for the standardization of phenotypes. The appropriate scale at which standardization should take place depends on whether groups are considered to be fixed or random. We emphasize that the scale of standardization is a critical decision in empirical studies of selection that should always warrant explicit justification...|$|R
