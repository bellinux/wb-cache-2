40|$|Despite {{being the}} most widely {{distributed}} and cultured freshwater crayfish species in Australia, relatively {{little is known about}} the ecology of Cherax destructor outside of captivity. Similarly, few ecological studies have been conducted on the large and threatened stream dwelling Australian freshwater crayfish Euastacus bispinosus. A series of seasonal sampling surveys over two years investigated the population structure, life history and reproductive timing of C. destructor in <b>fire</b> <b>dam</b> habitats, and of E. bispinosus in channel (stream) habitats, in the Grampians National Park in south-west Victoria, Australia. Cherax destructor individuals in the largest size class (50 – 59. 95 mm OCL) were not abundant during the study, while those belonging to the 0 – 9. 95 mm OCL size class were more frequent in summer than at other times of year, suggesting synchronous recruitment in <b>fire</b> <b>dam</b> habitats. Individuals in the reproductively active mid-size classes were also frequent in summer. For E. bispinosus, sex ratios in spring always favoured females, although there were no clear trends for other times of year. Gravid E. bispinosus females were found in winter and spring throughout the study, and were sexually mature at a smaller size than has previously been reported...|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{events like}} wildfire, {{flooding}} and drought, and {{activities related to}} managing these events (<b>fire</b> <b>dam,</b> bridge and road construction and water regulation) potentially impact freshwater crayfish populations, although limited information exists. Our study analysed abundance data for four freshwater crayfish species across an 11 -year period, including pre- and post-wildfire and post-flooding data, and described the impacts of human actions on their populations in the Grampians National Park in Victoria, Australia. Wildfire and flooding were generally associated with reduced crayfish abundances for Euastacus bispinosus, Cherax destructor, Geocharax falcata and Gramastacus insolitus, but in some habitats, C. destructor, G. falcata and G. insolitus did not decline. A general trend of decreasing abundances for all species was evident over the study period, likely due to the landscape-scale impacts of wildfire, flooding and the shrinking of available habitat during drought. Southeastern Australia is a crayfish biodiversity hot-spot and increased frequencies of wildfire, flooding and drought are forecast for this region as climate change progresses, threatening crayfish populations. Therefore, {{it is important that}} disaster recovery management seeks to minimise additional damage to crayfish habitat availability and connectivity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{underground}} coal mines, {{the energy}} difference from sealed fire area to general mine atmosphere and variations in atmospheric pressure cause leakage, which {{can affect the}} stable status of sealed fire area even lead to reburning. In this study, a quantitative analysis method was presented to optimize ventilating energy distribution, which coupled the atmospheric pressure fluctuation. The method {{was applied to the}} sealed fire area management in a high gas emission coal mine. Based on analysis results, the “one into and four outs” system, four <b>fire</b> <b>dams</b> in air-outflow condition with continuous nitrogen injection, was realized stably by setting up adjustable ventilation facilities reasonably. After the ventilating energy distribution was optimized, oxygen and carbonic oxide concentration of sealed fire area declined remarkably with less than 5 % and 10 ppm respectively.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} literature {{describing the}} potential for freshwater anthropogenic waterbodies to act as refuges from disturbance. We identified research related to the refuge potential {{of a wide range}} of waterbodies, using waterbody names as keywords along with 'artificial' and 'freshwater'. Potential freshwater anthropogenic refuges were more often standing than running waters. Agricultural ponds, rural and urban drainage ditches and transport canals were the most diverse for all aquatic taxa, whereas irrigation infrastructure was least diverse. Comparatively little is known about the refuge role of <b>fire</b> <b>dams,</b> urban artificial ponds, golf course lakes, disused industrial ponds and retaining walls. Local-scale attributes associated with high biodiversity were: presence of macrophytes (for animals), absence of fish (for amphibians, invertebrates), natural bed materials and hydroperiod (all biota). Landscape variables associated with high biodiversity were proximity to and connectivity with other waterbodies and to natural terrestrial vegetation. Moderate levels of management intervention were also associated with higher biodiversity. Many knowledge gaps about the function of anthropogenic refuges within landscapes exist and require further research. One of the most important limitations to the provision of refuges for freshwater biodiversity by anthropogenic waterbodies is the lack of recognition of their actual or potential biodiversity value. Anthropogenic waterbodies need to be recognised for their potential to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation for freshwater species, while being managed to prevent the spread of invasive species...|$|R

50|$|Working {{conditions}} for laborers on the projects (which Rousseff has insisted should continue, and even be accelerated, with some sites seeing multiple work shifts so that construction can continue {{more than twenty}} hours per day) were harsh, while pay was low despite a high cost of living at the remote construction sites.

In the spring of 2012, 17,000 workers at the Jirau Dam site went on strike for over three weeks, and later some began looting company stores, setting <b>fire</b> to <b>dam</b> structures, and destroying worker housing.

In 1869 a major flood apparently damaged the mill beyond repair, and it may also have damaged the dam; it washed out the bridge then standing just downstream.

Our highlighting of problems and difficulties, however, is an attempt to suggest and imply ways of further improving their efficiency and effectiveness in crisis situations. We should also note that as pre-planned EOCs have become standard features of local American community life in the last few years, some of the following observations were more relevant in the past than now. Likewise, our observations are less applicable to disaster prone communities than to areas with little disaster experiences. However, while these qualifications are necessary in specific instances, nevertheless, what follows is probably a rather accurate picture of the problems and difficulties in the use of local EOCs in natural disasters in American society...|$|R

Some comparative static results with respect to changes in income and risk behavior are derived. As some of the sketched risks are insurable while some others are not, we introduce further the possibility of risk coverage by private market insurance. We analyze the interaction of such an insurance with the public good level, both for efficient provision and for private provision equilibria. It turns out that the levels of self-insurance and self-protection decrease when being privately provided. Moreover, it appears a strategic substitutability between the public good and market insurance which leads to an additional decline of the provision levels...|$|R
