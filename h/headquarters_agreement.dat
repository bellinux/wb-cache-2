50|$|In the United Kingdom, up to 1950, people {{affiliated}} with a university were allowed a vote in both a university constituency and their home constituency, and property owners could vote both in the constituency where their property lay and that in which they lived, if the two were different. Therefore some university-educated property owners could vote in three different constituencies.

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the {{privileges and immunities}} granted to organizations under international conventions, in particular <b>headquarters</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded between the international organizations and the state on the territory of which the quarters of the organization are situated. It endeavours to trace {{the historical development of}} the establishment of the international organizations, the manner of their establishment, the controversy about defining the international organization, the types and the various divisions. An International organization is one of the persons of public international law, {{as a result of the}} changing circumstances in the international relations due to the appearance of international organizations, and to the jurisprudential promotion in respect of persons of international law, which has discarded the concept of the persons of international law being restricted to states alone. The thesis {{discusses the}} legal status of international organizations, the recognition of the legal status, and respect of privileges and immunities, which are required by functions of international organizations. The immunities of international officials and the immunity of funds of the international organizations, the quarters, documents and business are provided in the instruments establishing the organization. Likewise the thesis discusses enjoyment, by the international organizations, of legal status in domestic laws and its capacity to acquire estates and conclude contracts. The instruments of the international organizations provide for this capacity, and particularly in such agreements, the organization may conclude with states, in whose territory the quarters are situated. Such capacity has been referred to by the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion concerning the compensation for damages which the United Nations had sustained in Palestine. The capacity of the international organization to exercise the rights recognized in the domestic law, particularly in the states parties to the organization result from this status. The thesis considers in detail the subject of the immunity necessary for exercising function of the international organization and protection of the officials and representatives, as one of the effects of the recognition of the legal status for an international organization. It dealt with general conventions and protocols in this respect such as the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations ١٩٤٦ (The General Convention), and the ١٩٤٧ Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies. The quarters agreements signed by the Sudan with regional organizations grant privileges and immunities to the organization and its employees. Also there are privileges and immunities pertaining to country offices of the UN, the specialized agencies and other organizations, and the legal status of national and foreign NGOs, operating in the Sudan, and which have signed agreements of quarters with the governments. The thesis concludes that the agreements concerning international organizations in the Sudan lack many safeguards, since they are not provided for in some of these agreements. The principles concerning granting immunities have to be included therein. The thesis recommends the establishment of a mechanism at the national level to be responsible for revision, establishment, co-ordination and evaluation of the work of international organizations resident in the Sudan, and to submit periodical reports to competent bodies, and that the state has to use its right to waive such immunities, whenever it deems that such immunities impede the progress, in order to guarantee the sovereignty of the state and its territory...|$|R

ICLARM should broaden its participation in intercenter activities, and expand partnerships with NARS and ARIs. ICLARM should continue to explore opportunities for a <b>headquarters</b> facility and <b>agreement</b> in the Philippines, and consider the technical issues involved in relating its strategy to the unique opportunity of the proposed site in Egypt.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of the Basic Principles of the <b>Headquarters</b> <b>Agreement</b> presents a unique challenge for the PrepCom. As explained earlier, the two-step process for {{the conclusion of the}} <b>headquarters</b> <b>agreement</b> has never been utilized before in the history of international organizations.

The process, which may look somewhat cumbersome, managed to forge a heightened level of understanding among the Bureau, the host country, and the U. N.

40|$|Paper {{prepared}} by two legal consultants for the CGIAR Secretariat on the control, ownership and {{legal status of}} CGIAR center germplasm collections, internationally and within their host countries. The document was considered at a joint meeting held in Rome January 30 to February 1, 1992, of the Center Directors Committee on Intellectual Property and the Center Directors/TAC Committee on Plant Genetic Resources, {{and served as a}} background document at TAC 57 to the discussion of CGIAR policy on intellectual property rights and related matters. A review of IARC constitutions and headquarters agreements revealed a general lack of provisions for the ownership of genetic material or for its devolution in the event an IARC ceases to operate. There was wide variation among cases depending on the legal status of the center, and the <b>headquarters</b> <b>agreement</b> in effect. In general, however, the consultants' view was that the germplasm collections would not pass automatically to the host government.

40|$|External {{program and}} {{management}} review of INIBAP conducted in 1992 {{by a panel}} chaired by David MacKenzie. This review was {{considered part of the}} induction program for expansion centers. The review panel found serious weaknesses in INIBAP's mode of operation. Specific problems were the performance and viability of the regional research networks, which were to be the modus operandi of the center; in the board of trustees; and in overall management. Although INIBAP had been in operation since 1984, and had achieved international status, a <b>headquarters</b> <b>agreement</b> had yet to be negotiated with the host country, France. The panel concluded that INIBAP was not really testing the innovative concepts being applied, because of insufficient funding. The panel made a number of recommendations, notably concerning procedural issues and the need for enhanced strategic planning. It suggested examination of research on additional issues such as sustainability, post-harvest technology, storage and marketing. Although training was one of INIBAP's four goals, there was no training program. The panel suggested several improvements in the operations of the board. Finally it urged the CGIAR to clarify its intentions with regard to INIBAP. The burden of the recommendations was to identify a need for rethinking, replanning, and renewed support.

The successes chalked by ACBF towards attainment of its objectives have vindicated those who held the view that establishing an indigenous African institution, with focus on and commitment to the course of Africa's development was the right course of action at the time. Twenty years on, ACBF has supported nearly 250 projects and programs in 44 African countries and committed more than US$ 400 million to build capacity on the continent. Projects and programs supported by the Foundation have drawn synergy with and complemented countless other activities of various development institutions operating on the Continent.
