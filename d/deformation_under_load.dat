25|$|Cadmium is a soft, {{ductile metal}} (MH 2.0) that {{undergoes}} substantial <b>deformation,</b> <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> at room temperature. Like zinc, {{it has a}} crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. The halides of cadmium, {{with the exception of}} the fluoride, exhibit a substantially covalent nature. The oxides of cadmium in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely CdO and Cd(OH)2, are weakly amphoteric; it forms cadmates in strongly basic solutions. Cadmium forms Zintl phases such as LiCd, RbCd13 and CsCd13. When heated in air to a few hundred degrees, cadmium represents a toxicity hazard due to the release of cadmium vapour; when heated to its boiling point in air (just above 1000 K; 725 C; 1340 F; cf steel ~2700 K; 2425 C; 4400 F), the cadmium vapour oxidizes, 'with a reddish-yellow flame, dispersing as an aerosol of potentially lethal CdO particles.' Cadmium is otherwise stable in air and in water, at ambient conditions, protected by a layer of cadmium oxide.|$|E

50|$|Thermoset plastic {{polymers}} characterised by rigid, three-dimensional {{structures and}} high molecular weight, {{stay out of}} shape when deformed and undergo permanent or plastic <b>deformation</b> <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> and normally decompose before melting. Thermoset elastomers, which are soft and springy or rubbery and can be deformed and revert to their original shape on loading release, also decompose before melting. Conventional thermoset plastics or elastomers therefore cannot be melted and re-shaped after they are cured which implies that thermosets cannot be recycled for the same purpose, except as filler material. There are developments however involving thermoset epoxy resins which on controlled and contained heating form crosslinked networks that can be repeatedly reshaped like silica glass by reversible covalent bond exchange reactions on reheating above the glass transition temperature. There are also thermoset polyurethanes shown to have transient properties and which can thus be reprocessed or recycled.|$|E

50|$|While {{springback}} {{has long}} been a topic of discussion for sheet metal forming operations it has been far less of a topic of research for tube hydroforming. This may in part be a result of the relatively low levels of springback naturally occurring when deforming the tubes into their closed section geometries. Tube Hydroformed sections by the nature of their closed sections are very rigid and do not display high degrees of elastic <b>deformation</b> <b>under</b> <b>load.</b> For this reason it is likely that negative residual stress induced during tube hydroforming might be insufficient to deform the part elastically after the completion of forming. However, as more and more tubular parts are being manufactured using high strength steel and advanced high strength steel parts, springback must be accounted for in the design and manufacture of closed section tube hydroformed parts.|$|E

50|$|The He 177 had Fowler-type {{extensible}} {{trailing edge}} flaps, which covered the trailing {{edge of the}} wing, including those portions covered by ailerons. Each aileron comprised upper and lower portions, the latter arranged to slide rearwards with flap extension, while the upper part retained its function of providing lateral control for take-off and landing. The original wing design did not fully take into account the stresses resulting from the operation of the Fowler flaps. A Rechlin report dated 9 October 1942 stated:"The examination has shown that the strength of the He 177's wings is one-third below that estimated by Heinkel. The reason for this is the uneven rigidity of the individual members with consequent <b>deformation</b> <b>under</b> <b>load.</b> This condition was not recognized by Heinkel at the proper time, the failure tests having been undertaken too late in view {{of the size of the}} structure."Tests on the 40th production A-1 aircraft in September 1942, revealed serious outer wing panel component damage after only some 20 flights, due to the aerodynamic stress from diving attack exercises. Costly and extensive strengthening was needed to solve the problem, which significantly increased the aircraft's weight. Starting with the later versions of the He 177 A-3, the Fowler flaps along the outboard wing sections were removed and a strengthened wing design was introduced on the He 177 A-5.|$|E

When the quantity of 90 -pct-carbon graphite addition varied between 0 and 30 wt pct, hot strength was highest, <b>deformation</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> lowest, and air-slag-metal wear the least at 10 wt pct. As test temperature increased from 500 deg to 2, 750 deg f, the hot strength difference became less. Carbon fiber additions were limited to 1. 5 pct in dolomite-carbon brick. At this level, physical properties were generally comparable to those obtained with natural flake graphite, but were below values obtained with 10 -pct- flake-graphite additions.
