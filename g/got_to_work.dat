Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was {{released}} on February 12, 1972, in the United States by Capricorn Records.

5|$|Ed Roberts and Bill Yates {{finished}} the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to Popular Electronics in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived {{due to a}} strike by the shipping company. Solomon already {{had a number of}} pictures of the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E

5|$|On Mono Island, {{the main}} landing {{along the south}} coast had been {{achieved}} with relative ease, with few casualties although they had to fend off some attacks that night. However, Logan Force which had landed as planned at Soanotalu, {{on the opposite side}} of the island to 29th and 36th Battalions, experienced some difficulty. Initially unopposed, a defensive perimeter had been established and the American technicians <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Over the next three days, some contact had been made with Japanese soldiers, which had evaded the New Zealanders to the south, looking to escape the island by seizing a barge. During the evening of 1 November, a party of 80 Japanese, began attacking Logan Force. A small group of six soldiers from 34th Battalion plus three Americans held a blockhouse throughout the night and by dawn, over 50 Japanese had been killed for the loss of five men. By early November, Japanese resistance had largely been overcome although patrols still made contact with small parties of Japanese and on 12 November, Mono Island was considered to be secure. By this stage, the battalion had reassembled on Mono Island. There were still isolated Japanese that needed to be captured or killed and patrols were ongoing well into January 1944. By this stage, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. Reidy, taking over from Eyre who was now too old for active service and had returned to New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the wake}} up call, the crew on board Discovery <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{preparing}} for entry. After the first landing opportunity was waved off {{due to high}} wind concerns, the team on the ground gave the crew a 'go' {{to proceed with the}} second opportunity. Following the deorbit burn, the orbiter landed successfully at 15:13 EDT.|$|E
25|$|Most Canadian {{cities have}} public transport, {{if only a}} bus system. Three Canadian cities have rapid transit systems, four have light rail systems, and three have {{commuter}} rail systems (see below). In 2006, 11% of Canadians used public transportation to get to work. This compares to 80.0% that <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> using a car (72.3% by driving, 7.7% as a passenger), 6.4% that walked and 1.3% that rode a bike.|$|E

25|$|The crew then <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Ferguson and Hurley {{using the}} shuttle arm {{to take its}} OBSS from the station's Canadarm2 {{operated}} by Garan and Furukawa. The station arm had plucked the OBSS from its stowage position on the shuttle cargo bay sill. The handoff was to prepare to use the boom for any shuttle heat shield late inspections if required. Magnus worked with TV setup and Walheim transferred spacewalk gear.|$|E
25|$|Pramas {{made the}} offer {{to publish the}} setting if Kenson would also create a superhero game system based on the d20 System. Kenson agreed and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Over time, {{it became clear to}} him that the game would need to be {{released}} only under the Open Game License. Releasing the game under the d20 Standard Trademark License, as originally planned, would have prohibited the inclusion of ability generation and character advancement rules. Presenting a complete game was seen as taking precedence over having a d20 logo on the product, so {{the decision was made to}} use the OGL without the d20 license.|$|E

He investigated 70, including 17 Italians, and opened 41 files leading to indictments against 17 accused, only eight {{of whom had}} previous criminal records. Charges were laid on 10 September and, {{at the request of}} the prosecutor, the Cour de Cassation agreed to hold the trials in Angoulême. Among the defendants was an Italian worker, Giordano, defended by M. Guillibert, a lawyer from Aix. The trial was due to open on 11 December 1893 but, due to the complexity of the case, it was not actually started until the 27 December.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the wake}} up call, the two crews <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{preparing}} for the mission's final spacewalk. Bowen and Kimbrough officially began the EVA at 18:24 UTC. Shortly before the spacewalk began, managers on the ground radioed up to the crew that the Mission Management Team had approved an extra docked day {{of operations for the}} crews, extending the mission to sixteen days. The extra time was being given to allow the crews more time to resolve the issues with the Urine Processing Assembly. The spacewalk successfully concluded after 6 hours and 7 minutes, bringing the total time spent in EVA activities for the mission to 26 hours, 41 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The crew of Discovery <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in {{the morning}} {{preparing}} for rendezvous and docking with the space station. After performing the rendezvous pitch maneuver (RPM) to allow the Expedition 18 crew to photograph {{the underside of the}} orbiter, Discovery successfully docked with the station at 21:20 UTC. Following hatch leak checks, the hatches were opened at 23:09 UTC. After greeting each other, the crews had a mandatory station safety briefing, and then set to work with initial transfers, including the exchange of Magnus' Soyuz seat liner for Wakata's. The swap of the seat liners marked Wakata officially joining the Expedition 18 crew as Flight Engineer, and Magnus became a Mission Specialist for STS-119.|$|E
25|$|Kyle Carrozza {{was born}} in Catskill, New York. As a young child, Kyle was {{influenced}} by many cartoon shows on television, mostly Bob Clampett's Looney Tunes.

He also got into anime in 1996 {{while he was at}} high school and particularly enjoyed watching Ranma 1/2 and Project A-ko. Several of his animation influences were from Bob Clampett, Bruce Timm, Doug TenNapel, Jhonen Vasquez, Tex Avery, Ralph Bakshi and numerous others.

Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. [...] "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. [...] "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having {{a leader in the}} band, which was Ian Anderson's way.
