40|$|This paper {{examines}} the portfolio optimization of energy <b>futures</b> <b>by</b> using the STARR ratio that can evaluate {{the risk and}} return relationship for skewed distributed returns. We model the price returns for energy <b>futures</b> <b>by</b> using the ARMA(1, 1) -GARCH(1, 1) -PCA model with stable distributed innovations that reflects the charac-teristics of energy: mean reversion, heteroskedasticity, seasonality, and spikes. Then, we propose the method for selecting the portfolio of energy <b>futures</b> <b>by</b> maximizing the STARR ratio, what we call “Winner portfolio”. The empirical studies <b>by</b> using energy <b>futures</b> of WTI crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas traded on the NYMEX compare the price return models with stable distributed innovations to those with normal ones. We show that the models with stable ones are more appropriate for energy futures than those with normal ones. In addition, we discuss what characteristics of energy futures cause the stable distributed innovations in the returns. Then, we generate the price returns of energy futures using the ARMA(1, 1) -GARCH(1, 1) -PCA model with stable ones and choose the portfolio of energy futures employing the generated pric...|$|R

5|$|Between 1904 and 1905, Hull City {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Boulevard. This ground was used by Hull on a {{contract}} which allowed them to use it when not used for Rugby League, {{at a cost of}} £100 per annum. Hull built their own ground, Anlaby Road, which was opened in 1906. With the threat of the rerouting of the railway line through the Anlaby Road ground, the club was convinced it needed to secure its <b>future</b> <b>by</b> owning its own ground. They negotiated the deal for land between Boothferry Road and North Road in 1929, which was financed by a £3,000 loan from the FA. Due to the club's financial difficulties, no work took place for three years, and development then stopped until 1939. In that year a proposal to build a new multi-purpose sports stadium on the site temporarily halted the club's plans to relocate, but when this plan failed the club resolved to continue with the stalled development of the site, in anticipation of moving to the new stadium in 1940. The outbreak of war, however, meant that the redevelopment again came to a halt, as the site was taken over by the Home Guard.|$|E

5|$|Boden Fortress {{is made up}} of five primary {{self-supporting}} forts excavated out of {{the bedrock}} in five of the mountains surrounding Boden: Degerberget, Mjösjöberget, Gammelängsberget, Södra Åberget and Rödberget. Eight fortified secondary artillery positions were constructed between the forts to give flanking support and to cover areas not in range of the main forts' artillery. In addition, 40 bunkers for infantry, along with dugouts and other fortifications, were built to cover even more terrain. During the Second World War anti-tank gun emplacements and additional bunkers and shelters were built, and tens of kilometres of dragon's teeth were placed around the fortress and the city itself. Owing {{to the end of the}} Cold War and the reduction of the threat from the Soviet Union, Boden Fortress became less important to the defence of Sweden, and began to be decommissioned. The last fort of the complex was decommissioned on 31 December 1998, and is now used as a tourist attraction. All five forts as well as some of the supporting structures have been declared historic buildings, to be preserved for the <b>future,</b> <b>by</b> the Swedish government.|$|E

The 2003–04 season brought success in the FA Vase competition, when Andover reached the quarterfinals {{for the first time in}} their history, before losing to Hampshire rivals Winchester City. They finished sixth in the league and won the North Hants Senior Cup for the fifth time. The 2004–05 season saw an improvement in the league with a fifth-place finish; the reserves finished runners up in the Wessex Combination East division. The club also won the North Hants Senior Cup for the sixth time.|$|E

5|$|On October 27, 1914, after {{approval}} from the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered the area. During the Greek administration, and while the First World War continued, it had been agreed between Greece, Italy and the Great Powers that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue {{should be left to}} the future, after the war ended. After Venizelos' resignation in December however, the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and pre-determine the region's <b>future</b> <b>by</b> incorporating it formally within the Greek state. In the first months of 1916, Northern Epirus participated in the Greek elections and elected 16 representatives for the Greek Parliament. In March, the region's union with Greece was officially declared, and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa.|$|E

5|$|After the British had {{departed}} Tug Argan, the Italians swiftly began {{to bring a}} close to their operations in Somaliland. Units of the Black Watch, 2nd Battalion King's African Rifles, and the 1/2 Punjab Regiment formed a small rearguard at Barakasan, which fought gamely into the night of 17 August to buy the main force time to evacuate. The Royal Navy {{had already begun to}} evacuate military personnel from Berbera on 16 August, operations that were not interfered with, possibly due to uncertainty about whether a peace treaty might be signed in the near <b>future.</b> <b>By</b> 19 August, all military forces, including the rearguard, the remainder of which had embarked late the previous day, had been evacuated by sea. An estimated 5,300–5,700 troops in total were evacuated to Aden. Italian forces, who had been held up by naval bombardment by HMS Ceres on 17 August, arrived in an empty Berbera on the 19th, effectively completing their conquest of British Somaliland. In total, Britain had suffered extremely light casualties, with 38 dead, 102 wounded, and 120 missing; however 10 artillery pieces had to be left behind and were captured by the Italians. In comparison, Italy paid dearly for the province, suffering 465 deaths and 1530 wounded.|$|E
5|$|During development, id {{approached}} Sierra Entertainment, {{then one}} of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein 3D, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front {{as part of the deal}} rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein 3D and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable <b>future.</b> <b>By</b> the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, Doom, the success of Wolfenstein 3D led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.|$|E
