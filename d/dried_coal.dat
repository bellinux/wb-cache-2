30|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>coal</b> {{beneficiation}} has {{an inherent}} advantage since it uses no process water {{and reduces the}} costs {{that are associated with}} process water, fines dewatering and slurry confinement.

Meanwhile, the low-rank coal easily conducts the process of argillation when using wet coal beneficiation, yielding the difficulties in slurry treatment and product dewatering. Therefore, <b>dry</b> <b>coal</b> beneficiation is comparatively more suitable for low-rank coal cleaning and upgrading. Countries that heavily relay on coal for energy supply all progressively exploit and utilize low-rank coal to meet the increasing required energy consumption and protect the hard coal resource.

40|$|Almost 50 % of the world’s coal {{resources}} are low rank coals. Efficiency for low rank coal utilization {{is reduced by}} high moisture contents and can decrease the conventional power plant efficiency by up to 9 %. Drying coal is an effective way of increasing the efficiency of low rank coal combustion for power generation. A drying technology for use with Victorian brown coal is steam fluidized bed drying. However fundamental drying data is required for scaling up steam fluidized bed drying to a commercial scale. This study generates the data and also provides {{an understanding of the}} kinetics on fluidized bed drying in general, and steam fluidized bed drying in particular. Water in Victorian brown coal consists mainly of non-freezable and bulk water whereas similar coals such as Chinese lignite only contains bound and non-freezable water. The structure of bound water in Chinese Shenhua lignite also differs from that in Victorian brown coals –Loy Yang, Yallourn and Morwell–, displaying two separate freezing temperatures (- 36 °C and - 48 °C) compared to Victorian brown coal’s one (- 47 °C). When re-introducing water to <b>dried</b> <b>coal,</b> non-freezable water returns to previous levels, while the bound water is reduced. The difference in re-wetted coal-water interactions affects the energy requirements for re-wetted coals, and can impact agglomeration and slurry processes when water is added to coal. Observing different size fractions, smaller fractions exhibit lower bulk water mass, however the non-freezable and bound water mass remains relatively unchanged. The kinetics of both air and steam fluidized bed drying of Victorian brown coal show that increasing the fluidization velocity and bed temperature or decreasing the particle size results in a lower drying time. This trend occurs regardless of the fluidization medium, with drying ratio’s between drying temperatures and fluidization velocities remaining consistent between air and steam fluidization mediums. Through experiments in a 1 kg bed a drying time of 30 minutes was established to completely dry the coal and represents a practical drying time closer to commercial driers. To reconcile laboratory and larger drying kinetics a scaling co-efficient of 1. 33 has been created in conjunction with a modified Page model. This model accurately describes the scaling of drying in a small steam fluidized bed to a large steam fluidized bed. Analysis of the chemical characteristics of <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> indicates that the oxygen functional groups change with temperature. Synchrotron infrared experiments of single particle drying in Nitrogen indicates that functional group breakdown of Victorian brown coals occur between 140 and 250 °C, while Chinese lignite’s begin to break down at 160 °C. The loss of functional groups was also dependent on the residence time. At 130 °C longer residence times show Chinese Shenhua lignite showing faster and different functional group loss than Yallourn brown coal. At 170 °C a drop in COOH dimers is seen after 15 minutes, with additional functional group loss occurring at 25 minutes. These results show Shenhua lignite is more temperature sensitive and should be dried at temperatures below 200 °C to avoid major functional group loss. During steam fluidized bed drying particle breakage occurs, with a 100 μm drop in average particle diameter observed. However a 100 μm average particle size drop occurs regardless of drying medium or method and is attributed to the transition from bulk/bound water to non-freezable water and not fluidization. At 30 and 60 minutes residence time, air fluidization decreases the average particle diameter by an additional 75 μm, while steam fluidization has no additional effect. Moisture re-adsorption of Victorian brown coal shows steam fluidized bed <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> re-adsorbs up to 2 % less moisture than air fluidized bed dried coals (9. 6 % vs. 7. 6 % for Loy Yang brown coal), and has been attributed to the change in oxygen functional groups. Unlike previously developed engineering models, a single particle model for steam drying has been developed for implementation into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Using a lumped, master curve approach, a model has been developed to describe the surface temperature and moisture content of a coal particle during drying. This provided comparable results to other drying models in the literature, with a significantly simpler calculation method. The form of the equations allows for modelling of local dryer conditions and has practical applications in drier design and optimization. The characteristics of the <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> were investigated through the combustion and gasification reactivity along with the ignition point analysis. The change in drying temperature and fluidization medium make no observable impact on either the reactivity or ignition point. This proves steam fluidized bed drying maintains similar combustion and gasification properties of <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> when compared to other forms of drying. This thesis characterised the steam fluidized bed drying process, allowing for an accurate prediction of the output coal quality, from the moisture content to the resultant coal properties to the coals usability in combustion and gasification processes. ...|$|E

In addition the dry coal particles will react with ambient oxygen, and heat up enough to ignite.

Different methods of drying were investigated to determine whether <b>coal</b> <b>drying</b> can be accomplished without reducing the reactivity of <b>coals</b> toward liquefaction. <b>Drying</b> methods included thermal, microwave, and chemical dehydration.

40|$|Blast furnace is {{the heart}} of every steel plant. Steel {{production}} is based on the blast furnace process, as it is where the iron is extracted from the iron ore and turned into liquid iron, which will subsequently be used to make liquid steel. Therefore, without hot iron, steel can not be produced. Blast furnaces in this process are supplied among others with pulverized coal. Raw coal should be prepared for the blast furnaces in the form of fine coal powder. This fine coal powder should then be injected into the blast furnaces in order to continue the production. This process is carried out by the Pulverized Coal Injection System, which changes raw coal into dry fine coal powder. The system consists of a hot gas generator, a coal mill, a bagfilter as well as various valves, fans and piping. The general idea is to burn specific gases with the help of equipments and to use them to dry the coal in the cycle. When the amount of the gases inserted into the system is changed, the <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> amount is directly affected. Based on this background the following project is carried out, which aims at the investigation of bottlenecks and critical points in the process. The most important bottleneck is the limited possibility of fresh air usage, as the oxygen in fresh air can cause explosions if existent in exceeding amounts in the system and thus, is dangerous. In order to prevent this explosive condition in the system, additional gases need {{to be added to the}} system. The aim of this project is to introduce additional gases to the system in order to increase the upper limit of the fresh air amount. Increasing the amount of fresh air in the recirculation gas should provide more amount of dried coal,hence increasing the drying capacity of the coal grinding plant. To understand the situation better, tests about gas injection are carried out in the system. The results of the tests are analyzed and the performance changes in the system are calculated. For this, programs in Excel and also inLabVIEW are created to interpret the situations easily. As it is understood from the results of the tests, when the amount of the additional gases isincreased, approximately 10 % increase in the amount of <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> is observed.

The best-fit solutions indicate that the coal volume decreases upon drying. The microscopic shrinkage estimated using helium expansion was greater than the shrinkage reported using the bed-height technique. The microscopic shrinkage was 5 - 10 % for low-moisture medium and high-rank coals and up to 40 % for low-rank coals having higher moisture contents.

The adsorption capacity, isosteric heat of adsorption, average pore size, and surface area of the as-received (moist) and <b>dried</b> Argonne <b>coals</b> were estimated after accounting for the volume changes.

40|$|Unlike other {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) storage options, CO 2 storage in coal seams {{is still in}} its infancy, and one of the many {{questions}} that need to be answered concerns the long term effects of storing CO 2 in coal specifically on the structure and properties of the coal. Most studies on coal structural changes due to CO 2 adsorption have been done over the period of adsorption (hours or 2 - 3 days), and mostly at low pressures which are not representative of actual storage conditions. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine chemical and physical changes that might occur due to long term interaction of coal with CO 2 under pressurised conditions. Air <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> samples of different maceral groups (vitrinite and inertinite) were exposed to CO 2 in reactors under subcritical and supercritical conditions for different period of time (up to 6 months). The samples were well characterised pre- and post-CO 2 treatment. A newly-built high-pressure volumetric system was used for adsorption and desorption isotherms measurements of the coals before CO 2 sorption. The characterisation techniques used were BET, XRD, FTIR and 13 C NMR. Surface area analysis of untreated and treated coal particles showed that vitrinite-rich coal samples have a greater surface area and pore size distribution change in pore structure following CO 2 treatment than the inertinite-rich coal particles. Analysis of the crystalline part of the CO 2 untreated and treated inertinite-rich particles showed that there was slight increase in the average crystallite height following CO 2 treatment, although no changes were observed for the d 002 aromatic interplanar spacing. In comparing the effects of subcritical and supercritical treatment on CO 2 sorption behaviour over time, the study determined that the long term effects of CO 2 storage in coal were found to be dependent on the maceral composition of the coal, with the vitrinite-rich coal showing a more pronounced structural and properties change after CO 2 storage. This change did, however, differ under subcritical and supercritical conditions. The adsorption capacity of the supercritical treated coal was found to be lower than the subcritical treated coal over the same period of 6 months for the vitrinite-rich coal. Inertinite-rich coal was found to be less prone to changes under CO 2 storage. A major implication of this finding is the inclusion of maceral composition as major criteria for determining CO 2 storage in coal capability. The results in this study contribute significantly to the understanding of coal-CO 2 interactions and the implications for coal structure and properties changes; the results could be used by decision-makers on the effects of storing CO 2 in coal...|$|E
40|$|Large scale power {{generation}} commences with the combustion of coal or other fuel, {{which in turn}} converts high pressure water into steam which then drives a turbine thus generating electricity. Burning high moisture coal, such as lignite, for {{power generation}} implies that {{a significant amount of}} energy is wasted in vaporising the moisture, which could otherwise be used in the steam raising process. This implies that more moist coal would be required to drive the same process than if the coal was drier, thus increasing the amount of combustion products such as greenhouses gases. Introducing a <b>dried</b> <b>coal</b> in an existing boiler will significantly change the heat flux profiles, which could result in boiler damage or excessive fouling. Flame temperature is influenced by the supply of reactants; in most cases the limiting reactant will be oxygen. The supply of oxygen (through air) to a pneumatically transported coal stream and subsequent reaction is controlled by the localised fluid mechanics or ‘mixing’. This research aims to provide an understanding of the mixing process between the pneumatically transported coal and air in brown coal fired boilers by modelling the individual jets. The effects of the change in velocity ratio for the air (secondary) jets and fuel (primary) jets of rectangular burners typical of those found in brown coal fired boilers has been studied experimentally and is reported in this thesis. In particular, scientific analysis was used to investigate the physical mechanisms which control fuel-air mixing, and to quantify the concentration of primary and secondary fluid. The concentration data was used in a regression model in conjunction with a reactive combustion model, developed from a 1 : 30 scale cold model of the Yallourn W’ stage 2 boiler, in order that overall boiler performance can be assessed. This overall study is fundamental {{as a result of the}} questions raised concerning the future of brown coal in modern society. A qualitative flow visualisation study of the unconfined 1 : 30 scaled primary, and two adjacent rectangular jets, was conducted using single colour planar laser induced fluorescence. The characteristics of the jet flow were examined by imaging individually seeded primary and secondary jets and were visualised through four different planes longitudinally, on the axes of each jet. In addition, a transverse qualitative and quantitative study on the rectangular jets was also conducted for the individually seeded jets, and was visualised through planes of flow perpendicular to the direction flow, specifically at axial stations of x/D = 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The flow characteristics were also examined under different co-flow conditions, particularly secondary to primary jet velocity ratios (λ) of 0, 0. 55, 1. 4, 2. 8, 3. 6 and ∞. This quantitative data yields the basis for a 3 D regression model to predict fuel-air mixing in actual boilers. A semi-quantitative investigation into some geometrical modifications on the rectangular jets was also conducted at velocity ratios of λ= 0, 0. 55 and 1. 4. The rectangular nozzles were fitted with base plates orientated at 90 degrees and 60 degrees to the direction of flow. The longitudinal flow visualisation study highlighted the effect of velocity ratio on the flow field of the primary and secondary jets. In particular it showed that the main structures of the primary and secondary jets are sensitive to the co-flowing conditions. The primary jet also experienced the formation of coherent structures close to the bluff body re-circulation region for λ> 2. 8. The quantitative transverse analysis of the rectangular jets showed that the primary jet and secondary jets close to the nozzle exit plane distorted with a change in co-flowing conditions. The primary jet experienced distortion for λ> 1. 4, and the secondary jets experienced distortion for λ < 1. 4. A plausible mechanism for this “distortion” can be explained by different co-flowing conditions altering the velocity gradients of the jet, thus changing the denomination of the counter rotating vortices present in the corners of rectangular jets, allowing them to alter jet shape. The transverse quantitative analysis of the rectangular jets allowed for graphical representation of the normalised concentration of the primary and secondary jets in the radial direction and the centreline mixture fraction decay. The analysis of the latter showed that the primary jet, under all co-flow conditions, reached self-similarity at approximately x/D = 4, whereas the secondary jets did so at x/D = 2. The primary jets observed greater rates of centreline dilution at high velocity ratios, whereas the secondary jets did so at λ= 0. 55. The quantification of the centreline concentration decay obeyed the inverse rate law for all co-flowing conditions. The first order decay constant K₁, was found to be heavily dependant on velocity ratio. The planar transverse quantitative data of the primary and secondary jets was used with the method of weighted squares to develop a regression model that would three-dimensionally reproduce the scalar mixing field as a function of velocity ratio. The regression model reproduces scalar quantities for λ= 0 and λ= 0. 55 to 3. 6 for the primary jet and λ= 0. 55 to 3. 6 and ∞ for the secondary jet, and is capable of predicting primary and secondary bulk fluid concentrations within 30 to 40 % of the measured values. A sensitivity analysis on the regression model revealed that it is highly responsive to the momentum-controlling region between the jets with a change in velocity ratio. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|Overall, in {{the section}} of <b>dry</b> <b>coal</b> beneficiation, the most {{significant}} properties of coal that facilitate the separation process are density, shape, friction, electricity, and magnetite. According the different beneficiating mechanisms, <b>dry</b> <b>coal</b> beneficiation reported in recent literature are mainly classified into the following five categories: (I) air dense medium fluidized bed separation with/without external force field, (II) fluidized bed separation based on the difference of settling velocity, (III) compound dry separation, (IV) triboelectrostatic separation and (V) magnetic separation. These five categories of technologies have their own advantages respectively in processing certain coal or yielding clean coal product with certain quality. Generally speaking, technologies belong to the categories (I), (IV) and (V) usually have high separation efficiency but high operational cost, which are suitable for producing high-quality clean coal. In contrast, technologies in categories (II) and (III) don’t need additional dense medium or power and usually have larger capacities and low processing cost, but low separation efficiency due to the original limitation of separation mechanism. These technologies are suitable for producing steam coal. Besides, the electrostatic separation technologies and the magnetic separation technologies have high requirements for coal properties and certain degree of dissociation, thus, the handling capacities are limited. Considering these limitation, {{these two types of}} beneficiation technologies are only used in very special purpose. In the following sections, the representative research works in terms of the aforementioned technologies {{in the last five years}} are reviewed in detail and finally, we discuss the prospects and the challenges of the development of <b>dry</b> <b>coal</b> beneficiation.|$|R
