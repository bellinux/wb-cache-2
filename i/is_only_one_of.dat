5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, {{may be related to}} Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|The Atkinson Clock Tower near Bandaran Berjaya {{was built}} by Mary Edith Atkinson in 1905 in memory of her son, Francis George Atkinson. It was {{formerly}} used as a navigation aid for ships. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three pre-World War II buildings to survive the war. The Petagas War Memorial, located near KKIA, {{is a reminder of}} those who died when they went against the Japanese forces during World War II. It is situated at the place where the Kinabalu Guerrillas were killed by the Japanese army in 1944. The Double Six Monument, located in Sembulan, is also a memorial to remember Sabah's first Chief Minister and six other state ministers who died on a plane crash known as the Double Six Tragedy on 6 June 1976.|$|E
5|$|Vmax <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several {{important}} kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate {{needed to achieve}} a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is kcat, also called the turnover number, which {{is the number of}} substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} castle {{constructed}} in Lincoln, England, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle remains one of the most impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom. It is still possible to walk around the immense Norman walls which provide a magnificent view of the castle complex, together with panoramic views of the cathedral, the city, and the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|Coronations may be {{performed}} {{for a person}} other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was crowned as a second king of England, subordinate to his father HenryII; such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two instances {{of its kind in}} England (the other being that of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, crowned whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still alive). More commonly, a king's wife is crowned as queen consort. If the king is already married {{at the time of his}} coronation, a joint coronation of both king and queen may {{be performed}}. The first such coronation was of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; seventeen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and MaryII. The most recent was that of GeorgeVI and the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife were not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a queen consort in England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068; the last was Anne Boleyn's in 1533. The most recent king to wed post-coronation, CharlesII, did not have a separate coronation for his bride, Catherine of Braganza. In some instances, the king's wife was simply unable to join him in the coronation ceremony due to circumstances preventing her from doing so. In 1821, George IV's estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick was prevented from being crowned with him and when she showed up at Westminster Abbey she was denied entry and turned away. Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as Lord Protector in 1657. A Prince of Wales, usually the monarch's heir apparent, may also be crowned in a ceremony known as an investiture.|$|E
