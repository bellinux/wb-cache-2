40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} sensitivity and specificity of Counter Immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) in the diagnosis of hydatidosis in buffaloes using sera samples collected {{at the time of}} slaughter. One hundred sera samples <b>from</b> <b>buffaloes</b> were screened for hydatidosis using fertile buffalo hydatid cyst fluid as antigen by CIE. Out of the 100 sera samples used, 61 were positive for hydatid cysts in various organs confirmed on slaughter and the remaining 39 sera were collected randomly <b>from</b> <b>buffaloes</b> without any visible hydatid cysts. Forty six samples were found positive out of the 61 samples screened by CIE with 2 samples found positive out of the 39 samples <b>from</b> <b>buffaloes</b> without any visible hydatid cysts. The sensitivity and specificity of CIE in detecting hydatidosis in buffaloes was found to be 75. 41 per cent and 94. 8 per cent respectively...|$|R
5|$|The {{improvement}} of the road <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> southwest to Pennsylvania in the mid-19th century soon allowed for continuous travel across {{the entire state of}} New York. With the advent of the automobile, the state began to take over and pave major thoroughfares {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. In 1908, the state legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes. One of the routes assigned at this time was Route6, an Albany–Buffalo highway that followed the path of the Genesee Road and the Seneca Turnpike <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> to Utica, the Mohawk Turnpike between Utica and Schenectady, and the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike from Schenectady to Albany. From Auburn to Chittenango, Route6 utilized most of the newer, northern branch of the Seneca Turnpike.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{following}} {{what other}} states did, New York began to assign route numbers to its main thoroughfares. The Albany to Buffalo {{portion of the}} Yellowstone Trail, which ran through the cities of Syracuse and Utica, was assigned the number NY5A. The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY5's original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany. In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY5 and NY5A overlapped.|$|E

5|$|The route follows Eighteen Mile Creek {{northwest}} and west toward {{the village of}} Hamburg, where the amount of development along the highway increases significantly. At McKinley Parkway (County Route204), NY391 becomes East Main Street and begins {{to pass through the}} outskirts of the village. It officially enters Hamburg upon intersecting Sunnyside Drive two blocks to the west. The route continues into the village center, passing by commercial and residential buildings on its way to a roundabout at Buffalo Street, where it meets US62. At this point, NY391 comes to an end while US62 turns west onto Main Street <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Street.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{several of the}} routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways that {{did not yet have}} a route number were assigned one. This included both SH1282 and the section of SH286 south of Morton Road as both became part of NY18, a highway that was extended eastward <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> to Rochester as part of the renumbering. At the time, NY18 entered the hamlet of Morton on Kenmore Road and followed Morton, Redman, and Church Roads and Lake Road West Fork into Hamlin, where it overlapped with NY63 (modern NY19) south along Lake Road to rejoin its modern alignment at Hamlin Center Road. By the following year, NY360 was assigned to what is now NY18 between NY272 and Lake Road (then-NY63) in Hamlin. The alignments of NY18 and NY360 between Morton and Hamlin were flipped , placing both highways on their modern routings.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would {{be too late to}} see any combat.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1921 season, Barrow was {{appointed}} {{general manager of}} the New York Yankees and requested that Krichell join him as a full-time scout. At the time, the Yankees had a two-man scouting rotation, and Barrow believed the appointment of Krichell would improve the scouting staff. The first player signed by Krichell was Hinkey Haines, an outfielder from Penn State University. He signed catcher Benny Bengough <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> of the International League, and Charlie Caldwell, a Princeton University graduate. Caldwell was used mainly as a batting practice pitcher, appearing in just three games in his major league career. During one practice, Caldwell fractured Wally Pipp's skull with a high fastball, allowing Lou Gehrig to assume Pipp's place in the starting lineup.|$|E
5|$|The main Whig contenders in 1848 were Clay again, and two {{war hero}} generals with little {{political}} experience, Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor. Seward supported the nominee, General Taylor. The former governor was less {{enthusiastic about the}} vice-presidential candidate, New York Comptroller Millard Fillmore, a rival of his <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo.</b> Nevertheless, he campaigned widely for the Whigs against the Democratic presidential candidate, former Michigan senator Lewis Cass. The two major parties did not make slavery {{an issue in the}} campaign. The Free Soil Party, mostly Liberty Party members and some Northern Democrats, nominated former president Van Buren. The Taylor/Fillmore ticket was elected, and the split in the New York Democratic Party allowed the Whigs to capture the legislature.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Fillmore turned 21 and {{was thus}} legally {{independent}} of his father. He taught school in East Aurora, and accepted {{a few cases}} in {{justice of the peace}} courts, which did not require the practitioner to be a licensed attorney. He moved to Buffalo the following year, continued his study of law, first while teaching school, and then in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary; he also became engaged to Abigail Powers. In 1823, he was admitted to the New York bar, and declined offers <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> law firms to return to East Aurora and establish a practice as the town's only lawyer. Later in life, Fillmore stated that he initially lacked the self-confidence to practice in the larger city of Buffalo; his biographer, Paul Finkelman, suggested that after being under others' thumbs all his life, Fillmore enjoyed the independence of his East Aurora practice. On February 5, 1826, Millard and Abigail wed. They had two children, Millard Powers Fillmore (1828–1889) and Mary Abigail Fillmore (1832–1854).|$|E

5|$|Only part of Captain King’s force, {{including}} 35 of Lieutenant Angus's 70 sailors, {{succeeded in}} making a landing at the Red House. Under fire from the defenders, the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont’s detachment of the 49th Regiment. The sailors, armed with pikes and swords, closed in for hand-to-hand fighting. Lamont's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank and overwhelmed them; capturing Lamont and killing, taking or dispersing all of his men. The victorious Americans {{set fire to the}} post, spiked the guns and set off back to the landing-point, where they expected their boats to have re-landed in order to evacuate them. However, in the moonless darkness, King’s force became dispersed and split into two parties: one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus. Angus returned to the landing-point and found only four of the party’s ten boats there. Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed, Angus assumed that King had already departed, and he re-crossed the river in the remaining boats. When King’s party reached the landing-point, they found themselves stranded. A search downriver found two unattended British boats, in which King sent half of his men, and the prisoners that he had captured, over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> and pick him up.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made <b>from</b> <b>buffalo</b> skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

25|$|One or {{two years}} later, however, the portion of NY5 <b>from</b> <b>Buffalo</b> to Albany was shifted north to its modern alignment—mostly old {{legislative}} Route6—and the former, more southerly route was designated as NY7.

NY7 and NY35 were both short-lived designations as US20 was assigned on November11, 1926, {{as part of the}} establishment of the U.S. Highway System. When the U.S. Highway was first posted in New York in 1927, it was assigned to then-NY5 from the Pennsylvania line to near Hamburg, a previously unnumbered but state-maintained highway between Hamburg and East Aurora, NY35 from East Aurora to Geneseo, NY7 between Skaneateles and Albany, and NY5 from Albany to the Massachusetts line.
