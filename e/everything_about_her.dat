500|$|Marceline {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed and is popular with fans of Adventure Time. The character {{was also the}} focus of a miniseries entitled Stakes, which aired during the show's seventh season. Early in the show's history, Ward himself has stated that Marceline is his favorite character in the series because he does not know <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> history and backstory, which he noted adds a mysterious element to her character. Despite the positivity, the episodes [...] "What Was Missing" [...] and [...] "Sky Witch" [...] became somewhat controversial because of an implied past relationship between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was cast}} over Kate Hudson, Scarlett Johansson, and Amy Adams as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, a British drama film {{based on two}} novels by Colin Clark, {{depicting}} {{the making of the}} film The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Initially terrified of taking on the role, she turned down the offer. [...] "Physically and vocally, <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> is different from me," [...] she explained. Eventually, she found the offer too good to pass up. Williams took vocal lessons so she could sing in the movie, as lip-syncing was uncomfortable. Williams won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance. Her next performance was in Take This Waltz (2011), directed by Sarah Polley in Canada, that focuses on a young married couple (Williams and Seth Rogen) dealing with monogamy and fidelity.|$|E

500|$|Streisand's {{version of}} [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] divided music critics. A writer for Billboard was {{enthusiastic}} of the release, writing, [...] "Barbra takes the great Bob Marley reggae cut and commercializes it somewhat, though the flavor is still there. Good soulful backup and reggae type organ help make this an almost certain bet for heavy top 40 play". Author Derek Winnert referred to Streisand's version as a [...] "success" [...] in his 1996 book Barbra Streisand. However, an editor for Boating disliked Streisand's version and urged {{the public to}} [...] "ignore" [...] it, joking that it [...] "does not belong in [...] our stateroom". A reviewer from Broadcasting disliked <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> version, stating, [...] "The Streisand voice and name alone might be {{enough to make a}} hit out of any of her single releases, but with the first single from her best-selling ButterFly album, the singer is taking no chances." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne's gout {{rendered}} her lame {{for much}} of her later life. Around the court, she was carried in a sedan chair, or used a wheelchair. Around her estates, she used a one-horse chaise, which she drove herself [...] "furiously like Jehu and a mighty hunter like Nimrod". She gained weight {{as a result of}} her sedentary lifestyle; in Sarah's words, [...] "she grew exceeding gross and corpulent. There was something of majesty in her look, but mixed with a gloominess of soul". Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet, described her in 1706 [...] "under a fit of the gout and in extreme pain and agony, and on this occasion <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> was much in the same disorder as about the meanest of her subjects. Her face, which was red and spotted, was rendered something frightful by her negligent dress, and the foot affected was tied up with a poultice and some nasty bandages. I was much affected by this sight...".|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} crew of Adventure Time are also {{pleased with the}} character. Near {{the start of the}} series, Ward stated that Marceline was his favorite character because he does not [...] "know <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> character yet", which he finds [...] "mysterious [...] cool". Rynda claimed that Marceline was probably his favorite character in the series because [...] "she's just really fun to draw." [...] Marceline is also particularly popular with the Adventure Time fan base, and after the release of [...] "Evicted!" [...] her popularity grew enormously. Ward later noted that he felt [...] "good about that. It's nice". Marceline is also popular with cosplayers, or performance artists who wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent characters from the Adventure Time universe. The character's popularity has been recognized by the company that owns Adventure Time. In fact, the official press release for the Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens companion comic book referred to the character as a [...] "fan-favorite".|$|E

[...] The Shadow Man gives Scully detailed instructions about how and where to meet him, warning her that even a slight deviation from his instructions would mean that he would never contact her again. [...] The Shadow Man tells her to drive a series of vehicles and to drive west until she is told to stop.

500|$|Rachel then {{confronts the}} non-participating glee members and insults them, {{but when she}} starts to sing Miley Cyrus's [...] "The Climb", she sounds terrible: she has started to lose her voice. Later, after an {{examination}} by Rachel's doctor reveals that she suffers from tonsillitis and may need to have her tonsils removed, she is afraid to have the surgery lest it affect her voice, as she believes her singing ability is her only asset. Finn, who accompanied her to the doctor's, tries to convince her that he loves <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> {{and that there is}} more to her than her voice. He warns her that if she loses her ability to sing then Jesse (Jonathan Groff) would no longer find her attractive. Rachel tells Finn that she still cares about Jesse and that he needs to move on, prompting Finn to sing [...] "Jessie's Girl" [...] as his solo assignment. To put her fear into perspective, Finn introduces her to his friend Sean (Zack Weinstein), who was paralyzed from the upper chest down during a football game. At first, Rachel is nervous and overwhelmed by the meeting, but Finn forces her to stay as Sean tells her about his grueling experiences with his disability and how he realized that a person is not just one single thing. She then begins to understand why Finn brought her and thanks Sean as she leaves.|$|E
500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive". According to IGN, [...] "at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled {{to the brim with}} dagger-like teeth." [...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her on the list of [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due to her face despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head."

She commented, [...] "Jessica Lange already has two Oscars and six nominations to her credit, so her appearance near the words 'Academy Awards' should never be a surprise.
