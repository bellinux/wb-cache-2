2500|$|The {{most visible}} {{area of the}} Whitewater Canal that exists today is in Metamora. [...] This section from the Laurel Feeder Dam to Brookville was listed on listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as the Whitewater Canal Historic District. [...] The {{district}} encompasses 1 contributing building and 31 contributing structures. They include the Metamora Roller Mill, Laurel Feeder Dam, Duck Creek Aqueduct, and Millville Lock. Here the Canal Era is recreated and tourists can stroll through a nineteenth-century town. [...] There are museums, shopping, eateries, and you can <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> horse drawn ride on the canal.|$|E
2500|$|Cattle have {{historically}} been of the highest symbolic, religious and economic value among the Nuer. Sharon Hutchinson notes that [...] "...among Nuer people the difference between people and cattle were continually underplayed." [...] Cattle are particularly important in their role as bride wealth, where they are given by a husband's lineage to his wife's lineage. It is this exchange of cattle which ensures that the children will be considered {{to belong to the}} husband's lineage and to his line of descent. The classical Nuer institution of ghost marriage, in which a man can [...] "father" [...] children after his death, is based on this ability of cattle exchanges to define relations of kinship and descent. In their turn, cattle given over to the wife's patrilineage enable the male children of that patrilineage to marry, and thereby ensure the continuity of her patrilineage. [...] A barren woman can <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wife of her own, whose children (obviously biologically fathered by men from outside unions) then become members of her patrilineage, and she is legally and culturally their father, allowing her to participate in reproduction in a metaphorical sense.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional hay {{making in}} the Boho was a {{communal}} endeavour. Neighbours of the farmer and his family would gather round to help [...] "win" [...] the hay before any sign of rain. This was a long and arduous job compared to the modern process. Local people might <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> day off their regular job for this sole purpose. The meadow was cut using a scythe (originally), and then in more modern times by tractor with a side-mounted mower blade. The grass swathes would be turned over {{by means of a}} hay rake and if the grass was dry enough it would be [...] with a pitchfork. The person that was tedding would lift as much as he/she could with a pitchfork and then shake it out vigorously over the ground. Once the grass was dry enough, the loose hay would be gathered into rows with hay rakes (this tedding might be repeated depending on how dry the grass was). The rows could also be made into small [...] "laps" [...] or [...] "lappins" [...] which are circularised stacks of dried grass. The invention of a hay-right or tedding machine connected to the power take-off (PTO) of a tractor made tedding a lot less labour-intensive.|$|E

50|$|It {{seems they}} were ardent {{recipients}} of the Buddhist faith and the example of Dharmaraksita indicates that they <b>even</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> active role in spreading Buddhism as leading missionaries.|$|R

6000|$|... "What! {{you don't}} like {{the smell of}} it, my dear," [...] said the young woman, observing that Maggie did not <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> spoonful of the stew. [...] "Try a bit--come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfortunately," [...] said Mr. Bloom, with a {{sense of}} the loss clearly written upon his frank face, [...] "I'm like the Colonel--in the walk-making {{business}} myself--and I haven't had time to <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> sniff at the flowers. Poetry is a line I never dealt in. It must be nice, though--quite nice." ...|$|E

60|$|A new Lord Protector of England {{was to be}} chosen; and, at Raymond's request, we {{removed to}} London, to witness, and <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> part in the election. If Raymond had been united to Idris, this post had been his stepping-stone to higher dignity; and his desire for power and fame had been crowned with fullest measure. He had {{exchanged}} a sceptre for a lute, a kingdom for Perdita.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may not be," [...] said merry Robin. [...] "I am king here, and no subject {{may raise}} {{hand against the}} king. But even our great King Richard may yield to the holy Pope without shame, and <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> tap from him by way of penance; {{therefore}} I will yield myself to this holy friar, who seemeth to be one in authority, and will take my punishment from him."

6000|$|The Hottentots {{had long}} ago {{anticipated}} the Princess and her shrill modern sisterhood. If we take the Greeks, or even ourselves, we may say, with Dampier (1689), [...] "The Hodmadods, though a nasty people, yet are gentlemen to these" [...] as regards the position of women. Let us hear Mr Hartland: [...] "In every Hottentot's house the wife is supreme. Her husband, poor fellow, though he may wield wide power and influence out of doors, at home dare not <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> mouthful of sour-milk out of the household vat without her permission [...] . The highest oath a man can take is to swear by his eldest sister, and if he abuses this name he forfeits to her his finest goods and sheep." ...|$|E
25|$|The British major <b>even</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> {{swipe at}} William Alexander, Lord Stirling {{who was not}} even {{involved}} in the operation. Alexander had made an unsuccessful attempt to claim a Scottish earldom between 1756 and 1762. His hard-drinking ways were well-known to British officers.|$|R
6000|$|If only, Lawford thought, this insufferable weariness {{would lift}} awhile he could enjoy the quiet, absurd, heedless talk, and this very {{friendly}} topsy-turvy effort {{to ease his}} mind and soothe his nerves.

60|$|We did {{not remain}} long in this city, but soon started {{on our way}} across the continent, leaving behind us our three sailor companions, who {{intended}} to ship from this port as soon as an advantageous opportunity offered itself. These men heard no news of their vessel, although they felt quite sure that she had reached Honolulu, where she had probably been condemned and the crew scattered. As some baggage belonging to {{my wife and my}} father-in-law had been left on board this vessel, I had hopes that Mr. Enderton would remain in San Francisco and order it forwarded to him there; or that he would <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> trip to Honolulu to attend to the matter personally. But in this I was disappointed. He seemed to take very little interest in his missing trunks, and wished only to press on to the East. I wrote to Honolulu, desiring the necessary steps to be taken to forward the baggage in case it had arrived there; and soon afterward our party of five started eastward.|$|E
6000|$|No; I {{will not}} <b>even</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> humbler {{standard}} of comparison, {{and look at}} London {{side by side with}} Brussels, Antwerp, Munich, Turin. Each of those is a city, and a fine city in its way; but each of them is small. Still, even by their side, London is again but a squalid village. I insist upon that point, because, misled by their ancient familiarity with London, most Englishmen have had their senses and understandings so blunted on this issue, that they really don't know what is meant by a town, or a fine town, when they see one. And don't suppose it's because London is in Britain and these other towns out of it that I make these remarks: for Bath is a fine town, Edinburgh is a fine town, even Glasgow and Newcastle are towns, while London is still a straggling, sprawling, invertebrate, inchoate, overgrown village. I am as free, I hope, from anti-patriotic as from patriotic prejudice. The High Street in Oxford, Milsom Street in Bath, Princes Street in Edinburgh, those are all fine streets that would attract attention even in France or Germany. But the Strand, Piccadilly, Regent Street, Oxford Street--good Lord, deliver us! ...|$|E

60|$|I <b>even</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> little stroll to {{look for}} Hans, who had {{vanished}} in his mysterious fashion, but the afternoon was so hot and oppressive with coming thunder, that soon I came back again and fell {{into a variety of}} reflections that I need not detail.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, {{one week}} before his 75th birthday, Lester Germer died of a massive heart attack while lead {{climbing}} a rock climb at the Shawangunk Ridge (Eyebrow, 5.6).

60|$|Part of {{all this}} despairing cry arose from weariness, and part from a luxurious desire to be comforted, for it was sweet to feel her sympathy. He <b>even</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> morbid {{pleasure}} in the distress of her eyes and lips while her rich voice murmured in soothing protest.|$|R
50|$|Cook raced from 1980 to 1988, and {{his first}} major event was the NORBA Nationals in 1984, at which he took second place.
