500|$|Reagan {{reflected}} on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, My Turn. She described lunching with former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert S. Strauss, wherein Strauss said to her, [...] "When you first came to town, Nancy, I didn't like you at all. But after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you, I changed my mind and said, 'She's some broad!'" [...] Reagan responded, [...] "Bob, based on the press reports I read then, I wouldn't have liked me either!" ...|$|E
500|$|Romney {{supported}} the American Civil Rights Movement while governor. [...] Although {{he belonged to}} a church that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, Romney's hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement. He reflected, [...] "It was only after I got to Detroit that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Negroes and began {{to be able to}} evaluate them and I began to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites." [...] During his first State of the State address in January 1963, Romney declared that [...] "Michigan's most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination—in housing, public accommodations, education, administration of justice, and employment." [...] Romney helped create the state's first civil rights commission.|$|E
500|$|As he {{had worked}} with Sellers, he also came to know Spike Milligan, with whom he became a firm friend, and best man at Milligan's second marriage: [...] "I loved The Goon Show, and issued an album of it on my label Parlophone, which is how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Spike." [...] The album was Bridge on the River Wye. It was a spoof of the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, being based on the 1957 Goon Show episode [...] "An African Incident." [...] It was {{intended}} {{to have the same}} name as the film, but shortly before its release, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Martin edited out the 'K' every time the word Kwai was spoken, with Bridge on the River Wye being the result. The River Wye is a river that runs through England and Wales. The album featured Milligan, Sellers, Jonathan Miller, and Peter Cook, playing various characters.|$|E

5000|$|When Winifred Rushforth died, in August 1983, Prince Charles {{was said}} to be very taken aback. [...] "If only <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her sooner!" [...] he is said to have exclaimed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, [...] "I'm {{going over}} to talk to him, and I needn't keep you any longer in the meanwhile. You will {{remember}} that only you and <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the Canopus is really doing." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{played the}} golf course at Pinehurst No. 2 for six solid months, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Mr. Donald Ross...(who) had built the Fort Bragg golf course. He would come over and watch us play golf, {{and most of the}} time the captain and colonel hauled me over there. They didn't know who Mr. Ross was, but the other fellow walking with him was JC Penney, and they all knew him." ...|$|E
2500|$|While polls {{attributed}} Davis' declining popularity to {{the energy}} and budget problems, some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal. Davis, a moderate, had some disagreements with the more liberal Democratic-controlled Legislature. Democrat John L. Burton, {{the leader of the}} California State Senate, was Davis' chief antagonist. In 2003, Republican leader Jim Brulte told The Los Angeles Times that Davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times. [...] "I never felt <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him ... I always felt a little sorry for him".|$|E
2500|$|... "As {{early as}} 1945 Paul Stern pointed out Fritzi Gordon to me, saying 'There is the partner for you.' I was not enthusiastic. For one thing, I {{already had a}} more than {{satisfactory}} partner in Doris Rhodes, a good friend, and for another I suspected that Mrs. Gordon and I would not hit it off socially, whatever we did at the table. My opinion did not change when she played at the Hamilton Club and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her better. [...] as far as bridge is concerned, I have not a word of complaint about Fritzi Gordon, for she was a wonderful player and an excellent partner, who contributed greatly to my own success." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nary one! <b>I</b> only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{it was a}} small {{train of}} only two wagons, and it sorter melted into Californy through a {{southern}} pass, and kinder petered out, and no one ever heard of it agin, and that was all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{admitted}} with thoughtful candor. [...] "The few <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> seem <b>to</b> have an importance that perhaps {{is not very}} common at home. For instance, I heard Leslie giving his wife his reasons for thinking of buying some Hereford cattle, and his respect for her opinion impressed me." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Germans {{used to tell}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{them well}} because I played soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they {{used to tell me}} that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being {{destroyed}} by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there's going to be a war because the Israelis and the “Bushies” [...] you know, the bully, the bigot in the United States [...] tells you that if you're not with me you're against me.|$|E
2500|$|... "The motifs I {{was able}} to select from this milieu (the workers' lives) offered me, in a simple and forthright way, what I {{discovered}} to be beautiful.... People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic to me. On the other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts. It was not until much later...when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the women who would come to my husband for help, and incidentally also to me, that I was powerfully moved by {{the fate of the}} proletariat and everything connected with its way of life.... But what I would like to emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some {{years ago}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Mr Ford, {{the father of}} the little boy who is at the school. He {{recommended}} me to Mr Abney, who wanted somebody to help with the school.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> suppose you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about him, anyway," [...] said Fulkerson, thoughtfully. [...] "And I've been {{wondering}} just how I should tell you. Can't always make out {{exactly how much}} of a Bostonian you really are! Ever been out in the natural-gas country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{understand}} that," [...] said Lemuel. [...] "I couldn't help it, at first. But I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{see it all}} in {{a different}} light since then. I know that you meant the best by me. I know now that what I wrote wasn't worth anything, and just how you must have looked at it. I didn't know some things then that I do now; and since <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> a little more I have understood better what you meant by all you said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At first I had but, from {{continually}} {{talking with}} them, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their language--I won't say {{as well as}} Punjabi, but certainly very well--and I shall pass in it at the next examination." ...|$|E
60|$|Stony incredulity {{lingered in}} his eyes: but it broke down before my {{friendly}} attitude. With a slight upward toss {{of his arms}} (<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that gesture well afterward) he bolted out of the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And, Sir, before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{him for a}} {{boy that}} would not give a false account of himself, I used to wonder whether he could have run away from some school, and have friends above the common. If you observe, Sir, he speaks so remarkably well.' ...|$|E

"I {{first heard}} Dinah when I {{was just a}} kid," [...] said Aretha, [...] "back around the time she made 'Fat Daddy.' <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her {{personally}} in those days, though she and my father were good friends."The idea of recording a tribute to her {{grew out of the}} way I've always felt about her. I didn't try to do the songs the same way she did them, necessarily - just the way they felt best, whether they happened to be similar or different." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} from the {{resistance}} movement, smuggled out of Auschwitz, he was described as “the greatest bastard of Auschwitz”. His colleague, Perry Broad, wrote about him in his report that “he enjoyed taking part in the mass executions”. Rudolf Höss, who was not hesitant in his criticism of his staff, wrote in his memoirs: “Palitzsch was the most cunning and sly creature <b>I</b> ever <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> during my long, many-sided duty in the various concentration camps. He literally climbed over dead bodies in order to satisfy his lust for power.” ...|$|R
6000|$|To-morrow {{fortnight}} we purpose {{being at}} the Falls of Niagara, and then we shall turn back and really begin to wind up. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the [...] "Carol" [...] so well that I can't remember it, and occasionally go dodging about in the wildest manner to pick up lost pieces. They took it so tremendously last night that I was stopped every five minutes. One poor young girl in mourning burst into a passion of grief about Tiny Tim, and was taken out. This is all my news.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would have}} been duller still," [...] Netta laughed. [...] "I {{should have been a}} long time before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> people, and there is no good in knowing people when you are going right away from them in a short time, and may never meet them again." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{flood of}} light was let in upon me by this brief explanation, though I could not but {{wonder at the}} simplicity, or {{strength}} of character, that induced so strange a confidence. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Dus better, the whole became clear enough; but, at the moment, I was a little surprised.|$|E
6000|$|... "She--not the Countess, I shouldn't {{like you}} to have that idea, but his wife--came to be pretty {{friendly}} with my missus later on, and that's how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the details. He comes to her one day looking pretty sheepish-like, as one can well believe, and maybe he'd been drinking a bit to give himself courage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] she added, [...] "the {{people here}} are real kind to me; they hardly ever let me feel myself alone. We make up little parties, you know, picnics and excursions. And then, of course, there is the Opera and the Symphony Concerts, and the {{subscription}} dances. The dear old king has been doing a good deal this winter, too; and I must say the Embassy folks have been most thoughtful, so far as I am concerned. No, {{it would not be}} right for me to complain of loneliness, not now that <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> a few people, as it were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should just}} think I did," [...] {{returned}} the trapper, {{a look of}} self-satisfied pride crossing his scarred visage as {{he thought of the}} celebrity as a hunter to which he had attained. [...] "It took me a goodish while, of course, to circumvent it all, but in time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be--well, you <b>know</b> what, an' I'm not fond o' blowin' my own trumpet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, uncle; I {{know only}} the side {{they choose to}} present to me, which is a {{pleasant}} side, and I do not care <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more. But it is different in this case. Mr. Simcoe is here nearly every day; he {{has become one of}} our inner circle; you are naturally deeply interested in him, and I am, therefore, interested in him also, and want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more of him than <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> He is brave and pleasant; is he also honest and honorable? Is he a man of thoroughly good principles? We know what he tells us of his life and his adventures, but he only tells us what he chooses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's curious how events seem to {{have started}} beside those lonely river-reaches among the rocks," [...] he remarked. [...] "It was there that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Nasmyth, and through him I met you. It was there that I learned {{something}} about your brother and Clarence Gladwyne.

6000|$|... "There {{was a man}} I knew named Jerry Hammond, {{that was}} a contractor, and {{sometimes}} he had pretty big jobs on hand, buildin' or road-makin' or somethin' or other. He'd contract to do anything, would Jerry, no matter whether he'd ever done it before or not. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his times and seasons for collecting money, and I laid for him." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{hearing of}} this, Urquhart {{considered}} {{that he had}} been swindled, and set off in quest of Cocky. That boy was not to be found, however, until his threepence had disappeared in tarts. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> of this affair through Robbins' backing up of Cocky, and telling Urquhart that nobody was afraid of him. A ring was immediately formed round Urquhart and Robbins, which I had the pleasure of breaking up.|$|E
50|$|I {{was very}} lucky in my friendships and lucky {{in the books}} I chose. I read a book by Benjamin M. Anderson, whom <b>I</b> later <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> This was his 1917 book The Value of Money. He was an acute critic of nearly all other writers on money, and {{especially}} of Irving Fisher and his mechanical quantity theory of money. Mac Anderson read German, and discussed many German writers on money. He referred to the German edition of Ludwig von Mises's Theory of Money and Credit and wrote: 'In von Mises there {{seems to me to}} be very noteworthy clarity and power. His Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel is an exceptionally excellent book.' That impressed me.|$|R

"When <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Sailboat in the Moonlight", I {{thought it}} a fine melody with pretty chord changes and words that might be corny but didn't seem to be so bad when Lady Day {{delivered}} them. Then I chanced to find the sheet music at a Midwestern bazaar; at home, I picked out the melody with one finger and was astonished at how different it was from what Holiday sang. Until that moment, I had not fully gauged how freely imaginative her embellishments could be. By ironing out a phrase here, retarding another there, raising this note, slurring that, she transformed a hopelessly banal and predictable melody into something personal, real, meaningful." ...|$|R

The question at issues I have is: Which methods can class teachers in grades 1 - 3 use to help students with mathematics difficulties? and Which obstacles and opportunities are there in this work? To get answers to my questions, I have read relevant literature and interviewed 3 class teachers in central Sweden.
