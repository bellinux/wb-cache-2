5|$|On 22 April, Abu Nuwar {{issued a}} radio {{statement}} from the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs radio station denouncing Hussein. In coordination with Abu Nuwar, the following day, a Patriotic Congress composed of Hussein's opposition was held in Nablus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> demanding major palace officials be dismissed, expulsion of the American ambassador and military attaché, rejection of the Eisenhower Doctrine, federal unity with Egypt and Syria and reinstatement of the dismissed army officers, including Abu Nuwar. As {{a result of the}} congress, Hussein put Nablus, Jerusalem and Amman under military curfew, dissolved political parties, imposed press censorship, dismissed municipal councils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> in favor of military governors, disbanded Palestinian-dominated army units, arrested al-Nabulsi (who had since been made foreign minister) and dismissed the cabinet of Prime Minister Fakhri al-Khalidi. Although he eventually relaxed some of these measures, namely military curfews and severe press censorship, Hussein's moves significantly curtailed the constitutional democracy that existed in Jordan in the mid-1950s.|$|E

5|$|Yaish's {{four-year}} term legally expired in December 2009. While elections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled due to Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates.

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1st century {{there was}} a vicus at Sursee.

Imports from various regions of the Roman Empire (southern Spain, southern Italy, Lipari, southern and eastern Gaul and the Germanic areas) provide evidence of extensive trade relations. Sursee was likely a freight hub for trade with the entire Alpine region.|$|R

5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans are mixed with tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank.</b> Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting {{in an entirely different}} dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> and Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E

5|$|The al-Banna family's {{commercial}} experience, and {{the money}} they had managed to take with them, meant they could set themselves up in business again, Melman writes. Their orange groves, however, had gone, {{now part of the}} new state of Israel, which had declared its independence on 14 May 1948. The family moved to Nablus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> then under Jordanian control. Abu Nidal graduated from high school there in 1955, and joined the Arab nationalist Ba'ath party. He began a degree course in engineering at Cairo University, but left without a degree after two years.|$|E

50|$|The Bundesbank became {{worried about}} three {{elements}} of the sudden boom: the sudden financial shifts between east and west, {{which led to a}} jump in money supply; government deficits resulting from large expenditures in eastern Germany; and the potentially inflationary effects of a rapid growth rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bank</b> warned that interest rates would have to remain high to keep price increases under control. The bank raised short-term interest rates sharply through 1991 and 1992, with the average rate of short-term interest climbing from 7.1 percent in 1989 to 8.5 percent in 1990, to 9.2 percent in 1991, and to 9.5 percent <b>in</b> 1992. <b>The</b> Bundesbank permitted rates to begin falling only in 1993—to 7.3 percent—when it believed that the inflationary pressures had been contained by the recessionary effects of the credit squeeze.|$|R
5|$|The list {{includes}} four Israeli settlements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> an area outside of sovereign Israeli territory.

The area and population of Jerusalem includes that of East Jerusalem which has been de facto annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem's municipal borders under the Jerusalem Law. This, however, is not recognized by the international community who regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E
5|$|Widnes {{continues}} to be an industrial town and its major industry is still the manufacture of chemicals although there has been some diversification in recent years. In 2006 a new freight park, known as the 3MG Mersey Multimodal Gateway, was opened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> area of the town.

5|$|In 2005, Israel withdrew {{its troops}} from the Gaza Strip and removed the {{thousands}} of Israelis who had settled in the territory. See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> in response.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, a geopolitical dispute with the global Islamic {{community}} and Jewish groups in the United States and Israel arose over an Israeli franchisee opening stores in the Israeli-occupied territories. When Burger King franchisee in Israel, Rikamor, Ltd., opened a store <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim in August of that year, Islamic groups, including the Arab League and American Muslims for Jerusalem, argued that international Burger King parent Burger King Corporation's licensing of the store helped legitimize the illegal settlement. Beyond the called-for Islamic boycott of the company, the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries {{that are part of}} the League's membership.|$|E
5|$|With little {{mathematical}} hope {{of winning}} the nomination and polls showing another likely defeat in the New York primary, Kennedy prepared {{to withdraw from the}} race. However, partially due to Jewish voter unhappiness with a U.S. vote at the United Nations against Israeli settlements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> Kennedy staged an upset and won the March 25 vote by a 59–41 percent margin. Carter responded with an advertising campaign that attacked Kennedy's character in general without explicitly mentioning Chappaquiddick, but Kennedy still managed a narrow win in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary. Carter won 11 of 12 primaries held in May, while on the June 3 Super Tuesday primaries, Kennedy won California, New Jersey, and three smaller states out of eight contests. Overall, Kennedy had won 10 presidential primaries against Carter, who won 24.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 1957, Abu Nuwar, Rimawi and al-Hiyari {{were sentenced}} to 15 years {{imprisonment}} in absentia. During his exile from Jordan, Abu Nuwar initially resided in Damascus, along with other Jordanian dissidents, including al-Hiyari and Rimawi. However, in 1958, Abu Nuwar moved to Egypt following that country's union with Syria forming the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Nasser's presidency (Syria seceded in 1961). Thenceforth, Abu Nuwar lived much of {{the remainder of his}} exile in Cairo. In 1958, {{under the aegis of the}} UAR and with assistance from the head of Syrian intelligence, Abd al-Hamid al-Sarraj, the Jordanian dissidents in exile formed the Jordanian Revolutionary Council. It consisted of Jordanian Baathists, left-leaning politicians and dissident army officers, including Abu Nuwar, al-Hiyari and Abdullah al-Tal, a friend of Abu Nuwar who had been exiled by Hussein before him.
