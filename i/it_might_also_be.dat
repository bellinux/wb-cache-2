Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang(1985) elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological differences from the woolly hare.

25|$|Murdoch {{was more}} of an {{off-side}} player whose drives and cut strokes were regarded as among the best of his day; but his leg-side play was reputedly not so strong, and his ability against good spin bowling was not as impressive as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Also,</b> he <b>was</b> believed to be lacking in command against top-class pace bowling on difficult wickets; if conditions, were perfect, however, his batting often followed suit.|$|R
25|$|The Bridge of Asses (Pons Asinorum) {{states that}} in {{isosceles}} triangles the angles {{at the base}} equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.

25|$|The raid on Babylon {{could not}} have been {{intended}} to exercise sovereignty over the region; it was simply too far from Anatolia and the Hittites' center of power. It is thought, however, that the raid on Babylon brought an end to the Amorite dynasty of Hammurabi and allowed the Kassites to take power, and so might have arisen from an alliance with the Kassites or an attempt to curry favor with them. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> that Mursili undertook the long-distance attack for personal motives, namely as a way to outdo the military exploits of his predecessor, Hattusili I.|$|E
25|$|This custody {{occurred}} in a period when, urged on by Bishop Clement, King Alexander II of Scotland had become more assertive in the area, particularly in relation to overlordship over its MacDougall ruler, Eóghan of Argyll. The events of that decade thus may have induced Eóghan, at Clement's urging, to send a kinsman to be trained as a Dominican, and Laurence was indeed {{the first of three}} Dominican bishops of Argyll in the following century, another of whom {{appears to have been a}} MacDougall also. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> noted that the bishopric of Dunblane was partly dedicated to St Laurence, after whom Laurence may have been named.|$|E

25|$|Breakfast (quraac) is an {{important}} meal for Somalis, who often start the day with some style of tea (shahie) or coffee (qaxwa). The tea is often {{in the form of}} haleeb shai (Yemeni milk tea) in the north. The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (canjeero or canjeelo) similar to Ethiopian injera, but smaller and thinner. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> eaten with a stew (maraqe) or soup. Qado or lunch is often elaborate. Varieties of bariis (rice), the most popular probably being basmati, usually serve as the main dish alongside goat or lamb. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and garden sage are used to aromatize these different rice delicacies. Somalis eat dinner as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, supper is often served after Tarawih prayers; sometimes as late as 11 pm.|$|E

500|$|Genetic {{studies of}} the {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) of the populations of C. mutica reveal high genetic diversity in the Sea of Japan region, unequivocally identifying it as their native range. In contrast, non-native populations in North America, Europe, and New Zealand had poor variation. The detection of genetic material present in non-native populations, however, also make it probable that there are unknown regions that C. mutica may also be native to; though <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> simply that the sample groups used in the studies were too small. Comparisons of mtDNA of the different populations {{make it possible to}} trace the possible routes of introduction. The most likely of which is that the original non-native introduction was to the west coast of North America, which exhibit the highest genetic diversity in non-native populations. Multiple later introductions happened in Europe and eastern North America. From here, additional populations were transported to nearby ports. [...] Europe and eastern North America are also the possible sources for the New Zealand C. mutica population.|$|E
500|$|The German {{government}} began {{development of an}} atomic weapons programme in April 1939 when two scientists, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie, declared in an issue of the scientific journal Nature [...] that atomic fission was possible and could produce immense amounts of power. The Joliot-Curies argued {{that not only did}} it have possibilities as a power source, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to create an extremely powerful weapon. By September 1941 the German scientists assigned to the programme had determined how a nuclear reactor could be developed; this required significant quantities of heavy water to act as a neutron moderator to encase the uranium which would be used to provide the material for a nuclear weapon. Heavy water was extremely scarce and difficult to produce, and Germany only possessed a small amount which had been produced in laboratories. Norway possessed a large stockpile which was produced by the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant near the village of Rjukan, but the Norwegian government would not sell more than three gallons of heavy water a month, becoming suspicious of the sudden increase in demand for the water by the German government. When Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany in April 1940 this obstruction ended; the Vemork plant was captured and began producing heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme. Production of heavy water was slowed initially due to the effects of the fighting in Norway and a drought in the area, which led to a lack of water to provide hydroelectric power for the plant. Once the weather improved and snow began to melt, providing enough water to create sufficient hydroelectric power, production continued.|$|E
