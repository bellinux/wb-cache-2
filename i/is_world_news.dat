40|$|Although {{exporting}} {{agricultural products}} {{has become an}} important means of reducing stockpiles in the United States, few studies have assessed the farmers 2 ̆ 7 views {{of international trade and}} foreign policies which affect these exports. By analyzing questionnaires returned by a sample of 649 Nebraska farmers and ranchers, this dissertation attempts to close the current research gap. In order to understand variations of attitudes within the group of agricultural producers, their economic interest (production of heavily exported commodities and high gross farm income) is weighed as an independent variable against more commonly cited determinants of world view such as education, partisanship, group membership, and age. The general hypothesis is that the production of heavily exported commodities correlates with a more internationalist perspective. ^ Primary findings are: (1) Higher gross farm income is correlated with the belief that more exports mean greater profits. (2) Older respondents are more likely to <b>be</b> interested in <b>world</b> <b>news.</b> (3) Farmer/ranchers with more education, Republican Party affiliation, higher gross farm income, and more interest in <b>world</b> <b>news</b> <b>are</b> most likely to support an active role for the U. S. in the world. (4) Foreign policy goals with a humanitarian emphasis are supported by those who expect more profits from increased exports, as well as by older, more liberal agricultural producers and those favoring an active role for the U. S. in the world. (5) More militaristic foreign policy goals are correlated with Republican Party affiliation, lower education levels, interest in <b>world</b> <b>news,</b> and support for U. S. activism in the world. ...|$|R
