Intorduction The external wall insulation system is a composite insulation decorate the outside of the wall structure, The material itself, the combustion performance and fire resistance is a key factor in the spread of resistance against the adjacent building fire and further spread of fire within buildings. When the fire broke out, If the wall insulation materials haven’t fire resistance, The flame will be passed upward propagation through the external thermal insulation system, Leading to the spread of fire. Therefore, if we want to fundamentally prevent tragedies from happening again, we must use the insulation materials of fire performance. Especially the last two years, Fires frequently occur, like CCTV fire, Shanghai Jiaozhou Road fire, it makes people to put forward higher requirements for the fire performance of external insulation materials, In this context, how to ensure that the building fire was not caused by insulation materials and how to ensure that the insulation materials do not contribute to flame spread and expansion when the fire broke out are worthy of the key research...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{safety is}} a {{significant}} concern for fiber-reinforced-polymer (FRP) –strengthened RC structures, particularly for indoor applications. To satisfy fire resistance requirements, <b>fire</b> <b>insulation</b> layers may be provided to protect FRP-strengthened RC members. This paper presents a simple, design-oriented method for predicting temperatures in insulated FRP-strengthened RC members under standard fire exposure. The proposed method consists of two sets of formulas: one set for predicting temperatures in unprotected FRP-strengthened RC members exposed to a standard fire; and another set to convert a <b>fire</b> <b>insulation</b> layer into an equivalent concrete layer. As a result, an insulated FRP-strengthened RC member can be analyzed as an unprotected RC member with an enlarged section for which a similar simple method has previously been established by these authors. In the present study, a finite element (FE) approach for the temperature analysis of insulated FRP-strengthened RC members was first developed and then verified using existing test data. Then the verified FE approach was employed in a parametric study to generate extensive numerical data, on which {{the second set of}} formulas were established. The proposed temperature prediction method is shown to provide accurate predictions of both FE results and test data of insulated FRP-strengthened RC members.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{response}} to several claims from Manufacturers that intumes-cent coatings {{could be used}} in place of <b>fire</b> <b>insulation</b> and provide equal protection to shipboard structures during a fire, U. S. Navy conducted an extensive investigation of several fire protective coatings for use aboard ship. These fire protective coatings included water and solvent based coatings, insulative coatings, and foams. The objective of this program was to identify passive fire protection (PFP) coatings for shipboard interior applications capable of meeting U. S. Navy (USN) fire resistance requirements (DRAFT MIL-PRF-XX 381) of 30 min rating with backside average temperature rise less than 139 C using UL- 1709 fire curve (post flashover fire). This evaluation consisted of small scale fire, adhesion, and impact tests; intermediate scale room corner fire tests, and full scale fire tests conducted aboard ex-USS SHADWELL. The test results with steel substrate show that all candidate coatings failed to meet minimum U. S. Navy fire resistance criteria when used as stand-alone coatings. Furthermore, many coatings demonstrated poor adhesion, and fell off from the substrate during the fire test. These data have led the Navy to conclude that intumescent coatings tested in this study are not sufficient to protect shipboard spaces during a fire and are not equivalent when used alone as direct replacement for batt or blanket type fibrous <b>fire</b> <b>insulation</b> (mineral wool, *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|E

Section 6 (Design for Fire Resistance) of the New Zealand standard for concrete structure (NZS 3101, 1995) provides recommended values and minimum requirements for concrete at elevated temperatures. These values will be reviewed {{with respect to}} overseas standards and experimental data to find their applicability to lightweight and high strength concretes.

Considerations {{for the application}} of sandwich {{structures are}} weight reduction, <b>fire</b> <b>insulation,</b> maintenance, RCS reduction and functional combinations, such as radar transparency, aperture incorporation, conformal arrays and ballistic incorporation.

Typical failure modes for these constructions are: failure of the adhesive bond between steel and sandwich, core failure (see Fig. 1), delamination and in-plane (compression) failure of the FRP facings (see also Fig. 2). The failure models for delamination, adhesive bond failure and foam core or filler material failure were developed at TNO over the past decade and form together the so-called failure prediction tool, or FPT.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a summary of}} Thin Spray-On Liner (TSL) effects on concrete. Three aspects, <b>fire</b> <b>insulation,</b> adhesion strength on concrete surface and load carrying capacity (i. e. flexural strength) on segmental concrete liners, are presented. Small-scale to full-scale laboratory tests were conducted using ASTM standards or devised methods. The TSL effects on three aspects were then compared with the results for uncoated concrete specimens. Numerical analyses using TEMP/W for the thermal response of TSL and a FE program, ABAQUS for the mechanical response of TSL were respectively carried out and compared with the measured results. Additionally, numerical analyses in respect to the joint rotational stiffness for the modern joint and the flexible joint were performed. The TSL effect on the flexible joint was also evaluated. Based {{on the results of}} this study, it is revealed that TSL is an excellent fire insulating material as well as a structural substrate material. The TSL coating can reduce the heat transmitted in the concrete during a fire. Also, the TSL coating can reduce concrete spalling and crack propagation during failure.

40|$|In this paper, {{a series}} of {{experimental}} studies conducted to investigate the fire behavior of insulated full-scale carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) -strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams is presented. Four CFRP-strengthened RC beams, respectively insulated with a thick coating system, ultrathin coating system and calcium silicate board system, were tested under ISO 834 standard fire exposure. The test results revealed that satisfactory fire endurance for CFRP-strengthened concrete beams can be obtained with {{the protection of the}} three systems. The major role of <b>fire</b> <b>insulation</b> materials is to delay the failure of adhesive in the early stage and reduce the performance degradation of concrete and internal reinforced bars after the bond failure of the CFRP–concrete interface. In addition, it was indicated that effective anchorages of CFRP and reasonable anchoring constructions of the insulation system played important roles in ensuring the fire-resistant capability of CFRP-strengthened concrete beams.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has long}} been known that fire could {{dramatically}} reduce the characteristic strength of the reinforced concrete member. A significant effort has been devoted to study the effect of fire on the reinforced concrete members. Most of them were focused on evaluating columns’ fire resistance and provided some recommendations of structural fire resistance. Little attention was paid to the behavior of CFRP strengthened columns after fire. The main objective of the present work is to study the behavior of reinforced concrete CFRP strengthened columns exposed to fire under axial load experimentally. A furnace and a loading frame had been built to allow the application of the axial load driven from a hydraulic jack on the fired specimens at the same time. Fourteen CFRP strengthened columns with different protection layers subjected to 900 °C for 30 min and axial load at the same time according to ASTM were tested. It can be concluded that the some materials used for protection have low thermal conductivity and good resistance to fire, and CFRP materials used with a appropriate <b>fire</b> <b>insulation</b> can endure elevated temperatures of fire under service loads for more than 70 min.

The multifunctional bulkhead aims at increasing the resilience of naval vessels, reduce damage and repair time and provide a safer environment for crew and equipment against internal explosions. There are several technologies available to protect warships against the blast of an internal explosion.
