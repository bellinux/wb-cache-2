5000|$|In the Spring of 1981, a student, Eric V. Smith, began {{developing}} a program he called Apple Draw on an Apple II at University of Virginia. After {{he graduated in}} 1984, Mr. Smith was hired by an architectural firm, Stuart Griffin Burgh and Associates, in Charlottesville, Virginia. At this firm he began porting the Apple <b>Draw</b> <b>program</b> to the Corvus Concept platform as DataCAD. In 1984, only one license of DataCAD was sold before it was ported to the IBM PC platform. DataCAD was developed exclusively for the MS-DOS operating system until May 1998.|$|E
40|$|Remote access feels {{different}} from local access. The major issues are consistency (machines vary in GUIs, applications, and devices) and responsiveness (the user must wait for network and server delays). Protium attacks these by partitioning programs into local viewers that connect to remote services using application-specific protocols. Partitioning allows viewers to be customized {{to adapt to}} local features and limitations. Services are responsible for maintaining long-term state. Viewers manage the user interface and use state to reduce communication between viewer and service, reducing latency whenever possible. System infrastructure sits between the viewer and service, supporting replication, consistency, session management, and multiple simultaneous viewers. The prototype system includes an editor, a <b>draw</b> <b>program,</b> a PDF viewer, a map database, a music jukebox, and windowing system support. It runs on servers, workstations, PCs, and PDAs under Plan 9, Linux, and Windows; services and viewers have been written in C, Java, and Concurrent ML...|$|E

40|$|Constraint based <b>draw</b> <b>programs</b> require {{users to}} {{understand}} and manage relationships between drawing elements. By establishing constraint relationships among elements the user effectively programs the drawing's behavior. This programming task requires a more sophisticated visual interface than conventional <b>draw</b> <b>programs</b> provide. Users must have available — in a convenient format — information about {{the structure of the}} constraints that determine the drawing's interactive edit behavior. This format must support editing and debugging. CoDraw is a constraint based <b>drawing</b> <b>program</b> that can be interactively extended by its users.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} recent explorations in sketch {{recognition and}} management to support architectural design. The exploration and decision-making of early, conceptual design {{better suited to}} freehand drawing, sketching, and diagramming than to the hard-line drawing and construction kit approaches of traditional CAD. However, current sketch programs that simulate paper and pencil fail {{to take advantage of}} symbolic manipulation and interactive editing offered by computational environments. The paper presents a ‘computer as cocktail napkin’ program, which recognizes and interprets hand-drawn diagrams and provides a graphical search facility, simulated tracing paper, and a multi-user shared drawing surface. The cocktail napkin is the basis of Stretch-A-Sketch, a constraint based <b>draw</b> <b>program</b> that maintains spatial relations initially specified by a diagram. The cocktail napkin program is also the basis for a query-by-diagram scheme to access a case based design aid as well as to a small collection of images of famous buildings. The paper briefly reviews these extensions of the cocktail napkin program...|$|E

40|$|Current <b>drawing</b> <b>programs</b> provide mainly {{three ways}} for {{carrying}} out object alignment: either by issuing an alignment command, or by using direct positioning {{with the help of}} gravity active points, or by making use of constraints. The first technique has limited functionality, and the other two may be mysterious for a novice. We describe here a new direct manipulation tool for alignment. We show that while direct manipulation helps to make the tool intuitive, it has through iterative design evolved into a tool that also offers functionality not found in current commercial products. KEYWORDS: <b>drawing</b> <b>programs,</b> alignment tools, direct manipulation, two-handed interaction, iterative design INTRODUCTION Direct manipulation has {{for more than a decade}} been one of the preferred styles of interaction. <b>Drawing</b> <b>programs</b> were among the first applications that made heavy use of direct manipulation.
