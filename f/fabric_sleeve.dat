25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous <b>fabric</b> <b>sleeve</b> (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{bacteria}} {{were obtained from the}} exterior, and from the body fluids, of insects collected locally, and Lepidoptera species obtained from an Entomological supplier. The insects were found to contain a {{wide range of}} bacteria, both internally and externally including Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium used in the biocontrol of larval pests. Although not major pathogens, many of the bacterial isolates can cause infection in immune-compromised patients, a possibility which is discussed. Larvae of the Peacock butterfly (Vanessa io) were fed nettle leaves which were deliberately covered with a range of bacteria. Feeding with B. thuringiensis not surprisingly, lead to the death of all of the larvae after 4 hours. The results show that feeding with B. subtilis and E. coli can lead to larval death, while MRSA was shown to be less toxic. Feeding the larvae with the other bacteria killed some larvae, with the death rate after feeding B. subtilis and E. coli being identical. Bacillus cereus was isolated from the larvae fed B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis. Bacteria were isolated from the Dermestidae (beetle larvae) obtained from human cadavers. The dominant species of bacteria was Enterococcus faecalis which was isolated from inside the larvae extracted from a human corpse. Two species of Clostridium were also isolated; Clostridium cochlearium was isolated from the Dermestid larva, the other, Clostridium paraputrificum was isolated from inside the larva. Brevibacterium ravenspurgense, Staphylococcus hominis, Lishizhenia tianjinensis and Bacillus safensis, were also isolated from inside larvae, extracted from human body. The biocontrol agents Bacillus thuringiensis and Paenibacillus popiliae were shown to be capable of mediating in vitro, transformations which are important in the major environmental mineral cycles These bacteria are likely to reach the agriculture soils following treatment and, on germination can presumably participate in mineral cycling Both bacteria were shown to be capable in vitro hydrolysis of urea, and were shown to oxidize ammonium and elemental sulphur and also to solubilize a source of insoluble phosphate. It is not clear however, to what extent the ability of these bacteria to participate in these reactions in vitro correlates with the same activity in soils and other environments. Insects were sampled at a height of 120 meters using a drone–towed <b>fabric</b> <b>sleeve</b> and their microbial content studied. The major point of interest behind this work is the use of a drone-towed sleeve to sample the insects. As far as can be determined, this is the first reported use of this approach to sample high flying insects in relation to a study of their microbiology. The use of a drone was shown to be ideal for the high altitude sampling of insects since it proved to be both powerful and highly manoeuvrable and {{there is no doubt that}} the drone used could have been used to sample at greater heights than the 120 m used here. The results relating to the microbiology of the insects sampled using the drone are not surprisingly similar to those obtained using other sampling methods, since the drone, of course, does not necessarily sample insects which differ from those obtained using more traditional approaches. An octanol-based midge sampler (Predator) was used to obtain large numbers of midges from the air, in relations to studying their microbiology this approach appears to be novel. The midge-biomass collected was found to contain microbes and was shown to break down in an agricultural soil to release ammonium and nitrate. The potential use of this material as an agricultural or home fertilizer is discussed. Finally, larger moths were trapped using a Robinson UV light trap. The moths were found to carry filamentous fungi on their bodies, some of which are plant pathogens, notably of trees. ...|$|E

40|$|Sport {{compression}} garments {{have gained}} popularity amongst fitness enthusiasts in recent years, whilst scientific knowledge on their performance {{in terms of}} pressure generation on the underlying limb and the physiological comfort of the wearer remains scarce. The aim {{of this research is}} to predict, measure and validate pressure generated by SCGs on the underlying tissue of human and to evaluate the physiological comfort performance of the garments. Medical compression garments, their application, classification and the methods used in the prediction and validation of theoretical pressure inserted by them, were investigated through background research. This knowledge is used as a base, in order to predict and validate the theoretical pressure induced by sport compression garments. The theoretical pressure was predicted using the Law of Laplace, by testing the fabrics comprising sport compression garments for tensile properties according to a suitable method which was developed for the application under investigation. Validation of theoretical pressure was carried out through a linear regression model, whereby measured interface pressure generated by <b>fabric</b> <b>sleeves</b> over rigid cylinders was predicted with high accuracy, having the theoretical pressure as the predictor. Furthermore, the influence of composition of different fabrics within one garment on tensile properties and the resultant pressure was evaluated. It was observed that the amount and power of each fabric within the composition dictates the resultant pressure. The influence of the combination of weft and warp strain on interface pressure was also investigated and it was observed that the introduction of warp strain increases the resultant interface pressure. The physiological comfort properties of fabrics comprising sport compression garments were examined with standard and developed methods of testing. The developed method consisted of the introduction of strain in the weft direction and/or moisture when testing the fabrics, with the aim of investigating the comfort properties of the fabrics in conditions close to the wear applications of these garments. The moisture management capacity of the fabrics investigated was rated as poor. The introduction of strain increased the thermal resistance and decreased water-vapour resistance, surface roughness and friction of fabrics, whereas the presence of moisture decreased the surface roughness and increased the friction. Protocol was developed for taking lower-body measurements, relative to the application under investigation. A group of participants was scanned with a 3 D body-scanner and the lower-body measurements were evaluated for participants who fitted the same size category of sport compression garments. Variations in circumferential measurements were observed, which ultimately affects the induced pressure from compression garments. Position of important lower-body points such as calf, knee, mid-thigh and maximum thigh were calculated in regards to crotch height along the leg for both genders, and by comparison to existing anthropometric knowledge, differences in the body proportions of different ethnic groups was revealed...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} were investigated between the prickle discomfort scores, assessed by human response from wearer trial garment assessment, and sleeve trial, Wool ComfortMeter (WCM) and Wool HandleMeter (WHM) assessments of fabrics, and fiber diameter characteristics including mean fiber diameter (MFD). Sleeve trial assessment followed exercise, {{the use of}} a control sleeve to reduce participant variance and four sensory traits. WHM provides eight handle parameters calibrated against a panel of experts. Four scenarios were evaluated: sleeve trial assessment with MFD; sleeve trial assessment with MFD and WCM; sleeve trial assessment with MFD, WCM and WHM parameters; and sleeve trial assessment with WCM and WHM parameters. Data were analyzed using correlation and forward stepwise general linear modeling. There was no evidence that the incidence of fibers coarser than 30 µm aided the prediction of prickle discomfort once MFD had been accounted for in the models. There were significant correlations between the WCM measurement and each sleeve trial attribute. There was no significant correlation between WHM parameters and sleeve trial assessments. The sleeve trial attribute of ‘skin feel’ offers potential to improve the predictions made of wearer trial prickle discomfort when used in association of the WCM with or without data on fabric MFD. There was little evidence to support using WHM parameters with or without the WCM in predicting wearer assessed prickle discomfort of fabrics. These results indicate that the rapid evaluation of <b>fabrics</b> using <b>sleeve</b> trial assessment can provide cost effective ranking of consumer preferences...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} prickle discomfort sensations of wool fabrics are primarily determined by the mean fiber diameter of the wool. It is also known that differences in wool fiber curvature (crimp) affect softness of handle of greasy wool and of wool textiles. In a replicated experiment, we investigated if wearers could detect the effect of using 17 µm superfine wool of low (74 °/mm) or high (114 °/mm) fiber curvature, and when the wools were blended with 17 µm cashmere (fiber curvature 49 °/mm) in differing proportions, on four comfort sensations. Eight single jersey knitted fabrics were assessed under a controlled protocol using forearm sleeves made of the test fabric and a control fabric.
