50|$|Villa {{earned their}} first {{point of the}} season in the next game, after drawing 1-1 with Newcastle United at the Sports Direct Arena. Ciaran Clark's first half goal was {{cancelled}} out by a wonder strike from Hatem Ben Arfa and Villa's performance was reported to be much improved after the Everton game. The draw also lifted Villa off the bottom of the table and out of the relegation zone, at this early stage. The club's first league win of the season and first in 13 league matches came two weeks later, after the international break, as they beat Swansea City 2-0 at Villa Park - a reverse score of the fixture last season. A first competitive goal for the club for Matthew Lowton, a swerving volley, and a goal on his debut for substitute Christian Benteke wrapped up the points for Villa. Ron Vlaar was named captain for the match, replacing Darren Bent, who had captained the side in the previous matches. On 21 September, Stephen Warnock joined Bolton Wanderers on a three-month loan. The left back had not made a competitive appearance beforehand after falling out of favour with the new manager. The following day (22 September), Villa suffered a shock defeat at the hands of newly promoted and bottom of the table Southampton, going down 1-4 at St Mary's. Villa took the lead through Darren Bent's first league goal {{of the season in}} the first half. However, goals from Nathaniel Clyne, a Ciaran Clark own goal and a brace, including a penalty, for Rickie Lambert saw the South Coast club emphatically earn their first points of the season. Ron Vlaar was again named Villa captain, leading it to be believed that he had replaced Darren Bent as team captain. Villa didn't let this result affect their next performance however, as they recorded a shock 2-4 victory against champions Manchester City in the League Cup on 25 September. Villa twice came back after being behind, first being 1-0 down and then 2-1 down. Mario Balotelli gave City a half time lead but a Gareth Barry own goal against his former club put Villa level. Aleksandar Kolarov scored a trademark free kick, before Gabriel Agbonlahor scored his first goal of the season to send the tie into extra time. Charles N'Zogbia netted Villa's third after Agbonlahor's shot was parried by Costel Pantilimon before Agbonlahor grabbed his second and Villa's fourth, courtesy of a <b>defelction,</b> sending them through to the next round. Villa's reward for defeating City was a potentially tricky away tie to League One side Swindon Town, managed by former West Ham striker Paolo Di Canio, to be played on 30 October. Villa's final game of the month was a highly anticipated West Midlands derby against early high flyers West Bromwich Albion, which ended 1-1. Each team wanted to show the other that they were the top team in the West Midlands, and Villa went about setting the Baggies straight with a dominant first half performance. However, it was West Brom who took the lead early in the second half, as James Morrison beat an attempted offside trap and crossed a low ball towards Shane Long, before Villa captain Ron Vlaar's attempted clearance hit Long's foot and rolled past Brad Guzan. Villa equalised through substitute Darren Bent in the 80th minute, after he coolly put in the rebound following a goal mouth scramble from a corner. The draw saw Villa register their worst ever start to a Premier League season, with only five points from six games.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Five-axis milling {{is widely}} used in {{machining}} of complex surfaces parts. Part quality and productivity are extremely affected by cutting force and tool wear, especially thin-walled complex surface, such as turbine blade. Although extensive {{research has been conducted}} on cutting force and tool wear in 3 -milling process, very few are on 5 -axis milling and bull-nose mills. This paper presents cutting forces with various cutting conditions as well as tool wear patterns in five-axis milling super alloy, which is essential to cutting vibration and <b>defelction</b> analysis of thin-walled complex surfaces parts. The roles of lead angle and tilt angle in five axis milling were investigated, which provide data for NC program edit. In addition, experiments in this research proved that tool wear played affected cutting forces outstandingly. Therefore, tool wear played an very important role in tool change...|$|E
40|$|The Laser Astrometric Test of Relativity (LATOR) is an {{experiment}} designed {{to test the}} metric nature of gravitation - a fundamental postulate of the Einstein´s general theory of relativity. The key element of LATOR is a geometric redundancy provided by the long-baseline optical interferometry and interplanetary laser ranging. By {{using a combination of}} independent time-series of gravitational <b>defelction</b> of light in the immediate proximity of the Sun, along with measurements of the Shapiro time delay on interplanetary scales (to a precision respectively better than 0. 1 picoradians and 1 cm), LATOR will significantly improve our knowledge of relativistic gravity and cosmology. The primary mission objective is i) to measure the key post-Newtonian Eddington parameter gamma with accuracy of a part in 10 ^ 9, 1 / 2 (1 - gamma) is adirect measure for presence of a new interaction in gravitational theory, and, its search, LATOR goes a factor 30, 000 beyond the present best result, Cassini´s 2003 test. Other mission objectives include: ii) first measurement of gravity´s non-linear effects on light to ~ 0. 01 % accuracy; including both the traditional Eddington beta parameter and also the spatial metric´s 2 nd order potential contribution (never measured before); iii) direcht measurement of the solar quadrupole moment J 2 (currently unavailable) to accuracy of a part in 200 of its expected size of ~ 10 ^- 7; iv) direct measurement of the "frame dragging" effect on light due to Sun´s rotational gravitomagentic field, to 0. 1 % accuracy. LATOR´s primary measurement pushes to unprecedented accuracy the search for cosmologically relevant scalar-tensor theories of gravity by looking for a remnant scalar field in today´s solar system. We discuss the science objectives of the mission, its technology, mission and optical designs, as well as expected performance of this experiment. LATOR will lead to very robust advances in the tests of fundamental physics: this mission could discover a violation or extension of general relativity and/or reveal the presence of an additional long range interaction in the physical law. There are no analogs to LATOR; it is unique and is a natrual culmination of solar system gravity experiments...|$|E

On September 28, 2014, he {{received}} his first {{start of the season}} against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after Ike Taylor broke his forearm the previous game. He finished the loss with four solo tackles and two pass <b>defelctions</b> and remained the starter, in place of Taylor, {{for the rest of the}} season. On October 26, 2014, Gay made a season-high eight tackles, six solo tackles, and had his first career touchdown when he returned an interception for 33-yards in a 51-34 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. He also gained some spotlight for his unique celebration dance after returning an interception for a touchdown.|$|R

In the season-opener he 11 solo tackles in a 17-6 defeat over the Washington Redskins. On November 23, 2014, Joseph made three combined tackles, a pass deflection, and returned an interception for a 60-yard touchdown in a 22-13 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. He finished {{the season with a}} career-high 75 combined tackles (70 solo), 11 pass <b>defelctions,</b> two forced fumbles, two interceptions, and a touchdown in 16 games and 16 starts.
