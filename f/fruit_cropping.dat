40|$|Introduction. Fruits {{are under}} growing {{scrutiny}} regarding their environmental impacts. However, <b>fruit</b> <b>cropping</b> systems have seldom been studied using {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA). As part of the Agribalyse® project, the cropping systems for apple and peach in France, clementine in Morocco, and mango in Brazil were evaluated with a cradle-to-farm-gate LCA in order to include the manufacturing, transportation and utilization of all inputs used on the farm. Materials and methods. Representative systems for each fruit were designed, relying mostly on expert knowledge for apple, peach and clementine, and on a detailed survey of eight commercial orchards for mango from the Rio San Francisco Valley in Brazil. Potential environmental impacts were calculated using the ReCiPe Midpoint (H) method. Results and discussion. For most impact categories, apple showed the least impacts, followed by mango, peach and clementine. For marine eutrophication, mango and small citrus had the least impact, followed by apple and peach far above. For ecotoxicity, mango had the least impact followed by apple, peach and clementine far above. For each <b>fruit</b> <b>cropping</b> system, margins of improvement were identified and associated with agronomic recommendations. Generally speaking, the key aspects driving the eco-efficiency of <b>fruit</b> <b>cropping</b> systems at the farm gate were the yield, the fertilizer rates, the use of toxic substances for pest management, the water requirement associated with its local availability and the energy source for irrigation. The ecotoxicity results revealed were uncertain due {{to the difficulty of}} determining representative crop protection practices for perennial crops. Conclusion. The Agribalyse® program represented an important step forward for the environmental assessment of fruits. Complementary research is needed to design better crop protection practices, field emissions and water-use impacts. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Tomato {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{agricultural}} commodity that has a good prospect in marketing. It showed by a high demand for this commodity but not balanced with the supply because the productivity is still low especially at the lowland. To overcome this problem, plant breeder must strive to assemble new varieties suitable for cultivation in the lowland. This study aims to examine the growth and yield some tomatoes genotype grown in the lowlands. This study lasted from October 2012 to March 2013 at the experimental farm, Agriculture Faculty, University of Riau. This study arranged experimentally using Randomized Block Design (RBD) consist by 6 treatments and 3 replications. Genotype that used are 2201 - 5 IPB- 8 b, IPB- 6 - 8 T 43, T 53 -IPB and IPB 3 - 3 T 65 - 6. Comparation varieties used are Intan and Karina. The parameters measured were plant height, stem diameter, flowering date, harvesting date, fruit length, fruit diameter, number of fruit cavities, fruit flesh thickness and seed number. The results showed that the strains significantly affect the parameters of the study (flowering date, maturity, plant height, stem diameter, fruit flesh thickness, fruit length, fruit diameter, number of fruit cavities, total fruit weight per plant and number of seeds per gram). IPBT 43 - 6 - 8 strain has a total weight of <b>fruit</b> <b>cropping</b> highest (777. 1 g), but not significantly different from the weight of the total fruit crop IPBT 53 - 3 (655. 9 g) and IPBT 65 - 6 (605. 5 g). Three strains have a total weight of fruit crop was significantly higher compared with the Intan variety (404. 9 g) and Karina (208. 6 g) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{analyze the}} Ukrainian {{names of the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> which {{varieties}} are undergoing scientific and technical examination. Results. Names of <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> form a separate terminological system based on one-word fruit plant names. Names of new introduced <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> usually are borrowed from the language of that country where the crop has extended and whence it has spread, or {{on the basis of}} a Latin generic name. Conclusions. The registered varieties of fruit plants in Ukraine belong to 48 crops. Formation of names of <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> has begun in ancient times and is continuing until now. Crop names, as a rule, consist of one word; two-word names occur as an exception, if so, an adjective should be places ahead of a noun. Names of <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> and the name of botanic taxa are specific, belong to different terminological systems and perform different functions...|$|R

At a Brazilian savanna, I evaluated the proportional crop loss of Eriotheca gracilipes due the Blue-Fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) during a fruiting period. Also, I analyzed the relationship between proportional crop loss to Amazons and both <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> size and {{the distance from the}} nearest damaged conspecific. Trees produced from 1 to 109 fruits, so that Amazons foraged more often on trees bearing larger <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> size, while seldom visited less productive trees. Moreover, the relationship between <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> sizes and the number of depredated fruits was significant. However, when only damaged trees were assessed, I found a negative and significant relation between <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> size and proportional crop loss to Blue-Fronted Amazons. Taking into account this as a measure more directly related to the probability of seed survival, a negative density dependent effect emerged. Also, Amazons similarly damaged the <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> of either close or distant neighboring damaged trees. Hence, in spite of Blue-Fronted Amazons searched for E. gracilipes bearing large <b>fruit</b> <b>crops,</b> they were swamped due to the presence of more fruits than they could eat. Moderate seed predation by Blue-Fronted Amazons either at trees with large <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> or in areas where fruiting trees were aggregated implies in an enhanced probability of E. gracilipes seed survival and consequent regeneration success...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{reproductive}} success of animal-dispersed plants is {{closely linked to}} the number of seeds that they are able to disperse. The <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> size hypothesis states that a plant with large <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> size will attract more dispersers than a plant with a smaller <b>fruit</b> <b>crop,</b> which may result in more seeds being dispersed from the foremost. In this study, we experimentally examined the effect of crop size and other factors on primary seed dispersal in a neotropical shrub/tree, Casearia corymbosa (Flacourtiaceae). We used two pre-dictive variables of {{reproductive success}}, which produce an accurate picture of seed dispersal ra-tio: fruit removal efficiency (proportion of a <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> removed by frugivores) and fruit removal success (relative contribution of each individual tree to the number of fruits removed in the pop-ulation). We established two levels of <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> size at the C. corymbosa individuals, using plants with large (150 <b>fruits)</b> and small <b>crops</b> (50 <b>fruits).</b> We found that individual plants with larger crops had significantly higher values of fruit removal efficiency (92. 6 %) and success (5 %) than plants with smaller crops (69. 3 % and 1. 3 %, respec-tively). Fruit removal efficiency was related to vegetation type, plant height and fruit width, but the variance explained by these variables was low ( 90 % of the variance ex-plained). These results suggest that fruit removal efficiency and success are strongly related to <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> size of C. corymbosa plants...|$|R

The main pollinators of passion fruit are large solitary bees of the genus Xylocopa, commonly known as carpenter bees, which are potential candidates for management. Passion <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> exhibit a low density of pollinators and, consequently, a reduction in production. To improve management techniques of X. frontalis and X. grisescens, the general {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of pollinator enhancement on pollination services in passion <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> areas. Our results demonstrated that pollinator enhancement was an efficient way to minimize pollination deficit in passion <b>fruit</b> <b>crops,</b> as it promoted the production of a bigger and sweeter fruits.
