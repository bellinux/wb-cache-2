5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E
25|$|Appreciate getting here {{almost on}} time. Our excuse in Oneida was, well, we're on Injun time. They don't tell {{time by the}} clock. Our excuse here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a doctor and that we're never on time.|$|E
6000|$|The {{boy looked}} at the excited little animal thoughtfully. [...] "There were two reasons," [...] he explained. [...] "One reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like peaches, and the other reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't know it was enchanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was asking}} how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> came to <b>be</b> among his party; and when I {{explained}} how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> left my place, he seemed perfectly satisfied; so I don't expect I shall hear anything more about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly they cannot. But it <b>was</b> not <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> meant. It may not <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{and mine}} should {{transfer}} ourselves to your roof and sojourn there." ...|$|R
25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was told that the}} cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened as far as the viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E
25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear host," [...] he said, [...] "I left Berlin a {{year ago}} with only one hope--or rather two. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might never have to visit Berlin again! The second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might have the {{pleasure}} of meeting you as speedily and as often as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'What do you think, Rajah?' Captain Davis, who {{was riding}} by his side, asked. 'My orders <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to take {{possession}} of the place, but it <b>was</b> supposed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should find it empty.' ...|$|R
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{believes}} in God, writing for Lenny Letter that {{she believes that}} [...] "God is nature and space and energy and the universe. My own interpretation of spirituality isn't important, because {{we all have our}} own. What matters <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have something greater than me as an individual that helps bring me peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{very like}} what you were at her age," [...] he remarked. [...] "What a pity it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> such a poverty-stricken beggar in those days. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have married you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dreaming, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall awaken in {{a moment}} to see that awful knife {{descending}} toward my heart--kiss me, dear, just once before I lose my dream forever." ...|$|R
60|$|AMERICAN. [Eagerly, {{from his}} perch] What <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> don't {{want to miss}} any.|$|R
500|$|Kubrick stated {{himself that}} [...] "there is no {{deliberate}} pattern {{to the stories}} that I have chosen to make into films. About the only factor at work each time <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> try not to repeat myself". As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon {{the release of a}} film—for Paths of Glory.|$|E
500|$|On September 30, Castañeda reiterated {{his request}} for the cannon and was again rebuffed. Texians insisted on {{discussing}} the matter directly with Ugartechea. According to their spokesman, until this was possible [...] "the only answer I can therefore give you <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot now [...] will not deliver to you the cannon". Castañeda reported to Ugartechea that the Texians were stalling, likely to give reinforcements time to gather.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} in which the prince was placed by his marriage, while one of distinction, also offered considerable difficulties; in Albert's own words, [...] "I am very happy and contented; but the difficulty in filling my place with the proper dignity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am only the husband, not the master in the house." [...] The Queen's household was run by her former governess, Baroness Lehzen. Albert referred to her as the [...] "House Dragon", and manoeuvred to dislodge the Baroness from her position.|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not. She {{took up the}} Chronicle.|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. No; I {{think it}} must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to listen sometimes.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> meant <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{no great}} {{opportunity}} for judging, seeing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only with Lord Lufton for about ten minutes." ...|$|R
500|$|Just a {{day after}} {{returning}} for pre-season training with Leeds, on 28 June 2013, Morison joined former club Millwall, also of the Championship, on a season-long loan deal. On rejoining Millwall, Morison stated – [...] "I'm pleased to be back here. If anybody has any doubts about me all I'd say <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> aim to score plenty of goals for Millwall and help this club to greater success". Morison finished the season with eight goals in 41 appearances, helping the London club stave off relegation from the Championship with a 19th-place finish.|$|E
500|$|New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman {{stated that}} the {{settlement}} and payment by Trump [...] "is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university." [...] Trump himself said he settled [...] "for {{a small fraction of}} the potential award" [...] because he was too busy as president-elect to take it to trial. He added, [...] "The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!" ...|$|E
500|$|Shaughnessy said, [...] "The funny {{part of it}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> gave Maryland {{the roughest}} deal I have ever given anyone in my life, and when Dr. [...] offered {{me a chance to}} come back, I accepted." [...] Because of his {{repeated}} job changes, the Associated Press dubbed Shaugnessy [...] "football's man in motion". At Maryland, he replaced Bear Bryant who had departed for Kentucky. Shaughnessy reintroduced his preferred red and white uniforms, which again replaced the black and gold scheme and remained the dominant colors until 1987.|$|E
6000|$|... --The time <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hated thee, [...] And yet it <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> bear thee love. [...] Thy company, which erst was irksome to me, [...] I will endure-- [...] But do {{not look}} for further recompense. [...] As You Like It.|$|R
60|$|Again his {{excellency}} nodded. Could it indeed <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> enmeshed? My calm deserted me.|$|R
60|$|Then it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} why {{the old man}} was so solicitous regarding John's injury.|$|R
500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I want to say <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E
500|$|Like many his {{age in the}} Shamokin area, Coveleski {{began work}} as a [...] "breaker boy" [...] at a local {{colliery}} {{at the age of}} 12. In return for 72 hours of labor per week, Coveleski received $3.75, or about five cents an hour. [...] "There was nothing strange in those days about a twelve-year-old Polish kid working in the mines for 72 hours a week at a nickel an hour", he later recalled. [...] "What was strange <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever got out of there". Coveleski was rarely able to play baseball as a child due to his work schedule.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{then made}} a return to smaller-scale projects: [...] "My {{experience}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sort of {{stepped away from the}} independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand." [...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something that I would like to do solely." [...] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles— it was [...] "assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers"—but that her action career [...] "kind of took off a little too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, dear, {{and between}} us surely nothing need be said. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as thankful <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> {{the means of}} saving you, as you can <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost {{miraculously}} enabled to follow your track so successfully." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{my words}} <b>were,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would rather <b>that</b> my soul <b>be</b> {{returned}} unto God than <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should {{fall into the}} hands of the English." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> think, which {{disturbed}} {{his brain}} and unfitted him {{for membership in}} the club.|$|R
