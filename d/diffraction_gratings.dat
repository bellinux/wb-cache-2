5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings,</b> selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|Crystal fibres, formed of {{hexagonal}} {{arrays of}} hollow nanofibres, create the bright iridescent colours of the bristles of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin {{walls of the}} hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings,</b> making Aphrodita {{one of the most}} iridescent of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E
40|$|To sense {{characteristics}} of a sample, an ellipsometer includes a pivotal <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> positioned to receive white light from the analyzer without further focusing of the light after the light leaves the sample. The <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> {{is focused on the}} sensor at a predetermined angle with a precision of at least plus or minus one-half degree using an alignment-sensing means positioned between the analyzer and <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating.</b> The sensor includes an aperture through which the incident beam of light is transmitted, light-sensitive areas on opposite sides of said sensor and a comparator for comparing the signal from said light-sensitive areas. Equality of the light from the light-sensitive areas indicates that the incident beam of light is perpendicular to the <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating.</b> A second <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> and a second sensing means may receive the specularly reflected white light from a first <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> and reflect it to another <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> to investigate another spectrum of light. A spectroscopic ellipsometer uses a stacked photodiode in which the first photodiode and second photodiode have overlapping spectral ranges...|$|R

5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings,</b> selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|E

In the Littman configuration as shown in Fig.  1, first-order light is diffracted into the scanning galvanometer then reflected back into the FP–QCL chip by the <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> and the emitted single-mode laser light is extracted through zeroth-order reflection from the <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating.</b>|$|R
40|$|An imaging {{spectrometer}} has fore-optics coupled to a spectral resolving system with an entrance slit {{extending in a}} first direction at an imaging location of the fore-optics for receiving the image, a convex <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> for separating the image into a plurality of spectra of predetermined wavelength ranges; a spectrometer array for detecting the spectra; {{and at least one}} concave sperical mirror concentric with the <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> for relaying the image from the entrance slit to the <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> and from the <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> to the spectrometer array.

25|$|Ordinary pressed CD and DVD {{media are}} every-day {{examples}} of <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> {{and can be}} used to demonstrate the effect by reflecting sunlight off them onto a white wall. This is a side effect of their manufacture, as one surface of a CD has many small pits in the plastic, arranged in a spiral; that surface has a thin layer of metal applied to make the pits more visible. The structure of a DVD is optically similar, although it may have more than one pitted surface, and all pitted surfaces are inside the disc.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{high-resolution}} gratings were ruled using high-quality ruling engines whose {{construction was}} a large undertaking. Henry Joseph Grayson designed a machine to make <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings,</b> succeeding with one of 120,000 lines to the inch (approx. 4,724 lines per mm) in 1899. Later, photolithographic techniques allowed gratings to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic gratings have sinusoidal grooves {{and may not be}} as efficient as ruled gratings, but are often preferred in monochromators because they lead to much less stray light. A copying technique allows high quality replicas to be made from master gratings of either type, thereby lowering fabrication costs.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of papers from 1881 to 1886, Langley {{reported}} measurements of the spectrum of heat radiation, using <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> and prisms, and the most sensitive detectors that he could make. He reported {{that there was a}} peak intensity that increased with temperature, that the shape of the spectrum was not symmetrical about the peak, that there was a strong fall-off of intensity when the wavelength was shorter than an approximate cut-off value for each temperature, that the approximate cut-off wavelength decreased with increasing temperature, and that the wavelength of the peak intensity decreased with temperature, so that the intensity increased strongly with temperature for short wavelengths that were longer than the approximate cut-off for the temperature.|$|E
50|$|An ultrafast {{monochromator}} is a monochromator that {{preserves the}} duration of an ultrashort pulse (in the femtosecond, or lower, time-scale). Monochromators are devices that select for a particular wavelength, typically using a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> to disperse the light and a slit to select the desired wavelength; however, a <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> introduces path delays that measurably lengthen {{the duration of}} an ultrashort pulse. An ultrafast monochromator uses a second <b>diffraction</b> <b>grating</b> to compensate time delays introduced to the pulse by the first grating and other dispersive optical elements.|$|R

25|$|Most {{commonly}} {{confused with}} <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings</b> are the iridescent colors of peacock feathers, mother-of-pearl, and butterfly wings. Iridescence in birds, fish and insects is often caused by thin-film interference {{rather than a}} diffraction grating. Diffraction will produce the entire spectrum of colors as the viewing angle changes, whereas thin-film interference usually produces a much narrower range. The surfaces of flowers can also create a diffraction, but the cell structures in plants are usually too irregular to produce the fine slit geometry necessary for a diffraction grating. The iridescence signal of flowers is thus only appreciable very locally and hence not visible to man and flower visiting insects. However, natural gratings do occur in some invertebrate marine animals, like the antennae of seed shrimp, and have even been discovered in Burgess Shale fossils.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{measured}} {{radiated power}} with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He {{was concerned with}} selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Helmholtz reciprocity principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or <b>diffraction</b> <b>gratings.</b> His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium {{in which they had}} been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.|$|E

In older versions of such gratings, environmental susceptibility was a trade-off, as the gel had to be contained at low temperature and humidity.
