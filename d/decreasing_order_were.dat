Group II consisted of 734 randomly selected patients (aged 17 to 68 years) attending an inner-city gynecological outpatient clinic. C. trachomatis was detected in cervical scrapes by PCR specific for endogenous plasmid. These plasmid PCR-positive samples were subsequently subjected to genotyping by C. trachomatis-specific omp 1 PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (J. Lan, J. M. M.

The overall {{prevalence rates}} of C. trachomatis found in patients younger than 30 years were 9. 2 and 11. 8 % in groups I and II, respectively. A clear age dependency was seen in group II, with the highest prevalence rate (20 %) found in patients younger than 20 years, while the rate declined significantly after 30 years of age (5. 9 %).

Heterotrophic bacteria were the first to dominate the spoil, acquiring a population of 10 (7) cells per g within 2 weeks. Bacteria capable of utilizing choline sulfate as the sole source of energy comprised approximately 1 % of the total heterotrophic bacteria. Sulfur-oxidizing autotrophic bacteria (Thiobacillus) and finally iron-oxidizing bacteria (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans) increased in the population, the latter becoming the dominant species where acidity was greatest. Partition of species paralleled partition of acidity in the spoil. Maximum acidity (pH 2. 6) and maximum population of T. ferrooxidans (greater than 10 (7) cells per g) occurred at the summit.

30|$|It was {{important}} to select only factors for the study that had significant effects on forest profitability, defined as having an effect of at least 0.1 %. The contribution index analysis showed that the key factors affecting forestry profitability, in <b>decreasing</b> <b>order,</b> <b>were</b> discount rate, rotation period, site index, harvesting area and stand age. The discount rate and rotation period determined approximately 90 % of the total profitability. However, a stratification analysis suggested that effects of these two variables could noticeably change with changes to various stand and site factors. Discount rate has been previously shown to significantly affect profitability estimates (Davis et al. 2001; Richard and Puneet 2015), so we {{expected it to be}} one of the main factors in our study. Rotation periods determine the harvest intervals for a given stand, so variations in these periods will also affect the profitability of a forest area (Gunalay and Kula 2012). Site index is a measure of the productivity of a stand and thus is likely to reflect harvesting frequency. Increasing the harvesting area can also improve profitability due to the fixed costs of harvesting timber, such as labour and machinery.|$|E
