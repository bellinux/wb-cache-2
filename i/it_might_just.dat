5|$|Mars is {{the only}} planet in the Solar System on which deserts have been identified. Despite its low surface {{atmospheric}} pressure (only 1/100 of that of the Earth), the patterns of atmospheric circulation on Mars have formed a sea of circumpolar sand more than 5 million km² (1.9million sq mi) in area, much larger than deserts on Earth. The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes {{in the form of}} half-moons in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions. Examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the Mars Exploration Rover have shown a surface film that resembles the desert varnish found on Earth although <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be surface dust. The surface of Titan, a moon of Saturn, also has a desert-like surface with dune seas.|$|E
500|$|Oxenfree {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Wireds Chris Kohler wrote that [...] "Oxenfree shows some smart {{thinking about the}} relationship between games and players," [...] and that as Night School's first game, it was an [...] "auspicious debut." [...] Destructoids Nic Rowen praised the game for taking inspiration from old movies but still being [...] "anything but generic"; [...] "It dials into its own style and mood, tapping into something very heartfelt and special. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be the best 'horror' game I've played in years," [...] he wrote. A less enthusiastic review was offered by Allegra Frank for Polygon, who wrote that despite offering many promising attributes, [...] "I finished Oxenfree with my mouth agape, feeling wholly unsatisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|Strip Me {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews", based on 4 reviews. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave Strip Me a C rating and wrote that it [...] "plays like one long, increasingly desperate pep talk. The only breather? 'Unexpected Hero,' a lovely late-Beatles-style ballad." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the album for [...] "retaining [...] same blend of well-manicured R and European sophistication" [...] of Bedingfield's debut album and commented that she [...] "plays it exceptionally safe, {{to the extent}} that she even tones down the self-empowerment of her first two records, preferring pristine blue-eyed soul and adult contemporary ballads, all tailored for an aspirational upscale lifestyle". Slant magazine's Jonathon Keefe found it [...] "single-minded in its uplifting, inspirational tone", writing in conclusion that [...] "Bedingfield uses her powerful voice to oversing most of her material, making Strip Me feel like even more of a sermon. It may not be the year's worst pop album, but <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be the most exhausting and heavy-handed." ...|$|E

500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film a four-out-of-five rating {{and called it}} a madcap comedy which dared to [...] "push the {{envelope}} in its own way": [...] "Dostana is a winner all the way. In terms of content, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> {{prove to be a}} trendsetter." [...] The Times of India also rated it four out of five: [...] "It introduces the most outrageous scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages {{to get away with it}} because it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana [...] "can make you laugh out loud and also strike an emotional chord." [...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music." [...] For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: [...] "Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer".|$|E
500|$|Clare Heal of the Daily Express, in her {{review of}} the third series, praised the show's [...] "spot-on spoofs of modern telly" [...] and agreed that [...] "There's no {{particular}} target audience but pretty much anyone of any age will find something in there for them". Kerrie Mills of PopMatters rated the first three series 9/10, opining that the show [...] "does also provide evidence, edgewise between the falling bodily fluids, of a sharp comic intelligence... in fact, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> {{be one of the}} most successful original comedy shows to appear in years." [...] Stephen Kelly of The Guardian argued that the fourth series had definitively transcended its roots to become not just [...] "the best show on children's television—it's one of the smartest comedies on TV", performed by an [...] "astonishing cast... so superb that even special guest stars such as Chris Addison can look slightly out of their depth." [...] In an article discussing the League of Gentlemen troupe's appearance in the same series, the Radio Times Gareth McLean agreed that [...] "despite nominally being a children's programme, Horrible Histories is one of the best sketch comedies on TV", adding that [...] "ultimately, comedy performers relish [...] madcap, sometimes deliciously silly exuberance, which, thanks to the show's razorsharp writing, educates as well as entertains." [...] Graeme Virtue of The Scotsman called the League's reunion a [...] "coup" [...] for the series: [...] "While Gatiss's American accent was pretty duff, the bickering spark between the three Gentlemen remained." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her report, Abbey {{also argues}} that “men may be socialized to attend more {{carefully}} than women to potentially sexual cues and are, therefore, more likely to interpret a variety of stimuli {{as a sign of}} sexual intent.” Men tend to read into women’s actions more sexually than women would read into men’s actions. For example, men might find tickling to mean that the woman is very interested while to women <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be a way of flirting or joking around. This can lead to some problems and possibly awkward encounters. Abbey also says that men tend to have a more sexual outlook and oftentimes perceive situations more sexually than women might; therefore, men could then feel that sexual advances are appropriate and justified whereas a woman may not be thinking so.|$|E
2500|$|Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources (CBR) {{gave the}} first issue three out of five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Fearless Defenders #1 offers a {{coincidental}} threat to bring Misty Knight and Valkyrie together, but that threat isn't completely realized for readers to grasp the full level." [...] Sara Lima of Comic Vine gave it five out of five stars writing, [...] "Sexy, smart and strong: if this series is anything like this first issue, then <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be my new 'must-read.'" [...] Melissa Grey of IGN gave it a 9.0 out of 10 writing, [...] "The ladies of Fearless Defenders are {{a force to be}} reckoned with in this stellar first issue." [...] George Marston of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 writing, [...] "With a little bit of Lethal Weapon, a little of The Da Vinci Code, and lots of Marvel charm, there are more than enough hooks to make this book worth your continued attention." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani {{expressed}} that Oh Land's [...] "cinematic arrangements bring Janelle Monáe's ambitious approach to pop music to mind, but tracks like 'Wolf & I' and 'Lean' draw {{a bit too}} heavily from the trip-hop playbook [...] and, however well-excecuted they may be, end up sounding derivative." [...] Similarly, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music felt that [...] "there's {{a bit of an}} identity void {{at the heart of the}} thing, a lack of personality. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> be that Oh Land is more skilled at getting songs to sound current than she is at expressing herself." [...] Drowned in Sounds John Calvert called the album [...] "hip, diverse and always vibrant", but also branded it [...] "pretty forgettable". Calvert pointed out the production work of Dave McCracken and Dan Carey, noting the album [...] "inhabits a tepid middle ground between the two extremes—offering neither gilded Scandi chart-pop (Robyn, Annie) or the artistic mettle of Scandi indie bands, most of whom are able to turn out sublime pop anyway." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Duke of Argyll {{says that}} [...] "heredity {{is the central}} idea of natural selection." [...] Now it would, I think, be {{concluded}} that those who possess the central idea of a thing have some consciousness of the thing. Yet men have possessed the idea of heredity {{for any number of}} generations and have been quite unconscious of natural selection. Clearly the statement is misleading. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as truly be said that the occurrence of structural variations in organisms is the central idea of natural selection. And <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>just</b> as truly be said that the action of external agencies in killing some individuals and fostering others is the central idea of natural selection. No such assertions are correct. The process has three factors--heredity, variation, and external action--any one of which being absent, the process ceases. The conception contains three corresponding ideas, and if any one be struck out, the conception cannot be framed. No {{one of them is the}} central idea, but they are co-essential ideas.|$|E
