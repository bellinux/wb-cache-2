5|$|Just {{one week}} after the MEF had taken over Anbar, insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy {{carrying}} four American mercenaries from Blackwater USA on 31 March, killing all of them. An angry mob then set the mercenaries' bodies ablaze and dragged their corpses through the streets before hanging them over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. The American media compared the attack on the mercenaries to the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, where images of American soldiers being <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of Somalia prompted the United States to withdraw its troops.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5|$|Many {{military}} events {{occurred during}} Clinton's presidency. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters {{were shot down}} by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|Arya, who {{has been}} living as a beggar {{in the streets of}} King's Landing since her escape from the Lannisters, learns a crowd is {{gathering}} at the Great Sept of Baelor, where her father will be judged before the gods, and in order to see over the crowd, climbs onto the statue of Baelor the Blessed. As he is <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution. When he sees that Arya has been rescued, Ned accepts his fate and is beheaded by Ser Ilyn Payne.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E

5|$|While {{under house}} arrest, Bhimsen smuggled {{a letter to}} the Resident Hodgson {{appealing}} him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment, but sought permission from his superiors to do so. Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped off her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a khukuri on 28 July 1839. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1939, at the age of 64. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals. On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshowr was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.|$|E
25|$|Marine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was {{reported}} missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of Nasiriyah on 28 March.

The corpse was discovered by U.S. forces on 10 April.|$|E
25|$|Catherine de Forcade from Orthez, who, {{forced to}} convert to Catholicism, refused to receive the Sacraments of the Catholic Church and to perform Catholic rituals before dying in March 1688, was {{condemned}} to have her properties confiscated, her cadaver <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of Orthez on a rack and then left on the road instead of being buried.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the motion}} in the Derschmidt rotor follows the natural change in <b>drag</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rotation, the force applied to the blades to move them into {{position}} is quite small. Of the several designs he presented in his early patents, most used a very small linkage from a bell crank {{on the inner side}} of the blade attached to a small pushrod for operation. These rods were attached to a disk set eccentrically to the centre of rotation, which drove the blades into their proper locations.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{monolithic}} bullets {{have also}} gained {{popularity in the}} world of professional competitive shooting. Due to the precision manufactured process by which the bullets are produced, the high accuracies achieved make for ideal target shooting bullets. When purchasing high quality, well designed monolithic bullets with low trajectories and limited <b>drag</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air, these bullets provide a massive advantage to the competitive shooter, especially over medium to longer ranges.|$|R
25|$|On 14 July 1958, {{members of}} the Iraqi Army, under Abd al-Karim Qasim, staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq. King Faisal II, former Prime Minister Nuri as-Said, former Regent Prince 'Abd al-Ilah, {{members of the}} royal family, and others were brutally killed during the coup. Many of the victim's bodies were then <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Many had {{anticipated}} {{the events and}} escaped by sea. The ensuing massacre was indiscriminate: neither women nor children were spared, and Latin patients lying in hospital beds were murdered. Houses, churches, and charities were looted. Latin clergymen received special attention, and Cardinal John, the papal legate, was beheaded and his head was <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets at {{the tail of a}} dog.|$|E
25|$|One year later, {{under the}} National Legionary State (the Iron Guard's government), Marinescu and Argeşanu, {{alongside}} other politicians, were executed in Jilava (September 1940); {{it was also}} {{at that time that}} the Călinescu family crypt in Curtea de Argeş was dynamited, while a bronze bust of him which awaited unveiling was chained and <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of Piteşti. Călinescu's wife Adela was required to hand all of her husband's personal documents, and, in a letter to Conducător Ion Antonescu, claimed to have been repeatedly harassed by agents of Siguranţa Statului.|$|E
50|$|A {{sea anchor}} (also {{known as a}} drift anchor, drift sock, para-anchor or boat brake) is a device used to {{stabilize}} a boat in heavy weather. Rather than tethering the boat to the seabed, the sea anchor increases <b>the</b> <b>drag</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> water and thus acts as a brake. When attached to the stern of a vessel, a sea anchor can prevent the vessel from turning broadside to the waves and being overwhelmed by them.|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} high-quality magnetic field measurements of 19 sharp-lined B-type stars with precisely-measured N/C abundance ratios.

50|$|In {{the weeks}} before the first assault, the 8 G5s were flown in {{darkness}} from Rundu to Mavinga (15°47'36 S 20°21'49 E) over 2 nights by South African Air Force Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, whilst {{the remainder of the}} battery including the gun-tractors drove the distance. The heavy guns were difficult to <b>drag</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sandy terrain and this avoided {{a significant part of the}} journey from the border to the target area.|$|R
25|$|However, {{many of the}} after-death {{actions are}} even more macabre than the deaths themselves. Suffolk's head is {{delivered}} to Margaret, who carries it around court {{for the last two}} acts of the play. Lord Stafford and his brother are killed and their bodies <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets behind horses. Lord Saye and his son-in-law are beheaded and their heads carried throughout the streets on poles and made to kiss. Cade is beheaded and his head delivered to the king. Not only is physical violence presented as a major theme, but so too is physical desecration, a disregard for the body after death.|$|E
25|$|The Battle for Lake Tanganyika was {{a series}} of naval engagements that took place between {{elements}} of the Royal Navy, Force Publique and the Kaiserliche Marine between December 1915 and February 1916, during the First World War. The intention was to secure control of the strategically important Lake Tanganyika, which had been dominated by German naval units {{since the beginning of the}} war. The British forces—consisting of two motor boats named HMS Mimi and Toutou—were under the command of the eccentric Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson. The boats were transported to South Africa and from there by railway, by river, and by being <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> African jungle, to the lake.|$|E

A man climbed along side him sliced off his penis and testicles, flinging them into the fire below…he then plunged a knife into Despenser's abdomen and cut out his entrails and heart…the corpse was lowered to the ground and the head cut off. It was later sent to London, and Despenser's arms, torso and legs were sent to be displayed above the gates of Newcastle, York, Dover and Bristol.|$|E
50|$|The {{skull of}} Mosasaurus tapered {{off into a}} short, conical tip. The jaws were armed with massive conical teeth. Their paddle-like limbs had five digits in front and four in back. The body ended in a strong tail, which other mosasaurid fossils suggest had a fluke {{similar to those of}} sharks and some ichthyosaurs. The body {{probably}} remained stiff to reduce <b>drag</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> water, while the end of the tail provided strong propulsion.|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology (1980), former member Larry Wollersheim sued the {{organization}} for mental distress, and was awarded $30million in damages. On appeal, the award was reduced to $2.5million. In 1996, Wollersheim was awarded an additional $130,506.71 in attorney's fees incurred while defending against a church lawsuit that was dismissed for violating a California law prohibiting strategic lawsuits against public participation. The Church vowed not to pay the award, and the case <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> courts for 22 years, including two separate appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States and two additional appeals to the Supreme Court of California. In early 2002, the case was finally settled, with the Church of Scientology paying Larry Wollersheim $8,674,643.|$|E
25|$|The {{mole plough}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers that impede drainage. It is a very deep plough, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ground, it leaves a channel deep under the ground, and this acts as a drain. Modern mole ploughs may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. Similar machines, so called pipe-and-cable-laying ploughs, are even used under the sea, for the laying of cables, as well as preparing the earth for side-scan sonar in a process used in oil exploration.|$|E
25|$|US troops {{participated in}} a UN {{peacekeeping}} mission in Somalia beginning in 1992. By 1993 the US troops were augmented with Rangers and special forces {{with the aim of}} capturing warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from Pakistan. During a raid in downtown Mogadishu, US troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the Battle of Mogadishu. Eighteen American soldiers were killed, and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being <b>dragged</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets by an angry mob. Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000 total casualties during the conflict. After much public disapproval, American forces were quickly withdrawn by President Bill Clinton. The incident profoundly affected US thinking about peacekeeping and intervention. The book Black Hawk Down was written about the battle, and was the basis for the later movie of the same name.|$|E
