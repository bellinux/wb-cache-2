40|$|WTO-led trade {{liberalisation}} in <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> {{is often seen}} as having considerable potential for generating 'win-win' outcomes for {{the economy and the}} environment. Despite this, progress in liberalising <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> within the GATS framework has been limited. This paper argues that a major barrier to progress in <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> liberalisation is uncertainty about the development impact of <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> liberalisation in developing countries. We develop this argument using the example of water services, where market opening needs to be accompanied by effective domestic regulatory measures. The paper argues that uncertainty on the interpretation of the GATS rules on domestic regulation acts as a further constraint on countries' willingness to make new commitments for {{trade liberalisation}} in <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> The final section of the paper makes a number of proposals for `accompanying policies' that may be needed to be adopted if progress is to be made in meeting the Doha Development Agenda's commitment to the reduction or elimination of barriers to trade in <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> ...|$|R

This study explores the nature and structure of the <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> sector, both globally and in India, with particular focus on recent trends such as privatization and foreign investment in this sector. It also discusses issues of classification and definition which have occupied centre stage in the multilateral negotiations in this sector. The study assesses the implications of liberalizing <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> in India, taking into account the country's strengths, weaknesses, and interests in this sector. Based on this assessment, it suggests a negotiating strategy for India in <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> in the ongoing GATS 2000 negotiations. Given the special features of this sector, the study also suggests domestic reforms and regulations to ensure equity and sustainability along with economic efficiency in the provision of <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> in India. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Rawapening Reservoir {{is part of}} the {{watershed}} Tuntang, which began to show the failure of its function as a support system of water resources in support of life. It is seen causing various water-use conflicts, particularly between upstream and downstream watershed Tuntang, so the incidence of floods and droughts are becoming more frequent and declining agricultural production, fish and hydroelectric increasingly felt. Watershed management requires coordination and in addition quite a long time, the necessary financing is also very large. One alternative financing watershed management is the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Services</b> payment of the service users, one of which is Jelok and Timo hydroelectric. The second hydropower received <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> such as water availibility to rotate turbine. When environmental conditions are degraded, services rendered either degraded, uneven distribution of water availability and floods and droughts are becoming more frequent. Above conditions and make Jelok and Timo Hydroelectric losses (production target is not reached), the loss of electivity production due to the loss of <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> tahat can be enjoyed. To cover the shortage of electricity production, PLN would be cost to turn the other energy sources, the cost is equivalent to the loss <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> Hence, in the <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> can still be enjoyed at its optimum, the costs incurred by PLN, to supply production targets can be referred to as the cost of <b>environmental</b> <b>services,</b> this concept is known as the concept of replacement cost.
