50|$|Some light general {{aviation}} aircraft (including Piper Cherokees, Beech Musketeers, and some early model Cessnas - {{such as the}} Cessna 140) use Johnson bars to actuate <b>flaps</b> and <b>wheel</b> brakes. The Cessna 162 Skycatcher uses a Johnson bar for flap operation. A small number of older aircraft (including the Mooney M-18 and some older M20s) also have landing gear actuated by Johnson bars.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was powered originally by either a 60 hp (45 kW) Anzani engine or the unsuccessful 65 hp (48 kW) Detroit Air Cat radial. The Model 22 {{was the first}} light aircraft awarded a type certificate (number 22) and in 1930 it was fitted with the Velie M-5 62 hp (46 kW) five-cylinder radial engine to become the Model 70.In 1930 Monocoupe introduced the Model 90 with refined lines and a fuselage that was slightly longer and wider, this being sold in Model 90 and Model 90A versions with a 90 hp (67 kW) Lambert R-266 radial engine. The Monocoupe 90 DeLuxe introduced trailing edge <b>flaps,</b> <b>wheel</b> speed fairings and an improved engine cowling. The Model 90AF was fitted with a 115 hp (86 kW) Franklin engine. The Model 90AL had Avco Lycoming engines. The Model 90J was introduced in 1930 with a 90 hp (67 kW) Warner Scarab Jr engine.|$|R

50|$|The Lim-5M was {{regarded}} {{only as an}} interim variant, and work on a more advanced plane continued, testing many different ideas. In 1961, 40 Lim-6 attack aircraft were built. They introduced new blown flaps, but tests showed problems with the modified Lis-6 jet engine and the aircraft were not given to the Air Force. As a result, {{it was decided to}} redesign the thick wing sections with fuel tanks, blown <b>flaps,</b> double <b>wheels</b> and RATO and return to only slightly modified Lim-5 construction, with increased weapon-carrying capability instead.|$|R
50|$|Late in 1935 V.K. Tairov helped {{form the}} OKO (experimental design section) in Kiev. In 1937 the OKO-1 was {{completed}} as a six-seat passenger transport, with all wood construction, this single engined monoplane demonstrated good performance with state-of-the-art systems. Electrically driven <b>flaps,</b> pneumatic <b>wheel</b> brakes, trimmers {{on all the}} tail surfaces, heated cabin, lighting and instruments for night or blind flying, full sound-proofing and full GVF(civil air fleet) equipment were all incorporated. The performance of the aircraft in flight tests was regarded as excellent but, for unknown reasons, production was not undertaken.|$|R

5000|$|Models include precise {{replication}} of proportions and detail of actual vehicles, including accurate moldings, logos, and name scripts. Tires are not rubber, but {{are made of}} {{the same type of}} plastic as body and chassis, though black. Models often have movable mud <b>flaps</b> behind rear <b>wheels</b> (which often are lost with play). Rather odd, and rarely seen on other miniatures of any type, are headlights often molded in white plastic as opposed to clear lenses. This may be the single most recognizable trait of the brand.|$|R
50|$|The Yak-52, {{like most}} Soviet {{military}} aircraft, {{was designed to}} operate in rugged environments with minimal maintenance. One of its key features, unusual in western aircraft, is its extensive pneumatic system. Engine starting, landing gear, <b>flaps,</b> and <b>wheel</b> brakes are all pneumatically actuated. Spherical storage bottles for air, replenished by an engine driven compressor, are situated behind the rear cockpit and contents displayed on the instrument panels. The operating pressure is between 10 and 50 bars (145 and 725 psi) and an emergency circuit is reserved for lowering the undercarriage if the normal supply is exhausted or the compressor fails. Additionally both main and reserve bottles can be charged from a port {{on the ground with}} compressed air, usually from a Scuba type air bottle. The ground steering/braking arrangement, especially, takes some adjustment for flyers accustomed to hydraulics, because the aircraft uses differential braking controlled by rudder pedals and a hand operated lever on the control stick.|$|R

5000|$|The Burnelli GX-3, {{also known}} as Uppercu-Burnelli UB-SS. was an American twin-engined, mid-wing {{experimental}} aircraft which first flew in 1929. Work commenced on this aircraft during development of the Burnelli CB-16. Soon after, Daniel Guggenheim announced the Guggenheim Safe Aircraft Competition. Many manufacturers brought aircraft to this competition. The GX-3 was built in New Jersey, but did not arrive at the competition in time to participate. However, it {{was reported to have}} good short take-off and landing capabilities and was able to operate at 200 km/h. The GX-3 had wings which were able to change their shape using <b>flaps.</b> The front <b>wheels</b> were smaller than the rear ones, and the aircraft was powered by two [...] engines. The pilots sat in an open cockpit. The aircraft also incorporated Burnelli's lifting-body feature.|$|R
50|$|The low-set, {{straight}} wing has a double-taper planform, 2½-deg dihedral {{from the}} roots, {{a relatively low}} aspect ratio, and 100 L fuel tanks permanently attached to the wingtips. The trailing edge has double-slotted trailing edge flaps inboard of mass-balanced ailerons; the flaps are separated from the ailerons by small wing fences. An automatic trimming system was present, the flaps and the trim system being connected in order to counteract the potentially large pitch changes {{that would otherwise be}} generated by vigorous movements of the flaps. The tall, swept vertical tail has an inset rudder. Variable-incidence horizontal stabilizers with inset elevators are mounted {{at the base of the}} rudder and over the exhaust nozzle. Side-by-side airbrakes are located under the fuselage ahead of the wing's leading edge. The <b>flaps,</b> landing gear, <b>wheel</b> brakes and air brakes are powered by a hydraulic system. Controls are pushrod-actuated and have electrically powered servo tabs on the ailerons and rudder. Operational g-force limits at 4,200 kg are +8/-4 g.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{he set out}} on the journey. Although the heat of summer was yet intense the days had {{considerably}} shortened, and before he had advanced a mile on his way all the heath purples, browns, and greens had merged in a uniform dress without airiness or graduation, and broken only by touches of white where the little heaps of clean quartz sand showed the entrance to a rabbit-burrow, or where the white flints of a footpath lay like a thread over the slopes. In almost every one of the isolated and stunted thorns which grew here and there a night-hawk revealed his presence by whirring like the clack of a mill {{as long as he could}} hold his breath, then stopping, <b>flapping</b> his wings, <b>wheeling</b> round the bush, alighting, and after a silent interval of listening beginning to whirr again. At each brushing of Clym's feet white miller-moths flew into the air just high enough to catch upon their dusty wings the mellowed light from the west, which now shone across the depressions and levels of the ground without falling thereon to light them up.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{developments}} in commercial aviation resulting from More Electric Aircraft initiatives. The present level of electromechanical actuation is considered with {{discussion of the}} factors affecting more widespread use. Two rather different electromechanical actuators are presented for commercial aircraft; DEAWS electrical flap actuation and ELGEAR nose wheel steering. Both projects are industrially driven with specifications based on existing medium-sized commercial aircraft. Methods comparing fault tolerant electric drive topologies for electrical actuators are presented, showing two different categories of electric drive and comparing each category {{in a variety of}} operating conditions to assess size and component count. The safety-driven design process for electromechanical actuators is discussed with reliability calculations presented for both proposed actuators, showing where fault tolerant design is required to meet safety requirements. The selection of an optimum fault tolerant electric drive for each actuator is discussed and fault tolerant control schemes are presented. The development of the electric <b>flap</b> and nose <b>wheel</b> steering systems is described, with the focus on the work performed by the author, primarily on the power electronic converters and control software. A comprehensive range of laboratory and industrial results are given for both actuators, showing demonstrations of fault tolerance at power converter and actuator levels. Following testing, further analysis is given on various issues arising prior and during testing of both converters, with design considerations for future electromechanical actuators. From design testing and analysis, the two projects can be compared to attempt to determine the optimal electromechanical actuator topology and to consider the challenges in evolving the two actuators to aerospace products.

40|$|A multi-element {{front wing}} of a formula student car was {{analyzed}} using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software STAR-CCM+. A {{number of cases}} were simulated in steady state to get {{an understanding of the}} interaction between the wing, the front wheels, the car body (monocoque) and the ground. Three different flap settings were simulated in three different heights in combinations with and without the following elements: Front wheels, monocoque, ground, front wing. The SST k-omega turbulence model was used with a polyhedral mesh. Chord Reynolds numbers were between 545 000 [...] 600 000. It was found that both the front wing operating isolated from other components and the wing operating in interaction with the front wheels and the monocoque responded with increased downforce in ground effect. Optimal ground height was dependent on flap setting: The mild configuration did not stall at any of the simulated heights, while the flaps on the aggressive configuration stalled close to the ground in the isolated case. Ground effect improved the downforce produced by the wing in free stream by up to 50. 7 %. Comparisons of the wing in mild and high downforce settings were done with and without the wheels. The wing-wheel interaction reduced the downforce produced in the mild flap angle setting by 20. 5 % by obstructing the flow, but increased the downforce of the high flap angle setting by 2. 2 % by introducing surface normal adverse pressure gradients, preventing boundary layer separation. The wing-monocoque interaction increased downforce in all simulated cases. The monocoque caused increased velocity and suction {{on the bottom of the}} symmetric center section, thus reducing the 3 D effects across the span toward the high-downforce section. This contributed to enhanced sectional lift coefficient along the complete span, increasing downforce produced by the wing with low <b>flap</b> angles and <b>wheels</b> behind by 14. 3 % and correspondingly for the high flap angle an increase of 10. 8 %. </p...|$|R
