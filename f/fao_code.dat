The book is more a basic information tool for on-site elaboration rather than a handbook with all the answers. After a brief introduction to farmers, agriculture and pesticides In the Third World, the first part emphasizes the social background of crop protection in the Third World. Part II is dedicated to Integrated Pest Management (IPM) which provides alternatives to chemical crop protection alone.

Part III deals with possible training methods for IPM, and gives information on background research in IPM. Because in the Third World, pesticides are often sold without adequate Instructions for use, and because the use of these chemicals which is sometimes prohibited in the North, part IV looks more closely at government measures and pesticide legislation, including <b>FAO's</b> <b>Code</b> of Conduct. The final part, part V, gives two case studies, in pest management, in Peru and Sri Lanka. There are four useful appendices: the 50 most commonly-used pesticides and their dangers; a list of organizations involved in crop protection; a bibliography (with abstracts); and a glossary of terms used in plant protection.

This study develops an integrated model of geoinformatics technology applied to forest harvest planning. The model determines the distribution and extent of allowable forest harvest zone from economic and environmental perspective using cartographical modelling and linear weighted combination approaches in a GIS.   This study uses remote sensing data and geographic information system technology for data extraction, manipulation, analysis and evaluation of impacts of the difference perspective for forest harvest zone.

40|$|The Concept of Responsible Fisheries {{advocated}} by <b>FAO</b> through its <b>Code</b> of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries is considered as an epitome among global efforts for realising the coveted goal of sustainable utilization of our marine resources. The Code is a landmark in marine development thinking as {{it represents the}} consensus achieved by more than 150 nations across {{the world on the}} directions we should follow in order to avoid resource depletion due to irrational utilization behavior pattern shown by various stakeholders. It is essential to inculcate awareness on the need to undertake all fisheries -related activities on a responsible manner. Since the code is voluntary in nature, it is only through concerted and continuous communication or extension interventions that we can bring about desirable cognitive changes among the varied and multiple resource users in the fisheries sector so that they would follow responsible practices as a moral obligation. Though the code was promulgated way back in 1995 it was not available in any of the maritime vernaculars in our country, except Tamil till the year 2000. I am proud to recall that Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) could bring out a Malayalam translation of this important international document in 2002 as an initial and significant output of the NATP funded project titled "Designing and Validation of Communication Strategies for Responsible Fisheries- A Co-learning Approach" under the leadership of Dr. C. Ramchandran, Scientist, Agricultural Extension, Socio Economic Evaluation and Technology Transfer Division (SEETTD), of the Institute. The project could also bring out a number of well -validated communication tools for making the fisher folk aware about the concept of responsible fisheries. This includes animation films, pamphlets, books, CDs, campaign materials etc. It is worth mentioning that the animation film "Little Fish and Tiny Nets" developed under the project was short- listed in the prestigious "Earth Vision" video film festival held in Tokyo in 2003. I am happy that he has compiled his experiences he has gathered while carrying out this project, along with other details, in this publication titled 'On Designing Communication Tools for Responsible Fisheries". As the whole project activities were organized in a Co -Learning mode, the emphasis given on insights and learnings derived out of the very process of designing these communication tools is a welcome departure. I am sure that this publication will be useful for all marine fisheries stakeholders in general and the extension professionals working in this sector in particular.

40|$|Insects, diseases, {{and weeds}} account for 40 % {{of the annual}} crop and harvest losses in the ACP countries. But the use of pesticides, the most {{commonly}} adopted remedy against these scourges, has its dangers both for man and environment The only way to reduce these risks to a minimum is to follow rigorously the instructions for use and use the new, less toxic products and alternative techniques that are becoming available. Crop pests are legion in the tropics, especially in humid zones where they can bring about a substantial destruction of the crops. Lower yields, loss of quality, and devastation of stores can almost halve the harvest each year in developing countries Protection of plants by spraying against pests (in conjunction with improved seed and fertilizer and better husbandry techniques) therefore remains a vital factor in increasing production in West Africa, improved spray treatment has increased the cotton yield by more than 200 kg to 1000 kg/ha in 25 years. The use of pesticides, is considerably lower in developing countries than in industrialized nations, but is rising continuously. Africa still accounts for only 5 % of world pesticide use but has increased consumption rune fold in a decade or so. However, Third World countries have a poor safety record, {{and so it is}} that agrochemicals are frequently condemned and referred to as Third World poisons and the scourge of pesticides. Nevertheless, despite the undeniable toxicity of these products, agriculture cannot manage without them at present. On the other hand, there is {{a long way to go}} before they are utilized most effectively and the risks to both population and ecology are reduced. Educating the conscience of international businesses For governments the first challenge is to control the import of plant sprays which are not manufactured locally. Very few ACP countries (Africa in particular) possess the facilities to test and pass these products as safe for use when correctly handled and applied. This lack of effective control opens the door to many abuses: the import of products which are unsuitable for the purpose, the sale of dangerous products which are banned or strictly controlled in other countries; and the criminal trade in useless substances of doubtful origin. International arganizations are currently seeking to coordinate legislation on sprays throughout Africa and in order to reduce the costs of such measures, regional groups have been suggested where safety measures taken and tests done in one zone would be valid in all countries with a simiar climate At the same time there have been moves to mobilize the conscience of the international pesticide trade. In 1985 the <b>FAO</b> adopted the <b>Code</b> of Conduct for the Distribution and Use of Pesticides. It has been ratified by numerous organizations including GIPAP which unites 1000 companies producing 90 % of pesticides used in the world. This code, which is not compulsory, is the first step towards inducing a greater sense of responsibility on the part of firms and governments in improving the control of sprays between the producer and end-user. An updated and more precise version of the code, which will increase its effectiveness, is currently being: studied. Necessary precautions Certain countries, however, have already gone further. The European Community has recently issued an edict stipulating that importing countries must give their prior consent to any introduction of a banned or controlled chemical product before its export can be authorized. This clause is also being discussed at international level by the Pesticide Action Network (PAN). Indeed, even if the application of these directives is taking longer than their formulation, the first step has been taken. Both industrialists and nations have understood the weight of responsibility they bear. In order to help the importing countries the International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemical Products supplies information on the relevant regulations, and the OMS instructs on the safe usage of pesticides. Rigorous labelling of exports is also one of the good resolutions taken by producers. Risks remain, even if the import of safe and appropriate products can be guaranteed. Lack of care in handling and applying pesticides often causes serious accidents and illegal uses such as fishing and poaching, or even criminal purposes (poisoning suicide, abortion) all too often increase the mortality figures. As with any chemical product, the use of pesticides requires precautions to ensure the protection of those applying them, the safety of the consumers of the treated crops, and the preservation of the environment. Storing sacks of pesticides next to foodstuffs in poorly-ventilated depots, handling torn sacks or leaking drums without gloves, and spraying with faulty equipment are some of the most frequent causes of poisoning. The many risks of contamination demand that the basic rules of safety are followed implicitly. Simple precautions and procedures which are not always put into practice include not checking wind direction and strength and washing hands after application. This sort of negligent affitude is sometimes accompanied by careless application. It is imperative that manufacturer's instructions are followed exactly. A product that kills locust larvae may not necessarily be the right thing to apply to tomato plants and, when a farmer treats his fields with the product he has to hand or that is available at market, he risks poisoninghimself orothers with the crops and vegetables from his farm and garden. Such practices which are too common and difficult to control, can have disastrous consequences on the health of consumers by contaminatingfood products and polluting water supplies. Furthermore, farmers do not always get the desired results from products which have to be applied at a precise dose and at a certain growth stage of crop or pest in order to be effective against target species. Herbicides, whichare now more commonly used, must be applied at a certain stage in the development of the weed for it to be killed. Usually cash crops are treated with appropriate pesticides whereas food crops, the poor relations of agriculture, all too often have to make do with products originally intended for other crops grown for export. Farmers themselves are not always primarily responsible for this hazardous state of affairs; they are poorly educated, they do not always know how to use these toxic substances, and often have expectations of performance and safety based on exaggerated claims made by salesmen and even extension staff. Aware of these difficulties and concerned with profits, development agencies and large-scale agricultural enterprises are trying to train their employees in the correct use of pesticides. Information and training must be a number one priority for agrochemical suppliers right down to the instructor in rural areas. For the iUiterate, FAO and GIFAP have designed pictorial labels which can be understood by anyone. GIFAP has also published several manuals and posters on handling, storage, safety precautions, and what to do if poisoning occurs, and these have been translated into local languages. But nothing can take the place of on-the-spot demonstrations and practical training courses. Those who sell pesticides must ensure from the beginning that their products are properly used. Pesticides are a two-edged sword beneficial or hazardous according to the use made of them. Incorporating other means of control If the inevitable weapon against pests is a chemical one, it is no longer considered as the panacea, and today other techniques have been introduced to reduce the dependence on chemical products. The first pesticides to appear in the 1940 s, the organochlorines. of which DDT is the best known, are now prohibited almost world-wide. Very long-lasting, they can cause lasting damage to the environment and to human beings. The carbarnates and organo-phosphorus compounds were the second generation. They were widely used in agriculture and although these were more easily degradable, they were nonetheless toxic to people and mammals. But it is the third generation insecticides, synthetic pyrethroids. which came on the market in 1975 which are now most widely used. These products are harmless to man and beast and to the environment, and at the same time extremely effective against crop pests, especially the Lepidoptera. Even though less toxic, they need be applied at low dose rates: where 1 kg DDT or 400 g parathion were once necessary, now only 10 g of deltamethrine would be required. Unfortunately, repeated use of these pyrethroids induces resistance to them in insects so the selection of insecticides must be varied to extend their useful life. A fourth range of compounds is about to come onto the market. These are growth regulators which act on an insect's metabolism and disturbs their development. These are very selective, toxic to their target organisms only, and are effective at a very small dosage. Thus a promising new insecticide, which modifies the transformation mechanism in locust larvae, seems likely to replace the controversial organo-chlorine, dieldrin. But the cost of producing these complex molecules is high, and it will still be several years before their use becomes general in developing countries. Other types of products mimic natural substances and may be used in order to avoid causing serious ecological imbalances. For instance it is possible to synthesize the chemical messages which determine insects' sexual instincts (pheromones), which attract pests to certain plants (kairomones), or which repel them (allomones). Some can be used in traps, sometimes combined with chemical sterilizing agents, to kill or interfere with breeding. An example of their use is where the pink bollworm is becoming more resitant to insecticides and so Egypt has used the sex pheromone of this worm' which attracts the male, prevents him finding the female, and thus inhibits reproduction. Microbiological warfare is being developed on many other fronts: bacteria, viruses and fungi, to which insects are naturally victim, are being formulated and sprayed on crops like chemical pesticides. Their use - as yet not fully developed - will allow the reduction of and perhaps even substition for chemical pesticides. Both biotechnology (see SPORE 18) and using other insects which are hostile to pest species are also possibilities which can be considered in addition to the treatments outlined. With this wide range of weaponry available to farmers to fight these age-old foes, the > is no longer the only option. An integrated campaign which combines complementary techniques of chemical and biological control seems to be the solution for the future. Although a pesticide-free future must be the goal, the usefulness of these substances to safeguard the meagre crops in developing countries cannot be denied. However it is possible to kill pests without poisoning mankind or nature if the use of pesticides is reduced to the minimum necessary and where products are chosen more selectively, and their correct use is safeguarded by education and training. Insects, diseases, and weeds account for 40 % of the annual crop and harvest losses in the ACP countries. But the use of pesticides, the most commonly adopted remedy against these scourges, has its dangers both for man and environment The only way to [...] ...|$|R

Quality can be considered a too for responsible fisheries {{and at the same time}} an opportunity for producers ’ organizations to quote better prices...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between annual {{growth in the}} catches of fishing nations {{and the quality of}} the institutions of those nations is analyzed. Catch volumes are used as a proxy for development, since economic performance indicators based on a common set of definitions do not exist. 49 major fishing nations were selected for this study, including 22 OECD countries and several developing countries. Three general good governance indices, for government-efficiency (World Bank), corruption (Transparency International) and competitiveness (World Economic Forum) and one fishery specific <b>FAO</b> <b>Code</b> of Conduct compliance index were used. The correlation between fisheries’ performance and the indices proved to be spurious, but OECD members achieved a statistically significant negative growth in catches between 1987 and 2007. The countries are divided into five groups, including ‘Winners’ and ‘Losers’, with reference to catch growth rates over two decades. Most of the OECD countries fell into the category ‘Losers’, whereas “Winners” includes many developing countries with lower quality institutions. Some countries had experienced an amazing growth in catches, while others had experienced a decline. The future prospects for both categories are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The human-shark {{relationship}} has varied throughout history from one culture to another. While some cultures attached a spiritual significance to sharks, or consumed shark fins {{with the belief}} in their health promoting properties, others, especially in the West, viewed them with fear. The current regimes and regulations for shark fishery management reflect {{the historical development of}} this relationship. Policies at the international level that pertain to shark fishery management, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the <b>FAO</b> <b>Code</b> of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries provide broad guidelines and principles, while regional and national legislation are more specific and enforceable. In spite of a great deal of legislation that has been passed within the past ten to fifteen years, shark populations are projected to continue declining in the face of various threats such as Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing, and a large market demand for their meat, liver oil, cartilage and especially fins, which are expected to be increasingly sought after in Asia as its population becomes more affluent. While various policy recommendations have bee...|$|E
40|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} weed competition are often underestimated in developing countries, perhaps because unlike insects and diseases, they often cause few obvious symptoms of damage prior to harvest. Also the weeds seem to grow elsewhere, and {{have always done}} so, without causing anv harm. Yet in Africa alone weeds are known to cause average crop losses of at least 30 %. These are serious losses by any standards but {{all the more so}} when there are hungry mouths to feed. Such losses have wide ranging effects from limiting income from cash crops (and hence foreign exchange) to contributing directly to the poverty of small-scale farmers. Common Weeds of East Africa is an FAO publication produced {{as a result of the}} meeting of an FAO panel of experts on Improved Weed Management, held in Nairobi in April 1984. The text provides a clear and concise description in both English and Swahili of each of 63 weeds selected because they are common or serious pests in one if not all three countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Each description is accompanied by a colour photograph of the weeds' flowers while line drawings are used to demonstrate other diagnostic features such as leaf shape. A range of common names is given where appropriate and a glossary is provided to explain terms used in the text. Finally a bibliography suggests sources of information on weed biology, distribution and control so that further action may be taken once the weed has been identified. The book fits in a large pocket, making it easy to carry in the field, while its clear pictures, text and diagrams should considerably improve the ease with which troublesome weeds may be identified and subsequently control led.

40|$|Marine {{fisheries}} {{sector in}} India plays {{a significant role}} in Indian economy and provides livelihood security to about 3. 5 million coastal rural folk living in 3200 marine fishing villages. The substantial growth of the sector is due to innovative and efficient fishing practices, government policies, well developed harvest and post-harvest infrastructure and increased demand for marine fish products in the domestic and international markets. The growing demand resulted in fishing effort intensification, extension of fishing grounds, increase in overall length of fishing boats, holding capacity of the trawlers, fishing effort in terms of fishing hours through multi-day fishing by the mechanized sector and enhanced fishing operations by the motorized sector. Multiday fishing that came into vogue in the 90 s. The production, which reached 2. 7 million t in 1997, has remained almost invariant. The asymptotic production level in all the regions of exploitation indicates a little scope for further increase. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure sustainability of resources through appropriate management interventions as envisaged in the <b>FAO</b> <b>Code</b> of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and also in the context of global warming and climate change...|$|E
