500|$|Many of {{the methods}} that Playford used were {{described}} by economic conservatives as 'socialism', drawing opposition from within his own party, especially in the Legislative Council. It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber—Sir Collier Cudmore—once referred to Playford as a 'Bolshevik'. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader Mick O'Halloran would dine with Playford {{on a weekly basis}} to discuss the development of the state, and the pair were on close personal terms. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that [...] "I wouldn't want to be Premier <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be. Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters than I could if I were in his shoes." [...] O'Halloran's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon, but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display. As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor, O'Halloran was often described as the premier's 'junior partner". Playford called Labor [...] "our Opposition", in comparison to opponents in his party, which he decried as being [...] "critical without being helpful". This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until Don Dunstan's prominence in the late 1950s, when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.|$|E
2500|$|Following Button's fourth-place finish, {{which was}} the fifth time in the season that he {{finished}} in the top four, he stated he did not compete to attempt to prove anything but was in the sport [...] "to do my job and my job is to do the best job I can for myself and for the team and that's exactly what I did." [...] However, he was delighted at his battle with the Williams team, saying, [...] "It was a lot of fun. And then the battle with Kimi Raikkonen, going past him was mega – I really enjoyed that. We're not the best of friends but we battle hard but clean." [...] Alonso did not feel frustrated towards teammate Räikkönen over the pair's late-race battle for sixth place: [...] "The most important thing was not the battle with him, it was the battle with the other teams and we got some good points for Ferrari today. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have overtaken Kimi a little quicker I had to save a lot of fuel {{in the last couple of}} laps so a battle with Sebastian was never a possibility." [...] Räikkönen dismissed the battle as [...] "normal racing" [...] and felt the duel had not hindered his team because it made no difference for him or Ferrari, and no matter where he finished, the team would accumulate the same amount of points.|$|E

6000|$|... "We owe {{his life}} to Tim Doyle," [...] Louis said. [...] "I was not next to him; and did not see him fall, or know he was hit till I saw Tim come up, with him on his shoulders--and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have lifted him, and carried him off. Tim saved his life. There {{is no doubt about}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{thought of}} the curate's sovereigns. If he has missed them already, what should I return to? And, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> returned, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> put them back? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where am I to go?" [...] {{he asked}} helplessly, {{and held out}} the {{envelope}} with a gesture; [...] "and what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew-- How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> leave the gardens?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{can you say}} so, Fergus? You {{know how}} little these verses can {{possibly}} interest an English stranger, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> translate them as you pretend.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some {{one must}} go,' said Mrs. Edmonstone, 'and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of letting Laura run the risk, this unhappy affair about Philip puts her {{going out of}} the question.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Al, {{you sort}} of take my breath," [...] replied Dale. [...] "An' I'm sure grateful. But the fact is, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> handle the job, I--I don't believe I'd want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indifference! Is sixty {{thousand}} pounds in one year, {{and more than}} double within three or four, indifference? I have paid too much to be indifferent. But it is hopeless to pay more. I have no hope for you; you are ruined, and I couldn't redeem you <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not set you free and tell you to begin again, even were it wise to do so; and therefore I tell you to go. And now, good night; I have not another word to say to you," [...] and the earl got up as if to leave the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think not}} that there is peril in so doing," [...] {{answered}} Eustace; [...] "and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> there were, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not leave him in sickness, after all his kindness to me and patience with my inexperience." ...|$|R
6000|$|The purser {{smiled a}} little incredulously. [...] "He sent round this <b>evening</b> to know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> lend him some flannel pyjamas," [...] he said,--"says {{all the things that}} have been {{collected}} together for him are too thin. That man makes me tired, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Dorinda, Uncle Eugene hates us all. He {{is terribly}} bitter against us. He would never, never listen to any request for help, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{bring myself to}} make it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{shall never}} come back here," [...] the old woman said, [...] "never, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Paris is hateful to me now, and I have no reason for ever wanting to come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did notice it, and I {{could not}} stand that drive. And, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be got to the train, to go North, I should have to walk a good deal at the stations." ...|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s during the {{production}} of Perceval le Gallois Rohmer began {{to reduce the number}} of crew members on his films. He first dispensed of the Script supervisor, then (controversially) cut out the assistant director, then all other assistants and technical managers until, by the time he shot The Green Ray in 1986, his crew consisted only of a camera operator and a sound engineer. Rohmer stated that [...] "I <b>even</b> wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> work in the usual conditions of filmmaking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why then," [...] said she, [...] "you {{had better}} {{go down to}} the village after dark; and I can go with you, and then I am sure you could never be suspected; and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> you were, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell them it was {{altogether}} a mistake." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was fair. Listen, Oprah Winfrey gave me {{an amazing}} shot at doing this. She really did. She put me back on TV. She {{believed}} in me. <b>I</b> didn't <b>even</b> know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it again, truthfully. And then she said, 'I think you can,' and then I said, 'I think I can too.' And off I came here to Chicago {{with the best of}} intentions, trying — really — what I thought would be trying kind of easy for me, but it wasn't really that easy." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{distance}} to the ground from the window was not less than fifteen feet, rather a long drop <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage to get the slats loose, which I doubted, for I had no tools at hand.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took this}} seriously. [...] "I thought of that, but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get into a}} league team, which is hardly probable, it wouldn't lead anywhere. You see, I'm getting up an ambition. I want to be rich and powerful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! pour cela non,' said Genevieve. 'Oh! no; I am {{grateful}} to Mr. Gilbert Kendal, for, even as a little boy, he was always kind to me, but for the rest--he is so young, madame, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forget--' ...|$|E
50|$|Founded by San Pedro de Alcantara Acim Pedroso (Cáceres (province)) in 1557, {{this was}} {{considered}} the world's smallest religious house. Subsequently extended, it retained the original area {{under the name of}} the convent. In a tiny space, were built several structures a chapel for the offices large enough to fit only the officiant and an acolyte, to which is attached the founder's cell, which describes Santa Teresa de Jesús this way:It seems they were forty years, {{he told me he had}} slept one hour and a half between night and day, and it was the greatest work of penance that had in the early to beat the dream and it was always or kneeling or standing. I was sitting and sleeping head leaning against a maderillo he had driven into the wall. Lying, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not because his cell as we know, was not longer than four feet and a half.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{believed}} <b>even</b> {{then that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> transform my experience into poetry I {{would give it}} the value and dignity it did not begin to possess on its own. I thought too that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write about it <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come to understand it; <b>I</b> believed that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> understand my life—or at least the part my work played in it—I could embrace it {{with some degree of}} joy, an element conspicuously missing from my life." [...] Philip Levine ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did {{me a good}} turn," [...] he said, [...] "and you're a man. You've the pluck--that's what I like. You knew nothing, {{you were}} as green and ignorant {{as a young man}} from behind the counter of a country shop, but, my God! you'd got the right stuff, and I meant getting <b>even</b> with you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> You'll leave here with me to-morrow, and in three weeks we sail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true, Louise. I {{have seen}} it myself. I went with a {{disguise}} to try and rescue our dear lady, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not save the marquis; but I could not get to her--the wretches have murdered them both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Frequently: when he marries far beneath him, {{as in this}} case. But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have had}} it, I should not have liked a showy wedding. I have had no {{experience}} as a bride except in the private form of the ceremony.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gabriel impatiently; [...] "it's still there--but {{to return}} to Mr. Gunn. He has taken a fancy to Kitty, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not lift the mortgage, there's some {{possibility}} that the land would still remain in the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor shall <b>I</b> approve, <b>if</b> she treats me {{like an old}} woman," [...] {{and then}} she stepped on and joined the children. [...] "I wouldn't spoil <b>even</b> their sport <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help it," [...] she said to herself. [...] "But with them I shall only be a {{temporary}} nuisance; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> remain behind I shall become a permanent evil." [...] And thus Bessy and her old lover were left by themselves.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{reported}} to have said that [...] My dad was a hotelier, he wanted me to handle his business but I wanted to be a police officer. During college days, I developed shortsight and my dreams crashed as clear eyesight was a pre-requisite to join the police. People told my mother that her son was good looking and he should try to get into films.. the lecturers in college said the same and that was playing on my mind. My father was against it but my mother supported me. <b>I</b> thought <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> failed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fall back on the family business. In my heart, I knew that I don't fit into business or politics. I responded to an advertisement in the paper for fresh faces for a film and I got through the audition more easily than I had expected.My first break was in Tamil directed by Balachander. The same was remade in Telugu as Idhi Katha Kadu with me, Kamal Haasan and Chiranjeevi and the film was a hit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} not,--without {{bringing}} her too. She has taken {{it into her}} stupid head that you and I are disgracing the family. As for me, she {{seems to think that}} I am actually robbing her own boys of their rights. I would do anything for them, or <b>even</b> for her, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> comfort her; but she is determined to look upon us as enemies. My father says that it will worry him into his grave." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{green and}} precipitous {{elevations}} that stood ranged around {{the head of}} the vale where Marheyo’s habitation was situated, effectually precluded all hope of escape in that quarter, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have stolen away from the thousand eyes of the savages.|$|E
6000|$|Rollinson {{shook his}} head. [...] "You couldn't get a {{longshoreman}} {{to land the}} machine on board, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get the Lurlette over, which I can't, for the crew {{are members of the}} Coast Seamen's Union, and they're on strike along with the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I dare say!' said Clarence, smiling; 'but to {{say nothing}} of poor Selina, my mother would hardly see it in the same light, nor should I deal rightly, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make any alterations; I doubt whether my father would have held himself bound--certainly not while no one can read this document.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} that you would expect me, master," [...] she said, [...] "but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> you had <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have come. Do you think that one could stand still like a statue for hours when great things were being done, when the people were getting their liberty again, and the flag of the despot was being pulled down from the Tuileries. I have blood in my veins, master, not ice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She cannot {{recognise}} {{you just}} now, dear Willie," [...] said Flora, deeply {{touched by the}} sorrow of the lad; [...] "and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> she <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> fear it would do her harm by exciting her too much. Come, my poor fellow," [...] (leading him softly to the door), [...] "I am just going up to visit a kind English family, {{where they will be}} only too glad to put you up until it is safe to let her know that you have returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold looked keenly at the boy. [...] "No, Wulf, {{treated as}} I am {{as a guest}} I cannot fly without {{incurring}} the reproach of the basest ingratitude, nor <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wished it <b>could</b> <b>I</b> escape. Under the excuse of doing me honour, there are Norman soldiers at the gate, and a Norman sentry stands at my door. I must {{go through with it}} now, and if need be promise all that William asks. This time there is nowhere to send you to fetch aid for me. You have heard, I suppose, that William has promised me his daughter in marriage?" ...|$|R
