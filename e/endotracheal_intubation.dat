5|$|<b>Endotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> and {{mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E

25|$|The {{scope of}} {{practice}} of a German paramedic is not specifically {{defined by a}} decent law. Thus the allowed standard procedures largely depend on the local medical director and the employer. However, in life-threatening situations, a Rettungsassistent or Notfallsanitäter always has to perform autonomously first diagnosis/monitoring and all necessary ALS treatments until an emergency physician arrives. This includes airway management (clearing airway and oropharyngeal, subglottic and <b>endotracheal</b> <b>intubation),</b> intravenous cannulation and application of crystalloid solutions, basic medication (adrenaline, glucose, inhaled ß2 agonists/bronchodilators, rectal benzodiazepine, glyceryl trinitrate, analgetics) and resuscitation with an automated external defibrillator.|$|E
25|$|However, EMTs {{were neither}} trained nor {{authorised}} to provide definitive care for cardiac arrest. They {{could not provide}} defibrillation; intravenous medications; or advanced airway control, such as <b>endotracheal</b> <b>intubation.</b> EMTs saved few, if any, victims of sudden cardiac arrest, largely because cardiac arrest occurred mostly in people's homes. The time required for EMTs to arrive and transport the patient to the closest emergency department was too long for resuscitation to be successful. Not even letter-perfect CPR can save a life if it takes too long for defibrillation and other advanced procedures to occur.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of {{phenobarbital}} overdose is supportive, and mainly {{consists of}} the maintenance of airway patency (through <b>endotracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> and mechanical ventilation), correction of bradycardia and hypotension (with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, if necessary) and removal of as much drug {{as possible from the}} body. Depending on how much time has elapsed since ingestion of the drug, this may be accomplished through gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or use of activated charcoal. Hemodialysis is effective in removing phenobarbital from the body, and may reduce its half-life by up to 90%. No specific antidote for barbiturate poisoning is available.|$|E
25|$|Supraglottic airway — a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any {{airway device}} that is seated above {{and outside the}} trachea, as an {{alternative}} to <b>endotracheal</b> <b>intubation.</b> Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia. There are many types of SGAs available including the Esophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC), Laryngeal tube (LT), and the obsolete Esophageal obturator airway (EOA).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND; AIMS: Endoscopist-directed {{propofol}} sedation (EDP) remains controversial. We {{sought to}} update the safety experience of EDP and estimate the cost of using anesthesia specialists for endoscopic sedation. METHODS: We reviewed all published work using EDP. We contacted all endoscopists performing EDP for endoscopy that we were aware of to obtain their safety experience. These complications were available in all patients: <b>endotracheal</b> <b>intubations,</b> permanent neurologic injuries, and death. RESULTS: A total of 646, 080 (223, 656 published and 422, 424 unpublished) EDP cases were identified. <b>Endotracheal</b> <b>intubations,</b> permanent neurologic injuries, and deaths were 11, 0, and 4, respectively. Deaths occurred in 2 patients with pancreatic cancer, a severely handicapped patient with mental retardation, and a patient with severe cardiomyopathy. The overall number of cases requiring mask ventilation was 489 (0. 1 %) of 569, 220 cases with data available. For sites specifying mask ventilation risk by procedure type, 185 (0. 1 %) of 185, 245 patients and 20 (0. 01 %) of 142, 863 patients required mask ventilation during their esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy, respectively (P >. 001). The estimated cost per life-year saved to substitute anesthesia specialists in these cases, assuming they would have prevented all deaths, was $ 5. 3 million. CONCLUSIONS: EDP thus far has a lower mortality rate than that in published data on endoscopist-delivered benzodiazepines and opioids and a comparable rate to that in published data on general anesthesia by anesthesiologists. In the cases described here, use of anesthesia specialists to deliver propofol would have had high costs relative to any potential benefit...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine indications, type of medications used, and immediate complications of pediatric <b>endotracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> in the emergency department. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was done on all pediatric patients (0 - 14 years old) who required <b>endotracheal</b> (ET) <b>intubation</b> for airway management in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Aga Khan University Hospital from January to December 2009. Data were collected on a preformed questionnaire for age, sex, indications, drugs used, and complications of pediatric ET intubations done in the emergency department. Dead-on-arrival patients and those intubated elsewhere were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 83 pediatric intubations were done during the study period. Indications for ET intubations were respiratory failure in 51 (61 %), unresponsiveness in 18 (22 %), cardiac arrest in 8 (10 %), and trauma in 6 cases (7 %). Comorbid conditions were present in 28 (34 %). Of 83 ET intubations, drugs were used in 48 cases (58 %). Both sedation and neuromuscular blockade were used in 42 cases (51 %), 4 cases (5 %) received sedation only, and 2 cases (2 %) received relaxation without sedation, and in 35 cases (42 %), intubation was done without drugs. Drugs used for sedation/induction were ketamine in 22 (26 %), midazolam in 14 (17 %), propofol in 7 (8 %), and etomidate in 3 cases (4 %). Neuromuscular blockades used were rocuronium in 27 cases (32 %), succinylcholine in 11 cases (13. 5 %), and atracurium in 5 cases (6 %). Complications were noted in 16 cases (19 %).

40|$|Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at {{high risk}} of {{nosocomial}} infection as they frequently perform medical procedures on infectious patients that may generate bioaerosols. For example, emergency <b>endotracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. Due to the high zonal bioaerosol concentration close to infection sources (e. g. patient's breathing zone) local exhaust ventilation (LEV) has been identified as a practical solution to reduce the bioaerosol concentration in hospital wards. In this study, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models have been developed to simulate the transport of infectious droplets and bioaerosols in a hospital ward to aid the design and control of a LEV system.
