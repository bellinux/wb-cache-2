5|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became {{symbols of the}} {{slightly}} risqué <b>glamour</b> <b>and</b> decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. <b>Glamour</b> <b>and</b> theatricality became reality when the American film star Grace Kelly became chatelaine of the palace in 1956.

Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her <b>glamour</b> <b>and</b> the songs were the only high points of the film.

5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and <b>glamour,</b> <b>and</b> the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E

25|$|Bras rapidly {{became a}} major {{industry}} over the 1930s, with improvements in fiber technology, fabrics, colours, patterns, and options, and did {{much better than the}} retail industry in general. Innovations included Warners' use of elastic, the adjustable strap, the sized cup, and padded bras for smaller-breasted women. In the US production moved outside of New York and Chicago, and advertising started to exploit Hollywood <b>glamour</b> <b>and</b> become more specialised. Department stores developed fitting areas, and customers, stores and manufacturers all benefited. Manufacturers even arranged fitting training courses for saleswomen. International sales started to form an increasing part of the U.S. bra manufacturer's market. Prices started to make bras available to a wider market, and home-made competition dwindled. Other major manufacturers of the 1930s included Triumph, Maidenform, Gossard, (Courtaulds), Spirella, Spencer, Twilfit, and Symington.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, LaVey {{purchased}} a Victorian {{house in the}} Richmond District of San Francisco, which he painted black. During the late 1950s, LaVey hosted Friday night lectures on occult subjects at his house. The process of writing his lectures lead him to distill his philosophy based on his earlier research into topics considered bizarre and arcane, and experiences as a psychic investigator and hypnotist, as well as work in the carnivals. He gradually gathered regular visitors who {{became known as the}} “Magic Circle”. During this time, LaVey also held “witches workshops”, classes to instruct women on the art of seduction and manipulation through <b>glamour</b> <b>and</b> feminine wiles. According to sociologist and early group affiliate, Randall Alfred, these “workshops” included “various aspects of Satanism” and were part of the Friday night lectures. Though actual numbers are unknown, {{it has been suggested that}} the group comprised around twenty people. Accounts suggest that the “circle” included authors, artists, doctors, policemen, and academics among other professions.|$|E
