5|$|Born in 1989, Liukin was {{ten months}} {{too young to}} compete as a senior in 2004, and thus was not {{eligible}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> on the U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.

5|$|Despite being {{regularly}} overlooked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in {{the elite}} South Australian junior state squads, {{he continued to}} follow {{the rest of the}} squad to training sessions in order to learn alongside them. Harley's persistent attendance at training was rewarded when he was called up to the under–18s squad as a late injury replacement a week prior to the National AFL Championships. Playing at centre half-back, Harley's performance in defence earned him end-of-year All-Australian honours and brought him to the attention of AFL scouts.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurrence}} {{of the effects}} of his injury in 1924 restricted Gilligan's cricket in 1925. Appearing in fewer games and bowling far less frequently than in previous seasons, he scored 542 runs at 15.05 and took only eight wickets. He bowled in the first four games of the season, but in his remaining seventeen appearances played only as a batsman. In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer considered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the panel of Test selectors, and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called Collins's Men.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to film {{scenes that}} involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made}} to recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he resumed}} with Victoria, but faced {{a lot of}} {{competition}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> as an opening batsman in the Australian team. He played his only Test in the 1946-47 Ashes series at the Adelaide Oval, filling in for the injured Sid Barnes. Scoring 12 and 31, he partnered Arthur Morris in a second innings opening stand of 116. After a further two first-class seasons, Harvey retired after being dropped from Victoria's first-choice team. He ended with a record of 1,147 first-class runs at 38.23 in 22 matches. This included three centuries, and he captained Victoria five times, winning one matchthe rest were drawn. His career highlight was an innings of 136 in December 1946 against New South Wales, when he hooked a bouncer from Ray Lindwall into the MCG public bar and featured in a partnership of 271 with Keith Miller. His highest score was 163 against South Australia at Adelaide. Harvey continued playing for Fitzroy until 1954-55, and he finished with 6,654 runs at an average of 29.31 in 207 First XI matches for the club.|$|E
