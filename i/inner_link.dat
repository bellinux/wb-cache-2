5000|$|There are {{actually}} {{two types of}} links alternating in the bush roller chain. The first type is <b>inner</b> <b>links,</b> having two <b>inner</b> plates held together by two sleeves or bushings upon which rotate two rollers. <b>Inner</b> <b>links</b> alternate with the second type, the outer links, consisting of two outer plates held together by pins passing through the bushings of the <b>inner</b> <b>links.</b> The [...] "bushingless" [...] roller chain is similar in operation though not in construction; instead of separate bushings or sleeves holding the inner plates together, the plate has a tube stamped into it protruding from the hole which serves the same purpose. This {{has the advantage of}} removing one step in assembly of the chain.|$|R

It aims to find clusters in a graph- a group of nodes in which the number of <b>inner</b> <b>links</b> between the nodes inside the group {{is much higher than}} that between the nodes inside the group and those outside the group. Many techniques have been proposed to solve this problem [34 – 37].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{investigation}} is first motivated by showing two examples of simple regular symmetrical graphs, which have the same structural parameters, such as average distance, degree distribution and node betweenness centrality, but have very different synchronizabilities. This demonstrates {{the complexity of the}} network synchronizability problem. For a given network with identical node dynamics, it is further shown that two key factors influencing the network synchronizability are the network <b>inner</b> <b>linking</b> matrix and the eigenvalues of the network topological matrix. Several examples are then provided to show that adding new edges to a network can either increase or decrease the network synchronizability. In searching for conditions under which the network synchronizability may be increased by adding edges, it is found that for networks with disconnected complementary graphs, adding edges never decreases their synchronizability. This implies that better understanding and careful manipulation of the complementary graphs are important and useful for enhancing the network synchronizability. Moreover, it is found that an unbounded synchronized region is always easier to analyze than a bounded synchronized region. Therefore, to effectively enhance the network synchronizability, a design method is finally presented for the <b>inner</b> <b>linking</b> matrix of rank 1 such that the resultant network has an unbounded synchronized region, for the case where the synchronous state is an equilibrium point of the network...|$|R

50|$|Double skin (USA: double wall): The outer tent is a {{waterproof}} layer which extends {{down to the}} ground all round. One or more 'inner tents' provide sleeping areas. The outer tent may be just a little larger than the inner tent, or it may be a lot larger and provide a covered living area separate from the sleeping area(s). An inner tent is not waterproof, but allows water vapour to pass through so that condensation occurs only on the exterior side. The double layer may also provide some thermal insulation. Either the outer skin or the inner skin may be the structural component, carrying the poles; the structural skin is always pitched first, though some tents are built with the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>linked</b> so that they are both pitched at the same time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the effect}} of the {{coupling}} strength to the complex network synchronizability is investigated. For a given network with identical node dynamics, it is shown that the coupling strength among the nodes is one of key factors influencing the network synchronizability besides the network <b>inner</b> <b>linking</b> matrix and the eigenvalues of the network topological matrix. It is point that if the synchronized region S is an unbounded sector, for achieving synchronizability, the coupling strength must be {{greater than or equal to}} the minimum coupling strength, and with the increasing of the coupling strength, network synchronizability is improved; if S is a bounded sector, for achieving network synchronizability, the coupling strength must be in a certain range, and the larger coupling strength does not necessarily indicate better synchronizability...|$|R
