40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development and}} current status <b>of</b> supported <b>employment,</b> a relatively recent concept that holds much promise for improving the <b>employment</b> prospects <b>of</b> disabled people. It argues that supported employment offers a positive departure from the poor performance of traditional approaches to vocational rehabilitation and job placement. However the thesis demonstrates {{that because of the}} perspectives which inform the current concept <b>of</b> supported <b>employment</b> it can be disempowering and oppressive. The origins and current status <b>of</b> supported <b>employment</b> are explored to identify the central issues and concerns. The capacity and limits <b>of</b> supported <b>employment</b> in the broader arena <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> support services in New Zealand are revealed. The theoretical orientation of the thesis lies in the critical tradition. Three perspectives that have influenced policies and practices in the disability arena are examined The views and experiences of fourteen disabled people on the nature and performance <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> support services were obtained through individual interviews in order to reveal the central issues as defined by service users. Many of these people were also involved with the disability rights movement. The findings revealed a great deal of concern about the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> support services. In particular participants identified disabled people's lack of power in the development and use of services. A policy analysis <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> support services, a critical theoretical analysis of disability and the reflections of a group of service users contribute to the reconstruction <b>of</b> supported <b>employment.</b> An emancipatory model <b>of</b> supported <b>employment</b> is described in which disabled people are empowered to reveal the contradictions and power <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> conventional approaches to vocational rehabilitation and job placement. As a result employment support services and related policies are challenged to shift from a focus on assimilation in the workplace to the transformation <b>of</b> workplaces and <b>employment</b> support services in disabled people's interests...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{analysis}} of four surveys {{conducted during the}} time period of 2003 - 2009, this paper examines basic characters and changes in college student employment trends under new circumstances triggered by the current global financial crisis. The data shows that the crisis has negatively influenced the growth <b>of</b> student <b>employment</b> and has aggravated the already serious <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> supply and demand in the Chinese job market for university graduates. Shifts in economic growth structures caused by the financial crisis have decreased demands {{in the job market}} for university graduates. Although Chinese government carried out a series of reforms aimed at promoting employment for university graduates, their individual preferences about work options and tendencies of choosing location have not been noticeably changed. This is due to the significant <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic development among geographical regions, urban and rural regions, as well as labour market segmentation...|$|R
40|$|Since 1993, American {{trade deficit}} with China is {{expanding}} and the gap is becoming increasingly bigger. The widening bilateral trade imbalance has caused growing concerns. This paper, by using empirical method and adjusting the data of trade from 1989 to 2005, finds that the causes <b>of</b> the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> China-US trade are as follows: 1) the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> domestic demands of US; 2) the adjustment of American economic structure, and 3) the growing of multinational enterprises. The paper also finds that the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> China-US trade is {{not as big as}} it was reported by US; the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> China-US trade is an inevitable result of economic development, and the trade deficit does not necessarily mean a loss of profit. In fact, American investors and consumers have greatly benefited from China-US trade...|$|R
