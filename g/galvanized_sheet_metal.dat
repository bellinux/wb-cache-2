40|$|Arc brazing has, in {{comparison}} to arc welding, the advantage of less heat input while joining <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> The evaporation of zinc is reduced in the areas adjacent to the joint and improved corrosion protection is achieved. In the automotive industry, lightweight design is a key technology {{against the background of}} the weight and environment protection. Structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> have higher stiffness compared to typical automobile <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> and therefore they can {{play an important role in}} lightweight structures. In the present paper, three arc brazing variants of <b>galvanized</b> structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> were validated in terms of the corrosion behavior. The standard gas metal arc brazing, the pulsed arc brazing, and the cold metal transfer (CMT®) in combination with a pulsed cycle were investigated. In experimental climate change tests, the influence of the brazing processes on the corrosion behavior of <b>galvanized</b> structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was investigated. After that, the corrosion behavior of brazed structured and flat <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was compared. Because of the selected lap joint, the valuation of damage between <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was conducted. The pulsed CMT brazing has been derived from the results as the best brazing method for the joining process of <b>galvanized</b> structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of degreasing, a surface {{preparation}} methods in adhesive bonding, on adhesive joint strength. 5 types of degreasing agents {{were used in the}} study: acetone, extraction naphtha, Ultramyt, Wiko and Loctite 7061. The degreasing operation was performed by three methods: rubbing, spraying and immersion. Strength tests were performed on single-lap adhesive joints of hot-dip <b>galvanized</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> made with Loctite 9466 adhesive according to the above variants of surface preparation. The experimental results demonstrate that adhesive joint strength is significantly affected by the applied degreasing agent. Moreover, the method of application of the degreasing agent is crucial, too. The results of strength testing reveal that the most effective degreasing method for hot-dip <b>galvanized</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> adhesive joints is spraying using extraction naphtha. Thereby degreased samples have the highest immediate strength and shear strength.

40|$|Abstract:During {{forming process}} of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal,</b> {{friction}} phenomenon occurs everywhere. <b>Galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is the combination}} of substrate and zinc coating, which are two different materials of different properties. Compared with ordinary cold-rolled steel sheets, friction during forming process of <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> is more complicated. Factors like load, velocity, etc. have different effects. In this paper, effects of zinc coating, velocity and load on <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> friction coefficient were researched based on orthogonal tables with using friction wear tester. The results show the following conclusions. Zinc coating has great effect on <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> friction, friction coefficient of zinc-coated sheet is {{greater than that of}} bare board under low load (0. 3 ~ 1 N), but smaller than that of bare board under high load (1 ~ 5 N). <b>Galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> friction coefficient also changes when load or velocity changes, with load increases, it first increases and then decreases; with velocity increases, it first increases and then decreases. Mechanism of the influence rules above was simply analyzed. Significance of the three factors above could also be seen. Under low load, effect of zinc coating on <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> friction coefficient is the greatest, followed by that of load, and finally that of velocity, but none of them is significant; under high load, effect of zinc coating is significant, those of velocity and load are not significant...|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and {{ornament}} decreased in use in the US. It is now gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Typically, architectural grade zinc is 99.995 percent pure zinc with trace amounts of titanium, to reduce coefficient of thermal expansion and improve tensile strength and hardness, and copper to improve workability. Exact alloy composition is subject to manufacturer and is a color determinant in zinc's final patina. Over time, zinc develops its distinctive patina, transforming from a shiny silver to a matte bluish-grey. Pre patinated finishes are available from certain manufacturers to expedite the natural patination process. Zinc is still used in alloys such as brass and nickel silver, and in the electroplating of steel as well. Today, galvanized steel and pure zinc material, usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of titanium in most architectural zinc available in North America. <b>Galvanized</b> nails and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> ducts are also common.|$|R

50|$|Three key {{interventions}} {{were discussed}} and disseminated; ventilation by enlarging windows or opening eaves spaces, adding smoke hoods over the cooking area, or {{the option of}} installing an improved cook stove such as the Upesi stove. Smoke hoods are free-standing units that act like flues or chimneys {{in their effort to}} draw smoke out of the dwelling. They can be used over traditional open fires and this study showed they contribute to considerably lower levels of IAP. The smoke hood models were made with hard manila paper and then transferred to heavy-gauge <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> and manufactured locally. This resulted in further employment opportunities for the artisans who were trained by the project. The Upesi stove, made of clay and kiln-fired, was developed by Practical Action and East African partners to utilize wood and agricultural wastes.

40|$|Abstract. When {{stamping}} <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet,</b> the formability usually decreases {{for failure}} of zinc coating. In this paper, formability of <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> was firstly researched by Erichsen experiment. The {{results show that}} zinc coating has lost efficacy when the cup arrives the value of Erichsen depth (ED). Then finite element analysis was used, it puts the zinc coating and the substrate in connection by using automatic-surface-to-surface-tiebreak and sets {{up a series of}} forming limitation diagrams (FLD) of <b>galvanized</b> <b>sheet</b> and of zinc coating under different punch strokes. Then depth of the cup when zinc coating reaches critical state was got, which decreased about 5 %- 10 % compared with bare sheet. At last, failure mechanism of zinc coating was discussed, the reason is that material of zinc coating is soft and the friction leads to pulverization and exfoliation of zinc coating. The simulation results are consistent with the Erichsen experiment ones.

The sheets aligned vertically in a zigzag shape and {{the gap between the}} sheets is around 7. 5 mm. Water drips from the top distribution bath over the pads through small holes. Outside air is cooled by evaporating water droplets and moisture retained at the surface of the wetted sheets in the zigzagged air pathways. Performance of three pad’s depths (0. 15, 0. 30, and 0. 45 m) was tested. Each test lasted 24 hours, and dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity of outside and conditioned air and reservoir’s water temperatures were scanned and recorded every ten seconds.

But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the Tin, Sheet Iron and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade.
