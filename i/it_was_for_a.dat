Nagamitsu (also called Junkei Nagamitsu), the son of Mitsutada, was the second generation, and Kagemitsu the third generation.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Singh {{was called}} for an {{audition}} by Shanoo Sharma, {{the head of the}} casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, {{the vice president of the}} company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he {{was called for}} a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} closed in 1978 and leased {{to a private}} company; however, the venture failed, and it closed to bathers in 1984. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time used as a trout farm, but was {{threatened}} with demolition, {{as an alternative to}} repair. In 2003 Bath and North East Somerset council put the site up for sale or long lease, and it was added to the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. A trust was formed in 2005 to rescue the pool from dilapidation. In 2006 its listed building status was raised from II to II* as it is considered particularly important buildings of more than special interest.|$|E

25|$|Coldstream Mill {{was built}} to serve the Barony and castle of Hessilhead. It was officially known as Whitestone Mill in the Lands of Coldstream.

25|$|From 367, under Valentinian I, Trier {{once more}} became an {{imperial}} residence (lasting until {{the death of}} Theodosius I in 395) and remained the largest city north of the Alps. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few years (383 – 388) the capital of Magnus Maximus, who ruled most of the western Empire. In 407, shortly after the invasion of Gaul by the Vandals, Alans and Suebi, the Gallic prefecture was relocated to Arles, on the Rhône.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a provincial}} and local {{government}} city of the Holy Roman Empire, and an important trading point connecting several routes, {{on either side of}} the River Danube from the east to the west and Bohemia and Poland from north to the Balkans and Italy to the south. Being the city where the Habsburg Emperor Friedrich III spent his last years, <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short period of time, the most important city in the empire. It lost its status to Vienna and Prague after the death of the Emperor in 1493.|$|E
25|$|Cheapside was {{the birthplace}} of John Milton, and Robert Herrick. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time {{one of the most}} {{important}} streets in London. It is also the site of the 'Bow Bells', the church of St. Mary-le-Bow, which has played a part in London's Cockney heritage and the tale of Dick Whittington. Geoffrey Chaucer grew up around Cheapside and there are a scattering of references to the thoroughfare and its environs throughout his work. The first chapter of Peter Ackroyd's Brief Lives series on Chaucer also colourfully describes the street at that time. Thomas Middleton's play A Chaste Maid in Cheapside (1613) both satirises and celebrates the citizens of the neighbourhood during the Renaissance, when the street hosted the city's goldsmiths.|$|E

25|$|Besses o' th' Barn Band, and {{subsequently}} its associated boys' band, has {{existed in the}} area since at least 1818, at which time it had converted from a string band to a reed band. Its founders were John, James and Joseph Clegg – three brothers who were manufacturers of cotton products at Besses o' th' Barn – {{and for this reason}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time known as Clegg's Reed Band. Originally using a room called the mangle room, attached to the old barn at Besses which was pulled down in the 1880s, it has had its headquarters on Moss Lane since 1884. At the peak of its fame in the early 1900s this band, by now using brass instruments, undertook numerous prestigious engagements, including world tours lasting well in excess of 12 months at a time.|$|E
25|$|When {{a vacancy}} occurred, {{the bishop of}} the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of {{election}} was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to Rome. It was necessary that an abbot {{should be at least}} 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached {{on the rights of the}} monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> term of 8–12 years.|$|E
