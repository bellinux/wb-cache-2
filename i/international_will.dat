25|$|Donovan {{returned}} to training with the Galaxy on March 25, 2013, {{and made his}} season debut five days later against Toronto FC, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute. However, upon his return, it was announced he {{would be forced to}} relinquish the captaincy to Robbie Keane for the 2013 season. He scored two goals against Chivas USA, tying him with Jeff Cunningham together as the top MLS goalscorer with 134 goals. On May 25, 2014, Donovan scored twice against the Philadelphia Union to break Cunningham's record of 134, making Donovan MLS's All-Time leading goalscorer with 136 goals. On August 6, 2014, he scored the winning goal at the 2014 MLS All-Star Game, putting the ball past Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at the 70th minute, he was subsequently substituted for Sporting Kansas City striker Dom Dwyer and gave the captain's armband to Canadian <b>international</b> <b>Will</b> Johnson. On August 7, 2014, Donovan announced he would be retiring {{at the end of the}} 2014 Major League Soccer season; the season ended with the Galaxy winning their fourth MLS Cup of the Donovan era on December 7, 2014.|$|E

500|$|Chicago-based Environmental Systems Design, Inc. {{will provide}} mechanical, plumbing, {{electrical}} and fire protection engineering, {{as well as}} teledata, audio/visual, security systems and acoustics. Langan <b>International</b> <b>will</b> be responsible for geotechnical engineering {{as well as some}} ground level site work such as transportation engineering and parking, including the design of the proposed 3,000–4,700 car underground parking garage that will be located near, but not under the tower for terrorism reasons. Langan also designed the tower's foundation, which {{has to be able to}} support the tower despite the less than optimal subsurface conditions, such as soft rock and permeable coral, which could cause the piles to settle. Thornton Tomasetti has provided the structural engineering for two of the previous world's tallest building title holders, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, and the Taipei 101 in Taiwan, as well as the under construction Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, which will be the second tallest building in China after completion. Saudi Binladin Group is the largest construction firm in the Middle East, with over 35,000 workers and hundreds of projects. They recently constructed the topped-out [...] Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower in Mecca, which is the tallest building in Saudi Arabia and third tallest in the world, as well as the largest skyscraper in the world by floor area and volume. Aside from buildings, the firm has also constructed many major infrastructure projects, such as the King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport expansion and the [...] six lane Al Qassim Expressway through Saudi Arabia. Saudi Binladin Group is owned by the family of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As a result, it has sparked some minor media buzz. When asked his thoughts about this in an interview, Adrian Smith simply stated that they are the largest construction firm in the Middle East, most significant work in Saudi Arabia was done by them, and that it is a very large family that shouldn't be stereotyped by one of its members. Furthermore, in January 2012, New York City judge George B. Daniels ruled that no charges could be filed against SBG to repay the victims of 9/11 as there is no evidence of the construction firm financially supporting bin Laden after he was removed as a shareholder following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.|$|E

2500|$|Analyst Jessica Tuchman Mathews of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace {{agreed that}} {{imposing}} democracy [...] "from scratch" [...] was unwise, and didn't work. Realist critics such as George F.

Realist critics attacked the idealism of Wilson as being ill-suited for weak states created at the Paris Peace Conference. Others, however, criticize the U.S. Senate's decision not to join the League of Nations which was based on isolationist public sentiment as being one cause for the organization's ineffectiveness.|$|E

2500|$|According to Amedeo Policante, a {{researcher}} from Goldsmiths College, University of London: [...] "The devastating {{effect of these}} types of corporate-led form of capital accumulation cannot be overstated in a region where, {{according to the most recent}} reports of the UNEP, over 30 million people are dependent on maritime and coastal resources for their daily livelihoods. Nevertheless, there was little or no <b>international</b> <b>will</b> to insist on the implementation of the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea, which banish both over-fishing and toxic dumping in oceanic waters. This form of illegality – despite the environmental disruption and the high cost in human life it implied – was not perceived as an existential threat by states and it was therefore left unchecked. Only when piracy appeared in the region the lack of effective sovereign control over the Gulf of Aden was problematized".|$|E
