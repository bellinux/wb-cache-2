According to Stoker Hunt, author of Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game, before his death Merrill warned {{against the use of}} the Ouija board.|$|E

And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

500|$|Josef Zankowicz, {{who managed}} the firm's {{publicity}} during this period, later commented: [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that we might}} get sued—actually, we prayed to get sued. Because by suing us, the number one player in the marketplace opened up the door. Anyone can create an interesting product, spend $10 million and create awareness of it. But it's another thing to create a product and spend one-tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Robert Canning {{also found}} the long-running {{football}} vs. glee storyline repetitive, but wrote that the football players joining glee club was [...] "a welcome twist", however convoluted and unrealistic. He rated the episode 8/10, finding it [...] "preposterously fun". Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker considered the episode [...] "at once in-your-face and under-handed, very clever about its very cynicism." [...] He noted that while he had become jaded with Glee, he enjoyed [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", summarizing that, [...] "Everything in this episode was chaotic and topsy-turvy, but you never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> the silliness was {{getting away from the}} producers. It all came together." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E

500|$|Producer Harve Bennett was {{exhausted}} by {{his work on}} the previous three Star Trek films and wanted to move on, feeling that he {{was not part of the}} Star Trek [...] "family" [...] and that he had been mistreated by Nimoy. When Shatner tried to convince Bennett to reconsider, the producer insisted on a meeting at his home. After several hours of discussion Bennett agreed to return. Bennett disagreed with several elements of Shatner's story, feeling that because no one could assuredly answer the question of God's existence, the ending of the film would never be satisfying. Bennett also told Shatner that the film <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of a tone poem rather than an adventure story. The studio agreed with Bennett, reasoning that the subject matter could be too weighty or offensive to theatergoers.|$|E
500|$|After From Russia with Love, Eon had {{considered}} undertaking {{an adaptation of}} either On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Casino Royale. They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman, who held {{the rights to the}} latter, but a deal proved too difficult to achieve. Instead, Eon turned to the Thunderball novel. Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared. As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball. McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although [...] "in reality all three men would essentially act as producers". Broccoli later said of the three-way partnership that [...] "We didn't want anyone else to make Thunderball... We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that if anyone else came in and made their own Bond film, it would have been bad for our series".|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, The Straits Times {{said that}} Thumboo's [...] "most {{powerful}} legacy" [...] was [...] "spearheading {{the creation of}} a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: [...] "There were not that many people writing in 1965, so you <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that you had to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What the hell is going on with the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting. We were already starting to think, 'Maybe our instinct here has been wrong.|$|E
500|$|Bakke {{complained to}} Dr. George Lowrey, {{chairman}} of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. [...] At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. [...] If he was not accepted the second time, “he could then research the legal question. [...] He {{had been a good}} candidate. [...] I thought he’d be accepted and that would end the matter.” [...] Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, “I don’t think Storandt meant to injure the university. [...] It’s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.” [...] Storandt stated, “I simply gave Allan the response you’d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. [...] I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn’t know this would be the case.” Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the Bakke case, Storandt was fired.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{went to the}} Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Customs {{early on}} with the script {{and told them that}} they were trying to present as {{detailed}} and accurate a picture of the current drug war as possible. The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the border checkpoint to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the content of the script. Soderbergh said Traffic had influences from the films of Richard Lester and Jean-Luc Godard. He also spent time analyzing The Battle of Algiers and Z, which, according to the director, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that the footage was [...] "caught" [...] and not staged. Another inspiration was Alan J. Pakula's film All the President's Men because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining. In the opening credits of his film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from All the President's Men and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for Traffic.|$|E

500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the club}} failing {{to live up}} to its high {{spending}} potential, Ford became a target for doubters due to his physical playing style and his arguments with teammate and former record-breaking signing, Len Shackleton. During a match against Chelsea in February 1952, Ford scored a first-half hat-trick during the match as the Mackems found themselves 4–0 up at half-time, Shackleton having also scored. In the second- half of the match, Shackleton was believed to have [...] "switched off" [...] as he considered the match already won, leaving Ford to largely play up-front on his own against the opposition defense, resulting in a frustrated Ford to claim to members of the local press after the game that Shackleton never deliberately passed to him during games. Things became so heated between the pair that, during a friendly match against a Netherlands B side, Shackleton dribbled past the opposition goalkeeper before stopping on the goal-line and passing the ball back to Ford before commenting [...] "Here, don't say I never give you a pass" [...] in reference to Ford's displeasure at his belief that Shackleton would play the ball in areas Ford did not want it. Billy Bingham, who played alongside the pair at Sunderland, later commented [...] "He (Ford) never seemed to know what Shackleton was going to do with the ball and subsequently Trevor believed that Shackleton was ignoring him on the field of play". Stan Anderson, another former teammate of the pair, believed that Shackleton was jealous of Ford's perceived good looks and also supported Ford's claims of Shackleton deliberately misplacing passes to Ford on at least one occasion, commenting [...] "I just <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> he (Shackleton) never wanted Trevor to score, which made me really angry".|$|E

2500|$|An early {{admirer of}} The House in Paris was Virginia Woolf, {{a good friend}} of Bowen's.
