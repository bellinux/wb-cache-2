40|$|The coupled SWAP–WOFOST {{model was}} used to {{study the effects of}} {{increasing}} salinity of groundwater, drought and water excess on grass production in The Netherlands. WOFOST simulates crop growth and SWAP simulates transport of water, solutes and heat in the vadose zone. The model was tested using several datasets from field experiments. We applied the models at regional scale where we quantified the impact of various groundwater salinity levels on grass growth and production using historical weather data (1971 – 2000). The salt concentrations in the subsoil were derived from the National <b>Hydrological</b> <b>Instrument.</b> The results show that salinity effects on grass production are limited. In wet years the excess rainfall will infiltrate the soil and reduce salt water seepage. In a next step we used future weather data for the year 2050, derived from 3 Global Circulation Models. From each model we used data from two CO 2 emission scenarios. As expected higher temperatures increased drought stress, however, the production reduction as a result of salt water in the root zone is limited. Salt stress mainly occurred when irrigation was applied with saline water. The increased CO 2 concentration in combination with the limited drought stress resulted in increasing simulated actual and potential yields. Overall conclusion for grassland in The Netherlands: drought stress is stronger than stress caused by water excess which on its turn is stronger than salinity stress. Future water demand for irrigation may increase by 11 – 19 % and result in water scarcity if water supply is insufficient...|$|E
40|$|Geoengineered {{groundwater}} systems {{located within}} seven large (> 100 ha surface area), deep-seated, slow-creep schist landslides in Cromwell Gorge (Otago, New Zealand) are observed to respond systematically to 10 large (>Mw 6. 2), regional earthquakes at epicentral distances of 130 - 630 km. The permeabilities of the schist landslides have previously {{been reported to}} be c. 1 x 10 ⁻¹⁷ - 4 x 10 ⁻⁶ m 2 and the permeability structure is dominated by large fracture zones. Of the 315 <b>hydrological</b> <b>instruments</b> in the gorge for which data have been analysed, 21 monitoring well piezometers record repeated metre- or centimetre-scale groundwater level changes, and 12 underground V-notch weirs record elevated flow rates induced by the same earthquakes. Groundwater level changes exhibit consistent temporal characteristics at all monitoring sites, namely a time to peak pressure change on the order of one month and a subsequent recovery period on the order of one year. Changes in weir flow rate are near-instantaneous with maximum flow rates reached within 0 - 6 hours, followed by recession periods on the order of one month. Hydrological responses to different earthquakes at each monitoring site are systematic in terms of polarity and amplitude. This comprehensive dataset enables consistent patterns in the amplitude, time to peak pressure change and recovery time of groundwater level changes, and elevated weir discharge volumes in response to earthquake shaking to be documented. Earthquakes inducing hydrological responses have been categorised into five categories based on shaking characteristics (duration, bandwidth and amplitude). Larger hydrological responses and proportionally shorter time to peak pressure change and recovery time are associated with long duration (25 - 50 s or longer), high-amplitude, broad bandwidth shaking. The larger amplitudes of hydrological response and proportionally shorter times to peak pressure change and recovery times, are interpreted to represent greater temporary enhancement of the landslides hydraulic properties, particularly permeability. Understanding how earthquakes can enhance or otherwise affect hydraulic properties such as permeability in fractured reservoirs is intrinsically important and may prove of economic utility for both the geothermal and hydrocarbon energy sectors...|$|R

40|$|SIMGRO is an {{integration}} hub {{that connects}} to diverse hydrologic models. Its coupling method aims {{to describe the}} hydrologic feedbacks adequately at an acceptable cost of the increased computational load. The achieved balance between accuracy and efficiency is investigated in the paper. The coupling method centres around a shared state variable of two connecting subsystems. A prime {{example of such a}} variable is the elevation of the phreatic surface that forms the natural demarcation between the saturated groundwater flow and the unsaturated flow in the soil. In our scheme the shared variable is alternately updated by the connecting submodels, with both models using the same combined storage relationship. This method has also been implemented for the linkage between the ponding water of column models and surface water models. Using a basin-scale model, the scheme was subjected to a time-step sensitivity analysis. Results were compared to a benchmark, for which we took the same scheme, but with a short time step of 0. 125 d. Increasing the time step to 1 d caused a numerical error of less than 5 % in the simulated regional design discharge. Errors in the simulated 95 th percentile of highest groundwater levels are less than 0. 05 m.

40|$|The Rollesbroich {{headwater}} catchment {{located in}} western Germany is a densely <b>instrumented</b> <b>hydrological</b> observatory {{and part of}} the TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories) initiative. The measurements acquired in this observatory present a comprehensive data set that contains key hydrological fluxes in addition to important hydrological states and properties. Meteorological data (i. e., precipitation, air temperature, air humidity, radiation components, and wind speed) are continuously recorded and actual evapotranspiration is measured using the eddy covariance technique. Runoff is measured at the catchment outlet with a gauging station. In addition, spatiotemporal variations in soil water content and temperature are measured at high resolution with a wireless sensor network (SoilNet). Soil physical properties were determined using standard laboratory procedures from samples taken at a large number of locations in the catchment. This comprehensive data set can be used to validate remote sensing retrievals and hydrological models, to improve the understanding of spatial temporal dynamics of soil water content, to optimize data assimilation and inverse techniques for hydrological models, and to develop upscaling and downscaling procedures of soil water content information.

40|$|Conceptual {{models of}} first-order {{controls}} governing river channel dynamics in mountain streams have been rarely {{tested in the}} field. In this Ph. D. thesis we {{examine the effects of}} hydro-meteorological forcing and sediment supply on the bedload transport dynamics of mountain streams. To this purpose we select three step-pool mountain streams that share identical granitic lithology, but exhibit contrasting sediment supply and hydro-climatic conditions. The three study sites, which are located in Trentino, Eastern Italian Alps, include the Ussaia Creek (2. 3 km 2) in Val di Sole, and the Grigno and Tolvà Creeks (7 km 2) in Valsugana. The former is characterized by high, sand-rich sediment supply delivered by some 20 m-thick glacigenic deposits. The latter two, which flow through glacially carved bedrock terrain, are disconnected from colluvial sediment inputs so that sediment sources are limited to channel banks and bars during high flows. Mean annual precipitation is respectively 844 mm in Ussaia Creek and 1511 mm in Grigno and Tolvà Creeks. All study streams experience, to variable extents, snowmelt and rainfall-induced bedload transporting flows. To estimate quantitatively the effects and the interactions associated with sediment supply and hydro-meteorological forcing, we monitor precipitation and atmospheric temperature. <b>Hydrological</b> levels at <b>instrumented</b> sections are recorded via pressure transducers. Bedload transport is monitored by tagging and tracking 632 stones (b-axis: 30 to 131 mm; weight 88 - 4004 g). The tracking of these PIT-tagged tracers was conducted from December 2013 to December 2015 by means of an RFID portable pole antenna. Cumulatively, a total of 16, 11 and 19 bedload events were monitored respectively at Grigno, Tolvà and Ussaia Creek. We measured displacement lengths occurred during inter-survey periods, induced by peak flows associated to snowmelt, rainfall or {{a combination of the two}} (mixed-type). Active channel depth was evaluated via direct digging tests at the three study sites finding a median burial depth of 0. 1 m at Grigno and Tolvà Creeks, and 0. 25 m at Ussaia Creek; recent findings (Schneider et al., 2014), show that ordinary bedload events of boulder-bed streams in the Alps, active layer thickness is comprised within 0. 01 and 0. 22 m; Houbrechts et al. (2012) demonstrated that in mountain streams the active layer thickness is lower than D 50. The active layer width was evaluated via orthophoto maps obtained through Structure-from-Motion. To characterize the streambed roughness and the channel slope we conducted topographic and morphologic surveys. To evaluate event-based bedload sediment volumes we applied the virtual velocity approach (Haschenburger and Church, 1998). In particular, to assess the minimum discharge able to entrain clasts, determining the virtual transport duration of each tracer weight class, we used the competence flow method. In order to evaluate the uncertainty associated with methodology that has been customarily applied in the literature, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the evaluation of bedload transfer proposing three scenarios varying the assumptions that (i) virtual velocities are normally distributed and therefore justifying the adoption of median virtual velocities instead of the average virtual velocity, (ii) that active channel width is constant in time, hence replacing bankfull width with site-specific active widths, evaluated on the base of PIT-tagged particles displacements. The monitoring year 2014 was characterized by a total annual precipitation two times larger than the historical mean, associated to a prolonged snowmelt and to heavy storm front events. By contrast, in 2015 we observed no snowmelt and no precipitation occurred in November and December. At Grigno and Tolvà Creeks, the majority of sediment is transported during autumn storm fronts (median travel distance: 30 m) and secondarily by summer convective storms (median travel distance: 4. 5 m). At Ussaia Creek, snowmelt-related events induced 17...|$|R
