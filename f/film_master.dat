In his pre-pink days at Nikkatsu, from 1963 to 1965, Wakamatsu made 20 low-budget exploitation movies {{based on current}} events such as sensational crimes and disasters. Though at first the work was steady, Katori was barely surviving on the bit-part wages from Nikkatsu. When the major film studios started facing a decline in audiences, they began cutting back in film output. Katori's income suffered as well.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the film}} was released, rumors and {{allegations}} began to circulate that Battlefield Earth contained subliminal messages promoting Scientology. Former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim, in a press release issued by his group Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, said that the Church of Scientology [...] "has placed highly advanced subliminal messages in the Battlefield Earth <b>film</b> <b>master</b> to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience {{and to get the}} audience to develop a revulsion for psychiatry and current mental health organizations and practices". Other critics said that the film [...] "is a veiled attempt to gain converts and influence", and that writers were gagged from making connections between Scientology and the film with threats of lawsuits. Warner Bros. dismissed the claims as [...] "silly nonsense", the Church of Scientology denounced them as [...] "hogwash" [...] and the media reacted with skepticism; as the Scottish journalist Duncan Campbell put it, [...] "the only subliminal voice I could detect came about 10minutes into this 121-minute film and it seemed to be saying Leeeaaave thisssss cinemmmaaa nooow". When asked about the similarities between the film and Scientology beliefs in intergalactic travel and aliens, church spokesman Aron Mason stated, [...] "That's a pretty crude parallel… You'd have to make some serious leaps of logic to make that comparison." [...] John Travolta also stated that {{the film was}} not inspired by Scientology tenets.|$|E

With the money from Screen Gems and other works, [...] Eileen and he moved to 539 South Beverly Glen, near Beverly Hills. He discussed an idea about a multiethnic crew on an airship travelling the world, based on the 1961 <b>film</b> <b>Master</b> of the World, with fellow writer Christopher Knopf at MGM. As the time was not right for science fiction, he began work on The Lieutenant for Arena Productions. This made it to the NBC Saturday night lineup at 7:30pm, and premiered on September 14, 1963. The show set a new ratings record for that time slot. Roddenberry worked with several cast and crew who would later join him on Star Trek, including: Gene L. Coon, star Gary Lockwood, Joe D'Agosta, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, and Majel Barrett. The Lieutenant was produced with the co-operation of the Pentagon, which allowed them to film at an actual Marine base. During the production of the series, Roddenberry clashed regularly with the Department of Defense over potential plots. The department withdrew its support after Roddenberry pressed ahead with a plot titled [...] "To Set It Right" [...] in which a white and a black man find a common cause in their roles as Marines. [...] "To Set It Right" [...] {{was the first time he}} worked with Nichols, and it was her first television role. The episode has been preserved at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City. The show was not renewed after its first season. Roddenberry was already working on a new series idea. This included his ship location from Hawaii Passage and added a Horatio Hornblower character, plus the multiracial crew from his airship idea. He decided to write it as science fiction, and by March 11, 1964, he brought together a 16-page pitch. On April 24, he sent three copies and two dollars to the Writers Guild of America to register his series. He called it Star Trek.|$|E
