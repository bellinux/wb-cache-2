In this report, we define geneenvironment interactions as a stochastic dependence {{in the context of}} the effects of the genetic and environmental risk factors on the cause of phenotypic variation among individuals. We use mutual information that is widely used in communication and complex system analysis to measure <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions.</b> We investigate how geneenvironment interactions generate the large difference in the information measure of <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> between the general population and a diseased population, which motives us to develop mutual information-based statistics for testing <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions.</b> We validated the null distribution and calculated the type 1 error rates for the mutual information-based statistics to test <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> using extensive simulation studies.

In genetic epidemiology, <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> are useful for understanding some diseases.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> play an {{important}} role in the etiological pathway of complex diseases. An appropriate statistical method for handling a wide variety of complex situations involving interactions between variables is still lacking, especially when continuous variables are involved. The aim of this paper is to explore the ability of neural networks to model different structures of <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions.</b> A simulation study is set up to compare neural networks with standard logistic regression models. Eight different structures of <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> are investigated. These structures are characterized by penetrance functions that are based on sigmoid functions or on combinations of linear and non-linear effects of a continuous environmental factor and a genetic factor with main effect or with a masking effect only. Results In our simulation study, neural networks are more successful in modeling <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> than logistic regression models. This outperfomance is especially pronounced when modeling sigmoid penetrance functions, when distinguishing between linear and nonlinear components, and when modeling masking effects of the genetic factor. Conclusion Our study shows that neural networks are a promising approach for analyzing <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions.</b> Especially, if no prior knowledge of the correct nature of the relationship between co-variables and response variable is present, neural networks provide a valuable alternative to regression methods that are limited to the analysis of linearly separable data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Most complex {{diseases}} have well-established {{genetic and}} non-genetic risk factors. In some instances, these risk factors {{are likely to}} interact, whereby their joint effects convey a level of risk that is either significantly {{more or less than}} the sum of these risks. Characterizing these <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> may help elucidate the biology of complex diseases, as well as to guide strategies for their targeted prevention. In most cases, the detection of <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions</b> will require sample sizes in excess of those needed to detect the marginal effects of the genetic and environmental risk factors. Although many consortia have been formed, comprising multiple diverse cohorts to detect <b>gene-environment</b> <b>interactions,</b> few robust examples of such interactions have been discovered.
