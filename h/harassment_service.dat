We examine how patterns of sexual harassment and generalized workplace harassment are linked to utilization of mental health, health, legal, spiritual, and work-related services, and whether and how gender influences these relationships. Data derive from a random digit dial telephone survey with a continental US sample of employed adults. Eligibility criteria were being 18 {{years of age or}} over, and being employed at least 20 Â h per week at some time in the 12 months prior to the wave 1 survey. Out of 4116 households with eligible individuals, 2151 agreed to participate at wave 1. At wave 2, 1418 participated, thus, the overall response rate was 34. 5 %.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{is being given}} to the challenging of racism and racial harassment in health care organisations. Very little, however, is known about anti-discriminatory practice in the health services, or how professionals give meaning to ‘race’ in their work with service users. This paper examines these issues through representations of the ‘dilemmas’ that were talked about by hospice staff in managing incidents of racial <b>harassment</b> amongst <b>service</b> users. By addressing the micro-interactional dynamics of this work, specific {{attention is}} given to representations of the cognitive and emotional dimensions of anti-discriminatory practice: that is, how professionals {{talk about how they}} think and feel in working with, and sometimes attempting to challenge, racist service users. The paper suggests that the recognition and exploration of staff dilemmas in dealing with racism has much to contribute to the analysis of professional roles, values and expectations, while also having implications for policy and service development...|$|R

Semi-structured interviews were used to {{understand the relationship between}} women's experiences and their views of harassing behaviours, as well as influences on the incidence of harassment. Findings showed that participants cooperated with harassing behaviours because of their role view, and that older women were less prone to harassment, mostly because they were more skilled at rejecting unwanted advances.

These assumptions effectively prostitute the innate skills of young women who are keen to please management and customers, but not at the risk of assault and abuse...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} express one’s self, or simply ‘be yourself’ in public space remains a {{predominant}} concern among historically marginalized groups, {{and should be}} an important consideration in public space planning. Among those groups whose right to self-expression has failed to materialize in the public realm, the LGBTQ community is conspicuously absent from planning literature and discourse. Verbal <b>harassment,</b> bullying, <b>service</b> refusal, and physical violence {{are only a few}} of the ways LGBTQ people, particularly homeless youth and transgender women of color (TWOC), continue to experience public discrimination. By examining how TWOC perceive and interact with ‘everyday’ public spaces in Los Angeles, this thesis attempts to better understand the physical and social characteristics of everyday, public places that contribute to TWOC feeling more or less comfortable being themselves. The research uses qualitative methods, that include 1) a preliminary set of semi-structured interviews; 2) visual documentation, and 3) a second set of semi-structured interviews. Participants were invited to photograph the public spaces they use on an everyday basis, and were asked to consider how their feelings of comfort vary across these spaces. The research shows that everyday public spaces reflect social norms around gender identity, sexual orientation, and race, leading to compounded experiences of discomfort among TWOC individuals. At the same time, the degree of comfort varies depending on the social and physical conditions of public spaces...|$|R
40|$|Anecdotally, {{hospitality}} has {{a reputation}} for poor ethical standards, and preliminary results from this doctoral study indicate such a reputation is well founded. However, the expected crimes of sexual <b>harassment,</b> theft, the <b>service</b> of alcohol to minors, and poor food hygiene, {{do not appear to be}} the main concerns. Instead, staff complain of persistent unfair treatment by supervisors, and the struggle to provide service in an environment of poor training and critical under-staffing. This paper investigates the incidence of constructive dismissals and harsh treatment by supervisors in the Auckland hospitality industry, and the under-staffing and high turnover rates currently being experienced. Initial quantitative and qualitative analyses from 453 questionnaires are presented, in an attempt to shed light on some disturbing trends in this industry. Hospitality has a crucial role in tourism, which accounted for 14 % of New Zealand’s export earnings in 2002 (Provisional Tourism Satellite Account 2000 - 2002, 2003). Understanding the cause and extent of unethical behaviour is a significant step towards protecting the New Zealand industry from the traditions of opportunism and moral insensitivity prevalent in the hospitality industry in some countries...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Armed Forces has an {{expressed}} {{ambition to}} recruit more women. One component in {{this has been}} the establishment of special enlistment days for women. The expectations of the Armed Forces for this form of enlistment were both quantitative and qualitative. Firstly, more women would attend the tests and enlist as conscripts, and secondly, this form of enlistment would better prepare women for their service. The expectation that more women would enlist has already proven correct. The central question in this study is whether the special enlistment for women did in fact render the women better prepared for their service. The study was conducted using a questionnaire. The group studied comprised 320 women, of which about half attended the special enlistment for women and the rest ”ordinary” enlistment, i. e. together with men. The results of the study show that those women who underwent the special enlistment for women is basically satisfied with this form of enlistment. Most positive was to meet and get information from female officers and conscripts. The results also indicate that the special enlistment strengthens women on the personal level. For instance, the group of women who underwent separate enlistment report less sexual <b>harassment</b> during their <b>service.</b> The reason for this could be that after having spoken to women with experience of the military, they have more insight into the importance of ”setting boundaries” and ”opportunities to report”, etc. Thus, the question posed at the outset, whether the special enlistment for women provides a better preparation than ”ordinary” enlistment, can be answered in the affirmative. ...|$|R
2500|$|Twitter {{was criticized}} for its {{inability}} to respond quickly and prevent <b>harassment</b> over the <b>service.</b> Within the United States, Twitter and other social media sites are not liable for content posted by third-parties of their service under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (1996), and so have no legal obligation to police malicious content such as harassment and threats. Brianna Wu, shortly after becoming a target of harassment, stated that Twitter facilitated harassment by {{the ease with which}} anyone could make a new account even after having an earlier account blocked, and challenged the service to improve its responsiveness to complaints. Robinson Meyer of The Atlantic said Gamergate is an [...] "identity crisis" [...] for Twitter, and by not dealing with harassing users, the platform is failing to protect victims. Early in the Gamergate controversy, software developer Randi Harper started the [...] "Good Game Auto Blocker" [...] or [...] "ggautoblocker", an expanding list of known Twitter accounts that were tied to the Gamergate hashtag which could be automatically blocked, therefore reducing the degree of harassment received. In November 2014, Twitter announced a collaboration with the non-profit group [...] "Women, Action & the Media" [...] (WAM), in which users of Twitter can report harassment to a tool monitored by WAM members, who would forward affirmed issues to Twitter within 24 hours. The move, while {{in the wake of the}} Gamergate harassment, was due to general issues of the harassment of women on the Internet. In May 2015, WAM reported that of 512 reported harassment instances by the tool during the month of November 2014, 12% of those were tied to the Gamergate controversy based on the ggautoblocker list, with most harassment occurring from single-instance accounts targeting a single person.|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} is significantly {{more common in}} hospitality than in other industries, and has {{a negative impact on}} both individuals and workplaces where it occurs. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission ’s 2001 report on sexual harassment found that 60 % of those harassed subsequently leave their place of work, indicating a significant cause of staff turnover, and a considerable expense to employers. The objectives of this study were therefore to identify the incidence and causes of sexual harassment in hospitality, so recommendations for prevention could be made to industry practitioners. As part of a wider doctoral study, quantitative and qualitative data from 534 Auckland hospitality workers were analysed, and results relating to sexual harassment identified. Of valid responses to questions on the incidence of sexual harassment, 24 % reported they had been harassed, a proportion consistent with that found in Hoel ’s 2002 British doctoral study. Customer contact was identified as a strong predictor of harassment, especially for young European women and those working in food and beverages <b>service.</b> <b>Harassment</b> was notably less prevalent where respondents had their own codes of ethics, and where training was perceived as satisfactory. High tolerance of harassment evident in written comments was associated with enjoyment {{and the nature of the}} industry, implying a sense of duty and behavioural norm extending well beyond limits accepted outside hospitality. Recommendations include the discouragement of behaviours and appearances associated with harassment by guests, such as the use of sexuality in employee – customer relationships. Training employees to reject sexual advances skilfully and professionally is also recommended, as is promoting harassment-free workplaces to both guests and staff using codes of ethics, pamphlets, or posters. However, as the root causes of sexual harassment are may be outside the reach of such prevention strategies, the discussion also addresses the implications of working in commercial hospitality. The tradition of sexual behaviour in hospitality is therefore addressed, and its relationship to the sexual favours provided in pre-Christian taverns, where barmaids were also prostitutes. The study concludes that sexual {{harassment is}} pervasive in hospitality, in part, because it is perceived as integral to the industry by both staff and customers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} researching {{the quality of}} social and health care {{services}} from minority ethnic older persons’ perspective. This was done by identifying {{the dimensions of the}} services where quality was experienced as poorest as well as studying the factors that influenced the experienced quality of the services. The client based quality was analysed as the congruence between the clients’ expectations and perceptions. The information gathered from elderly people belonging to ethnic minorities was compared with data from social and health care service personnel. With the help of the analyses of experienced quality, the study aimed at identifying ways to develop and organise the social and health care services so that they would provide high quality services also for the elderly clients belonging to ethnic minorities. The data of this study consisted of two samples. The service user sample included constructed interviews with 119 Russians, 50 Vietnamese and 126 Sami respondents. The service provider sample consisted of 71 respondents, from whom data were gathered by postal survey with a questionnaire. Both of the samples were analysed by using quantitative, statistical methods. The area where quality was experienced as poorest, both among the service users and service providers, was access to services. The individual aspect that was most connected to the quality experiences of the service users, was the experience of racial <b>harassment</b> in the <b>services.</b> In the service user data, differences in the experienced quality of care were strongly connected to the ethnic group. This was the case partly because the respondents in different ethnic groups had different expectations and perceptions about the services, and partly because they emphasised different aspects of the services as being important to them. The results highlight the importance of equal treatment, cultural sensitivity and the principles and praxis of non-discrimination in the health and social services, in order to guarantee high quality care for all the service users. This forms a challenge {{to be taken into account}} in basic education and in the in-service training of social and health care professionals. Also the service design and culture should be developed towards care based on the individual. In order to provide high quality services for the aged, the unique situation of the individual should always be thoroughly examined and taken into account. This includes also acknowledging the ethnic background of the client. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Sexual {{harassment}} (SH) in {{the hospitality}} industry is prevalent. This study investigates {{the phenomenon of}} sexual harassment of hotel staff by customers in Thailand. There are two main research objectives. The first is to explore the relationship between factors such as age, gender, marital status, and race and how these factors {{are influenced by the}} characteristics of the hotel industry as a service provider. The second is to investigate the perception of hotel staff concerning their sexual harassment experiences, in the following six areas: whether hotel staff consider such experience as sexual harassment; whether male and female staff perceive such experience similarly; the staff's perceived severity of sexual harassment; type of sexual harassment by customer (verbal, physical, visual, or written); how staff react to sexual harassment; how sexual harassment impacts on staff. The research employs a mixed methodology. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted with hotel executives and Human Resource managers in Bangkok, Thailand. Another sixty in-depth interviews were conducted with general hotel staff at a number of different locations throughout Thailand. The in-depth interview data were explored using thematic analysis – as suggested by Creswell’s generic process of qualitative data analysis (2003) and Braun and Clarke (2006) ’s Phases of Thematic Analysis. The last part of the research involved five hundred surveys distributed to hotel staff in eight locations in Thailand and was based upon the thematic analysis of the in-depth interview with hotel executives, Human Resource managers and staff, with reference to the literature. The data from the survey were analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Statistics analysis included descriptive statistics (means and frequencies of answers to each item) and nonparametric tests which were used to examine the relationships between dependent and independent variables. Integration of qualitative and quantitative data was carried out in the discussion chapter. The research reveals that the personal characteristics of hotel staff, as well as the specific hotel job and characteristics of the hospitality environment were contributory causes for sexual harassment. The study results also indicate that sexual harassment is prevalent and severe in the Thai hotel industry. Female staff were more vulnerable to severe physical sexual harassment than their male counterparts. However, both male and female staff were vulnerable to sexual harassment. The research also indicates that although they were {{a small part of the}} data set, homosexual staff were the most vulnerable to sexual harassment. Evidence indicates that staff experienced all forms of harassment (verbal, visual, physical, and written). The physical form was considered the most severe and might trigger a complaint from staff. Written forms of harassment were considered to be the least severe and rarely occurred. Verbal and visual forms were normal and accepted by most staff. Men were more tolerant of sexual harassment than women. Sexual harassment had a range of impacts on staff but most accepted it as part of the job and simply ignored it. Staff employed multiple methods to cope, ranging from ignoring it to informing legal authorities. However, the research indicates that most staff did not complain except in the most severe cases (such as rape). Sexual harassment also impacted on a hotel's image and reputation. It is of note that the research indicates that hotels were not equipped in regards to sexual harassment policies and complaint handling procedures. The study also indicates that some Thai cultural and social issues had played a significant role in the prevalence of sexual harassment. These include the cultural differences (between the Thai workers and the foreign customers), the significant presence of prostitutes, patriarchy and the legal system. This study demonstrates that hotels should consider the need for management commitment, effective sexual harassment policy, good communication, recruitment and training. The research also recommends culture change within the management of the hotel, improvement of physical hotel security and infrastructure as well as government and tourism regulators’ cooperation. Apart from the cultural aspect, sexual harassment theory should incorporate the environment settings into its definition and application. Sexual harassment in the hospitality industry and other service industries has some common elements such as the harasser, the forms of conduct, and the victim. However, each industry may have its own characteristics and settings that facilitate the misconduct. This makes one service industry more susceptible than the others to sexual harassment. Future research should focus on both these common and different elements. The study of sexual <b>harassment</b> in other <b>service</b> industries such as nursing, airlines, health care and so forth is recommended. The study concluded that there were a multiple causes that trigger sexual harassment in hotels and proposes an Integrated Model/Dimension of Customer Sexual Harassment (IMCSH) as a theoretical framework for sexual harassment study in hotels as it is of considerable interest to both academics and practitioners. It gives a new multi-dimension to the interrelationship between sexual harassment and the characteristics of hotel staff, hotel premises, sociocultural characteristics of the country as well as the characteristics of the hospitality itself. This lends itself to further research which will help gain a greater understanding of this interrelationship...|$|R
