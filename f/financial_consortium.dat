The government's stabilization program, which included new exchange controls and the reduction of fuel and export subsidies, was unpopular domestically, but it enabled Ecuador to successfully negotiate a new debt repayment schedule with the International Monetary Fund, which also proved willing to grant Ecuador an additional US$107 million in financial assistance. The government, after several months of negotiation, also concluded multiyear rescheduling agreements with foreign private banks in December 1984 and with the Paris Club (a <b>financial</b> <b>consortium</b> of Western banks and governments) in April 1985. By successfully refinancing nearly all of the public-sector debt, the government narrowly avoided defaulting on payments, and, for the period 1985-89, the external debt service ratio was reduced from 60 percent of export earnings to a manageable 30 percent. From 1985 until the beginning of 1987, Ecuador paid only the interest on its external debt.|$|E

G. Wodehouse (Thompson 143) and on the other a mishmash of popular ethnic, national and regional stereotypes – including those of the Balkans (Todorova 122). It is, however, a far more subtle work than such accounts suggest. Though the influence of Hope and Wodehouse can certainly be seen in the novel’s story of princes in disguise (reminiscent of The Prisoner of Zenda) and a country house setting that would have reminded readers of Blandings, its main plot addresses an important theme –and in exploring it Christie takes the Balkans very seriously. Oil has been found in the Republic of Herzoslovakia and the Foreign Office, represented by George Lomax, has secured the pledge of the exiled Prince Michael Obolovitch “to grant certain oil concessions” to a consortium led by Herman Isaacstein if the Obolovitchs are restored to power. In other words: to secure those concessions the British Government has committed itself to the overthrow of Herzoslovakia’s government. The Foreign Office’s interest in the Balkans might not have surprised Christie’s readers. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had held a monopoly on the extraction, refining and sale of Iranian oil since 1901, and a similar monopoly on reserves in south-eastern Europe would have been welcome at time when large profits were to be made from investment in Romanian oil (Benson 55, 267 - 68; in the years after the War, British investments in the Romanian oil industry were the largest of any foreign country: Hichens 428). However, even so, the idea of financing a coup to secure British interests – though it might have made sense to the Foreign Office and the City – was not one Christie expected her readers to accept...|$|E

5000|$|The {{novel is}} set in London {{at the turn of}} the 20th century and its plot focuses on the machinations and {{developments}} of finance capital, something that is often considered to be unusual for Brecht as his work is traditionally viewed as being based more concerned with conditions of industrial production. The plot is organised around the activities of three different <b>financial</b> <b>consortiums</b> which are taking place in London. Three central characters each take their place with their own strand of the capitalist economy in order to shows ways in which this economy can be seen to effect each individual person in complex and often unpredictable ways. A character named Peachum maintains a syndicate of street beggars whom he ruthlessly exploits, a character named Coax attempts to invest in a commercial shipping venture and Macheath, a gangster, the origin of the infamous song [...] "Mac the Knife", maintains a commercial venture. Macheath is presented in the novel as someone who has left behind his previous life as a cut-throat gangster and instead is now attempting to make serious progress in business by engaging in direct competition and attempting to absorb and defeat his competitors in a commercial sense. As well as depicting Macheath's rise to power, the novel also focuses on the ways in which Macheath is able to court Polly, the daughter of a rich individual known as Peachum. Brecht employs a series of complex plot twists and turns in order to demonstrate Macheath's legitimate rise to power and to show the way in which he is able to do this often with legal sanction. The novel ends with Macheath as someone who restructures his business, takes over his competitors and eventually becomes the head of a large and important bank.|$|R

50|$|The {{renovation}} {{was delayed}} for two reasons. First, occupany rates {{at the hotel}} dropped to lows not seen since World War II. Second, the hotel suffered a debilitating strike. The hotel withdrew from the Hotel Association of Washington, D.C.'s master contract in October 1981, a move which angered the association and signalled management's intent to negotiate a separate contract. The hotel staff union, Local 25 HERE, struck on November 17 when the hotel owners demanded 90 days to review all staff and fire whomever they chose without cause, due process, or notice. Management also sought cuts in pension and health care benefits. Occupancy rates dropped to just 50 percent, 20 percent lower than the city-wide average and well below the break-even point. Third, financing for the hotel purchase and renovation came under fire by labor unions and others in Tennessee. The hotel was purchased with a $9.8 million loan from Security Federal Savings and Loan in Nashville. The single loan represented 60 percent of the commercial loan business of {{the savings and loan}} association (S&L) and its only out-of-state loan—which led to questions about whether undue influence was applied to the S&L to make the loan, and whether it imperiled the S&L's <b>financial</b> stability.

A breach of rules on insolvency was the main reason behind the decision. The administrator of the club, Donald McGruther, admitted his concern after the decision, saying that [...] "In my view, this represents the death knell of Livingston Football Club". Gordon McDougall, a member of the Livingston 5 Consortium stated that [...] "We've got to consider all the options that are open to us - it makes it very, very difficult". It was feared that the club could not survive in the Third Division due to a significant loss of revenue. However, despite the decision and the likely <b>financial</b> impacts, the <b>consortium</b> continued with their bid to take over the club. An appeal was lodged and as a result the club refused to play their opening Division Three fixture against East Stirlingshire on 8 August 2009. Because of this, the club were threatened with a points deduction, but in the event they were given a £3,000 fine for their actions. This was latter overturned on appeal, meaning that the club ultimately escaped any punishment for their boycott of the match. On 7 September 2009 a further appeal to the SFA was dismissed, and the club finally accepted their Third Division fate.|$|R
40|$|Grain legume-cereal {{rotations}} {{are long}} known to farmers in southern Africa, but their productivity and benefits to household food and income security is often compromised by inadequate fertilization. This {{study was conducted}} between 2008 and 2011 in Makoni and Hwedza districts, {{to determine the effects}} of co-applying basal P-containing fertilizers and locally available organic nutrient resources on grain legume productivity, legume - derived soil fertility benefits, subsequent maize yields and financial returns on smallholder farms. The study approach entailed a household and field survey, on-farm field experimentation, laboratory analyses and financial analyses. Amounts of N 2 fixed by grain legumes were determined using the N-difference method while carbon and nitrogen mineralization patterns were quantified by a back titration and leaching tube method, respectively. Financial analyses were done through a gross margin and sensitivity analyses. About 30 % of the farmers practiced disproportionate legume-maize sequencing, but more than 70 % of these farmers did not apply fertilizer to the legume. Legume fertilization with either sole or combinations of cattle manure, woodland litter, Compound D (7 % N, 14 % P 2 O 5, 7 % K 2 O, 6 % S) or PKS blend (0 %N: 32 % P 2 O 5 : 16 % K 2 O: 5 % S) increased biomass productivity by between 20 % and 300 % compared to the non-fertilized control which yielded < 1 t biomass ha- 1. Amounts of N 2 fixed by grain legumes increased by at least 50 % after fertilization ranging from 31 kg N ha- 1 under basal PKS and 161 kg N ha- 1 under organic and inorganic nutrient resource combinations. External nutrient application raised the amounts of N derived from N 2 fixation by grain legumes from 50 % to 94 % of total N taken up by the plant. The increase in amount of mineral N released from soils sampled after legume fertilization, reaching up to 85 mg N kg- 1 soil, reflects significant differences in biological activity of soils under experimental treatments. Cumulative amounts of CO 2 -C evolved from soils following different fertilization regimes increased in the order: continuous fertilized maize < unfertilized grain legume < sole organic-fertilized grain legume sole inorganic- fertilized grain legume < grain legume under inorganic x organic nutrient resource combination. Co-application of an N â€“ containing basal fertilizer with cattle manure onto maize produced grain yields of up to 5 t ha- 1. Sole application of P-containing mineral fertilizers resulted in grain yields of ~ 2 t ha- 1, which were 30 % and 260 % above sole organic nutrient treatments and the unfertilized control, respectively. When fertilizer combinations were applied to a preceding grain legume crop, the rotational maize yielded 2. 9 to 4. 2 t ha- 1. Highest nutrient uptake was recorded after co-application of cattle manure or woodland litter and an NPK compound reaching up to 54. 1 kg N ha- 1 and 23. 8 kg P ha- 1. Recovery efficiencies after fertilized grain legumes ranged between 22 % â€“ 90 % N and 18 % â€“ 53 % P reflecting better nutrient capture under combined application of organic and inorganic nutrient resources. Co-application of N-containing fertilizer with manure gave the highest gross margin of US$ 1433 ha- 1 for the legume â€“ maize sequence. Targeting P- based fertilizers combined with low quality organics to the legume, even under low rainfall conditions, resulted in higher yields and profit margins. After sensitivity analyses, the fertilization strategies which yielded the highest stable profit was PKS + organic and half rate AN under a legume â€“ maize sequence. It was concluded that low P status of soils coupled with non-application of external nutrients accounts for the low yields of < 0. 5 t ha- 1 in smallholder farming areas.
