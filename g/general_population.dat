40|$|AbstractChildren with {{cerebral}} palsy participate less in everyday activities than children in the <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> During adolescence, rapid physical and psychological changes occur which may be more difficult for adolescents with impairments. Within the European SPARCLE project we measured frequency of participation of adolescents with {{cerebral palsy}} by administering the Questionnaire of Young People's Participation to 667 adolescents {{with cerebral palsy}} or their parents from nine European regions and to 4666 adolescents from the corresponding <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Domains and single items were analysed using respectively linear and logistic regression. Adolescents with cerebral palsy spent less time with friends and had less autonomy in their daily life than adolescents in the <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Adolescents with cerebral palsy participated much less in sport but played electronic games at least as often as adolescents in the <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Severity of motor and intellectual impairment {{had a significant impact}} on frequency of participation, the more severely impaired being more disadvantaged. Adolescents with an only slight impairment participated in some domains as often as adolescents in the <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Regional variation existed. For example adolescents with cerebral palsy in central Italy were most disadvantaged according to decisional autonomy, while adolescents with cerebral palsy in east Denmark and northern England played sports as often as their <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Participation is an important health outcome. Personal and environmental predictors of participation of adolescents with cerebral palsy need to be identified in order to design interventions directed to such predictors; and in order to inform the content of services...|$|R

40|$|Posters - Topic 5 : HIV Transmission and Viral Diversity: {{abstract}} P 05. 01 BACKGROUND: Monitoring HIV {{transmission and}} viral diversity has significant impacts on guiding effective vaccine development. Until now, few large-scale studies have investigated HIV infections among the <b>general</b> <b>populations</b> of China. METHODS: 915, 830 and 2, 152, 658 blood samples from various groups {{were collected in}} 2006 - 2007 and 2008 - 2009, respectively, in Fujian, a low prevalent region in China. Comprehensive HIV- 1 epidemiology and molecular epidemiology studies were conducted. RESULTS: Our data revealed a significant rise of the overall prevalence of infections {{within a short time}} period, from 0. 064 % in 2006 - 2007 to 0. 074 % in 2008 - 2009 (p= 0. 003), which resulted in the double numbers of infections from 528 in 2006 - 2007 to 1129 in 2008 - 2009. Critically, the prevalence rate among <b>general</b> <b>populations</b> such as voluntary blood donors, recipients of blood transfusion and people during pre-surgery screening had significantly increased in recent years (p< 0. 001). Besides CRF 01 _AE as the dominant circulating subtype (61 / 86, 70. 9 %), 25 non-CRF 01 _AE strains were found contributing to increased HIV- 1 genetic diversity including C/CRF 07 _BC/CRF 08 _BC (5. 8 %), B/B’ (15. 1 %) and unique recombinant forms (8. 1 %). More than 30 % (26 / 81) of subjects were found to contain various drug resistant mutations. CONCLUSION: The rising epidemic in recent years in Fujian is likely due to the increased prevalence of HIV- 1 infections among <b>general</b> <b>populations</b> and multiple viral subtypes circulating. Our findings will be useful for helping to enhance the current surveillance system and to generate strategic prevention programs targeting <b>general</b> <b>populations</b> in China. Moreover, these results also have implications for AIDS vaccine research. postprin...|$|R
