60|$|Accordingly, {{after breakfast}} next day Mr. Hewson sent for a <b>hackney-coach</b> and they {{drove down to}} the docks.|$|E
60|$|Our {{acquaintance}} with <b>hackney-coach</b> stands is of long standing. We are a walking book of fares, feeling ourselves, half bound, as it were, to be {{always in the}} right on contested points. We know all the regular watermen within three miles of Covent-garden by sight, and should be almost tempted to believe that all the <b>hackney-coach</b> horses in that district knew us by sight too, if one-half of them were not blind. We take great interest in hackney-coaches, but we seldom drive, having a knack of turning ourselves over when we attempt to do so. We are as great friends to horses, <b>hackney-coach</b> and otherwise, as the renowned Mr. Martin, of costermonger notoriety, and yet we never ride. We keep no horse, but a clothes-horse; enjoy no saddle {{so much as a}} saddle of mutton; and, following our own inclinations, have never followed the hounds. Leaving these fleeter means of getting over the ground, or of depositing oneself upon it, to those who like them, by <b>hackney-coach</b> stands we take our stand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And that,' said Mr. Pickwick, laughing, 'will be a {{very long}} time. Sam, call another <b>hackney-coach.</b> Perker, my dear friend, good-bye.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the streets was most desolate: the <b>hackney-coaches,</b> with four horses, strolling about like ghosts, the foot-passengers few but the lowest of the people.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] {{interrupted}} Clara, laughing, [...] "if one {{can believe}} what one reads, {{it applies to}} <b>hackney-coaches,</b> ferry-boats, doctors, lawyers, and even the clergy. My father says it is----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way {{he talks}} he IS a German said the man; {{and in a moment}} Count Otto began his career in America by {{discussing}} the tariff of <b>hackney-coaches</b> {{in the language of the}} fatherland.|$|R
60|$|Running downstairs {{again as}} fast as she had run up, Miss Tox got the party out of the <b>hackney-coach,</b> and soon {{returned}} with it under convoy.|$|E
60|$|It {{was at this}} moment, {{that the}} sound of {{approaching}} wheels was heard, and that the ladies, looking up, saw a <b>hackney-coach</b> stop at the garden gate.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bar {{had hardly}} {{been in the}} chair one second, when whir comes a <b>hackney-coach</b> to the door, from which springs a gentleman in a black coat with a bag.|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later Lebat {{came out of the house}} and walked down the street. Harry {{followed}} him. After walking for some distance Lebat came to a stand of <b>hackney-coaches</b> and spoke to one of the drivers. When he had gone on again Harry went up to the man.|$|R
6000|$|After some brief parley between them--in {{which it}} was charming to hear how my friend Samuel WOULD speak, what he called French, to a lady who could not {{understand}} one syllable of his jargon--the mutual <b>hackney-coaches</b> drew up; Madame la Baronne waved to the Captain a graceful French curtsy. [...] "Adyou!" [...] said Samuel, and waved his lily hand. [...] "Adyou-addimang." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had a long}} chat by {{the fire}} {{before we went to}} bed. I slept in a room on the same floor with my aunt's, and was a little {{disturbed}} {{in the course of the}} night by her knocking at my door as often as she was agitated by a distant sound of <b>hackney-coaches</b> or market-carts, and inquiring, 'if I heard the engines?' But towards morning she slept better, and suffered me to do so too.|$|R
60|$|Time {{performs}} wonders. By {{the powerful}} old gentleman's aid, even a <b>hackney-coach</b> gets {{over half a}} mile of ground. They stopped at length, and Mr. Pickwick alighted at {{the gate of the}} Fleet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Know your place, fellow!' {{cried out}} little Bullingdon indignantly: 'and give {{place to the}} Lord Viscount Bullingdon!' and put himself before the huge person of the new-comer, {{who was about to}} enter the <b>hackney-coach.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'll have a <b>hackney-coach,</b> I suppose?' {{interrupted}} the constable, holding Kit (whom his other captors had released) carelessly by the arm, a little above the elbow. 'Be so good as send for one, will you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Representatives {{themselves}} (as Merlin the Thionviller) who accost him, this puissant Henriot flings into guardhouses. He bursts {{towards the}} Tuileries Committee-room, [...] "to speak with Robespierre:" [...] with difficulty, the Ushers and Tuileries Gendarmes, earnestly pleading and drawing sabre, seize this Henriot; get the Henriot Gendarmes persuaded not to fight; get Robespierre and Company packed into <b>hackney-coaches,</b> sent off under escort, to the Luxembourg and other Prisons. This {{then is the}} end? May not an exhausted Convention adjourn now, for a little repose and sustenance, 'at five o'clock?' ...|$|R
60|$|One o’clock! Parties {{returning}} from the different theatres foot it through the muddy streets; cabs, <b>hackney-coaches,</b> carriages, and theatre omnibuses, roll swiftly by; watermen with dim dirty lanterns in their hands, and large brass plates upon their breasts, who have been shouting and rushing about {{for the last two}} hours, retire to their watering-houses, to solace themselves with the creature comforts of pipes and purl; the half-price pit and box frequenters of the theatres throng to the different houses of refreshment; and chops, kidneys, rabbits, oysters, stout, cigars, and ‘goes’ innumerable, are served up amidst a noise and confusion of smoking, running, knife-clattering, and waiter-chattering, perfectly indescribable.|$|R
60|$|<b>Hackney-coaches</b> and {{carriages}} keep rattling up {{the street}} {{and down the street}} in rapid succession, conveying, doubtless, smartly-dressed coachfuls to crowded parties; loud and repeated double knocks at the house with green blinds, opposite, announce to the whole neighbourhood that there’s one large party in the street at all events; and we saw through the window, and through the fog too, till it grew so thick that we rung for candles, and drew our curtains, pastry-cooks’ men with green boxes on their heads, and rout-furniture-warehouse-carts, with cane seats and French lamps, hurrying to the numerous houses where an annual festival is held in honour of the occasion.|$|R
60|$|Speechless with indignation, Mr. Pickwick {{allowed himself}} to be led by his {{solicitor}} and friends to the door, and there assisted into a <b>hackney-coach,</b> which had been fetched for the purpose, by the ever-watchful Sam Weller.|$|E
60|$|We {{maintain}} that hackney-coaches, properly so called, belong {{solely to the}} metropolis. We may be told, that there are <b>hackney-coach</b> stands in Edinburgh; and not to go quite so far for a contradiction to our position, we may be reminded that Liverpool, Manchester, ‘and other large towns’ (as the Parliamentary phrase goes), have their <b>hackney-coach</b> stands. We readily concede to these places the possession of certain vehicles, which may look almost as dirty, and even go almost as slowly, as London hackney-coaches; but {{that they have the}} slightest claim to compete with the metropolis, either in point of stands, drivers, or cattle, we indignantly deny.|$|E
6000|$|What an {{interesting}} book a <b>hackney-coach</b> might produce, {{if it could}} carry as much in its head {{as it does in}} its body! The autobiography of a broken-down <b>hackney-coach,</b> would surely be as amusing as the autobiography of a broken-down hackneyed dramatist; and it might tell as much of its travels with the pole, as others have of their expeditions to it. How many stories might be related of the different people it had conveyed on matters of business or profit—pleasure or pain! And how many melancholy tales of the same people at different periods! The country-girl—the showy, over-dressed woman—the drunken prostitute! The raw apprentice—the dissipated spendthrift—the thief! ...|$|E
60|$|They made {{a pretty}} wide circuit in {{going back to}} Islington, as they had time to spare, and Tom was never tired of looking about him. It was well he had John Westlock for his companion, for most people would have been weary of his {{perpetual}} stoppages at shop-windows, and his frequent dashes into the crowded carriage-way at the peril of his life, to get the better view of church steeples, and other public buildings. But John was charmed to see him so much interested, and every time Tom {{came back with a}} beaming face from among the wheels of carts and <b>hackney-coaches,</b> wholly unconscious of the personal congratulations addressed to him by the drivers, John seemed to like him better than before.|$|R
60|$|His {{cabriolet}} was gorgeously painted—a bright red; {{and wherever}} we went, City or West End, Paddington or Holloway, North, East, West, or South, {{there was the}} red cab, bumping up against the posts at the street corners, and turning in and out, among <b>hackney-coaches,</b> and drays, and carts, and waggons, and omnibuses, and contriving by some strange means or other, {{to get out of}} places which no other vehicle but the red cab could ever by any possibility have contrived to get into at all. Our fondness for that red cab was unbounded. How we should have liked to have seen it in the circle at Astley’s! Our life upon it, that it should have performed such evolutions as would have put the whole company to shame—Indian chiefs, knights, Swiss peasants, and all.|$|R
60|$|William Congreve’s(58) Pindaric Odes {{are still}} {{to be found in}} Johnson’s Poets, that now unfrequented poets’ corner, in which so many {{forgotten}} bigwigs have a niche—but though he was also voted {{to be one of the}} greatest tragic poets of any day, it was Congreve’s wit and humour which first recommended him to courtly fortune. And it is recorded, that his first play, the Old Bachelor, brought our author to the notice of that great patron of English muses, Charles Montague Lord Halifax, who being desirous to place so eminent a wit in a state of ease and tranquillity, instantly made him one of the Commissioners for licensing <b>hackney-coaches,</b> bestowed on him soon after a place in the Pipe-office, and likewise a post in the Custom-house of the value of 600l.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She came {{in early}} this morning,' cried the girl, {{who was still}} leaning over the railing of the gallery, 'with a gentleman in a <b>hackney-coach,</b> and it's him as wants his boots, and you'd better do 'em, that's all about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} punctual, I see, Jeanie," [...] said the Duke of Argyle, as Archibald opened the carriage-door. [...] "You must be my {{companion}} {{for the rest}} of the way. Archibald will remain here with the <b>hackney-coach</b> till your return." ...|$|E
60|$|Jeanie courtesied reverently and withdrew, {{attended}} by the Duke's gentleman, to her <b>hackney-coach,</b> with a respect which her appearance did not demand, but which was perhaps {{paid to the}} length of the interview with which his master had honoured her.|$|E
60|$|Peffer {{is never}} seen in Cook's Court now. He is not {{expected}} there, for he has been recumbent this {{quarter of a century}} in the churchyard of St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and <b>hackney-coaches</b> roaring past him all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in Cook's Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street, whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he knows from his personal observation next to nothing about it--if Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook's Court, which no law-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he comes invisibly, and no one is the worse or wiser.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were still}} a few <b>hackney-coaches</b> {{accustomed}} to stand about the streets, more truly from habit than for use. I put her in one of these, and entered with her that I might secure her entrance into the hospital. Our way was short, and she said little; except interrupted ejaculations of reproach that he had left her, exclamations on the unkindness {{of some of his}} friends, and hope that she would find him alive. There was a simple, natural earnestness about her that interested me in her fate, especially when she assured me that her husband was the best of men,--had been so, till want of business during these unhappy times had thrown him into bad company. [...] "He could not bear to come home," [...] she said, [...] "only to see our children die. A man cannot have the patience a mother has, with her own flesh and blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Barker had not officiated {{for many}} months in this capacity, when the {{appearance}} of the first omnibus caused the public mind to go in a new direction, and prevented a great many <b>hackney-coaches</b> from going in any direction at all. The genius of Mr. Barker at once perceived the whole extent of the injury that would be eventually inflicted on cab and coach stands, and, by consequence, on watermen also, by the progress of the system of which the first omnibus was a part. He saw, too, the necessity of adopting some more profitable profession; and his active mind at once perceived how much might be done in the way of enticing the youthful and unwary, and shoving the old and helpless, into the wrong buss, and carrying them off, until, reduced to despair, they ransomed themselves by the payment of sixpence a-head, or, to adopt his own figurative expression in all its native beauty, ‘till they was rig’larly done over, and forked out the stumpy.’ ...|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Jerningham {{would have}} been much more {{surprised}} and puzzled if he had waited one minute longer, and seen this Mr. Perkins, who had so gallantly escaladed the <b>hackney-coach,</b> step out of it with the most mortified, miserable, chap-fallen countenance possible.|$|E
60|$|Kate {{would have}} entreated a few minutes' respite, but {{reflecting}} that her uncle might consider {{the payment of}} the <b>hackney-coach</b> fare a sort of bargain for her punctuality, she suffered him to draw her arm through his, and to lead her away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a <b>hackney-coach</b> in waiting, madam," [...] said Mr. Archibald, {{interrupting}} the officious old lady, {{from whom}} Jeanie {{might otherwise have}} {{found it difficult to}} escape; [...] "and, I believe, I must not allow her time for any change of dress." ...|$|E
6000|$|About twelve o'clock, just as {{the bell}} of the packet is tolling a {{farewell}} to London Bridge, and warning off the blackguard-boys with the newspapers, who have been shoving Times, Herald, Penny Paul-Pry, Penny Satirist, Flare-up, and other abominations, into your face--{{just as the}} bell has tolled, and the Jews, strangers, people-taking-leave-of their families, and blackguard-boys aforesaid, are making a rush for the narrow plank which conducts from the paddle-box of the [...] "Emerald" [...] steamboat unto the quay--you perceive, staggering down Thames Street, those two <b>hackney-coaches,</b> {{for the arrival of}} which you have been praying, trembling, hoping, despairing, swearing--sw--, I beg your pardon, I believe the word is not used in polite company--and transpiring, for the last half-hour. Yes, at last, the two coaches draw near, and from thence an awful number of trunks, children, carpet-bags, nursery-maids, hat-boxes, band-boxes, bonnet-boxes, desks, cloaks, and an affectionate wife, are discharged on the quay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cruel miss," [...] said Mr. Guppy, [...] "hear {{but another}} word! I think {{you must have}} seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I waited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I could not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up {{the steps of the}} <b>'ackney-coach.</b> It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was well meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have walked up and down of an evening {{opposite}} Jellyby's house only to look upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to-day, quite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its pretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I speak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my respectful wretchedness. Love was before it, and is before it." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{was still}} worse, the Lambs gave a grand ball, {{to which they}} {{neglected}} to invite any of their old neighbors; {{but they had a}} great deal of genteel company from Theobald's Road, Red Lion Square, and other parts towards the west. There were several beaux of their brother's acquaintance from Gray's Inn Lane and Hatton Garden, and not less than three aldermen's ladies with their daughters. This was not to be forgotten or forgiven. All Little Britain was in an uproar with the smacking of whips, the lashing of in miserable horses, and the rattling and jingling of <b>hackney-coaches.</b> The gossips of the neighborhood might be seen popping their night-caps out at every window, watching the crazy vehicles rumble by; and there was a knot of virulent old cronies that kept a look-out from a house just opposite the retired butcher's and scanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door.|$|R
