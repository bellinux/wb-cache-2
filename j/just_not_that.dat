During this period, Cooper also continued starring in television shows, such as the 2005 sitcom Kitchen Confidential, and played a dual role in a 2006 onstage production of Three Days of Rain. However, the former was cancelled after four episodes due to low ratings. His breakthrough came {{with the role of}} a reckless teacher in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009), which became one of the highest grossing R-rated films of all time. Cooper continued to take on parts in several box office hits, including The A-Team (2010), Limitless, and The Hangover Part II (both in 2011).|$|E

500|$|Parisian fashion house Balenciaga and Revlon {{cosmetics}} signed Connelly as {{the face}} of their 2008 campaigns. Connelly portrayed astrobiologist Helen Benson alongside Keanu Reeves in the 2008 remake of the 1951 science fiction film The Day The Earth Stood Still. Unlike the original movie, in which Benson was a secretary and her relationship with Klaatu was the focus, the remake featured Benson in a troubled relationship with her stepson, portrayed by Jaden Smith. This {{was followed by a}} role in the 2009 romantic comedy He's <b>Just</b> <b>Not</b> <b>That</b> Into You, which also featured Jennifer Aniston and Ginnifer Goodwin. The film was based on the self-help book of the same name. Variety praised her portrayal: [...] "Despite its layer of darkness Connelly gives a really rich performance as a woman whose principles back her into a corner".|$|E
500|$|While Affleck {{intended}} to [...] "keep a primary emphasis on directing" [...] going {{forward in his}} career, he acted in three films in 2009. In the ensemble romantic comedy He's <b>Just</b> <b>Not</b> <b>That</b> Into You, the chemistry between Affleck and Jennifer Aniston was praised. Affleck played a congressman in the political thriller State of Play. Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe found him [...] "very good in the film's silliest role," [...] but David Edelstein of New York Magazine remarked of Affleck: [...] "He might be smart and thoughtful in life [...] as an actor his wheels turn too slowly." [...] He had a supporting role as a bartender in the little-seen comedy film Extract. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described his performance as [...] "a goofball delight", while Manhola Dargis of The New York Times declared it [...] "a real performance". In 2010, Affleck starred in The Company Men as a mid-level sales executive who is made redundant during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. David Denby of The New Yorker declared that Affleck [...] "gives his best performance yet", while Richard Corliss of Time found he [...] "nails Bobby's plunge from hubris to humiliation".|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Cooper hosted Saturday Night Live {{with musical}} guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one skit. Later that year, he {{appeared}} in a supporting role in the film He's <b>Just</b> <b>Not</b> <b>That</b> Into You. Cooper's breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, {{one of the three}} friends—alongside Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis—to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. The Hangover was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. The New York Times A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "Mr. Cooper... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." [...] For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie Awards—Best Comedic Performance. The newspaper The Daily Telegraph opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into [...] "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with Shave: [...] "It's the same.

500|$|The game's trivia {{is based}} on general {{knowledge}} from several fields including science, history, and geography, combined with contemporary entertainment, celebrities, and other news items; the game, {{as well as the}} series, is often described as [...] "high culture meets pop culture". For example, one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons, the answer being [...] "He's <b>Just</b> <b>Not</b> <b>That</b> Into You". In addition to the usual questions, each episode typically features a [...] "Dis or Dat" [...] question. This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications, or in some cases, both. For example, one Dis or Dat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus One phone, Nexxus shampoo, or both. In offline play, only one player participates, while other players try to steal by getting it right if the main player gets it wrong. [...] In online play, all players play the Dis Or Dat simultaneously. Players are also urged to look for the [...] "Wrong Answer of the Game", which is hinted at by the show's sponsor; for example, in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company, the answer [...] "Cat's Cradle" [...] is the Wrong Answer of the Game. Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus. Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts, such as questions based on a fortune cookie message, or ones read through Cookie's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment that may make the question harder to understand.|$|E
