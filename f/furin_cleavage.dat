[...] However, this changed when the quail orthologue of Sulf1, QSulf1, was identified in a screen for Sonic hedgehog (Shh) response genes activated during somite formation in quail embryos. Sequence alignment analysis indicates QSsulf1 is homologous with lysosomal N-acetyl glucosamine sulfatases (G6-sulfatases) that catalyze the hydrolysis of 6-O sulfates from N-acetyl glucosamines of heparan sulfate during the degradation of HSPGs. [...] In contrast to lysosomal active sulfatases, QSulf1 localizes exclusively to the cell surface by interacting hydrophilically with a non-heparan sulfate outer membrane component, and is enzymatically active at a neutral pH. [...] By mutating the catalytically active cysteines to alanine, thereby blocking N-formylglycine formation, they found QSulf1 was responsible for Wingless (Wnt) release from HS chains to activate the Frizzled receptor; this was the first evidence that an extracellular sulf was capable of modifying HS and therefore cell signaling. [...] The overall structure of QSulf is followed closely by its orthologues and paralogues, including human and mouse.

However, not all <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> recognition sites can be described by this pattern and not all R-X-[K/R]-R↓ sites are cleaved by furin. Since many furin substrates are involved in the pathogenesis of viral infection and human diseases, it is important to accurately characterize the <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> site motif. In this study, the <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> site motif was characterized using statistical analysis. The data were interpreted within the 3 D crystal structure of the furin catalytic domain.

Cleavage by a cellular protease at this sequence, Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg, normally follows binding of PA to a cell surface receptor. We attempted to identify this protease by determining its sequence specificity and catalytic properties. Semi-random cassette mutagenesis was used to generate mutants with replacements of residues 164 - 167 by Arg, Lys, Ser, or Asn. Analysis of 19 mutant proteins suggested that lethal factor-dependent toxicity required the sequence Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg. Based on these data, three additional mutants were constructed with the sequences Ala-Lys-Lys-Arg, Arg-Lys-Lys-Ala, and Arg-Ala-Ala-Arg. Of these mutant proteins, Arg-Ala-Ala-Arg was toxic, confirming that the cellular protease can recognize the sequence Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg. The mutant containing the sequence Ala-Lys-Lys-Arg was also toxic but required > 13 times more protein to produce equivalent toxicity. This sequence specificity {{is similar to that}} of the ubiquitous subtilisin-like protease furin, which is involved in processing of precursors of certain receptors and growth factors.

We assayed corresponding channel function as amiloride-sensitive sodium transport (I(Na)). We varied furin-mediated proteolysis by mutating the P 1 site in alpha and/or gamma subunit <b>furin</b> consensus <b>cleavage</b> sites (alpha(mut) and gamma(mut)). Our findings were as follows. (i) The beta subunit alone is not transported to the cell surface nor cleaved upon assembly with the alpha and/or gamma subunits. (ii) The alpha subunit alone (or in combination with beta and/or gamma) is efficiently transported to the cell surface; a surface-expressed 65 -kDa alpha ENaC fragment is undetected in alpha(mut) betagamma, and I(Na) is decreased by 60 %. (iii) The gamma subunit alone does not appear at the cell surface; gamma co-expressed with alpha reaches the surface but is not detectably cleaved; and gamma in alphabetagamma complexes appears mainly as a 76 -kDa species in the surface pool. Although basal I(Na) of alphabetagamma(mut) was similar to alphabetagamma, gamma(mut) was not detectably cleaved at the cell surface. Thus, furin-mediated cleavage is not essential for participation of alpha and gamma in alphabetagamma heteromers. Basal I(Na) is reduced by preventing furin-mediated cleavage of the alpha, but not gamma, subunits.

This unusual cleavage site and efficient propagation of Hendra virus in a furin-deficient cell line indicate that the Hendra F protein is not cleaved by furin, the protease responsible for proteolytic activation of many viral fusion proteins. To identify the subcellular site of Hendra F processing, Vero cells transfected with pCAGGS-Hendra F or pCAGGS-SV 5 F were metabolically labeled and chased in the absence and presence of inhibitors of exocytosis. The addition of carbonyl-cyanide- 3 -chlorophenylhydrazone, monensin, brefeldin A, or NaF-AlCl 3 or incubation of cells at 20 °C all inhibited processing of the Hendra F protein, suggesting that cleavage of Hendra F occurs either in secretory vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi network or at the cell surface. In contrast to proteolytic cleavage of the simian virus 5 (SV 5) F protein by the Ca 2 +-dependent protease <b>furin,</b> proteolytic <b>cleavage</b> of the Hendra F protein was not significantly inhibited by decreases in Ca 2 + levels following incubation with EGTA or A 23187.

The third one (R-Q-P-R) was derived from a recently described trypsin independent HMPV isolate (J. H. Schickli, J. Kaur, N. Ulbrandt, R. R. Spaete, and R. S. Tang, J. Virol. 79 : 10678 - 10689, 2005). To preclude the possibility of conferring even greater virulence to this significant human pathogen, the modifications were done in an HMPV variant that was attenuated by the deletion {{of two of the}} three envelope glycoproteins, SH and G. Each of the introduced cleavage sequences conferred trypsin independent F cleavage and growth to HMPV in vitro. However, they differed in the efficiency of trypsin independent growth and plaque formation in vitro: R-R-R-R > R-K-A-R > R-Q-P-R > R-Q-S-R. The R-R-R-R mutant was the only one whose growth in vitro was not augmented by added trypsin, indicative of highly efficient trypsin independent cleavage. When inoculated intranasally into hamsters, there was essentially no difference in the magnitude of replication in the upper or lower respiratory tract between the mutants, and virus was not detected in organs outside of the respiratory tract. Evaluation of the most cleavage-efficient mutant, R-R-R-R, in African green monkeys showed that there was no detectable change in the magnitude of replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract or in immunogenicity and protective efficacy against HMPV challenge. These results suggest that cleavage activation is not a major determinant of HMPV virulence...|$|R
40|$|The {{coronavirus}} {{spike protein}} (S) {{plays a key role}} in the early steps of viral infection, with the S 1 domain responsible for receptor binding and the S 2 domain mediating membrane fusion. In some cases, the S protein is proteolytically cleaved at the S 1 –S 2 boundary. In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S 2 domain (S 2 ′, R 797). Mutation of R 797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell–cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> site at both the S 2 ′ cleavage site within S 2 793 -KPTKR- 797 (S 2 ′), as well as at the junction of S 1 and S 2. Introduction of a <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> site at the S 2 ′ position allowed trypsin-independent cell–cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> site at the S 1 –S 2 position. Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S 2 ′), acting in concert with the S 1 –S 2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity...|$|E
40|$|Maturation of the {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) involves furin-dependent cleavage at two extracellular sites within the α subunit {{and at a}} single extracellular site within the γ subunit. Channels lacking furin processing of the α subunit have very low activity. We recently identified a prostasin-dependent cleavage site (RKRK 186) in the γ subunit. We also demonstrated that the tract α D 206 -R 231, between the two <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> sites in the α subunit, {{as well as the}} tract γ E 144 -K 186, between the furin and prostasin cleavage sites in the γ subunit, are inhibitory domains. ENaC cleavage by furin, and subsequently by prostasin, leads to a stepwise increase in the open probability of the channel as a result of release of the α and γ subunit inhibitory tracts, respectively. We examined whether release of either theα orγ inhibitory tract has a dominant role in activating the channel. Co-expression of prostasin and either wild type channels or mutant channels lacking <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> of the α subunit (αR 205 A,R 208 A,R 231 Aβγ) in Xenopus laevis oocytes led to increases in whole cell currents to similar levels. In an analogous manner and independent of the proteolytic processing of theα subunit, amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes expressing channels carrying γ subunits with both a mutation in the <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> site and a deletion of the inhibitory tract (αβγR 143 A,ΔE 144 -K 186 and αR 205 A,R 208 A,R 231 AβγR 143 A, ΔE 144 -K 186) were significantly higher than those from oocytes expressing wild type ENaC. When channels lacked the α and γ subunit inhibitory tracts, α subunit cleavage was required for channels to be fully active. Channels lacking both <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> and the inhibitory tract in theγ subunit (αβγR 143 A,ΔE 144 -K 186) showed a significant reduction in the efficacy of block by the syntheticα- 26 inhibitory peptide representing the tract αD 206 -R 231. Our data indicate that removal of the inhibitory tract from the γ subunit, in the absence ofα subunit cleavage, results in nearly full activation of the channel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe fusogenic {{potential}} of Class I viral envelope glycoproteins is activated by proteloytic cleavage of the precursor glycoprotein {{to generate the}} mature receptor-binding and transmembrane fusion subunits. Although the coronavirus (CoV) S glycoproteins share membership in this class of envelope glycoproteins, cleavage to generate the respective S 1 and S 2 subunits appears absent in a subset of CoV species, including that responsible for the {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS). To determine whether proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein might be important for the newly emerged SARS-CoV, we introduced a furin recognition site at single basic residues within the putative S 1 –S 2 junctional region. We show that <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> at the modified R 667 position generates discrete S 1 and S 2 subunits and potentiates membrane fusion activity. This effect on the cell–cell fusion activity by the S glycoprotein is not, however, reflected in the infectivity of pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing the cleaved glycoprotein. The lack of effect of <b>furin</b> <b>cleavage</b> on virion infectivity mirrors that observed in the normally cleaved S glycoprotein of the murine coronavirus and highlights an additional level of complexity in coronavirus entry...|$|E
40|$|Activation of <b>furin</b> {{requires}} autoproteolytic <b>cleavage</b> of its 83 -amino acid propeptide at {{the consensus}} furin site, Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg 107 /. This RER-localized cleavage is necessary, but not sufficient, for enzyme activation. Rather, full activation of furin requires exposure to, and correct routing within, the TGN/endosomal system. Here, we identify {{the steps in}} addition to the initial propeptide cleavage necessary for activation of furin. Exposure of membrane preparations containing an inactive RER-localized soluble furin construct to either: (i) an acidic and calcium-containing environment characteristic of the TGN; or (ii) mild trypsinization at neutral pH, resulted in the activation of the endoprotease. Taken together, these results suggest that the pH drop facilitates the removal of a furin inhibitor. Consistent with these findings, following cleavage in the RER, the furin propeptide remains associated with the enzyme and functions as a potent inhibitor of the endoprotease. Co-immunoprecipitation studies coupled with analysis by mass spectrometry show that release of the propeptide at acidic pH, and hence activation of furin, requires a second cleavage within the autoinhibitory domain at a site containing a P 6 arginine (-Arg 70 -Gly-Val-Thr-Lys-Arg 75 /-). The significance of this cleavage in regulating the compartment-specific activation of furin, and the relationship of the furin activation pathway to those of other serine endoproteases are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco products, both {{combustible}} and smokeless, contain abundant {{amounts of}} toxic chemicals and carcinogens capable of causing extensive damage to the body. Tobacco specific nitrosamines, including 4 -(methylnitrosoamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK) and N’-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), {{are among the most}} potent of these carcinogens and are capable of eliciting cellular transformations within the body after bioactivation by cytochrome P 450 enzymes. In order to reduce the harm associated with smokeless tobacco, a recombinant anti-NNK antibody has been constructed from a hybridoma secreting a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for NNK. In work performed previously, hybridomas were created by constructing a structurally-related benzoyl derivative to facilitate coupling to NNK-carrier proteins, which were then used to immunize BALB/C mice. Splenocytes from mice bearing NNK-specific antibodies were used for hybridoma production and the final product was isolated, characterized and found to secrete a high-affinity anti-NNK monoclonal antibody. In the current study, the heavy and light chain antibody F(ab) fragments were cloned, sequenced and inserted in tandem into an expression vector with an FMDV <b>Furin</b> 2 A <b>cleavage</b> site between them. Expression in HEK 293 cells revealed a functional F(ab) with similar binding features to that of the parent hybridoma. This study lays the groundwork for synthesizing transgenic tobacco that expresses carcinogen-sequestration properties, thereby rendering it less harmful to consumers...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{structure}} and {{expression of the}} Dfur 2 gene of Drosophila melanogaster, which encodes the subtilisin-like serine endoprotease Dfurin 2, was studied. The Dfur 2 gene is very compact {{in contrast to the}} related Dfur 1 gene, which has an estimated size of over 100 kbp. The 6 -kb Dfur 2 mRNA is encoded by 16 exons dispersed over a genomic region of about 9 kbp. The exon/intron organization shows conservation of intron positions not only in comparison with Dfur 1, but also with the related mammalian genes FUR, PC 1 /PC 3, PC 2, and PC 4. This conservation supports the hypothesis that all genes belonging to the family of subtilisin-like pro-protein processing enzymes are evolutionary related by descent from a common ancestral gene. In primer extension experiments, Dfur 2 transcription initiation sites were identified in the presumed Dfur 2 promoter region. This region was found to contain general RNA polymerase II promoter elements like a potential TATA box, a potential CAP signal, and several potential CCAAT boxes. Also, several sequence motifs putatively corresponding to binding sites for Drosophila transcription factors like zeste, bicoid, and engrailed were found to be present. RNA in situ hybridization experiments on Drosophila embryos revealed presumably maternal Dfur 2 expression until the syncytial blastoderm (stage 5 of embryogenesis), no expression during gastrulation (stage 9), transient expression in a subset of neurons in the central nervous system of stage 12 - 13 embryos, and, from stage 13 onwards, expression in the developing tracheal tree. In a vaccinia expression system, the endoprotease Dfurin 2 not only cleaved wild-type precursor of von Willebrand factor (pro-vWF) with pro-region cleavage site R-S-K-R decreases, but also, although to a lesser extent, pro-vWF mutants in which the P 2 (vWFK- 2 A) or P 4 (vWFR- 4 A) basic residue with respect to the pro-region cleavage site had been mutated. This cleavage specificity resembles that of human <b>furin.</b> The <b>cleavage</b> of pro-vWF by Dfurin 2 shows that the previously reported lack of cleavage of the precursor of the beta A-chain of activin-A by Dfurin 2 in this vaccinia expression system is substrate determined. status: publishe...|$|R
