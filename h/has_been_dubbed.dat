5|$|Since the 1970s {{there have}} been various {{initiatives}} to attempt to regenerate Coatbridge. Urban Aid grants, European Union grants and, more recently, Social Inclusion Partnership's have attempted to breathe new life into Coatbridge. Despite these efforts the town's population has continued to fall {{and in recent years}} the town <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> the 'most dismal in Scotland'.|$|E
5|$|Pictish stones {{dating from}} the 6th to 9th centuries {{featuring}} what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> the Pictish Beast may be the earliest representations of a kelpie or kelpie-like creature. Other depictions show kelpies as poolside maidens, as in Draper's 1913 oil on canvas. Thomas Millie Dow had also sketched the kelpie in 1895 as a melancholy dark-haired maiden balanced on a rock, a common depiction for artists of the period. Folklorist Nicola Bown has suggested that painters such as Millie Dow and Draper deliberately ignored earlier accounts of the kelpie and reinvented it by altering its sex and nature.|$|E

It {{is also one}} of the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong Simpsons fans in the area.|$|E
5|$|The World Chess Championship 1972 was a {{match for}} the World Chess Championship between {{challenger}} Bobby Fischer of the United States and defending champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. The match {{took place in the}} Laugardalshöll arena in Reykjavík, Iceland, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> the Match of the Century. Fischer became the first American born in the United States to win the world title, and the second American overall (Wilhelm Steinitz, the first world champion, became a naturalized American citizen in 1888). Fischer's win also ended, for a short time, 24 years of Soviet domination of the World Championship.|$|E
5|$|At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Metternich and his {{conservative}} allies had reestablished the Spanish monarchy under King Ferdinand VII. Over the following forty years, {{the great powers}} supported the Spanish monarchy, but events in 1868 would further test the old system. A revolution in Spain overthrew Queen Isabella II, and the throne remained empty while Isabella lived in sumptuous exile in Paris. The Spanish, looking for a suitable Catholic successor, had offered the post to three European princes, each of whom was rejected by Napoleon III, who served as regional power-broker. Finally, in 1870 the Regency offered the crown to Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a prince of the Catholic cadet Hohenzollern line. The ensuing furor <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> by historians as the Hohenzollern candidature.|$|E

The films were issued both separately and in a three-disc set called The Fantasia Anthology. A variety of bonus features {{were included in the}} bonus disc, The Fantasia Legacy. This edition attempted to follow as closely as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version, and included additional restored live-action footage of Taylor and the orchestra, including the bookends to the film's intermission. In the 2000 and 2010 releases, Deems Taylor's voice <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> throughout by Corey Burton because most of the audio tracks to Taylor's restored scenes have been lost.|$|E

Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews.

The film was originally produced in Spanish, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> for their worldwide fanbase.|$|E
5|$|Dylan's lyrics {{incorporate}} {{a wide range}} of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has also published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that Richard II was deposed in 1399, {{the power of the}} major noble magnates had grown considerably; {{powerful}} rulers such as Henry IV would contain them, but during the minority of Henry VI they controlled the country. The magnates depended upon their income from rent and trade to allow them to maintain groups of paid, armed retainers, often sporting controversial livery, and buy support amongst the wider gentry; this system <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>dubbed</b> bastard feudalism. Their influence was exerted both through the House of Lords at Parliament and through the king's council. The gentry and wealthier townsmen exercised increasing influence through the House of Commons, opposing raising taxes to pay for the French wars. By the 1430s and 1440s the English government was in major financial difficulties, leading to the crisis of 1450 and a popular revolt under the leadership of Jack Cade. Law and order deteriorated, and the crown was unable to intervene in the factional fighting between different nobles and their followers. The resulting Wars of the Roses saw a savage escalation of violence between the noble leaderships of both sides: captured enemies were executed and family lands attainted. By {{the time that}} Henry VII took the throne in 1485, England's governmental and social structures had been substantially weakened, with whole noble lines extinguished.|$|E
