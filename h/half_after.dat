5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} <b>half</b> <b>after</b> emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E

5|$|A {{month and}} a <b>half</b> <b>after</b> Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor PedroI abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom PedroII was a minor, a regency was formed, {{and more than a}} decade of {{instability}} and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the presiganga (prison ship) in which they had been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner Jaguaripe which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. Seeing that the artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few men took a boat to warn the city. They encountered musket fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the next day when three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.|$|E
5|$|Because Miami {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second <b>half.</b> <b>After</b> Miami's kickoff and a touchback, Tech began the first possession {{of the second half}} at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a quick first down off a rush each by Lawrence, Dovel, and Casey. Lawrence picked up another with two rushes that resulted in 13 yards and drove the Hokies to their 44-yard line. There, Casey completed his longest pass of the game — a 42-yard throw to tight end Rob Purdham — that gave Tech a first down at the Miami 14-yard line. Tech continued to drive, picking up short yardage with multiple rushes. The Hokies suffered a near-disaster when Lawrence fumbled the ball, but Tech retained possession when the ball rolled out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays after the fumble, Lawrence vaulted over the goal line for Tech's first and only touchdown of the game. Following the extra point, Tech cut Miami's lead to 1410 with 8:52 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Because Stanford {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech received it to begin the second <b>half.</b> <b>After</b> starting from their 21-yard line, the Hokies went three-and-out. Following a Tech punt, Stanford's first drive {{of the second half}} began at its 41-yard line. Two plays gained 13yards and a first down, then Stanford began battering Virginia Tech with its passing offense. Luck threw four consecutive passes: the first was incomplete, but the next three went for 10, 17, and 18yards, respectively. This gave Stanford a first down at the Tech one-yard line. Three plays later, Owen Marecic crossed the goal line on a running play. The subsequent extra point was missed, and Stanford extended its lead to 19–12 with 8:47 remaining.|$|E
