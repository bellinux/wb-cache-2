40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} osseous, chondral and tendinous lesions {{associated with}} <b>fissures</b> <b>of</b> the posterior labrum. To {{better understand the}} pathological processes leading to <b>fissure</b> <b>of</b> the posterior labrum. Materials and methods. Retrospective study of 43 CT arthrograms performed in 43 patients that showed a <b>fissure</b> <b>of</b> the posterior labrum. The following associated lesions were noted: osseous and chondral remodeling of the humeral head and/or glenoid and articular surface <b>fissures</b> <b>of</b> the rotator cuff. Based on type of associated lesions, patients were separated into one of four pathological subgroups: posterior instability, posterosuperior or internal impingement, anterior instability and isolated <b>fissure</b> <b>of</b> the posterior labrum. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (37. 2 %) of patients showed posterior instability, 12 (27. 9 %) showed lesions of internal impingement, and 11 (25. 6 %) showed lesions of anterior instability. Only 4 patients (9. 3 %) had an isolated <b>fissure</b> <b>of</b> the posterior labrum. CONCLUSION: Posterior instability, internal impingement and anterior instability are the main pathologies leading to <b>fissure</b> <b>of</b> the posterior labrum, which seldom occurs in isolation. Evaluation of these associated lesions allows understanding of the underlying pathological processes leading to <b>fissure</b> <b>of</b> the posterior labrum...|$|R

The replacement <b>of</b> the <b>meniscus</b> permits the arthritic patient to have improved pain relief and knee joint function as well as delay or avoid the time for artificial joint replacement. In a 2 to 7 year follow-up study, 89.4% <b>of</b> <b>meniscus</b> transplantation patients were successful, having shown significant signs of improvement in pain, activity, and functioning. A study on the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>meniscus</b> transplantation in active patients with severe cartilage damage found that the procedure provided significant improvements in pain and function levels for an average of 8.6 years with the majority of patients achieving their goal of participation in sporting activities.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the biomechanical properties <b>of</b> murine <b>meniscus</b> surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) -based nanoindentation {{was performed on the}} central region, proximal side <b>of</b> <b>menisci</b> from 6 - to 24 -week old male C 57 BL/ 6 mice using microspherical tips (R[subscript tip]≈ 5 µm) in PBS. A unique, linear correlation between indentation depth, D, and response force, F, was found on menisci from all age groups. This non-Hertzian behavior is likely due to the dominance of tensile resistance by the collagen fibril bundles on meniscus surface that are mostly aligned along the circumferential direction. The indentation resistance was calculated as both the effective modulus, E[subscript ind], via the isotropic Hertz model, and the effective stiffness, S[subscript ind] = dF/dD. Values of S[subscript ind] and E[subscript ind] were found to depend on indentation rate, suggesting the existence of poro-viscoelasticity. These values do not significantly vary with anatomical sites, lateral versus medial compartments, or mouse age. In addition, E[subscript ind] <b>of</b> <b>meniscus</b> surface (e. g., 6. 1 ± 0. 8 MPa for 12 weeks of age, mean±SEM, n= 13) was found to be significantly higher than those <b>of</b> <b>meniscus</b> surfaces in other species, and of murine articular cartilage surface (1. 4 ± 0. 1 MPa, n= 6). In summary, these results provided the first direct mechanical knowledge <b>of</b> murine knee <b>meniscus</b> tissues.

40|$|Abstract—The {{literature}} {{concerning the}} properties <b>of</b> <b>menisci</b> is briefly reviewed {{and it is}} shown that numerical analysis using computers {{has led to the}} solution of a whole range <b>of</b> <b>meniscus</b> problems. Menisci are classified and their properties defined according to the nature and number of the supporting solid surfaces and of certain shape characteristics. The sizes and shapes of different types <b>of</b> <b>menisci</b> are then obtained by integrating the Laplace—Young equation numerically. The free energy <b>of</b> the whole <b>meniscus</b> system is derived in terms of the surface area and the potential energy in the gravitational field and the equilibrium and stability given in terms of the first and second differential of the free energy with respect to perturbation. Axisymmetric perturbations only are considered as they are those of lowest energy and hence most damaging and the energy profiles <b>of</b> such perturbed <b>menisci</b> have been obtained by numerical analysis. It is shown that when critical stability is reached the size and shape <b>of</b> a given <b>meniscus</b> become unique theoretically determined properties. These critical properties have been extracted from the tables of shape and size. Finally it is shown that a further set of unique properties, but at stable equilibrium, may also be extracted from the table. These unique properties form an excellent set of conditions by which surface tension is measured with great precision...|$|R
