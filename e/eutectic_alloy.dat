25|$|Production of fourrées began {{almost as}} early as the {{production}} of the first coins in Asia Minor in the 7th century BC. These coins were produced by people wishing to profit by producing a counterfeit containing less precious metal content than its purported face value. The most common method for producing a fourrée was to take a flan of copper, wrap it with silver foil, heat it, and strike it with the dies. If the coin was sufficiently heated and struck hard enough, a layer of <b>eutectic</b> <b>alloy</b> (a mixture of 72% silver and 28% copper that has the lowest melting point of any mixture of these two metals) would be produced, fusing the layers together. Sometimes eutectic was sprinkled between the layers to increase the bond. Exposure of the deception was often due to wear at the high points of the coin, or moisture trapped between the layers that caused the foil to bubble and then break as the core corroded.|$|E

The lower lamellar spacing around 100 nm of the eutectics Co 49. 2 Fe 49. 2 Zr 9. 6 yields a high hardness of 713 (+/- 20) VHN. Magnetic measurements reveal high magnetic moment of 1. 92 mu B (at 5 K) and 1. 82 mu B (at 300 K) per formula unit for this composition. The magnetization vs. applied field data at 5 K show a directional preference to some extent and therefore smaller non-collinear magnetization behavior compared to Co 11 Zr 2 reported in the literature due to exchange frustration and transverse spin freezing owing to the presence of smaller Zr content. The decay of magnetization as a function of temperature along the easy axis of magnetization of all the eutectic compositions can be described fairly well by the spin wave excitation equation Delta M/M(0) = BT 3 / 2 + CT 5 / 2.
