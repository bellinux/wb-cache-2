40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new cryptographic tool: multiset hash functions. Unlike standard hash functions which take strings as input, multiset hash functions operate on multisets (or sets). They map multisets of arbitrary finite size to strings (hashes) of fixed length. They are incremental in that, when new members {{are added to the}} multiset, the hash can be updated in time proportional to the change. The functions may be multiset-collision resistant in {{that it is difficult to}} find two multisets which produce the same hash, or just set-collision resistant in that it is difficult to find a set and a multiset which produce the same hash. We demonstrate how set-collision resistant multiset hash functions make an existing offline memory integrity checker secure against active adversaries. We improve on this checker such that it can use smaller time stamps without increasing the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>checks.</b> The improved checker uses multiset-collision resistant multiset hash functions...|$|E

40|$|In ad hoc {{networks}} nodes rely on forwarding packets {{for each}} other. Yet, in large heterogeneous networks {{the willingness of}} all nodes to decently cooperate towards a common goal of effective communication cannot be taken for granted. Malicious nodes can compromise {{the integrity of the}} messages they forward by replacing their contents with unsolicited data (hereinafter referred to as spam) and without any countermeasures such malpractices may disrupt the performance of some of the nodes or even the whole network. This thesis presents a mechanism for detecting and isolating malicious nodes from the network. The decision whether to cease communicating with another node is made individually by every node, thus, no exchange of reputation information is necessary. Firstly, all nodes continuously perform probabilistic verification of the data they relay, removing the spam they find and marking the verified messages that proved to be undistorted with the ’checked ’ flag. The algorithm is designed so that the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> adapts itself to the intensity of the spam received. Secondly, every node gathers during the sampling of its traffic information on the estimated fractions of spam and ’checked ’ messages received from every neighbour. It appears that these two values should be close to each other if only a node adheres to the protocol. Thereby, if a node observes discrepancies between these two values, the node will regard the corresponding neighbour as a spammer and refuse to communicate with it. The divergence between the values that raises the suspicion and the number of data exchanges needed before a node can make a decision on neighbour isolation were set experimentally in order that all visibly malicious nodes are detected and isolated, yet the number of false accusations is minimized.

40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} a topic: "The System of the {{prenatal}} diagnosis of fetal harm" and it's divided to two parts, the theoretical part and the research section. The theoretical part, which is {{the introductory part of}} the thesis, has three main chapters. The first chapter is focused on the prenatal care. This chapter describes the prenatal care in general, who provides that. It is dealt by pregnancy card, which is the essential component of the prenatal care and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>checks.</b> The biggest part of the chapter is devoted to a detailed overview regularly and irregularly, or examination carried out in time. The second chapter is focused on prenatal diagnosis of congenital defects in the fetus and describes individual screening methods of investigation and diagnostic methods of congenital defects in the fetus. At the end of this chapter is a mention of Prenascan. It means new and only diagnostic noninvasive tests for congenital defects in the fetus. The last chapter {{deals with a}} role of the midwives in the prenatal care. In this chapter it doesn't lack the definition of the midwife, the psychological side of the midwife and the relationship midwife and clients. It's important that the interrelationship was based on trust and respect. The end of this chapter is focused on educational activities of midwives. The education has {{an important role in the}} prenatal care. It's very challenging activities from the perspective of midwives, which places demands on knowledge and skills. The midwife educates a pregnant woman about healthy habits, care of herself. It's in connection with prenatal diagnosis of congenital defects in the fetus. The research section focuses on worries of woman, maps quality and satisfaction of woman with the provided information and satisfaction with the attitude of healthy personal. The bachelor's thesis has these goals: The goal 1 - Map methods prenatal diagnosis of fetal harm. The goal 2 Find out what information and approaches consider women as important in the area of prenatal diagnosis, when the screening in I. trimester of pregnancy is positive. Based on the above objectives were determined these research question: The Research question 1 What are women afraid of most? (There are women who have increased risk of birth defects).

In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe <b>checks</b> <b>of</b> rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe <b>checks</b> <b>of</b> veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length <b>of</b> lathe <b>checks</b> for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> lathe <b>checks</b> <b>of</b> the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> lathe <b>check</b> <b>of</b> the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> lathe <b>check</b> in manufacturing rotary cut veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon.

30|$|It {{is worth}} noticing that without {{guarantees}} that any server replying to probing requests {{is the right}} one, collected RTT measurements are useless to location verification process.

One challenge would be an analysis of PDP cost regarding <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> PDP <b>checks.</b> In particular, adequately increasing <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> PDP <b>checks</b> makes it economically unprofitable for a malicious CSP to move data between two PDP checks. Indeed, a malicious CSP, which {{is aware of the}} period between two successive PDP checks, when this period is very high—e.g., more than one month—would be tempted to move data to another location between two PDP checks. Doing so, a malicious CSP would bring back data just when a possession proof is to be built and then it relocates data.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the output {{capacity}} of a piezoelectric pump when transferring gas, this paper presents a compact resonant piezoelectric diaphragm pump (hereinafter {{referred to as the}} piezoelectric diaphragm pump), which is driven by a rectangular piezoelectric vibrator. The compact structure can effectively release the vibrating constraints of the vibrator, and enlarge its center output displacement, so as to increase the volume change rate of the pump chamber. Based on the structure and the working principle of this piezoelectric diaphragm pump, a dynamic model for the diaphragm system is established in this paper, and an analysis on factors affecting the resonant <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the system is then conducted.

No differences were found between both groups in actual reality monitoring ability. Unlike previous studies, the reality monitoring task included actions that were related to the individual concerns of the OCD patients and were ideographically selected. Nevertheless, no differential reality monitoring effect was observed for the anxiety relevant stimuli. Data from the MCQ, however, revealed that OCD patients had less overall confidence in their memory for actions and their reality monitoring ability.

The current study investigated this notion by examining social comparison and perceived peer acceptance on the SN site Facebook, and their relationship with body image, body change strategies and self-esteem. The study used an online survey of 166 males and females aged between 18 and 66.

40|$|Abstract Background Lyme {{disease or}} Lyme borreliosis (LB) {{is the most}} common tick-borne disease both in the United States and Europe. Children, in particular, are at high risk of {{contracting}} LB. Since child-specific educational tools on ticks, tick bites and LB are lacking, we developed an online educational video game. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of an online educational video game versus a newly developed leaflet aimed to improve prevention of tick bites and LB among Dutch schoolchildren. Methods A total of 887 children, aged 9 – 13 years and attending the two final years of primary schooling, were recruited from 25 primary schools in June and July 2012. They were assigned through cluster randomization to one of three intervention groups: ‘game’ (22. 4 %), ‘leaflet’ (35. 6 %) or ‘control’ (41. 9 %). Prior to and directly following intervention, the children were asked to complete a short questionnaire. The main outcome measures were knowledge, perception (perceived susceptibility and importance) and preventive behavior in relation to tick bites and LB. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze the data. Results In the game group, the leaflet group and the control group, knowledge about ticks and tick bites improved significantly. The game was also an effective tool for improving preventive behavior; the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> for ticks increased significantly. However, {{there were no significant differences}} in knowledge improvement between the interventions. The game outperformed the leaflet in terms of improving preventive behavior, whereas the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> tick <b>checks</b> increased significantly. But this frequency didn’t increase more than in the control group. Conclusions The positive knowledge effects observed in the control group suggests the presence of a mere measurement effect related to completion of the questionnaire. The game did not outperform the leaflet or control group on all outcome measures. Therefore, the game may be of value as a complementary role, in addition to other media, in child-specific public health education programs on ticks and LB.

Body checking and body avoidance were significantly correlated with mental and physical quality of life, as well as with eating disturbances. <b>Frequency</b> <b>of</b> body <b>checking</b> significantly predicted impairment in mental quality <b>of</b> life, and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> body avoidance significantly predicted impairment in physical quality of life, over and above the contributions of depressive symptoms and related demographic characteristics. Targeting checking and avoidance in prevention and treatment programs may improve quality of life and reduce health-related functional impairment. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Content Addressable Memories (CAM) {{are widely}} used for the tag {{portions}} in highly associative caches. Since data are not explicitly read out of tag array in CAM search, the detection of false misses caused by soft errors for such caches, is difcult. This paper presents a technique to de-tect the false miss in highly associative cache with CAM-based tag. The technique involves subdividing the tags and providing backup checking for cases the tags are partially matched. An original tag encoding scheme is proposed to reduce the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> back-up <b>checking.</b> Modications to support the technique do not increase the cache access la-tency. The performance degradation incurred by additional cycles for false miss checking is very low. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is to show the {{susceptibility}} of students and staff of Hwa Chong Junior College to contracting SARS in the school compound. This is done by simulating the spreading of infection in the school compound using a computer programme called Axon Idea Processor. The simulation is loosely based on existing infection models, but the results are different in that they show how the extent of infection {{is affected by the}} <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> temperature <b>checks</b> (speediness <b>of</b> detection) and the degree and duration of contact between people in the school. In conclusion, the simulation results are useful for the planning and designing of schools in future, such that minimal spreading of viruses occur...|$|R
