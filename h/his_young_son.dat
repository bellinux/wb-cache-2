5|$|King Stanisław August's {{acquiescence}} to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On February 29, 1768, several magnatesincluding Józef Pułaski and <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son</b> Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing {{to oppose}} Russian influence, declared Stanisław August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, {{and formed a}} confederation at the town of Bar. The Bar Confederation focused on limiting the influence of foreigners in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to religious tolerance. It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were overwhelmed by Russian intervention in 1772.|$|E

5|$|Rebellions {{broke out}} in France and Anjou between 1111 and 1113, and Henry crossed into Normandy to support his nephew, Count Theobald of Blois, who had sided against Louis in the uprising. In a bid to diplomatically isolate the French King, Henry betrothed <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son,</b> William Adelin, to Fulk's {{daughter}} Matilda, and married his illegitimate daughter Matilda to Conan III, the Duke of Brittany, creating alliances with Anjou and Brittany respectively. Louis backed down and in March 1113 met with Henry near Gisors to agree a peace settlement, giving Henry the disputed fortresses and confirming Henry's overlordship of Maine, Bellême and Brittany.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{was awarded}} a {{testimonial}} match by the club, against Scottish-side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable {{to play in the}} whole match; however he kicked-off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty, winning the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son</b> notably covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute.|$|E
5|$|By 622, Heraclius {{was ready}} to mount a counter-offensive. He left Constantinople the day after celebrating Easter on Sunday, 4 April 622. <b>His</b> <b>young</b> <b>son,</b> Heraclius Constantine, was left behind as regent under the charge of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. He spent the summer {{training}} to improve the skills of his men and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia. This forced the Persian forces in Anatolia under Shahrbaraz to retreat from the front-lines of Bithynia and Galatia to eastern Anatolia in order to block his access to Persia.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, the Despensers were {{increasingly}} using Caerphilly Castle as their main {{residence in the}} region rather than Cardiff. Thomas le Despenser was executed in 1400 on charges of conspiring against Henry IV. In 1401 rebellion broke out in North Wales {{under the leadership of}} Owain Glyndŵr, quickly spreading across the rest of the country. In 1404 Cardiff and the castle were taken by the rebels, causing considerable damage to the Black Tower and the southern gatehouse in the process. On Thomas's death the castle passed first to <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son,</b> Richard, and on his death in 1414, through his daughter Isabel to the Beauchamp family. Isabel first married Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Worcester and then, on his death, to his cousin Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Warwick, in 1423.|$|E
5|$|Edward IV died in 1483, {{leaving the}} kingdom to <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son,</b> Edward V, but his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{had his own}} ambitions for the throne. Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the {{deposition}} of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, ahead of his own coronation. Kirby Muxloe and Lord Hastings' other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine. After a short pause, Katherine continued some work on the site until the summer of 1484, focusing on making the corner tower and partially finished gatehouse habitable, before the project was finally halted. By this point around £1,000 had been spent on the works, including the laying of 1.3 million bricks.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>young</b> <b>son</b> came to {{the throne}} as James III, {{resulting}} in another minority, with Robert, Lord Boyd emerging {{as the most important}} figure. In 1468 James married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. In 1469 the King asserted his control, executing members of the Boyd family and his brothers, Alexander, Duke of Albany and John, Earl of Mar, resulting in Albany leading an English backed invasion and becoming effective ruler. The English retreated, having taken Berwick for the last time in 1482, and James was able to regain power. However, the King managed to alienate the barons, former supporters, his wife and his son James. He was defeated at the Battle of Sauchieburn and killed in 1488.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} no major hostility {{as a result of}} the {{division}} of loyalty between the royalty and the nobility. In the same year, an English merchant, W.H. Read, controlled Sultan Ali's royal seal in exchange for a promise to liquidate his debts. Read had been an active supporter of Sultan Ali's claims for recognition as the legitimate ruler of Johor and the state's revenue, with the Temenggong as his vassal. As a result of economic and political pressure from these traders, the Governor did consider granting a formal recognition to Sultan Ali as the legitimate ruler of Johor, but in the process, he received a strong protest from the Temenggong and <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son,</b> Abu Bakar.|$|E
5|$|The travel writer Paul Theroux {{mentions}} the dinosaurs in his 1989 novel My Secret History. The novel's narrator, Andre Parent, accidentally learns of his wife's infidelity when <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son,</b> Jack, reveals {{that he has}} visited the dinosaurs {{in the company of}} his mother's 'friend' during Andre's prolonged absence gathering material for a travel book. The title story in Penelope Lively's 1991 novel Fanny and the Monsters is about a Victorian girl who visits the Crystal Palace dinosaurs and becomes fascinated by prehistoric creatures. The Lie Tree, a 2015 children's mystery-fantasy by Frances Hardinge features a dream scene with some of the dinosaur models coming to life.|$|E
5|$|Thomas's fleet {{arrived at}} the capital first. Facing no {{opposition}} from the Imperial Fleet, the rebels broke or unfastened the chain and entered the Golden Horn, taking station near the mouths of the Barbysos river, where they awaited the arrival of Thomas and his army. Thomas arrived in early December. The sight of his huge force did not cow the capital's inhabitants: unlike the provinces, the capital's citizens and garrison stood firmly behind Michael. To further encourage his troops, Michael had <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son</b> Theophilos lead a procession along the walls, carrying {{a piece of the}} True Cross and the mantle of the Virgin Mary, while a large standard was hoisted on top of the Church of St. Mary at Blachernae, in full view of both armies.|$|E

5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son</b> the goals of breaking those records.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} that the Queen might be barren, Henry and Eleanor had five children together. In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child, Edward, named after the Confessor. Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations, giving lavishly to the Church and to the poor to encourage God to protect <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son.</b> Their first daughter, Margaret, named after Eleanor's sister, followed in 1240, her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to the poor. Henry's third child, Beatrice, was named after his mother-in-law, and born in 1242 during a campaign in Poitou. Their fourth child, Edmund, arrived in 1245 and was named after the 9th-century saint: concerned about Eleanor's health, Henry donated {{large amounts of money}} to the Church throughout the pregnancy. A third daughter, Katherine, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a degenerative disorder such as Rett syndrome, and was unable to speak. She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught. Henry's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.|$|E
5|$|King John {{granted the}} lordship of Westmoreland, {{including}} Brough, to Robert de Vieuxpont in 1203. Robert enlarged the castle {{in order to}} exert his authority over the region, where he was competing for control {{with other members of}} his extended family. In 1206, King John briefly entrusted his captive niece Eleanor to the custody of Robert. Robert died in 1228, leaving substantial debts of £2,000 to the Crown and passing the castle to <b>his</b> <b>young</b> <b>son,</b> John. His son's guardian, Hubert de Burgh appointed the Prior of Carlisle to run the estate and the castle was left to fall into ruin. John died supporting the rebels during the Second Barons' War between 1264 and 1267 and his lands were divided between his two daughters, Isabel and Idonea. Isabel de Vieuxpont inherited Brough and the eastern Vieuxpont estates; Henry III gave guardianship of some of these lands to Roger de Clifford; Roger then married Isabel, acquiring all her lands and beginning a long period of Clifford control of the castle.|$|E
