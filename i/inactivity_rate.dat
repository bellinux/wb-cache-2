30|$|Part of the {{differences}} in the youth-adult (long-term) unemployment risk {{can be explained by the}} higher job mobility and the higher likelihood to enter inactivity among youth. As depicted in columns (5) and (6) of Table 1, the <b>inactivity</b> <b>rate</b> 3 among youth ranges between below 30 % (Netherlands, Switzerland and Iceland) and 70 % (Greece, Hungary, Luxemburg and Italy). On average, they are hence about four times more likely to be inactive than adults. While part of this higher inactivity is driven by entry into formal education – note that countries with an extensive apprenticeship-based secondary education system in which youth are counted as working, such as Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, exhibit a much lower <b>inactivity</b> <b>rate</b> – youth are generally also less attached to the labor market, and hence more likely to withdraw from labor force. An indicator capturing the size of this risk group is the share of youth neither in education nor in employment (NEET). Column (7) shows that about one third of countries exhibit NEET shares above 20 % among the age group of 20 to 24 -year-olds, with the Southern European countries (Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece), some Eastern European countries (Poland, Slovak Republic and Hungary) and Ireland being affected most heavily.|$|E

Raising the ERA {{has the potential to}} extend contribution periods and {{to reduce the number of}} pension beneficiaries at the same time, if employment exits are successfully delayed. However, workers may not be able to work longer or may choose other social support programs as exit routes from employment. We study the effects of the ERA increase on employment and potential program substitution in a regression-discontinuity framework. Germany abolished an important early retirement program for women born after 1951, effectively raising the ERA for women by three years. We analyze the effects of this huge increase on employment, unemployment, disability pensions, and <b>inactivity</b> <b>rates.</b> Our results suggest that the reform increased both employment and unemployment rates of women age 60 and over.

Despite their importance, however, their contribution to human health has not been properly quantified. This paper seeks to evaluate quantitatively how national/state parks and recreational waters are associated with human health and well-being, taking into account of the spatial dependence of environmental variables for the contiguous U. S., at the county level. First, we describe available natural resources for outdoor activities (ANROA), using national databases that include features from the Protected Areas Database, NAVSTREETS, and ATTAINSGEO 305 (b) Waters. We then use spatial regression techniques to explore the association of ANROA and socioeconomic status factors on physical inactivity rates. Finally, we use variance analysis to analyze ANROA’s influence on income-related health inequality. We found a significantly negative association between ANROA {{and the rate of}} physical inactivity: ANROA and the spatial effect explained 69 %, nationwide, of the variation in physical inactivity. Physical <b>inactivity</b> <b>rate</b> showed a strong spatial dependence—influenced not only by its own in-county ANROA, but also by that of its neighbors ANROA.

This is particularly the case for women, since the economic <b>inactivity</b> <b>rate</b> for is around 30 per cent compared to 44 % for female migrants from other European countries. Drinkwater and Robinson (2011) find that a relatively high percentage of migrants from other European countries (including people born in EaP countries) claim benefits in the UK, especially in comparison to people born in the EUA 8 and EU 14. This is true for both men and women, with relatively high levels of income support and sickness/disability claims observed for both sexes. This could be the result of higher levels of discouraged workers following job displacement, whilst the relatively low percentage of benefit claimants amongst EUA 8 migrants is likely to have been influenced by the restrictions on access to benefits in the UK by this group following EU enlargement. Drinkwater and Robinson (2011) report that whilst social assistance claims initially increase with years since migration they do so at a decreasing rate and there is a varying impact for different migrant groups in the UK. The turning point for the effect of years since migration on social assistance claims is highest for EU 14 migrants (29  years in the UK) and amongst the lowest for Other European migrants (9  years in the UK). This is likely to reflect a higher incidence of social assistance claims due to ageing for EU 14 migrants, whilst for Other Europeans it may reflect a different mix of origin countries across migrant cohorts.|$|E

The main factors behind this decline in equilibrium unemployment stem from actions taken by the previous government.

Underlying this favourable aggregate labour-market performance are serious problems facing unskilled men who have seen dramatic increases in their unemployment and <b>inactivity</b> <b>rates,</b> concentrated particularly in Wales and the northern regions of Britain. The policy response since 1997 has focused on encouraging the unskilled into work (the New Deal) while simultaneously raising the rewards for working (the minimum wage, tax credits).
