40|$|A {{heterodyne}} receiver for laser communication is described {{which includes a}} front end having a cooled photomixer contained in a hermetically sealed spaced quality housing designed for wide bandwidth transmission. The photomixer is coupled through a wideband preamplifier to the receiver back end which includes a frequency tracking network and <b>demodulating</b> <b>equipment.</b> The receiver is capable of tracking a Doppler frequency shift of 750 MHz, positive or negative, and has an instantaneous intermediate frequency information bandwidth of 400 MHz. The receiver system is also capable of operating over a wide temperature range and {{is designed to be}} suitable for use in outer space communication...|$|E
40|$|The Data Collection System flown on {{the first}} Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS- 1) relays earth {{resources}} data from remotely located in-situ sensors to Goddard Space Flight Center. Data is received at Goddard at least twice each day from every sensor installation and is distributed to users (who operate the sensors and transmitters) by mail and teletype. The system consists of a data formatting and transmitting unit, called the Data Collection Platform (DCP), a receiver and a retransmitter aboard ERTS- 1; and receiving, <b>demodulating</b> and decoding <b>equipment</b> located at the Goldstone, California and Goddard data acquisition stations. Data is transmitted from the data acquisition stations to the ERTS Control Center at Goddard, then to the NASA (ERTS) Data Processing Facility (NDPF) where it is processed and distributed to users. Experience to date indicates that {{the design of the}} ERTS- 1 Data Collection System is adequate for operational use for 50 % of the users and, with minor modifications, could meet the requirements of 75 %. Some users will have to augment the system by other data collection techniques to meet their operational requirements...|$|R
