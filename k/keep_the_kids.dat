[...] Julene Snyder of Sonicnet wrote that [...] "Aguilera has an instinctive grasp of the insipid state of the pop/ dance music scene, especially {{as it relates to}} her peers."

5000|$|Sky Kid is a {{two-dimensional}} scrolling shooter game. The players {{take control of}} <b>the</b> Sky <b>Kids,</b> [...] "Red Baron" [...] and [...] "Blue Max", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite informally known as Blue Max. <b>The</b> Sky <b>Kids</b> fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. The [...] "A" [...] button is used to control the plane's machine gun and the [...] "B" [...] button is used to perform a loop. A number of obstacles face the players in each level. First, their biplane is not equipped with a bomb to complete their mission and must be picked up {{en route to the}} target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Sky <b>Kids</b> from accomplishing their mission. Last, <b>the</b> Sky <b>Kids</b> may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities {{in order to get to}} the target. The targets which <b>the</b> Sky <b>Kids</b> must bomb will either be fortress complexes, or ships. As the players advance further up in the 21 missions, multiple targets will begin to appear in the course of one mission. Players receive points for destroying air and ground targets, and receive additional points at the end of the mission for how many of these types of targets are destroyed. In addition, players get points based on how much of the target is destroyed - but only total destruction warrants an end-of-mission bonus.|$|R

50|$|In {{the game}} Bastion, <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> actions are narrated {{by one of}} the other {{character}}s, Rucks, as he tells <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> story to another character while <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> is in <b>the</b> final area. Because Rucks never learns about <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> actions explicitly, <b>the</b> narration is mostly anecdotal and primarily serves to fill in background information about each level; however, it also serves to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> fourth wall intact, as player deaths are portrayed as jokes on the narrator's part. After the player's actions catch up to the story, the narration switches to a more speculative tone, as Rucks no longer knows what the player is doing.|$|R
