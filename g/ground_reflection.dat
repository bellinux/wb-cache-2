5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the <b>ground</b> <b>reflection,</b> and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
25|$|Clutter {{may also}} {{originate}} from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by <b>ground</b> <b>reflection,</b> atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection/refraction (e.g., anomalous propagation). This clutter type is especially bothersome since {{it appears to}} move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below, appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it {{on the basis of}} jitter or a physical impossibility. Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward. These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} is to simply lay the speaker on its back pointing at the sky on open grass. <b>Ground</b> <b>reflection</b> will still interfere, but will be greatly reduced in the mid-range because most speakers are directional, and only radiate very low frequencies backwards. Putting absorbent material around the speaker will reduce mid-range ripple by absorbing rear radiation. At low frequencies, the <b>ground</b> <b>reflection</b> is always in-phase, so that the measured response will have increased bass, {{but this is what}} generally happens in a room anyway, where the rear wall and the floor both provide a similar effect. There is a good case therefore using such ‘half-space’ measurements, and aiming for a flat ‘half-space’ response. Speakers that are equalised to give a flat ‘free-space’ response, will always sound very bass-heavy indoors, which is why monitor speakers tend to incorporate ‘half-space’, and ‘quarter-space’ (for corner use) settings which bring in attenuation below about 400 Hz.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>reflection</b> of an {{airborne}} lidar gives {{a measure}} of surface reflectivity (assuming the atmospheric transmittance is well known) at the lidar wavelength. However, the <b>ground</b> <b>reflection</b> is typically used for making absorption measurements of the atmosphere. [...] "Differential absorption lidar" [...] (DIAL) measurements utilize two or more closely spaced (<1 nm) wavelengths to factor out surface reflectivity {{as well as other}} transmission losses, since these factors are relatively insensitive to wavelength. When tuned to the appropriate absorption lines of a particular gas, DIAL measurements can be used to determine the concentration (mixing ratio) of that particular gas in the atmosphere. This is referred to as an Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) approach, since it is {{a measure of}} the integrated absorption along the entire lidar path. IPDA lidars can be either pulsed or CW and typically use two or more wavelengths. IPDA lidars have been used for remote sensing of carbon dioxide [...] and methane.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} maximum {{achievable}} rate of a two-hop amplified-and-forward (AF) relaying millimeter-wave (mm-wave) system, where two AF relaying schemes, i. e., half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) are discussed. By considering the two-ray mm-wave channel and the Gaussian-type directional antenna, jointly, {{the impacts of}} the beamwidth and the self-interference coefficient on maximum achievable rates are investigated. Results show that, under a sum-power constraint, the rate of FD-AF mm-wave relaying outperforms its HD counterpart only when antennas with narrower beamwidth and smaller self-interference coefficient are applied. However, when the sum-power budget is sufficiently high or the beamwidth of directional antenna is sufficiently small, direct transmission becomes the best strategy, rather than the AF relaying schemes. For both relaying schemes, we show that the rates of both AF relaying schemes scale as O(θ_m^- 1,θ_m^- 2) with respect to beamwidth θ_ m, {{and the rate of}} FD-AF relaying scales as O(μ^- 1 / 2) with respect to self-interference coefficient μ. Besides, we show that, <b>ground</b> <b>reflections</b> may significantly affect the performance of mm-wave communications, constructively or destructively. Thus, the impact of <b>ground</b> <b>reflections</b> deserves careful considerations for analyzing or designing future mm-wave wireless networks.

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the original AI radars was that the transmissions spread out over the entire front hemisphere of the aircraft. Shorter wavelengths, like those used in AI, tended to scatter from the ground, sending {{a portion of the}} signal back towards the aircraft, the <b>ground</b> <b>reflection.</b> For the simple reason that the ground is much larger than a target aircraft, the scattered signal overwhelmed any target return, and made it impossible to see any target further away than the aircraft's current altitude.|$|E

With shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), this is generally the case.|$|E
