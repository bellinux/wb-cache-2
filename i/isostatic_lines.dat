It is by means of the comparison NatHaz online database and numerical simulation research of wind flow repercussion in buildings, through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CDF), that we can understand and analyse the grid envelope structures in tall buildings.

This study compares flat lattice girders {{mounted on}} two supports, based on various design parameters, to {{determine}} which have better structural performance and what geometries are more efficient. The fundamental goal {{is to determine the}} relationship of performance and structural behaviour of each type of framework structure, with respect to the principle of optimization and improvement in the efficiency of the trusses if their geometry adapts to the directions of the principal stresses and, of course, to the trajectory of the <b>isostatic</b> <b>lines</b> of the equivalent continuous structural resistant element under the loading actions. In this study, 256 models of lattice girders, with different triangulations, are analyzed to determine their performance and structural behaviour. The results conclude that the trusses gain up to 25 - 35 % efficiency when they identify the trajectory of the <b>isostatic</b> <b>lines</b> generates by the acting loads...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} if steel space grid envelope for tall buildings are more optimal and efficient if their design is based on the <b>isostatic</b> <b>lines</b> of their structural elements. The methodology used is the dynamic response analysis of 540 models of tall buildings using the Equivalent Static Wind Loads (ESWL) method. It is necessary to determine the dynamic wind loads that influence buildings, RMS (root-mean-square) moment coefficients and spectra of along-wind, across-wind and torsional moments. To do this, 5 rigid models of tall buildings in the wind tunnel are made in order to compare them with the results of the NatHaz online database. The results conclude that space grids are more optimal if they do adopt the trajectory of the dominant load, in this case the wind. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} article {{demonstrates the}} application of PhotoStressR method in stress analysis of a rotating disc of a constant thickness, which was made of a photoelastic material PS- 1 A. Isoclinic fringes were observed on the rotating disc using linear polarized light at revolutions 5 000 RPM. Observations were carried out under angle parameter 0 o to 90 o with 10 o increase. A set of <b>isostatic</b> <b>lines</b> of I and II set was made from the set of obtained isoclinic lines. During gradual increase of rotations of the rotating disc up to 17 000 RPM, and with circular polarized light, we observed the distribution of colourful isochromatic fringes on the rotating disc.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} {{in the use of}} steel space grids as structural envelope elements for tall buildings leads structural concept to gain relevance in the design and aesthetics of the building. Therefore, to speak of a sensible architectural solution thereof, it is necessary the existence of a direct relationship between both concepts; architectural design and structural analysis. Given the current situation, it is necessary to develop a methodology to work and to analyze through a proper structural approach that allows solving the common problems that usually arise in the design and analysis of these structures. It is therefore necessary to address design issues as to produce a more optimal and efficient structural geometry, while providing a response to formal questions of the building. The overall aim is to project, understanding the structure as the core, steel space grid envelope structures for tall buildings to obtain resistant forms which are more optimal and efficient. In this line, it is essential to analyze the trajectory of the <b>isostatic</b> <b>lines</b> according to the loads acting on the buildings so as to obtain their simplified structural geometries. The efficiency of these geometries is compared with the basic or initial geometries (traditional standard), to determine which are most optimal. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an initial study line of the optimization of steel space grid envelope structures for tall buildings of circular base. Given the characteristics of this type of geometry or “bluff-bodies” (not aerodynamic) wind tunnel studies are necessary to determine the forces and moments produced by the influence of wind turbulent flow, for large numbers of Reynolds, which are typical of the tall buildings proposed. In this work we develop wind tunnel tests for three different models, scale 1 / 400, of tall buildings of circular base to determine the influence of the wind flow around these buildings. Once the tests are conducted the structural models are analyzed in order to compare the results with their initial geometries. The first analysis results obtained from tall buildings of circular base show that the geometries obtained using the design methodology proposed offer an improved structural performance and therefore greater efficiency, in comparison with the basic geometries, or initials.
