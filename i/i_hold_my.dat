She left a ring {{for him at the}} hotel, with a note asking for a new promise of love. He gave it, and {{described}} how he began wearing the ring on his left hand, [...] "with which <b>I</b> <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> paper, so that the thought of you clasps me tight." [...] At this time he began working on a philosophical novel, Séraphîta, about a hermaphroditic angel united by the love of a mortal man for a compassionate and sensual woman. Balzac explained that she was his model for the latter. It was clear to all that Hański was in ill health, and Hańska began to think about her future with the French author. In the meantime, she asked Balzac to begin collecting for her autographs of the famous people he spent time with in Paris and elsewhere.|$|E

[...] He considered an educated, professional ministry to be a form of Anti-Christ, a view also shared by both Dell and Erbury. [...] He wrote in New Englands Memoriall (1669): [...] "I would have you know that <b>I</b> <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> call to preach... not inferior to the call of any minister in the country." ...|$|E
