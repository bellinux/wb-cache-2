5|$|Further {{material}} was {{gleaned from the}} De honesta disciplina of 1504 by Petrus Crinitus, which included extracts from Michael Psellos's De daemonibus, and the De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum (Concerning the mysteries of Egypt…), a book on Chaldean and Assyrian magic by Iamblichus, a 4th-century Neo-Platonist. Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) {{in his first two}} verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> all of the occult works in his library, no one can say exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.|$|E
5|$|On November 25, 1999, {{the date}} that Bonfire would <b>have</b> <b>burned,</b> Aggies instead held a vigil and remembrance ceremony. Over 40,000people lit candles and {{observed}} {{up to two}} hours of silence {{at the site of}} the collapse, before walking to Kyle Field for yell practice. At the stadium, fans spontaneously relit their candles as the Parsons Mounted Cavalry fired the Aggie cannon twelve times, once for each victim. Former President George H. W. Bush, his wife Barbara, Texas Governor George W. Bush, and his wife Laura attended the remembrance ceremony.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two aspects}} to {{the harmful effects}} of plutonium: the {{radioactivity}} and the heavy metal poison effects. Isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in bone marrow. Contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents, including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons <b>have</b> <b>burned.</b> Studies of the effects of these smaller releases, {{as well as of the}} widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have provided considerable information regarding the dangers, symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning, which in the case of the Japanese Hibakusha/survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea was}} taken up again {{in the search for}} solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun {{produced}} neutrinos in the course of nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the proton–proton chain reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N. Bahcall detected solar neutrinos in the Homestake Experiment, for which Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, but the number of neutrinos detected was between one third and one half of the predicted number. This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time scientists contemplated the awful possibility that the Sun might <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> out.|$|E

50|$|Even a {{broadcast}} slash {{fire in a}} clearcut does not give a uniform burn over the whole area. Tarrant (1954), for instance, found only 4% of a 140-ha slash <b>burn</b> <b>had</b> <b>burned</b> severely, 47% <b>had</b> <b>burned</b> lightly, and 49% was unburned. Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.|$|R

25|$|In modern history, {{fires are}} known to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> the Big Sur area {{multiple}} times. In 1885, 1894, and 1898 fires burned without any effort by the few local residents to put them out, except to save their buildings. In 1903, a fire burned for three months, {{the result of an}} unextinguished campfire. In 1906, a fire that began in Palo Colorado Canyon from the embers of a campfire burned for 35 days, scorching an estimated , and was finally extinguished by the first rainfall of the season.|$|E
25|$|In 1741, a {{supposed}} plot of arson was allegedly conducted by three enslaved men, Cuffee, Prince, and Caesar. These three men were alleged to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> several buildings including {{the home of}} Lieutenant Governor George Clarke. Cuffee and Quack (Kwaku), were tried for arson, found guilty, and burned at the stake. In total 13 black men were burned at the stake, 17 were hanged along with four whites. 70 people were deported from New York. There is considerable historical debate as to how these fires were actually started.|$|E

25|$|A {{large body}} of Orthodox clergy were {{liquidated}} in Gorky in 1938 for supposedly belonging to a network of subversive agents headed by Feofan Tuliakov, the Metropolitan of Gorky, Bishop Purlevsky of Sergach, Bishop Korobov of Vetluga and others. The network was allegedly trying to subvert collective farms and factories, destroy transportation, collect secret information for espionage and to create terrorist bands. They were alleged to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> twelve houses of collective farmers, and to have cooperated with militantly atheistic Trotskyites and Bukharinites against the Soviet state. This guise served to cover mass executions of clergy.|$|E
25|$|Around 1809, Sequoyah began {{creating}} {{a system of}} writing for the Cherokee language. At first he sought to create a character for each word in the language. He spent a year on this effort, leaving his fields unplanted, so that his friends and neighbors thought {{he had lost his}} mind. His wife is said to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> his initial work, believing it to be witchcraft. He realized that this approach was impractical because it would require too many pictures to be remembered. He tried making a symbol for every idea, but this also caused too many problems to be practical.|$|E
25|$|The Killian {{documents}} controversy (also {{referred to}} as Memogate or Rathergate) involved six documents critical of President George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard in 1972–73. Four of these documents were presented as authentic in a 60 Minutes Wednesday broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004, {{less than two months}} before the 2004 Presidential Election, but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents. Subsequently, several typewriter and typography experts concluded the documents are forgeries, as have some media sources. No forensic document examiners or typography experts authenticated the documents, which may not be possible without original documents. The provider of the documents, Lt. Col. Bill Burkett, claimed to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> the originals after faxing copies to CBS. The whole incident was turned into a feature-length film entitled Truth.|$|E

25|$|Samuel {{taught that}} the {{interpretation}} that Aaron {{should not have}} eaten the offering agreed with Rabbi Nehemiah while the other interpretation that Aaron should have eaten the offering agreed with Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon. Rabbi Nehemiah argued that they burned the offering because the priests were in the first stages of mourning. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon maintained that they burned it because the offering had become defiled during the day, not because of bereavement. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued {{that if it was}} because of bereavement, they should <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> all three sin offerings brought that day. Alternatively, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued that the priest would have been fit to eat the sacrifices after sunset. Alternatively, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued that Phinehas was then alive and not restricted by the law of mourning.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Mauryans, the first Brahmin emperor of the Shunga Empire (Pushyamitra Shunga) is believed to have persecuted Buddhists and contributed to a resurgence of Brahmanism that forced Buddhism outwards to Kashmir, Gandhara and Bactria. Buddhist scripture such as the Asokavadana account of the Divyavadana and ancient Tibetan historian Taranatha have written about persecution of Buddhists. Pushyamitra is said to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> down Buddhist monasteries, destroyed stupas, massacred Buddhist monks and put rewards on their heads, but some consider these stories as probable exaggerations. The Shunga revolt was viewed as a persecution of Buddhists by Euthydemus. Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus, “invaded” the Indus Valley in 180 BC. Historians now suggest that the invasion was intended to show their support for the Mauryans and thus, the Indo-Greek Kingdom was established in 170 BC, in order to prevent the Shungas from advancing the Indus Valley.|$|E
25|$|On 25, 26, and 27 May, the {{two parties}} {{submitted}} complaints alleging violation of the General Armistice Agreement by civilians and military personnel in the Al-Dawayima area. In an emergency meeting of the Mixed Armistice Commission, both parties agreed to a mixed investigation. United Nations observers accompanied the representatives to the demarcation line to establish the facts. Despite the cease-fire which had been previously arranged, heavy firing broke out during the investigation. Israel troops had fired across the demarcation line at Jordanians in Jordan territory in response to illegal border trespassing by Jordanian farmers and Israeli soldiers were suspected to <b>have</b> <b>burned</b> crops in Jordan territory. The origin of the incident was the illegal cultivation by Jordanians of land in Israel territory. Armed Jordanians had penetrated Israel territory to harvest crops, and other Jordanians had fired across the demarcation line to protect the harvesters. The Jordanian government took no action to encourage or prevent the actions taken, though later considerations were made.|$|E
