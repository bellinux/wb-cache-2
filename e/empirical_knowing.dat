40|$|This essay {{belongs to}} the {{normative}} theory of democracy, namely, {{the search for the}} moral grounds of democracy and the democratic institutions. Unlike the descriptive or explicative approaches, the normative theory of democracy does not point to the <b>empirical</b> <b>knowing</b> of the actual democracies, but to give an account of the moral value of democracy as an ideal and the justification of principles for designing or reforming political institutions. The aims of this article are: a) To introduce some normative questions that the concept of democracy leaves open; b) To present, in their basic thesis, the main contemporary conceptions; c) To suggest the requirements that the proposal of an regulative ideal should meet to constitute a normative successful justification of democracy. </p...|$|E

Influenced by politics, art, community, and Judaism, In The Prepositional State attempts to enact a poetics where poetry is knowing; the process of coming to knowledge through the poem.

I once believed that poetry is an aggregate of knowledge [...] empirical, inductive, emotional [...] contained in the self, but over time my thinking changed.

40|$|Background: Nursing {{research}} has concentrated on <b>empirical</b> <b>knowing</b> with little focus on aesthetic knowing. Evidence {{from the literature}} suggests that using visual art in nursing education enhances both clinical observation skills and interpersonal skills. The purpose of this review was to explore how visual art {{has been used in}} baccalaureate nursing education. Methods: Of 712 records, 13 studies met the criteria of art, nursing and education among baccalaureate nursing students published in English. Results: Three quantitative studies demonstrated statistical significance between nursing students who participated in arts-based learning compared to nursing students who received traditional learning. Findings included improved recall, increased critical thinking and enhanced emotional investment. Themes identified in 10 qualitative studies included spirituality as role enhancement, empathy, and creativity. Conclusion: Visual arts-based learning in pre-licensure curriculum complements traditional content. It supports spirituality as role enhancement in nurse training. Visual art has been successfully used to enhance both critical thinking and interpersonal relations. Nursing students may experience a greater intra-connectedness that results in better inter-connectedness with patients and colleagues. Incorporating visual arts into pre-licensure curriculums is necessary to nurture holistic nursing practice...|$|E
40|$|Performing Building Sites is the {{formulation}} of one of many possible critical strategies for curating. Performing Building Sites are approached as subject, site, and/or metaphor, proposing an understanding of architecture and construction as processual and hybrid fields of material and spatial practice. The project aims to explore methods for curatorial analysis and intervention on space, spanning from theoretical to practice oriented approaches. The Thesis is developed as both an academic research and as a curatorial project, extending the new research field of Curatorial Knowledge. The curator is proposed as a field practitioner, studying and intervening in existing spaces, and, sometimes, creating space. Central to this argument are theoretical and <b>empirical</b> <b>knowings</b> acquired through fieldwork. Situating the curator in space, producing research on spaces, suggests an implicated position for curating, and researching: in/on/through space. The academic research closely articulates with questions from a personal body of work developed by the author along a decade as an architect/researcher/curator. The images accompanying the study are (mostly) originals generated from fieldwork by the author and partners. Mostly set for curators, researchers and other spatial practitioners...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} Michael Polanyi’s {{notion of}} tacit knowing {{and seeks to}} clarify and elaborate upon its claims. Tacit knowing, which is conscious although inarticulate, must be distinguished from tacit processes, which are largely unconscious. Schematization is explored as a primary tacit process that humans share with all animals. This tacit process organizes and secures, in long-term memory, information of interest provided by receptors and those learned skills conducive to survival. Human <b>empirical</b> <b>knowing</b> integrates schematized subsidiaries into articulate explicitness through culturally-embedded symbols evoked in terms of felt fittingness. The thesis {{of this paper is}} quite easy to state: the tacit dimension of human knowing is implicated in all learning and accomplishing. Its processes and capabilities ought to be included in any adequate philosophical system. Yet for a process so central to education and achievement, there is a comparatively limited amount of attention paid to tacit knowing in scholarly writing, and there is surprisingly little consensus about how it functions. The literature in psychology contains disconnected discussion about various nonconscious contributors to knowledge, but nothing quite as comprehensive as a coherent theory of tacit knowing has emerged in psychology so far as I am aware. The most sustained version of a theory about tacit knowing has been produced by the scientist-philosopher who coined the term: Michael Polanyi. This paper is centere...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{exploratory}} study was to assess whether nurses from a regional base hospital had sufficient theoretical knowledge to assess and manage delirium in the clinical setting. Delirium is a well-recognised, preventable condition commonly seen in the older person. Numerous assessment tools {{have been developed to}} identify delirium in the clinical setting. Yet despite the effectiveness of these tools, many nurses remain unable to accurately detect the delirious patient and instead rely on clinical experience to make a diagnosis of delirium, often inappropriately. A self-administered survey based on a true/false questionnaire was used. In addition, a Likert scale was used to assess nurses' perceived levels of confidence in detecting and managing the delirious patient. A convenience sample of 130 nurses from four acute adult wards at a regional base hospital was provided with a 40 -item delirium knowledge questionnaire. The nurses answered an average of 80 percent of questions correctly. Statistical differences, using non-parametric tests, were found mainly between nursing designation and confidence levels; identification of predisposing and precipitating factors; and knowledge of delirium training. Overall, the staff nurse grade performed well, while nurse educators performing poorly. Nurses in this study held substantial theoretical knowledge about delirium. However, anecdotal evidence suggests this <b>empirical</b> <b>knowing</b> is not always transposed into practical application - it would seem nurses know more than they do...|$|E

Through exploration of narrative and its influence on indigenous epistemologies, we hope to challenge and expand the Western emphasis on the <b>empirical</b> way of <b>knowing.</b> We will learn from the epistemologies of three indigenous communities: Hawaii, New Zealand, and the continental United States.

There have been times in history when religion has taken a dogmatic role in limiting the practices of science (e. g. the Roman Catholic Church and Galileo). This manuscript reflects on the dogmatic ideals through reaching beyond the capacities of an <b>empirical</b> way of <b>knowing.</b> A Science, Technology, and Society (STS) approach to science teaching is considered as a possible mechanism for honoring both science and religion as valid yet different ways of knowing and better addressing students’ integration of science learned in school into their everyday lives...|$|R

Methods: A qualitative study using a phenomenological approach was performed in four Psychosocial Care Centers and in a psychiatric ward of a university hospital. Data collection was carried out with ten nurses participating in semi-structured interviews using the following guiding question: "Tell me your experience in caring for a patient in their first psychotic outbreak". Results: Carper's fundamental ways of <b>knowing</b> (<b>empirical,</b> aesthetic, ethical and personal) were identified in the caring of the patient in their first psychotic outbreak. Conclusion and Implications: A fragmented practice is implied when patterns of knowledge are taken in isolation. This reflects on specific actions of nursing work, such as the nursing practice and its stages...|$|R
40|$|This article moves beyond descriptives {{of how we}} “do ” {{change in}} a test of {{whether there is an}} <b>empirical</b> basis for <b>knowing</b> where in its life cycle is {{organizational}} change research. Questioning typical assumptions about change, it indicates what progress in the field looks like by plotting the patterning of temporal effects and life cycle in articles published in eight journals between 1947 and 2008 (n = 473). Findings indicate that the publication of more on change has not equated with more developed knowledge. As a community, change researchers are overwhelmingly focused on the most conservative type of progress, resulting in research that replicates rather than extends or develops, which ranks fairly low on a knowledge development scale. This illusion of knowledge development is described and explained by researcher reliance on existing idea mobilization and on belief prisons. The article concludes with discussion of implications for research and publishing practice. Keywords organizational change, knowledge development, temporal effec...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a computer program which can provide objective and quantitative data useful for the selection of the proper implant in order to obtain the symmetry with the contralateral breast in case of unilateral breast reconstruction by tissue expansion, especially for the surgeon without experience or for the occasional operator. METHODS: Our C++ program provides the final implant volume using the measurements of the semi-circumference and projection of the contralateral breast performed on the supine patient. The aim is the symmetry of the two breasts. RESULTS: According to our experience in breast reconstruction by tissue expanders, this program allows non invasive and simple measurements of the breast volume, useful to obtain the mammary symmetry. CONCLUSIONS: In case of breast reconstruction by tissue expansion, the preoperative evaluation is usually based on the surgeon's experience and on <b>empirical</b> observations without <b>knowing</b> the correct volume to reach. For this reason our program is useful to know the necessary volume for breast reconstruction, and therefore it allows the surgeon to obtain a better plastic result...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGraphene, a 2 D {{layer of}} sp 2 bonded carbon atoms in {{honeycomb}} arrangement, is a recently synthesized material, with exceptional mechanical, electronic, optical and thermal properties. Although theoretically studied since a long time, {{as it is}} the building block of graphite (a stacking of graphene layers), it was isolated as single or few layers only in 2004. Today graphene can be produced by several methods that depend on the quality and dimension of the material to be obtained. Applications of graphene are extensive in electronics, photonics, sensing and also in the field of energy generation and storage. Belonging to the same chemical group of carbon, also silicon could be in principle the ingredient of a 2 D material similar to graphene, named silicene. It shares with graphene the peculiar optical and electronic properties and could provide a more easy compatibility with the existing silicon-based microelectronics technology. An extremely high thermal conductivity in the range 3000 - 5000 Wm- 1 K- 1 has been measured for graphene. Only few results exist instead on the thermal properties of silicene. In this work we report ab-initio calculations, based on density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory, that provide the ingredients for the determination of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of graphene, silicene and 2 D silicon carbide. Ab-initio calculations solve Schrödinger equation without the need of <b>empirical</b> parameters, only <b>knowing</b> the chemical nature of the system constituents. The use of consolidated approximations employed in density functional theory allows the accurate prediction of several properties of materials...|$|R
40|$|Both {{artists and}} {{scientists}} {{want to make}} the invisible world visible. Checkpoint Leonardo (CPL) is a project for teaching and learning the art and science ways to gain knowledge of the world in informal museum and school education simultaneously. It consists of a series of art exhibitions with tailored workshops based on the scientific and artistic perspectives of the exhibit artworks. The first four workshops were designed and instructed for the conceptual level of 6 th grade pupils by interdisciplinary groups of physics student teachers and elementary school student teachers. These workshops studied different ways of perceiving (related to cubism), infrared imaging, oxidation as a source of color, and acid-base indicators. The basis for all workshops was to use the techniques and represent the results in an aesthetic manner. As the work continues and accumulates, the representations combine into an artistic project as well as a scientific body of results. This project was a volunteer part of pedagogical studies covering courses of pedagogy of arts and science and it was co-instructed by lecturers of pedagogy of science, art and museum pedagogies at the University of Jyväskylä and Jyväskylä Art museum, and the regional artist group Live Herring. Also, a series of lectures in the theme of different ways of perceiving the world was included in the Checkpoint Leonardo project. During the project we acquired and analyzed essays on students’ ideas of nature of science and aesthetic and <b>empirical</b> ways of <b>knowing</b> world and their development in this project. Only 41 % of the student teachers mentioned the empirical nature of scientific knowledge prior the project and 16 % of them claimed that scientific process does not permeate creativity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I provide a {{theoretical}} outline, {{followed by two}} case examples, of a qualitative method, called the free association narrative interview, which produces evidence that is congruent with the kinds and contexts of knowledge that human service professionals use in their work. Following a critique of assumptions about what constitutes evidence in evidence-based practice and an argument {{for the use of}} experiential and theoretical, as well as <b>empirical,</b> ways of <b>knowing,</b> I focus on qualitative methods and the shortcomings of semi-structured interviewing as an alternative method for evidence-based practice. In particular I argue that the theory of the research subject and the research relationship that is assumed in most qualitative methods is misguided and affects the character of the evidence that can be produced. I outline an alternative theory of the (research) subject, a psycho-social subject, drawing on psychoanalytic concepts that emphasise unconscious conflict, defences against anxiety and the centrality of unconscious intersubjective dynamics in the research, as in other, relationships. Two examples follow. The first illustrates the transference and counter-transference dynamics in one of my research interviews, showing their importance for what information was produced. The second example demonstrates the use of experiential, empirical and theoretical knowledge in the analysis of data from an interviewee with agoraphobia. It illustrates how the paradigm of a psycho-social subject can produce a more complex account of people's behaviour. I conclude by arguing that the kind of evidence illustrated here, being congruent with the vicissitudes of most human service professionals' work with clients, could provide a model for evidence-based practice that is not only more appropriate but also helpful for professional development...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{main purpose}} of the current {{conceptual}} article is to contribute to theorizing tacit knowledge creation (tacit knowing or knowing), by investigating its primary, foundational, and underlying condition: dialogicality. Drawing from dialogism – an epistemological and ontological framework – and the epistemology of practice, key concepts and approaches were intersected to explain dialogicality in knowing and the competences for crafting and refining it. As the emphasis on knowledge creation in organizational settings has often been on the need of interacting with other individuals to create knowledge – the more the better – the current study centres on a qualitative aspect of such knowing. There has been a de-skilling in creating knowledge with different experts and from their different experiences, and dialogicality is critical to help harnessing the generative and transformative power of such differences in knowing. Moreover, theorizing ‘dialogic’ or ‘dialogical’ knowing has been mostly based on cognitive and structural approaches and transmission models of knowledge communication, and such phenomenon has been limitedly understood in concrete and <b>empirical</b> sense, as <b>knowing</b> by means of face-to-face interactions through talk, verbal interactions with turn-takings, and ‘ideal dialogues’. It is argued the need to go beyond the idea of knowing-through-dialogue to knowing-through-dialogicality. It is claimed that it is not any dialogue that enables knowing with different experts and from their different experiences; such knowing-dialogue needs to be dialogically understood and conceived and for such, dialogicality is a central condition. Based on dialogism, the dialogicality in knowing is explained and four dialogical competences that help crafting and refining such dialogicality are suggested. The study extends and deepens the understanding and role of dialogicality in creating knowledge with and from the differences by analysing its epistemological, meta-theoretical, and ontological assumptions and by proposing its formative competences...|$|R
