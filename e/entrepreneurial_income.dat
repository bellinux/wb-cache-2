In both transition economies and existing West European market economies, the efficient taxation of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> presents particular difficulties, {{partly due to the}} absence of clearly defined `borderlines', for example between labour and capital incomes, and between business expenses and private consumption. The treatment of income volatility, of social insurance contributions, and of inheritance by the tax system can easily have a non-neutral impact on the balance between entrepreneurial investment and other investments. The paper considers how these problems could be addressed, and outlines a number of issues specific to the taxation of entrepreneurs in transition economies.

40|$|How {{valuable}} are {{cognitive and}} social abilities for entrepreneurs 2 ̆ 019 incomes {{as compared to}} employees? We answer three questions: (1) To what extent does a composite measure of ability affect an entrepreneur's earnings relative to employees? (2) Do different cognitive abilities (e. g. math ability, language ability) and social ability affect earnings of entrepreneurs and employees differently?, and (3) Does the balance in these measured ability levels affect an individual's earnings? Our individual fixed-effects estimates of the differential returns to ability for spells in entrepreneurship versus wage employment account for selectivity into entrepreneurial positions as determined by fixed individual characteristics. General ability has a stronger impact on <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> than on wages. Entrepreneurs and employees benefit from different sets of specific abilities: Language and clerical abilities have a stronger impact on wages, whereas mathematical, social and technical ability affect <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> more strongly.

In this respect, the study first reveals how income types represented by functional income distribution are distributed for the first and last quintiles. Secondly, the inequalities arising within different income types obtained by the respective income quintiles are involved to the analysis. TURKSTAT Income and Living Conditions Survey dataset has been used in the study. With regards to methodology, first the variations that occurred in the shares obtained by households in different income categories for the first and last income quintiles have been used from 2006 to 2015. The improving or deteriorating effects of the relevant income quintiles on income inequality have been put forth for these variations. Then, the Lorenz curves and the Gini coefficients have been used to assess the distribution within each income category. According to the findings of the study, items that increase income equality for the first quintile are salaries and wages, pensions and survivors’ benefits, property income and other social transfers. On the other hand, casual <b>incomes,</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes,</b> household transfers and rental incomes are the income categories that deteriorate income equality against the first income quintile.

For instance, ability and occupational choice are mentioned as driving both the level of (<b>entrepreneurial)</b> <b>income</b> and of education. Using instrumental variables can provide a way out. However, three questions remain: whether endogeneity is really present, whether it matters and whether the selected instruments make sense.

This is an important finding because family background variables are generally strongly correlated with education and are available in most datasets.

50|$|For a government, {{distinguishing}} between capital and labor incomes can be difficult.

The difficulty in distinguishing labor and capital income might be the most important reason for governments' reluctance to engage in the full tax exemption of capital income. Specifically, Christiansen and Tuomala (2008) find a positive optimal tax on capital income due to the presence of the ability to shift income, while Reis (2007) demonstrates that the Chamley-Judd result does not hold when tax authority cannot effectively distinguish <b>entrepreneurial</b> labor <b>income</b> and capital income.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{decomposes}} {{changes in}} inequality, which has in general been increasing {{in the transition}} economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, both by income source and socio-economic group, {{with a view to}} understanding the determinants of inequality and assessing how it might evolve in the future. The empirical analysis relies on a set of inequality statistics that, unlike"official data", are consistent and comparable across countries and are based on primary records from household surveys recently put together for the World Bank study"Growth, Poverty and Inequality in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union: 1998 - 2003 "[World Bank (2005 b) ]. The increase in inequality in transition, as predicted by a number of theoretical models, in practice differed substantially across countries, with the size and speed of its evolution depending on the relative importance of its key determinants, viz., changes in the wage distribution, employment, <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> and social safety nets. Its evolution was also influenced by policy. This diversity of outcomes is exemplified on the one hand for Central Europe by Poland, where the increase in inequality has been steady but gradual and reflects, inter alia, larger changes in employment and compensating adjustments in social safety nets and, on the other for the Commonwealth of Independent States by Russia, where an explosive overshooting of inequality peaked in the mid- 1990 s before being moderated through the extinguishing of wage arrears during its post- 1998 recovery. The paper argues that the process of transition to a market economy is not complete and that further evolution of inequality will depend both on (i) transition-related factors, such as the evolution of the education premium, a bias in the investment climate against new private sector firms which are important vehicles of job creation and regional impediments to mobility of goods and labor, as well as increasingly (ii) other factors, such as technological change and globalization. The paper also contrasts key features of inequality in Russia in the context of other transition economies with trends in inequality observed in China where rapid economic growth has been accompanied by a steep increase in inequality. It argues that the latter's experience is, to a large extent, a developmental, rather than a transition-related phenomenonderiving from the rural-urban divide and is, therefore, of limited relevance for predicting changes in inequality in Russia.

Chapter 1 {{focuses on the}} implications of lack of commitment for the optimal labor and capital income tax rates. It finds that it is optimal to converge to zero capital income taxes and positive labor income taxes in the long run. The government will follow the optimal plan as long as its debt is low enough, which implies {{that the lack of}} commitment may lead to some asset accumulation in the short run. Chapter 2 determines the optimal tax schedule when education is endogenous and observable, in a setting where agents have heterogeneous abilities. It finds that, for each ability level, it is optimal to subsidize monetary educational costs at the same marginal rate at which income is being taxed. Chapter 3 finds that when <b>entrepreneurial</b> labor <b>income</b> cannot be observed separately from capital income, then it is optimal to have positive capital taxation in the long run. Chapter 4 finds that if human capital expenses are unobservable, then in the optimal plan human capital accumulation will be distorted in the long run. by Catarina Reis. Thesis (Ph. D.)

First, I propose an overlapping-generations model with random endowment shocks and liquidity risk, evaluating their joint impact on expected returns. The model presents a single-factor asset pricing equation, with a new term capturing the covariance between assets' liquidities and non-tradeable wealth. In this economy, assets with higher liquidity or returns when non-tradeable wealth is low command lower expected returns. Second, I investigate whether risks associated with liquidity are priced after including non-tradeable wealth due to <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income.</b> I test the model on equally weighted and value-weighted portfolios, sorted by illiquidity levels, illiquidity variation and size, using US stock data from January 1962 to December 2004. The extra terms due to <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> reduce liquidity risk premium by almost 40 %, with an impact of - 0. 45 % per year on expected returns of value-weighted illiquidity-sorted portfolios.

40|$|The report {{surveys the}} {{incentive}} effects of taxes on capital and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> {{in light of}} the research in the field. The cash flow tax, the ACE tax and the tax on distributed profits of mature firms are known to be neutral with respect to the investment decisions. It is not widely understood that they are not neutral with respect to the entry decisions of start-up firms. The idea of creating tax incentives represents a departure from the neutrality principle. The entrepreneurial risk does not as such justify an investment incentive but an asymmetric tax treatment of it does. The Nordic dual income tax encourages the start-up investment of an entrepreneur who is expecting relatively high profitability. However, when setting the share of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> to be taxed as capital income, the failure risk matters. The empirical studies on the relation between the income tax rates and entrepreneurship point due to the tax avoidance motive to a positive relationship, though only at high tax rates. When judging the tax incentives on R&D spending, the strategic behavior between firms becomes relevant to be analyzed. Underinvestment or overinvestment are both potential outcomes. The entry barriers reduce in principle the validity of a tax policy based on the idea of tax neutrality. entrepreneurship, taxation, tax incentives...|$|E

Proponents argue that economic development practices that enhance and support entrepreneurship are essential because they cultivate innovation which, in turn, creates new jobs, new wealth, and a better quality of life. However, South Carolina’s real self-employed per capita income has decreased over the last decade. This downward trend highlights the need to examine the drivers of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income.</b> The income of self-employed workers, as opposed to the number of self-employed, is critical to economic development because a major goal of economic policy is to increase incomes not just employment.

30|$|The {{first of}} our models, {{which serves as}} a benchmark for the other {{specifications}} below, uses only contemporaneous variables to explain employment status. The underlying assumption in such empirical models is that labour market status is a choice variable with associated expected utility. Expected utility is a function of available capital, personal characteristics including <b>entrepreneurial</b> ability, expected <b>income</b> from profits or wages, {{and the level of}} demand in the economy (Taylor 1999). In such a framework, a worker will become dependently self-employed if he or she expects to receive a higher income from being dependently self–employed than from being a directly hired employee. In this case, we expect characteristics that are generally associated with better (labour) market outcomes – better education, for example – to be associated with both dependent and independent self-employment relative to being employed. If, in contrast, workers are being pushed into dependent self-employment because of weak bargaining power, the statistical associations of our estimates will be reversed. In other words, depending on the estimated associations of “good” and “bad” characteristics with dependent self-employment, we may discriminate between a pull vs. a push theory of dependent self-employment.|$|R
