5|$|Portrayed by Rob Lowe, Chris Traeger {{begins the}} show as an auditor working for the Indiana state {{government}} in Indianapolis, but eventually becomes the acting city manager of Pawnee, the fictional Indiana city where Parks and Recreation is set. Originally from Wisconsin, he is an excessively positive and optimistic person, who is constantly upbeat and extremely energetic. As a baby, Chris {{was diagnosed with a}} rare blood disorder and was not expected to live longer than three weeks, but miraculously survived. As a result, he sees <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> is alive as a gift, which results in his intensely cheerful and enthusiastic personality. He has a stepbrother who lives in London.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech {{language}} was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and {{made a point of}} writing and speaking in Czech <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper Národní listy. Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Božena.|$|E
5|$|Samar {{notices that}} Meera often prays at church. After {{a night of}} wild street dancing, they begin to fall in love. Samar helps Meera face her past, taking her to visit her estranged mother and foster reconciliation. Meera decides to confess to her father about Samar and break her engagement, but when Samar has a {{motorbike}} accident, Meera, believing she {{is the cause of}} his bad luck, prays to God to save his life, swearing never to see him again. Samar recovers and Meera reveals the vow she made. Angry, he leaves her and London altogether, challenging God to keep him alive as he risks his life <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> believes his death {{is the only way to}} make Meera lose her faith in God. He goes to India and enlists in the army, becoming a bomb-disposal expert.|$|E

"It's fine," [...] said Billina; [...] "the Tin Woodman says it gets softer and kindlier <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He's</b> {{waiting at}} his castle to welcome you, Dorothy; but he couldn't {{come with us}} because he 'is getting {{polished}} as bright as possible for Ozma's party." ...|$|R
5000|$|In another episode, {{recorded}} at NECSS in 2013, Novella said, [...] "Perry {{was a huge}} presence {{on the show and}} we think about him <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he's</b> been gone and we miss his presences on the show. We make sure we always pause to remember what he meant to us and what he meant to the SGU." ...|$|R

He's best just after dinner. But it's {{so hard to get}} to him then. Lord Alfred is almost always there; and then other people come, and they play cards. I think the city will be best.' ...|$|R
5|$|The {{staff are}} {{preparing}} to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric (GE) called Six Sigma, which encourages bosses to interact with their staff. He tells Liz and the writers {{that he will be}} sitting in the writers' room every day as an observer. As days pass, Jack begins to interfere with the writers' work, and instead of just being an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>he</b> tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E
25|$|Tutu {{says that}} <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> gets up at 4am {{and has a}} quiet time, a morning walk, morning prayers and the Eucharist. He reads the Bible every day.|$|E
25|$|He was an {{extremely}} diligent trainer, setting himself the target of one hundred practice bouts <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> suffered a severe shoulder injury in 1995, which required surgery.|$|E

25|$|Members of Moro's escort, {{who were}} not in service {{on the day of}} the kidnap, {{declared}} in September 1978 that Moro was a habitual person, and that <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> got out from his house exactly at 09:00 AM. However, Moro's widow denied this circumstance during her interview in front of the investigative judges on 23 September 1978.|$|E
25|$|The Buddha lived not in seclusion, {{but among}} people. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> walked barefoot to villages {{to beg for}} food. When he met a farmer, he used {{examples}} from farming {{to talk about the}} meaning of life. No matter who he met—a butcher, a prostitute, a bandit, a slave, a scholar, or a child---he would talk to them, according to their temperament and intellectual faculty, to inspire them a little and alleviate their suffering.|$|E

25|$|Though he {{has managed}} to remain clean and sober for {{extended}} periods in recent years, Osbourne has frequently commented on his former wild lifestyle, puzzled at how he has survived 40years of drug and alcohol abuse. Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent the next three months locked in his hotel room taking vast amounts of alcohol and other drugs all day, <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> claims that he would certainly have died if his future wife Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.|$|E
25|$|Curtin {{moved to}} Cottesloe near Perth in 1917 {{to become an}} editor for the Westralian Worker, the {{official}} trade union newspaper. He enjoyed the less pressured life of Western Australia and his political views gradually moderated. He joined the Australian Journalists' Association in 1917 and was elected Western Australian President in 1920. He wore his AJA badge (WA membership #56) <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> was prime minister. In addition to his stance on labour rights, Curtin was also a strong advocate {{for the rights of}} women and children. In 1927, the Federal Government convened a Royal Commission on Child Endowment. Curtin was appointed as a member of that commission.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1946 {{he started}} work at DUCO, a Du Pont Company paint factory outside Turin. Because of the {{extremely}} limited train service, Levi {{stayed in the}} factory dormitory during the week. This gave {{him the opportunity to}} write undisturbed. He started to write the first draft of If This Is a Man. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> scribbled notes on train tickets and scraps of paper as memories came to him. At the end of February, he had ten pages detailing the last ten days between the German evacuation and the arrival of the Red Army. For the next ten months, the book took shape in his dormitory as he typed up his recollections each night.|$|E

50|$|In hindsight, I {{think it}} works because Philip Glass's music {{is kind of}} a metaphor for Jiro's work ethic, because it's {{repetitive}} but it also builds on itself and escalates, and it's the same with Jiro's work. Because <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he's</b> going, he's doing the same routine, and trying to do everything exactly the same, but just reaching for that one step of improvement, and I feel like the music's doing the same thing, so they match perfectly.|$|R
50|$|The {{guard of}} the mind is the {{practical}} goal of the Hesychast. It is the condition in which he remains {{as a matter of}} course throughout his <b>day,</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> until <b>he</b> dies.|$|R
25|$|Just before 3 pm Kelly's superior, Wing Commander Clark, {{called him}} at home and spoke to him for 6-7 minutes. Clark called again at about 3:20 pm; the call was {{answered}} by Mrs Kelly who said that Kelly had gone {{out for a walk}} as he did <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> appears to have gone directly to an area of woodlands known as Harrowdown Hill about a mile away from his home where he ingested up to 29 tablets of painkillers, co-proxamol, an analgesic drug and to have then cut his left wrist with a knife he had owned since his youth. His wife reported him missing shortly after midnight that night, and he was found early the next morning. Questioned on a flight to Hong Kong that day, Blair denied that anyone had been authorised to leak Kelly's identity.|$|E
25|$|Even {{when not}} under indictment, he {{prepared}} for inevitable charges (knowing the FBI was watching him). Almost <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> would return from his residence to his mother's apartment at 225 Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village and emerge {{dressed in a}} bathrobe and pajamas or a windbreaker and shabby trousers. Accompanied by one or two bodyguards, he crossed {{the street to the}} Triangle Civic Improvement Association — a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters — where he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with his associates. Regular visitors to the Triangle included senior Genovese caporegimes Liborio Bellomo, John Ardito, Tino Fiumara, Ernest Muscarella and Daniel Leo. From Gigante's 1990 indictment and after his incarceration (in La Tuna, Texas) these men ran the crime family, with all major choices authorized by Gigante from his prison cell.|$|E
25|$|As {{governor}} of Hangzhou, Bai Juyi realised that the farmland nearby {{depended on the}} water of West Lake, but, due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dike had collapsed and the lake had dried out {{to the point that}} the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dike, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation, relieving the drought, and improving the livelihood of the local people over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake, visiting the lake almost <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> ordered the construction of a causeway to allow walking on foot, instead of requiring the services of a boat. A causeway in the West Lake (Baisha Causeway, 白沙堤) was later referred to as Bai Causeway in Bai Juyi's honour, but the original causeway built by Bai Juyi named Baigong Causeway (白公堤) no longer exists.|$|E
60|$|And Arthur also blushed, not {{thinking}} then of Adela Gauntlet, but of that pledge {{which he had}} given to Lord Stapledean--a pledge of which <b>he</b> had repented <b>every</b> <b>day</b> since <b>he</b> had given it.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} each episode, the Captain always {{encouraged}} parents {{watching the}} show to spend some quality time with their children <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> and <b>he</b> often demonstrated various creative ways in which to do so.|$|R
50|$|Mahajan was a vegetarian. His diet {{includes}} varan bhaat, pithla bhakri, green vegetables, fruits, {{milk and}} lemon juice. He trains by walking 10 km <b>every</b> <b>day</b> which <b>he</b> does {{at a speed}} of about 6 km/hr.|$|R
25|$|Shi Yi {{was known}} for leading a frugal and humble lifestyle. Unlike many other officials, he did not {{accumulate}} wealth for his family and never accepted financial aid from others. He was content with having only basic necessities. Sun Quan once went {{on a tour of}} Shi Yi's neighbourhood and saw a large mansion. When he asked who the owner of the mansion was, someone told him it was Shi Yi. However, Sun Quan said that it was definitely not Shi Yi, given his lifestyle. He was proven right. Shi Yi wore very simple clothing and had simple meals <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> also enjoyed helping the needy so he often donated or gave away his personal savings to the poor. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Shi Yi's house and sampled the meals Shi Yi had every day. After the visit, he increased Shi Yi's salary, gave him more rewards and a larger plot of land. However, Shi Yi rejected these rewards and gifts and said that he would feel uneasy if he accepted them.|$|E
25|$|Whilst in Calabria, Ipomadon {{takes on}} a number of disguises. As far as the King of Sicily's queen is concerned, her darling, whom she loves, hunts all day and, to the derision of her ladies-in-waiting, brings back nothing more honourable in the evening than venison to give to the king, who is engaged in the tournament. In reality, however, Ipomadon has been {{fighting}} at the tournament all day, winning horses for himself, and it is his tutor Ptolomy who has been hunting. Ipomadon fights on the first day in white armour, having changed into it deep in the forest, and wins the acclaim of all. On the second day he fights in red armour and on the third day, in black. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> wins the prize and the Proud is devastated when the winning knight does not show up the next morning; particularly so since she learns from her cousin Jason every evening that the victorious knight has been none other than her 'strange or unknown young man'. Ipomadon has been careful to seek out this cousin every evening after the fighting to declare his identity. Well, not quite his complete identity. Having won the fighting on three successive days, Ipomadon leaves secretly again, leaving the Proud once again distraught at his departure.|$|E
500|$|Aubrey and Sherry Lansing, {{who entered}} the movie {{business}} as a script reader at MGM under Aubrey, were struck by a car while crossing Wilshire Boulevard in the mid-1970s. Both were badly hurt and Lansing had to use crutches {{for a year and}} a half. Aubrey nursed her back to health. [...] "He came <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>He</b> would say, 'You're not going to limp.' My own mother and father couldn't give me more support," [...] she told Variety in 2004.|$|E
