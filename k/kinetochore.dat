25|$|Monocentric organisms, {{including}} vertebrates, fungi, {{and most}} plants, {{have a single}} centromeric region on each chromosome which assembles one <b>kinetochore.</b> Holocentric organisms, such as nematodes and some plants, assemble a <b>kinetochore</b> along {{the entire length of}} a chromosome.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one <b>kinetochore</b> is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each <b>kinetochore,</b> whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each <b>kinetochore.</b> However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one <b>kinetochore.</b> There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that <b>kinetochore</b> attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the <b>kinetochore</b> is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the <b>kinetochore.</b> These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{structural}} centromeric proteins (such as CENP-B), remain stably localized throughout mitosis (including telophase), {{the spindle}} checkpoint components are assembled on the <b>kinetochore</b> in high concentrations in absence of MTs, and their concentration decreases {{as the number}} of MTs attached to the <b>kinetochore</b> increases.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear pore {{complexes}} (NPCs) mediate all nucleocytoplasmic {{traffic and}} provide docking {{sites for the}} spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein Mad 1 p. Upon SAC activation, Mad 1 p is recruited onto <b>kinetochores</b> and rapidly cycles between NPCs and <b>kinetochores.</b> We examined the mechanism of Mad 1 p movement onto <b>kinetochores</b> and show that it is controlled by two components of the nuclear transport machinery, the exportin Xpo 1 p and Ran–guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Mad 1 p contains a nuclear export signal (NES) that is recognized by Xpo 1 p. The NES, Xpo 1 p, and RanGTP are all required for Mad 1 p recruitment onto <b>kinetochores</b> in checkpoint-activated cells. Consistent with this function, Xpo 1 p also accumulates on <b>kinetochores</b> after SAC activation. We have also shown that Xpo 1 p and RanGTP are required for the dynamic cycling of Mad 1 p between NPCs and <b>kinetochores</b> in checkpoint-arrested cells. These results reveal an important function for Xpo 1 p in mediating intranuclear transport events and identify a signaling pathway between <b>kinetochores</b> and NPCs...|$|R

Mitotic PtK 2 cells were pretreated with colcemid to remove all endogenous microtubules and were lysed with Triton X- 100 in PIPES- EGTA-Mg++ buffer. This procedure left centrosomes, chromosomes, and <b>kinetochores</b> intact as determined by electron microscopy of thin- sectioned cells.

25|$|The first protein to be {{assembled}} on the <b>kinetochore</b> is CENP-A (Cse4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This protein is a specialized isoform of histone H3. CENP-A {{is required for}} incorporation of the inner <b>kinetochore</b> proteins CENP-C, CENP-H and CENP-I/MIS6. The relation of these proteins in the CENP-A dependent pathway is not completely defined. For instance, CENP-C localization requires CENP-H in chicken cells, but it is independent of CENP-I/MIS6 in human cells. In C. elegans and metazoa, the incorporation of many proteins in the outer <b>kinetochore</b> depends ultimately on CENP-A.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two groups}} of +TIPs with <b>kinetochore</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinetochore</b> {{proteins}} and proteins binding to MTs (+) end (collectively called +TIPs) regulate <b>kinetochore</b> movement through the kMTs (+) end dynamics regulation. However, the kinetochore-microtubule interface is highly dynamic, {{and some of}} these proteins seem to be bona fide components of both structures. Two groups of proteins seem to be particularly important: kinesins which work like depolymerases, such as KinI kinesins; and proteins bound to MT (+) ends, +TIPs, promoting polymerization, perhaps antagonizing the depolymerases effect.|$|E
40|$|<b>Kinetochores</b> {{regulate}} {{the dynamics of}} attached microtubule bundles (kinetochore-fibres, K-fibres) to generate the forces necessary for chromosome movements in mitosis. Current models suggest that poleward-moving <b>kinetochores</b> are attached to depolymerising K-fibres and anti-poleward-moving <b>kinetochores</b> to polymerising K-fibres. How the dynamics of individual microtubules within the K-fibre relate to poleward and anti-poleward movements is poorly understood. To investigate this, we developed a live-cell imaging assay combined with computational image analysis that allows eGFP-tagged EB 3 (also known as MAPRE 3) to be quantified at thousands of individual metaphase <b>kinetochores</b> as they undergo poleward and anti-poleward motion. Surprisingly, we found that K-fibres are incoherent, containing both polymerising and depolymerising microtubules – with a small polymerisation bias for anti-poleward-moving <b>kinetochores.</b> K-fibres also display bursts of EB 3 intensity, predominantly on anti-poleward-moving <b>kinetochores,</b> equivalent to more coherent polymerisation, and this was associated with more regular oscillations. The frequency of bursts and the polymerisation bias decreased upon loss of kinesin- 13, whereas loss of kinesin- 8 elevated polymerisation bias. Thus, <b>kinetochores</b> actively set the balance of microtubule polymerisation dynamics in the K-fibre while remaining largely robust to fluctuations in microtubule polymerisation...|$|R
40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint monitors microtubule attachment to <b>kinetochores</b> and tension across sister <b>kinetochores</b> to ensure accurate division of chromosomes between daughter cells. Cytoplasmic dynein {{functions in the}} checkpoint, apparently by moving critical checkpoint components off <b>kinetochores.</b> The dynein subunit required for this function is unknown. Here we show that human cells depleted of dynein light intermediate chain 1 (LIC 1) delay in metaphase with increased interkinetochore distances; dynein remains intact, localised and functional. The checkpoint proteins Mad 1 / 2 and Zw 10 localise to <b>kinetochores</b> under full tension, whereas BubR 1 is diminished at <b>kinetochores.</b> Metaphase delay and increased interkinetochore distances are suppressed by depletion of Mad 1, Mad 2 or BubR 1 or by re-expression of wtLIC 1 or a Cdk 1 site phosphomimetic LIC 1 mutant, but not Cdk 1 -phosphorylation-deficient LIC 1. When the checkpoint is activated by microtubule depolymerisation, Mad 1 / 2 and BubR 1 localise to <b>kinetochores.</b> We conclude that a Cdk 1 phosphorylated form of LIC 1 is required to remove Mad 1 / 2 and Zw 10 but not BubR 1 from <b>kinetochores</b> during {{spindle assembly}} checkpoint silencing...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) arrests cells when <b>kinetochores</b> are unattached to spindle microtubules. The {{signaling pathway is}} initiated at the <b>kinetochores</b> by one SAC component, Mad 2, which catalyzes the initial steps of the cascade via the conformational dimerization of its open and closed conformers. Away from <b>kinetochores,</b> the dimerization surface of Mad 2 has been proposed, based on data in vitro, to either interact with SAC activators or inactivators and thus to contribute to SAC activation or silencing. Here, we analyze its role in vivo. ResultsTo analyze the putative pathway downstream of the kinetochores, we used two complementary approaches: we activated the SAC ectopically and independently from <b>kinetochores,</b> and we separated genetically the kinetochore-dependent and independent pools of Mad 2. We found that the dimerization surface is required also downstream of <b>kinetochores</b> to mount a checkpoint response. ConclusionOur results show that away from <b>kinetochores</b> the dimerization surface is required for stabilizing the end-product of the pathway, the mitotic checkpoint complex. Surprisingly, downstream of <b>kinetochores</b> the surface does not mediate Mad 2 dimerization. Instead, our {{results are consistent with}} a role of Mad 3 as the main interactor of Mad 2 via the dimerization surface...|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Dasso and {{collaborators}} {{have found that}} proteins involved in the Ran cycle can be detected on kinetochores during mitosis: RanGAP1 (a GTPase activating protein which stimulates the conversion of Ran-GTP in Ran-GDP) and the Ran binding protein called RanBP2/Nup358. During interphase, these proteins are located at the nuclear pores {{and participate in the}} nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. <b>Kinetochore</b> localization of these proteins seem to be functionally significant, because some treatments that increase the levels of Ran-GTP inhibit <b>kinetochore</b> release of Bub1, Bub3, Mad2 and CENP-E.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{components}} that vary in concentration on kinetochores during mitosis include the molecular motors CENP-E and dynein (as {{well as their}} target components ZW10 and ROD), and the spindle checkpoint proteins (such as Mad1, Mad2, BubR1 and Cdc20). These proteins assemble on the <b>kinetochore</b> in high concentration in absence of microtubules; however, the higher the number of MTs anchored to the <b>kinetochore,</b> the lower the concentration of these proteins. At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels disminish about 3 to 4x as compared to free kinetochores, whereas dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 levels are reduced >10-100x.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} or absence of Mad 1 at <b>kinetochores</b> is a major determinant of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activity, the surveillance mechanism that delays anaphase onset if one or more <b>kinetochores</b> remain unattached to spindle fibers. Among the factors regulating the levels of Mad 1 at <b>kinetochores</b> is the Rod, Zw 10, and Zwilch (RZZ) complex, which is required for Mad 1 recruitment through a mechanism that remains unknown. The relative dynamics and interactions of Mad 1 and RZZ at <b>kinetochores</b> have not been extensively investigated, although Mad 1 has been reported to be stably recruited to unattached <b>kinetochores.</b> In this study, we directly compare Mad 1 -green fluorescent protein (GFP) turnover dynamics on unattached Drosophila <b>kinetochores</b> with that of RZZ, tagged either with GFP-Rod or GFP-Zw 10.

40|$|Background: The mitotic {{checkpoint}} {{prevents the}} onset of anaphase before all chromosomes are attached to spindle microtubules. The checkpoint is thought to act by the catalytic generation at unattached <b>kinetochores</b> of a diffusible "wait signal" that prevents anaphase. Mad 2 and Cdc 20, two candidate proteins for components of a diffusible wait signal, have previously {{been shown to be}} recruited to and rapidly released from unattached <b>kinetochores.</b> Results: Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching demonstrated that Mad 1, Bub 1, and a portion of Mad 2, all essential mitotic-checkpoint components, are stably bound elements of unattached <b>kinetochores</b> (as are structural centromere components such as Centromere protein C [CENP-C]). After microtubule attachment, Mad 1 and Mad 2 are released from <b>kinetochores</b> and relocalize to spindle poles, whereas Bub 1 remains at <b>kinetochores.</b> Conclusions: A long residence time at <b>kinetochores</b> identifies Bub 1, Mad 1, and a portion of Mad 2 as part of a catalytic platform that recruits, activates, and releases a diffusible wait signal that is partly composed of the rapidly exchanging portion of Mad 2. The release of Mad 1 and Mad 2, but not Bub 1, from <b>kinetochores</b> upon attachment separates the elements of this "catalytic platform" and thereby silences generation of the anaphase inhibitor despite continued rapid cycling of Mad 2 at spindle poles...|$|R

Rapid transit of Cdc 20 through <b>kinetochores</b> may ensure that spindle checkpoint signaling at unattached/relaxed <b>kinetochores</b> can continuously inhibit APC/CCdc 20 targeting of anaphase inhibitors (securins) throughout the cell until all the chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle...|$|R

40|$|The condensin complex has a {{fundamental}} role in chromosome dynamics. In this study, {{we report that}} accumulation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe condensin at mitotic <b>kinetochores</b> and ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) occurs in multiple steps and is necessary for normal segregation of the sister <b>kinetochores</b> and rDNAs.
