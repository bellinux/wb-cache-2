50|$|By 1943, Partridge Wilson were {{producing}} {{vehicles with}} payloads of 7/10 cwt, 15 cwt, 18/25 cwt, and 40 cwt. The first three {{were aimed at}} the retail delivery market, and so were mainly supplied as bread vans and milk floats, while the 40 cwt model {{was designed as a}} lorry. All models were fitted with series traction motors and Bendix brakes. The 7/10 cwt model included a <b>drum-type</b> <b>controller,</b> with a constant delay between the stages. The larger vehicles used a fluid foot controller to regulate the speed of the vehicle. By this time they were using starting resistances, which were switched out of circuit as a camshaft on the controller rotated. Power was transmitted to the rear axle through a propellor shaft with Hardy-Spicer flexible couplings and a spiral bevel gear. On the larger models, the propellor shaft had Hardy-Spicer needle-roller joints, and was connected to an overslung worm drive on the rear axle. There was also a 30 cwt lorry with a tipping body available, although Hills in his summary of electric vehicles gives no further details, and the Wilson-Scammell electric horse was still in production.|$|E
