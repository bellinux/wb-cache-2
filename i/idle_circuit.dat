Significant energy and timing penalties are suffered to restore the pre-sleep system state {{at the end of}} the sleep mode with the conventional MTCMOS circuits. Two new master-slave MTCMOS memory flip-flops are presented in this paper for providing a low-complexity and low-leakage data retention sleep mode. A small size high threshold voltage static memory cell is integrated into an MTCMOS flip-flop to preserve the stored data while drastically reducing the leakage power consumption of <b>idle</b> sequential <b>circuits.</b> The already existing sleep signal of the MTCMOS circuitry is also used for controlling the data retention and restoration operations, thereby eliminating the need for any extra control signals. The memory flip-flops provide a significantly simplified sleep control/data transfer mechanism and reduce the circuit area by up to 37. 21 % as compared to the previously published MTCMOS flip-flops. Furthermore, the leakage power consumption with the presented techniques is reduced by up to 97. 71 % as compared to the previously published techniques in a UMC 80 nm CMOS technology.

Leakage power is dominated by critical paths, and hence dynamic deactivation of fast transistors could potentially yield large savings. We introduce methodologies for comparing fine-grain dynamic deactivation techniques that include the effects of deactivation energy and startup latencies, as well as long-term leakage current. Existing dynamic leakage reduction techniques, although they have low leakage current also have large deactivation energies and significant startup latencies. The large deactivation energies require long idle times to amortize their overhead, and large startup latencies impact performance, limiting the applicability of these techniques within an active microprocessor. We introduce new circuit techniques that have a low deactivation energy when transitioning a circuit block into a low leakage state from which it can be woken quickly.

Although overall activity changes in the ipsilateral motor cortex have been reported, their functional signifi-cance remains unclear. Using human functional imaging, we ana-lyzed neural finger representations by studying differences in fine-grained activation patterns for single isometric finger presses. We demonstrate that cortical motor areas encode ipsilateral movements in 2 fundamentally different ways. During unimanual ipsilateral finger presses, primary sensory and motor cortices show, underneath global suppression, finger-specific activity patterns that are nearly identical to those elicited by contralateral mirror-symmetric action. This component vanishes when both motor cortices are functionally engaged during bimanual actions. We suggest that the ipsilateral rep-resentation present during unimanual presses arises because other-wise functionally <b>idle</b> <b>circuits</b> are driven by input from the opposite hemisphere. A second type of representation becomes evident in caudal premotor and anterior parietal cortices during bimanual actions. In these regions, ipsilateral actions are represented as non-linear modulation of activity patterns related to contralateral actions, an encoding scheme that may provide the neural substrate for coor-dinating bimanual movements.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the use of {{distribution}} transformers, their integration into the electrical network, their properties, and principles and means of regulation according to changes in load. The introductory chapter is devoted mainly to the theoretical background concerning the functioning of the transformers. Even though it is not the focus of this thesis, a brief summary of their structure will be provided because it is presumed that not all the readers are familiar with this particular electrical network block and thus they should be explained how the transformer works. Then the ways of transformer regulation will be outlined. In the theoretical part, the important point for the reader is the substitution of the transformer by two-port network i. e. the equivalent circuit. The two-port network is a substitution of the connection properties by simple electric elements, which are not so problematic for further use. When dealing with the two-port networks in the chosen equivalent circuit, Blondel’s constants will be used. Blondel’s constants facilitate working with the basic network invariables of the circuit such as amperage, voltage and power. The second part of the thesis is devoted to solving a problem that involves the use of distribution transformers. The problem is as follows: there is a manufacturing plant with three transformers, each of them having rated power and nominal transformation ratio.
