5|$|The {{collapse}} {{focused attention}} on the Harper government's cancellation of the Joint <b>Emergency</b> <b>Preparedness</b> Program, which provides funds to Canada's five HUSAR teams. The province and the National Fire Protection Association denounced the cuts. The Canadian Centre for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Preparedness</b> suggested that such cuts would necessitate Canada asking for assistance from the United States in similar situations. Also cancelled by the Conservative federal government was the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of the cuts, noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E
5|$|Overall, damage totaled $85,000 (1998 USD); {{the effects}} were {{described}} as minor.

5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within <b>emergency</b> <b>preparedness.</b> Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor <b>emergency</b> <b>preparedness.</b>|$|E

The state Office of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Preparedness</b> declared 61 injuries on the American side and police claimed that 30 were injured in Mexico. The Red Cross stated that cuts from broken glass, bruises from falling objects, and a few broken bones were reported. California's Interstate 8 developed cracks in it, but vehicles were still able to traverse the highway. The CaliforniaHighwayPatrol warned drivers that use of the road would be at their own risk.|$|E
5|$|After {{an absence}} of ten years, and almost 30 years after the 1983 movie Big Bird in China, 53 eleven-minute episodes of Sesame Street's Big Bird Looks at the World, filmed in Mandarin Chinese, debuted in early 2011 in China. Inspired by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the program {{emphasized}} <b>emergency</b> <b>preparedness.</b> In {{the first week of}} December 2011, a Pashto and Dari-language version called Baghch-e-Simsim was launched in Afghanistan, and in the same month Pakistan began airing its own Urdu-language version, called SimSim Humara, which was supposed to run for three years. In June 2012, the United States terminated funding for SimSim Humara due to serious allegations of corruption by the local Pakistani puppet theater working on the initiative.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the flooding in St. John's, Newfoundland, the city mayor activated the city's <b>Emergency</b> <b>Preparedness</b> Program. On September 27, {{about a week after}} the passage of the storm, the Emergency Measures Organization began accepting applications for flood-related damage. By about a month after the storm, 169 applications were processed, with an additional 1,762 received by the Emergency Measures Organization. Eligibility for the disaster assistance included restoration to property or household items of an essential nature. A few days after the passage of the storm, the government of Newfoundland appealed to the federal government for federal disaster relief fund; the government later approved. Ultimately, disaster relief assistance totaled $6.3million (2001 CAD), primarily to individual assistance.|$|E
5|$|Officials of the Port of Port Hedland, an {{important}} iron ore exporting terminal, closed and evacuated the port by {{the morning of}} 16 March, operating under standard <b>emergency</b> <b>preparedness</b> procedure. Overall, nearly 40 ships in the port were relocated from the port {{out of the path}} of the storm. The Port of Dampier was also closed. The Port of Port Hedland reopened to shipping on 18 March, about 52 hours after its closure, with little or no damage reported, though the downtime drove iron ore prices up for a time, and reduced exports of the raw material by 4.7% compared to the previous month. In total, Lua cost natural resources companies over $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in stunted industry, accounting for nearly all of the monetary losses resulting from the storm.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Preparedness</b> ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E

40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has {{established}} a system of collaborating centers known as the Radiation <b>Emergency</b> Medical <b>Preparedness</b> and Assistance Network (REMPAN) to promote radiation <b>emergency</b> medical <b>preparedness,</b> assistance, and advice to countries in cases of overexposure of populations from any source of radiation. This network consists of 13 specialized institutions located in 10 countries. Within the REMPAN there are three separate but linked activities. The first is aimed at strengthening radiation <b>emergency</b> medical <b>preparedness</b> and assistance to treat and monitor acutely exposed individuals. The second activity is directed toward improving public health advice to mitigate long-term effects of exposure to low and protracted doses that might accrue in populations living in the affected territories. This involves giving advice on protecting public health, e. g., iodine prophylaxis, psychosocial risks associated with countermeasures, and public information strategies. In addition, the REMPAN develops activities aimed at improving long-term follow-up studies and preparedness for epidemiologic investigations in territories contaminated by radionuclides from a nuclear accident. The WHO's response in a radiation emergency depends {{on the type of}} accident and its time phase. This includes a wide range of actions from studying the situation to providing medical and public health assistance through the network of collaborating centers and relevant institutions within the REMPAN.

5|$|Some {{computer}} forecast models initially {{predicted that}} the storm would move towards South Carolina or Georgia. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, researchers at Clemson University used Bonnie to test a new method of estimating the damage a storm is likely to cause. In the state, the South Carolina National Guard put about 1,512 men on active duty, 1,474 being of the Army National Guard. On August 25, the South Carolina <b>Emergency</b> <b>Preparedness</b> Division activated Level 1 operations, the highest of five levels. That same day, the State Governor declared a State of Emergency, calling for mandatory evacuations of residents east of U.S. Route 17 in Horry and Georgetown counties. Schools were closed throughout the state. Over 200,000 people were evacuated from those counties, of which 120,000 were tourists. About 6,000 sought shelter at schools in Horry County. In a survey, 12% of respondents in the state took traffic as a significant consideration in deciding if they should evacuate. On the Grand Strand, Bonnie was the first storm where buses were provided to help people evacuate.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Preparedness</b> {{activated}} its Crisis Action Team on August 16 {{to monitor}} the storm and coordinate preparation. Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco {{declared a state of}} emergency early on the evening of August 17, asking for a presidential emergency declaration to give Louisiana access to federal funds prior to any landfall. Texas Governor Rick Perry declared Dean to be an imminent threat to the state, and thus initiated a full-scale hurricane preparedness effort on August 17 when the storm was at least five days away. Prior to the storm, Texas suffered severe flooding from several June–July storms, and Tropical Storm Erin left the ground still saturated. Governor Perry feared that more rainfall from Dean would cause additional flash flooding, and had 250 Texas Parks and Wildlife Department crews on standby with boats to assist in potential evacuations. He was willing to deploy up to 10,000 Texas Military Forces soldiers, and did deploy several elements of the Texas State Guard who set up emergency shelters. The Texas fuel industry began surging fuel loads to coastal counties to ensure adequate fuel in the event of the hurricane causing a disruption to the fuel distribution system. In anticipation of evacuations, the Texas Department of Transportation began working on extra evacuation lanes and contraflow. NASA cut short the STS-118 mission as a precaution, in case Dean approached Mission Control at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. To that effect, mission managers cut the mission's final spacewalk short by two hours, allowing them to land a day earlier than originally planned.|$|E
