50|$|All {{incoming}} {{passengers who}} intend {{to take advantage}} of the Visa Waiver Program are required to apply for a travel authorization through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) online before departure to the United States, preferably at least 72 hours (3 days) in advance.

The <b>electronic</b> <b>authorization,</b> which is valid for a two-year period, mirrors Australia's Electronic Travel Authority system. The authorization is mandatory for participating VWP citizens before boarding flights destined to the United States, but as with formal visas this does not guarantee admission into the United States since final admission eligibility is determined at U.S. ports of entry by CBP officers.|$|E

50|$|Maestro often {{requires}} on-line <b>electronic</b> <b>authorization</b> for every transaction, although Mastercard's rules permit {{the establishment of}} floor limits on Maestro EMV chip transactions only. Not only must the information stored in either the chip or the magnetic stripe be read, {{this has to be}} sent from the merchant to the issuing bank, the issuing bank then has to respond with an affirmative authorization. If the information is not read, the issuer will decline the transaction, regardless of any disposable amount on the connected account, except in the Asia Pacific region, where manual keyed entry is permitted under some circumstances. This is different from most other debit and credit cards, where the information can be entered manually into the terminal (i.e. by punching the 13 to 19 digits and the expiry date on the terminal) and still be approved by the issuer or stand-in processor. In most countries, other than those specified in Mastercard's rules, a PIN rather than a signature is always required to authorise a Maestro transaction, except where no CVM (Cardholder Verification Method) is required.|$|E

Merchants may also communicate this orally, as in [...] "We take (brands X, Y, and Z)" [...] or [...] "We don't take credit cards".The credit card issuer issues a credit card to a customer at the time or after an account has {{been approved by the}} credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer.
