500|$|As Hancock rode {{north to}} find {{additional}} reinforcements, he saw Wilcox's brigade nearing {{the base of}} the ridge, aiming at a gap in the Union line. The timing was critical, and Hancock chose the only troops at hand, the men of the 1st Minnesota, Harrow's Brigade, of the 2nd Division of the II Corps. They were originally placed there to guard Thomas's U.S. Battery. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Confederate flag over the advancing line and shouted to Col. William Colvill, [...] "Advance, Colonel, and take those colors!" [...] The 262 Minnesotans charged the Alabama brigade with bayonets fixed, and they blunted their advance at Plum Run but at horrible cost215 casualties (82%), including 40 deaths or mortal wounds, one of the largest regimental single-action losses of the war. Despite overwhelming Confederate numbers, the small 1st Minnesota, with the support of Willard's brigade on their left, checked Wilcox's advance and the Alabamians were forced to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} both praise and criticism for its multiple-genre format. It was reviewed by {{four people in}} a 1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly shortly {{after the release of}} the game in 1989. Steve Harris said that the game does more than most shoot 'em ups and that it's a [...] "good follow-up for Zanac fans". He added that the multiple-genre format [...] "helps elevate the whole title to a much higher level". Ed Semrad called the game a Blaster Master clone and [...] "only average at best", and he echoed Harris' opinion that those who enjoyed Zanac would enjoy The Guardian Legend. Donn Nauert said that the game is repetitive and offers little challenge and {{that it would have been}} better as a pure shoot 'em up; <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> special password ("TGL") in which players can enter to bypass all of the Labyrinth portions. Jim Allee also compared the game to Zanac and repeated what Nauert said about the lack of difficulty except in the boss battles; he overall praised the game for successfully bringing together two distinct themes.|$|E
500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E

2500|$|Because of the ordinance's vagueness {{there was}} a danger of [...] "arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement", Sprecher claimed. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Georgia case brought by two stores had had their {{business}} licenses revoked for selling alleged paraphernalia, where the judge had found, among other vague aspects {{of the law in}} question, that [...] "conflicting lifestyles and political views suffuse the decision maker's perception of what buyers will do with the product." [...] He saw the same possibility in the case before him. The village's brief had, Sprecher observed, suggested that no responsible business would sell paraphernalia.|$|E
2500|$|The name first {{given to}} the {{settlement}} is debated. Historian Doyce B.

For proof, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> map dated 1785, where that phrase was used. Frank Weber, the diocesan archivist, replied, however, that the name given by the founders was [...] "El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles de Porciuncula", or [...] "the town of Our Lady of the Angels of Porciuncula." [...] and that the map was in error.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in Park Ridge to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had {{arranged}} with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy {{what he had to}} discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the Daily Herald from Amirante's desk; <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: [...] "This boy is dead.

2500|$|The DVLMF categorically {{denied it}} was in any {{financial}} difficulty. It admitted spending $4.9 million on fundraising in 2005, most of it to purchase personalized items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, stadium [...] blankets, and umbrellas to mail to potential donors. But such expenditures were paying off, it said. The foundation had mailed 8.5 million letters to potential donors by March 2007, and received 749,306 donations with an average value of $16.58. Fenstermacher asserted that steep initial investment costs were to be expected, and that non-final 2006 fundraising figures were [...] "stellar". Bob Montgomery, Pope's attorney, also justified the fundraising strategy. [...] "You have to have parties...," [...] he told the Palm Beach Post, noting that people gave money at these types of events. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gala hosted in 2006 by the DVLMF in Palm Beach which raised $500,000.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 12 March 2012, advocate depute Alex Prentice QC began addressing the jury. He {{told them that the}} Crown case was that Mr Gilroy had killed Ms Pilley in the basement of her office before hiding her body in a recess. That Mr Gilroy had then brought his car from home and put Ms Pilley's body in the boot and the next day transported her to a [...] "lonely grave" [...] somewhere in Argyll. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sudden interruption" [...] in Ms Pilley's life since she had vanished. In particular, he highlighted that she had made no contact with anyone, there had been no activity on her credit cards and she had not made any arrangements for her pet fish and cat. It was also said that the lack of calls and texts from Mr Gilroy after Ms Pilley went missing suggested he knew she was already dead and that he had her phone. The advocate depute also reminded the jury that Mr Gilroy had gone on a journey of [...] "no importance" [...] the day after she had disappeared instead of [...] "assisting the police inquiry".|$|E
2500|$|Through {{his opinion}} in Harmelin, Justice Scalia voiced his {{disagreement}} with the Court's decision in Solem v. Helm, , which was decided before he {{was appointed to the}} Court. He first identified the English Declaration of Rights of 1689 as the source of the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. [...] According to Scalia, Solem assumed that the Americans who adopted the Eighth Amendment in 1791 understood that language {{in the same way as}} the English of 1689. Scalia disputed this hypothesis. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dispute among historians about which royal abuses the Declaration was intended to combat. Some historians contend that these abuses were the harsh punishments for treasondrawing and quartering, beheading, disembowelingmeted out by the Bloody Assizes. Other historians contend that the Declaration was meant to rein in the enormously arbitrary sentencing power the king had exercised in sentencing a notorious perjurer. Regardless, Scalia argued that those who wrote the Declaration considered a punishment to be [...] "cruel and unusual" [...] only if it were outside of the judge's power to impose. [...] The phrase [...] "'cruel and unusual' is treated as interchangeable with 'cruel and illegal.'" [...] For this reason, the English of the 17th century did not believe a [...] "cruel and unusual" [...] punishment was a disproportionate one.|$|E

2500|$|McNamara {{was shown}} first hand {{accounts}} of negative diagnoses {{of the military}} progress which contradicted the optimistic statements {{that he had been}} accustomed to giving. At one point during a military inspection tour, he visited a government [...] "open arms" [...] camp near Tam Kỳ. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> weapon from a pile of arms captured from Viet Cong insurgents and triumphantly asked [...] "Is this Chinese?" [...] only to be told by his embarrassed Vietnamese guide that it was an American rifle which had been earlier captured by the communists. Following a briefing from senior army officers which glossed over the capture of two towns in An Xuyên Province by the communists, Taylor and McNamara asked a major stationed at Cần Thơ to assess the situation. The young officer did not toe the line of his senior officers and gave a detailed and gloomy account of the situation before encouraging his colleagues to comment. According to Forrestal, [...] "all hell broke loose." [...] By the end of the trip, Bundy conceded that the evidence was eye opening, commenting that [...] "I was left, as I think McNamara was, with a lasting skepticism of the ability of any man, however honest, to interpret accurately what was going on." ...|$|E
