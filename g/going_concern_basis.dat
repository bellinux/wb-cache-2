40|$|Where a {{business}} becomes insolvent and its rescue {{is predicated on}} a going concern sale or transfer to another employer, there is a tension between employee protection and the rescue of insolvent but viable businesses. There is a consensus that employees deserve protection when the business that employs them becomes insolvent and is transferred to another employer on a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>basis,</b> yet extensive levels of employee protection can jeopardise going concern business sales by increasing the level of liabilities assumed by the purchaser. Business rescue and employee protection goals of insolvency law and employment law respectively are not inevitably incompatible. Opinions are divided, however, on the best means for achieving compatibility. This thesis uses theory to establish how the tension between these goals may be addressed. There is a perception that the European-derived provisions concerning the protection of employees’ rights, {{in the context of}} insolvent business transfers, are inimical to the rescue culture in the United Kingdom. While the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) are necessary in ensuring that employees’ rights are not walked over during transfers of insolvent businesses, it is equally important that policy makers take into account the fact that the rescue and continuity of such businesses would yield a better result for the employees, in terms of job security, than would be the case if they are liquidated...|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) in the European Union, the qualitative requirements for bank regulatory capital have changed. These changes aim at implementing in Europe the Basel III principles for better bank capital that is able to absorb losses of banks, without hindering the continued operations of banks. The qualitative requirements introduced with effect from 1 January 2014 do not relate to the measures introduced in Europe for bank’s recovery and resolution nor do they relate to the additional capital requirements imposed on systematically important banks. They also are not related to the newest requirements to be introduced in respect of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) capital to assist with resolution of the largest G-SIB’s. One of the topics researched in this contribution concerns the direct horizontal effect of European regulations. This topic is relevant to address the potential consequences of contractual provisions in bank capital instruments conflicting with the CRR rules and, similarly, conflicts with bank corporate organizational documents. We conclude that in view of the direct binding effect in European jurisdictions of regulations, the CRR provisions create direct binding effects between banks and their shareholders and bond investors. Another topic addressed in this contribution concerns the original concepts introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as regards capital requirements for banks that are beyond a point of viability. The CRR qualitative requirements for bank’s regulatory capital assume the bank’s operations are continued on a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>basis</b> and therefore the bank’s business is still viable. Measures to be taken gone concern and potential bail in mechanisms applied in that respect are regulated in other parts of European law.

40|$|By {{means of}} a company merger {{formerly}} legally and economically independent companies are tied up to an economic entity. To order the financial state of affairs after the merger, the current shareholders must revalue their stake in the merged company. The interest {{is focused on the}} valuation of shares and, consequently, on the allocation of the future economic benefits of the merged company to each owner. Despite the apparent relevance of company mergers in practice, the scientific literature deals with this topic only in an unsatisfying manner. After some early simple model-oriented approaches with the aim to define an ideal exchange ratio, the valuation problem of a merger was taken up again not earlier than in Hering (2004). Based on his considerations, the aim of our paper is to extend and generalize the valuation methods for a company merger and foremost to set the algebra for the computation of the critical share by using maximization of wealth as target function on a firm foundation. We assign a certain marginal quota to the shareholders representing the minimum share in the merged company which puts them in a financial position no worse than compared to the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>basis.</b> For this reason, we introduce the state marginal quota model as an innovative valuation approach that considers both existing market imperfections and individual expectations of a specific shareholder. To pinpoint our key finding: If private financial redistributions are available, our extended and generalized model shows that the marginal quota ?* in question cannot be 2 ̆ 01 ctrivially 2 ̆ 01 d obtained as a ratio of utilities. Instead, it is essential to consider the private decision field of a shareholder to allow a restructuring of the dividend payout stream offered by the merged company in order to reach at least a level of utility which is comparable to the state before the merger...|$|E

The research objective is two-fold and addresses whether the presence of a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> opinion is associated with (1) the quantity of forward-looking disclosures and (2) the clarity of the forward-looking disclosures. We examine MD&A disclosures from a sample of 2, 365 financially distressed companies over the fiscal years 2010 - 2014 and find that while the absolute number of forward-looking disclosures is lower for companies receiving a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> opinion, the proportion of forward-looking disclosures in the MD&A is greater {{in the presence of a}} <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> opinion.
