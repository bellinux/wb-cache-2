5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) are {{summoned to}} the ensuing hostage {{situation}} by Agent Lucy Kazdin (CCH Pounder), since Barry insists {{that he is an}} alien abductee. Mulder contacts Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) for assistance, asking her to look into Barry's history. Mulder acts as a hostage negotiator, calling Barry in order to earn his trust so that the standoff may be peacefully resolved. Barry quickly figures this out, causing Mulder to learn that he is a former FBI agent. A power outage occurs, frightening Barry and causing him to fire his gun, hitting one of the hostages. Mulder heads inside the travel agency with a paramedic. Barry releases the wounded hostage in exchange for Mulder, who is instructed to get Barry near the agency's front <b>door</b> <b>so</b> that snipers can fire on him.|$|E

25|$|Urinals in {{high-capacity}} washrooms {{are usually}} arranged {{in one or}} more rows directly opposite the <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> that users have their backs to people entering or standing outside. Urinals in the street may be arranged in a circle, with all users facing the center, with partitions high enough that they cannot wet each other, and usually high enough that they cannot see over. In a street urinal with an outside screen or wall, the users may stand back to back.|$|E

25|$|Because St. Christopher offered {{protection}} to travelers and against sudden death, many churches placed images or statues of him, usually opposite the south <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> {{he could be}} easily seen. He is usually depicted as a giant of a man, with a child {{on his shoulder and}} a staff in one hand. In England, there are more wall paintings of St. Christopher than of any other saint; in 1904, Mrs. Collier, writing for the British Archaeological Association, reported 183 paintings, statues, and other representations of the saint, outnumbering all others except for the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|The Police box was {{introduced}} in the United States in 1877 and was used in the United Kingdom throughout the 20th century. It is a public telephone kiosk or callbox for the use of members of the police, or for members of the public to contact the police. Unlike an ordinary callbox, its telephone was located behind a hinged <b>door</b> <b>so</b> it could be used from the outside, and the interior of the box was, in effect, a miniature police station for use by police officers to read and fill in reports, take meal breaks and even temporarily hold prisoners until the arrival of transport.|$|E
25|$|This {{left the}} receiver, time base {{system and the}} display inside the {{aircraft}} cabin. There was ample room for this in the Beaufighter where the radar operator sat {{at the back of}} the fuselage. In the Mosquito, the radar operator sat to the right and slightly behind the pilot. The main entry door was located on the left side of the fuselage, just in front of the radar operator. With the radar installed, this left almost no room to reach the <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> the time base circuitry was mounted on rails that allowed it to be slid up and forward, out of the way of the door. Among the parts inside the aircraft were the Type 73 display and the TR.3152 Lucero.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, {{a longer}} car set was rebuilt: Two {{unidirectional}} vehicles (SSB 714 and 735) were joined together as one bi-directional vehicle. The vehicle had no additional <b>doors,</b> <b>so</b> {{only the two}} doors {{in the direction of}} travel were usable.|$|R
25|$|As {{his celebrity}} {{grew in the}} late 1950s, he grew tired of being {{approached}} by strangers, and particularly disliked being visited by them at home. Another of his unverifiable stories had him keeping a suitcase by the front <b>door</b> <b>so</b> that he could claim to be just leaving, a practice {{he claimed to have}} abandoned after a helpful young man insisted on taking him to the railway station and had to be sent off to buy a paper so that Lowry could buy a ticket for just one stop without revealing his deceit. However, he was polite to the residents of Mottram, who respected him and his privacy; he used the bus to get about the area in his retirement. A bronze statue of him was erected at the traffic lights in the village.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the procession, the Epitaphios {{is brought}} back to the church. Sometimes, after the clergy carry the Epitaphios in, they will stop just inside the {{entrance}} to the church, and hold the Epitaphios above the <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> that all who enter the church will pass under it (symbolically entering into the grave with Christ) and then kiss the Gospel Book. In Greek churches, the Epitaphios is then brought directly to the sanctuary, where it remains on the Holy Table until Ascension Thursday. In Slavic churches, it is brought back to the catafalque {{in the middle of the}} church (and may be honoured further with more petals, rosewater and incense), where it remains until the Midnight Office at the Paschal Vigil on Great Saturday night. Where the Epitaphios remains in the centre of the church, the faithful will continue to venerate it throughout Great Saturday.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the party}} {{attendees}} expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to {{come back into the}} house and complete the performance. Both women came back into the house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the <b>door</b> <b>so</b> they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] Guy said, [...] "we must pile {{everything}} {{that we can find}} below against these <b>doors,</b> <b>so</b> that when they yield we can still make a defence here, before we retire. Are there other stairs than these?" ...|$|R
50|$|The next such {{rescheduling}} was in 2017 between Ultramarina Tarrafal of São Nicolau and Mindelo's Mindelense of São Vicente as Estádio Orlando Rodrigues had {{no extra}} keys for opening its <b>doors</b> <b>so</b> players {{can play a}} first leg match along with the personnel.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 {{another project}} made the crypt {{accessible}} to disabled visitors, and opened previously unused <b>doors</b> <b>so</b> that the visitor route no longer requires the 100% backtracking {{that was necessary}} before. The entire crypt was also air conditioned to prevent deterioration of the tombs.|$|R
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front <b>door</b> <b>so</b> that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up, and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song are simple, written as an {{invitation}} to dance with the singer. Despite the simple lyrics, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. Similar to Madonna's previous single [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984), a lyrical hook is also present in [...] "Into the Groove", directed at shy girls. The line [...] "At night I lock the <b>door</b> <b>so</b> no-one else can see" [...] implied that Madonna was not as brazen as her provocative image suggested. According to Barker, the nostalgic people would instantly recognize the song's lyrics at night clubs. He added that the line, [...] "Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free," [...] expresses the freedom that a dance floor brings about, with the dancers happy to find freedom in the music. A neume is visible in the line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me", which Barker believed, blurred the boundaries of reality and brought one closer {{to the world of}} fantasy.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that <b>door</b> <b>so</b> quick we didn't hear it shut. I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E

50|$|Genensky {{was proud}} of an {{achievement}} which he claims helps vision-impaired daily while negotiating public areas: he encouraged supervisors of California's public buildings to add raised circular or triangle-shaped markings to restroom <b>doors,</b> <b>so</b> by touch a person can determine which restroom is for which gender.|$|R
500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky {{became the}} second game to use Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine, after Lure of the Temptress. According to Cecil, the {{original}} version of the engine seemed less applicable in Beneath a Steel Sky, {{as the ability to}} issue commands conflicted with the gameplay they intended to create. Lure of the Temptress had one story that was moved forward by a key event, whereas Beneath a Steel Sky had multiple threads. In one way this presented them with [...] "exciting gameplay opportunities, but in others it cordoned off more ambitious ideas in terms of multilinearity." [...] As a consequence, some of the engine's features were scaled back. Tony Warriner and David Sykes, both Revolution co-founders and programmers, had to update the engine, which was part of the new deal with Virgin Interactive. As an example of change in the updated engine, Virtual Theatre 2.0, Warriner explained that in Lure of the Temptress, the system controlled everything, for instance specific routines to a <b>door.</b> <b>So</b> if there was a door on-screen, the door-routine was called up to handle it. The consequence was that every door looked the same and acted the same, so if a door was somewhat different from the last one, it caused a problem. This was changed in the new system, as it was object oriented and no distinction was made between a proper object like a door or key.|$|E
2500|$|..... completes what, perhaps, may {{be termed}} a trilogy; for, though very {{different}} in scope, {{each of the three}} books deals with certain conceptions that have an elemental kinship. With this book, the author believes that he closes the <b>door,</b> <b>so</b> far as he is concerned, on a particular phase of constructive thought." ...|$|E

60|$|Our friend Charley, too, {{thought the}} evening {{the best time}} to hear Grandfather's stories, because he could not then be playing out of <b>doors.</b> <b>So</b> finding his young {{auditors}} unanimous in their petition, the good old gentleman took up the narrative of the historic chair at the point where he had dropped it.|$|R
50|$|A-pillars aren't {{necessary}} {{as there are}} no side <b>doors,</b> <b>so</b> the windscreen can extend from the front {{to the back of}} the car, giving the driver a field of vision of more than 180 degrees and minimising blind spots. A-pillars are sometimes still added, like with the Sterling Nova, to give the car a more conventional look.|$|R
2500|$|In 1932–33, {{when the}} Nazis came to power, {{the head of}} Ufa decided {{to get rid of}} all Jews so Pressburger was told his {{contract}} wouldn't be renewed. He left his Berlin apartment, [...] "leaving the key in the <b>door</b> <b>so</b> that the Stormtroopers wouldn't have to break the door down" [...] and went to Paris.|$|E
2500|$|The Hensleigh Wedgwoods {{were now}} living {{next door to}} Erasmus. In early June 1838 they were visited for a week by Catherine Darwin and Emma Wedgwood, {{returning}} from a family get-together in Paris.

2500|$|The actress Lucy Speed – {{seventeen}} at {{the time}} – was chosen to play the part. Speed claims that she was cast due to her “cranky” attitude during her audition. She comments “I showed up there with an attitude, not giving ‘a stuff’ whether I got the damn part and they responded to that. They liked it, liked my feistiness, {{they thought it was}} the quality they were looking for…Natalie was a pretty gloomy kid, not a sunny show-biz kid which is all they'd been seeing until I walked through the <b>door.</b> <b>So</b> I got the part.” ...|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{however, the}} {{audience}} {{had been growing}} more and more numerous every moment; there was hardly standing-room round {{the top of the}} companion; and the strange instinct of the race moved some of the new-comers to close both the <b>doors,</b> <b>so</b> that the atmosphere grew insupportable. It was a good place, as the saying is, to leave.|$|R
50|$|Four wide {{pedestrian}} {{access points}} {{are located on}} the streets Haymarket (clock tower), Belgrave Gate, Charles Street and Humberstone Gate. Noticeably, there are no <b>doors</b> <b>so</b> no bottlenecks occur during busy periods. Some of the outlets can only be accessed from the street and some can only be accessed from the mall. The larger stores can be accessed either way.|$|R
