5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double policy. On {{the one hand}} John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade. On the other hand, not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, he allowed for such trade to {{continue}} and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them. However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|At its height, Nagar {{encompassed}} most of {{the southwestern}} half of the Khabur Basin, and was a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> political equal of the Eblaite and Mariote states. The kingdom included at least 17 subordinate cities, such as Hazna, and most importantly Nabada, which was a city-state annexed by Nagar, {{and served as a}} provincial capital. Nagar was involved in the wide diplomatic network of Ebla, and the relations between the two kingdoms involved both confrontations and alliances. A text from Ebla mention a victory of Ebla's king (perhaps Irkab-Damu) over Nagar. However, a few years later, a treaty was concluded, and the relations progressed toward a dynastic marriage between princess Tagrish-Damu of Ebla, and prince Ultum-Huhu, Nagar's monarch's son.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the {{highlands}} around Imerina were wracked with violent conflict among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united {{a number of these}} principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy to the east and Sahasarotra to the south. As he brought each territory under his control, he restricted the autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict submission to his own authority. His <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of {{different}} countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> trade relations between the two countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1805 U.S. Lieutenant Zebulon Pike {{was sent}} by General Wilkinson, {{governor}} of the Louisiana Territory, to enforce U.S. sovereignty against British traders {{in the area and}} establish <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> trading relationships with the native tribes. He met with the Sioux leadership in central Minnesota to secure rights for the U.S. to an area near Saint Anthony Falls, which would later become the city of Saint Paul. Though a treaty was signed by some leaders from the Sioux tribes, its legitimacy (including whether the Sioux understood it) was dubious and ultimately his efforts did little to establish the authority of the U.S. in the area.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{reached the}} peak of its {{political}} and strategic power {{in relation to the}} United States. The first SALT Treaty effectively established parity in nuclear weapons between the two superpowers, the Helsinki Treaty legitimised Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe, and the United States defeat in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal weakened the prestige of the United States. Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would be tempted to strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, {{the treaty}} pushed American {{diplomatic}} relations away from France and towards Great Britain, as the French government {{concluded that it}} violated the Franco-American treaty of 1778, and that the U.S. government had accepted the treaty against the overwhelming public sentiment against it. This set {{up a series of}} <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> political conflicts over the ensuing four years, culminating in {{what became known as the}} Quasi-War. The Jay Treaty also helped ensure American control of its own frontier lands. After the signing of treaty, the British withdrew their support from several Native Americans tribes, while the Spanish, fearing that the Jay Treaty signaled the creation of an Anglo-American alliance, sought to appease the United States.|$|E

5|$|Patroclus was {{a leading}} {{official}} and admiral under Ptolemy II, {{best known for his}} activity during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). His early career is obscure, but it must have been distinguished enough for him to rise to the chief priesthood of Alexander and the Theoi Adelphoi in 271/270 BC. After the outbreak of the Chremonidean War, he led a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> military expedition to the Aegean Sea that expanded Ptolemaic control by establishing bases at Crete, Ceos, Thera, Attica and the Argolid. From these bases he tried, without much success, to aid the Athenians against Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedon. He may have been the defeated Ptolemaic commander at the Battle of Cos, which marked the end of Ptolemaic thalassocracy.|$|E
5|$|Rainivoninahitriniony's {{tenure as}} sole Prime Minister was short lived. His violent tendencies, {{irritability}} and insolence toward Rasoherina, {{in addition to}} lingering popular resentment over Rainivoninahitriniony's role in the violent end to Radama's rule, gradually turned {{the opinion of the}} nobles against him. As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, while simultaneously overseeing <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other peoples, who viewed the coup as an indication of weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any {{notion that the}} German Empire has any place in dictating the terms of peace. The authors also insist that the German populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>and</b> military power. Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so that the German state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
