The track was mixed by Biancaniello and Watters. The song was initially written with Christina Aguilera in mind, later it was also being considered as a duet for Rihanna and Chris Brown but the news broke that Brown had assaulted Rihanna, and Jive CEO Barry Weiss then decided to give [...] "Battlefield" [...] to Sparks. [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Sparks revealed that {{while she was in}} the studio working on another song with Wilkins, he asked her if he could play her a demo of [...] "Battlefield". Sparks was pleased with the demo that was presented to her and asked her A <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> the song. She later received a phone call which confirmed that she was to record [...] "Battlefield". Sparks further elaborated about the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Lewis {{began to}} conceptualise her third album Glassheart {{in the second}} half of 2010, shortly after {{completing}} her first headline concert tour, The Labyrinth. [...] "Trouble" [...] was one of the earlier songs recorded by Lewis, and one of several tracks that Lewis worked on with British duo Emeli Sandé and Naughty Boy. Sandé first conceived the loose concepts for [...] "Trouble" [...] in 2009. It was not until British hip-hop artist Tinie Tempah began working with Sandé for his own debut album Disc-Overy (2011), that [...] "Trouble" [...] was pitched to Lewis; Tempah approached Lewis to record [...] "Trouble" [...] as a duet with himself. Upon hearing the demo, Lewis asked Tempah <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> the song and subsequently entered the recording studios with Sandé and Fraser T Smith to record and finish the song. Sandé later wrote two more songs for Lewis, including [...] "I to You" [...] and [...] "Sugar". A fourth song, [...] "Mountains", was reclaimed by Sandé and was recorded for her debut album Our Version of Events (2012).|$|E
500|$|As {{in other}} crises, Chamorro's ability to {{compromise}} was pivotal. The {{executive and legislative}} branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but {{the president had to}} be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government; and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote. Though some of the changes also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures—creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others—failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration's ability to prosecute, it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek transitional justice. [...] Sofía Montenegro, editor of the Sandinistan paper Barricada and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have,</b> but others, like Bishop Bernardo Hombach, are confident that her faith would have required her to forgive. Prosecutions would have prolonged conflict and harsh retaliation would not have brought about the reconciliation and peace she desired.|$|E

2500|$|The second film further {{developed}} her origin, {{and gave}} significantly {{more details about}} her radical design. It revealed most significantly she was an experimental reproductive model of replicant (who ultimately had a daughter to Deckard) {{with a high degree}} of human organs in comparison to replicant parts. She has an internal human bone structure, natural eyes, hair, skin and reproductive organs. This explains her uncanny ability to pass as human. Thus the film suggests it was only her mind and possibly other vital organs which were the replicant parts. As she died during childbirth, of complications related to a caesarean section, it remains uncertain <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> lived beyond the four years.|$|E
2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying {{that she could have}} done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun.... I was doing everything I could think of to protect my husband and keep him alive." ...|$|E

On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, she said that Icke's book Human Race Get Off Your Knees (in which he claims that Earth's moon is a [...] "gigantic spacecraft" [...] transmitting [...] "fake reality broadcast...in {{much the same way}} as portrayed in the Matrix movie trilogy") would be her choice <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> only one book. Walker has also praised this book on her website. She said that upon reading the book she [...] "felt it was the first time I was able to observe, and mostly imagine and comprehend, the root of the incredible evil that has engulfed our planet." [...] Jonathan Kay of the National Post said that Walker's public praise for Icke's book was [...] "stunningly offensive" [...] and that by taking it seriously, she was disqualifying herself [...] "from the mainstream marketplace of ideas." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 June 1994, Palmer {{was playing}} at a neighbour's house in Henrietta Street, Hartlepool, after being {{collected}} from nursery school by her stepfather, John Thornton. At approximately 15:30, Gary Amerigo, the local ice cream vendor, arrived and Palmer went to ask Thornton <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{money to buy}} an ice pop. She was the only customer, and after serving her, the ice cream salesman left and continued his route. Amerigo said later: [...] "Only Rosie came up to my van that day. She didn't have enough money but I gave her the ice-cream anyway. She seemed just her usual self, bright and cheerful." [...] Armstrong — who was celebrating his 32nd birthday that day — abducted her as she walked away after making her purchase. It was approximately two hours before Thornton realised Palmer was no longer at the neighbour's or playing outside the house. He and other local residents began to search the local area for her, and at 20:45 she was reported missing to the police.|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Stuart Tave {{noted that}} a major theme of Austen's novel is propriety, as she both mocks those who cling {{outwardly}} to propriety, often in a self-righteous manner without understanding what it really means and praises those who really live up to it. Those who really understand propriety in Austen's novel take into account both the feelings of others and draw the appropriate conclusions. Tave argued that the play Lover's Vows is {{a test of the}} character's commitment to propriety. The priggish Mrs. Norris sees herself as the guardian of propriety and is trusted by Sir Thomas before he leaves for Antigua to uphold propriety, a task she fails at completely by letting Lover's Vows be put on. Edmund objects to the play, as he knows it violates propriety in some way, but he fails to make the point, as bases his objections in specific matters rather the universal one of propriety. Only Fanny understands this point as she knows that playing the characters will also impact on the amateur actors, but she is not strong enough to persuade the others of her viewpoint. As the rehearsals continued, Fanny could clearly see the sexual tension and attraction between Edmund and Mary as they play the part of the two lovers, which fills her with misery and jealousy. Tave wrote about Price and the play: [...] "Excluded from the gaiety and busy employment of others, alone, sad, insignificant, seeing Mrs. Grant promoted to consequence and honor because Mrs. Grant accepted the character she herself refused, Fanny is in some danger of envying her. What distinguishes Fanny here, and throughout, is that she is capable of thought and recovery, and in this instance, reflection brings better feelings, showing her that even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> received the greatest respect she would never have been easy. It would have been easier to join a scheme, which considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether". Finally, Tave suggests that when Sir Thomas shuts down Lover's Vows, this demonstrates the hypocrisy and myopic character of Sir Thomas as he is content to destroy the set and props without considering just what had led his children into putting on Lover's Vows in the first place as he is only concerned with the external aspects of people, not what really drives them.|$|E
2500|$|Five months later, when Louise suffers burns {{from being}} pushed into lit candles by bully Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven), Ben {{contacts}} Phil. Phil turns {{up at the}} hospital, who is unimpressed with Lisa's presence and Lisa, Sharon and Louise ask Phil to give Lisa a chance. Lisa apologises to Phil for the past mistakes regarding Louise and says that they both {{need to be there}} for her, but Phil physically throws Lisa out of the hospital, ordering her to stay away from Louise. Lisa stays with Louise at the hospital and Lisa stands up to Phil, telling him she is not going and Phil allows Lisa to visit Louise. Phil warns Lisa not to mess up. The doctor gives Lisa consent to take Louise outside and Lisa tells Louise she has been discharged. Lisa plans to take Louise, going to Liverpool Street station. Phil and Sharon find Louise's room empty and the doctor reassures them of Lisa and Louise's whereabouts, although they find Louise's belongings gone. Phil is angry as the doctor explains how Louise is at a crucial stage in her recovery and the police tell Phil and Sharon what they are doing. Phil and Sharon are told Lisa switched cabs and find Lisa's flat, which is empty. Louise wakes up and Lisa lies to her that she and Phil agreed for her to be away from the square while Phil and Sharon question Lisa's capabilities. The police, Phil and Sharon discuss Lisa being traced through her cash withdrawals in Castle Point and that she has a mental health team. [...] Louise is in agony without her medication and Lisa prevents Louise from using the phone by cutting the cord. Louise realises Lisa is not taking her medication. Louise's phone dies as she tries to phone the police and Lisa prevents Louise from leaving, but when Lisa allows her to go, Louise chooses to stay with and comfort Lisa when she is distressed. Bex gives Phil and Sharon information on a hotel where Lisa and Louise are and compared to Sharon, Phil shows a lack of regard to Lisa's mental health. Phil finds Louise but she tells him to leave. Phil gains entry to their room and Lisa hits Phil over the head with a phone. Phil shouts at a struggling Lisa as Louise deteriorates and Lisa and Louise go to hospital together. Louise asks Phil <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> inherited Lisa's condition and Phil admits his part in causing Lisa's illness. Louise confides in Phil about her guilt of leaving Lisa when she was ill and she rubbishes Phil's belief he is a bad father.|$|E
