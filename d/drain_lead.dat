Under this condition, we analyze the time evolution of a Gaussian-shaped superposition of plane waves incoming from the source lead, and found that the wave packet can be splitted into three packets at the <b>drain</b> <b>lead.</b> This spatial pattern manifests in a direct way the peculiarities of the conductance in energy space.

40|$|Field {{programmable}} logic devices provide a cost and time {{efficient way to}} create new microcontroller designs. These qualities are particular useful and desirable for high temperature applications in hostile environments above 250 °C. Starting from summarizing the present state-of-the-art in SIMOX high temperature developement the presented work introduces HTPAL devices {{as an example of}} a new class of {{programmable logic}} devices. These class is characterized by a range of features that were not available in am similar combination before: a wide temperature range from - 50 °C up to 250 °C and above, high resistance against ionizing radiation, flexible and permanent field programmability by the end user. The wide temperature range results from an avantageous circuit structure combined with the SIMOX technology. Permanent field programmability is achieved by using a new One-time-programmable (OTP) MOSFET device, called a TOXFET.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{searches for}} signatures of Majorana-like excitations in proximitized semiconducting nanowires involve conductance spectroscopy, where the evidence sought after is a robust zero-bias peak (in longer wires) and its characteristic field-dependent splitting (in shorter wires). Although experimental results partially confirm the theoretical predictions, commonly observed discrepancies still include (i) a zero-bias peak that is {{significantly lower than}} the predicted value of $ 2 e^ 2 /h$ and (ii) the absence of the expected "Majorana oscillations" of the lowest-energy modes at higher magnetic fields. Here, we investigate how the inevitable presence of a normal <b>drain</b> <b>lead</b> connected to the hybrid wire can affect the conductance spectrum of the hybrid wire. We present numerical results using a one-band model for the proximitized nanowire, where the superconductor is considered to be in the diffusive regime, described by semi-classical Green functions. We show how the presence of the normal drain could (at least partially) account for the observed discrepancies, and we complement this with analytic results providing more insights in the underlying physics.

40|$|Much {{interest}} has been drawn {{in recent years}} to the concept and realization of Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). NEMS are nanoscale devices that combine mechanical and electrical dynamics in a strong interplay. The shuttle devices are a particular kind of Nanoelectromechanical systems. The characteristic component that gives the name to these devices is an oscillating quantum dot of nanometer size that transfers electrons one-by-one between a source and a <b>drain</b> <b>lead.</b> The device represents the nano-scale analog of an electromechanical bell in which a metallic ball placed between the plates of a capacitor starts to oscillate when a high voltage is applied to the plates. This thesis contains the description and analysis of the dynamics of two realizations of quantum shuttle devices. We describe the dynamics using the Generalized Master Equation approach: a well-suited method to treat this kind of open quantum systems. We also classify the operating modes in three different regimes: the tunneling, the shuttling and the coexistence regime. The characterization of these regimes is given in terms of three investigation tools: Wigner distribution functions, current and current-noise. The essential dynamics of these regimes is captured by three simplified models whose derivation from the full description is possible due to the time scale separation of the particular regime. We also obtain from these simplified models a more intuitive picture of the variety of different dynamics exhibited by the shuttle devices. Comment: 166 pages, 40 figures, Ph.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), {{in which the}} single mode of a nanomechanical oscillator {{plays the role of}} an active device, is receiving much attention due to its technological importance. The characteristic component that gives the name to these devices is an oscillator of nanometer size coupled to the electrons on the dot that transfer electrons one-by-one between a source and a <b>drain</b> <b>lead.</b> From a fundamental point of view, {{it is important to understand}} the interplay between the electronic transport and the nanomechanical motion of the oscillator quantum mechanically. This thesis contains the description and analysis of the dynamics of a nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a resonant tunnel junction (RTJ) and its realization as a shuttle device. The models we consider describe both the mechanical and electrical degrees of freedom quantum mechanically; Firstly, a RTJ coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator. Secondly, we report a first complete quantum mechanical analysis of a charge shuttle. We introduce a new non-perturbative quantum mechanical description for the strong interaction of both the electrical and the mechanical object, which is beyond the existing experiments. We describe a nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism: a well suited technique to treat this kind of far from equilibrium systems, which can deal with very small to very large applied bias. The numerical implementation of these models are discussed in detail, and the transient and the steady state behavior of the system is also considered here for the quantum dynamics of the oscillator as a function of time. This will provide useful insight for the design of experiments aimed at studying the quantum behavior of an oscillator.
