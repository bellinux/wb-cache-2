60|$|<b>Hare-Lip</b> spat loudly his disgust, and Granser {{hastened to}} make amends.|$|E
6000|$|And {{when it was}} {{all done}} me and the <b>hare-lip</b> had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things. The <b>hare-lip</b> she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She says: ...|$|E
5000|$|Two [...] "brothers" [...] (Gabriel and Elias) are {{informed}} after their father's death {{that they both}} are adopted half-brothers. They discover that their biological father is Evelio Thanatos, a geneticist specialised in stem cell research. To learn about their mother and to meet their biological father, the brothers choose to visit the Island of Ork where they {{find out that they}} have three other half-brothers (Franz, Josef and Gregor). Both Gabriel and Elias are welcomed with a beating, but in due course, the brothers get along. All five half-brothers have <b>hare-lips</b> and unattractive facial features or deformities.|$|R
2500|$|Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations {{in spite}} of vocal tract anatomy {{differences}} in size and shape due to gender, age and individual anatomical variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: dentists recognize three basic shapes of palate: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of malocclusion between the two jaws; nine ways teeth relate to the dental arch and {{a wide range of}} maxillary and mandible deformities. [...] Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and dental caries. Other factors that do not impede [...] the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation [...] are gross oral deformations such as <b>hare-lips,</b> cleft palates or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in ventriloquism). Paranasal sinuses [...] vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their [...] asymmetry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} cannot count beyond ten, so I will tell you. Hold up your two hands. On {{both of them}} you have {{altogether}} ten fingers and thumbs. Very well. I now take this grain of sand--you hold it, Hoo-Hoo." [...] He dropped the grain of sand into the lad's palm and went on. [...] "Now that grain of sand stands for the ten fingers of Edwin. I add another grain. That's ten more fingers. And I add another, and another, and another, until I have added as many grains as Edwin has fingers and thumbs. That makes what I call one hundred. Remember that word--one hundred. Now I put this pebble in <b>Hare-Lip's</b> hand. It stands for ten grains of sand, or ten tens of fingers, or one hundred fingers. I put in ten pebbles. They stand for a thousand fingers. I take a mussel-shell, and it stands for ten pebbles, or one hundred grains of sand, or one thousand fingers...." [...] And so on, laboriously, and with much reiteration, he strove to build up in their minds a crude conception of numbers. As the quantities increased, he had the boys holding different magnitudes in each of their hands. For still higher sums, he laid the symbols on the log of driftwood; and for symbols he was hard put, being compelled to use the teeth from the skulls for millions, and the crab-shells for billions. It was here that he stopped, for the boys were showing signs of becoming tired.|$|R
60|$|<b>Hare-Lip</b> {{leaped to}} his feet, giving {{a quick glance}} at the {{pasturing}} goats and the afternoon sun.|$|E
60|$|It was at {{this point}} that <b>Hare-Lip</b> rose to his feet, an {{expression}} of huge contempt on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a gabble the old geezer makes," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> remarked, when, {{the teeth}} all extracted, they began {{an attempt at}} equal division.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are brothers, I know, for I {{have heard}} them {{talk in the}} dark, on deck, when they thought no one listened," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> explained.|$|E
6000|$|Well, Mary Jane she lit out {{the back}} way, I reckon; because nobody see her go. When I struck Susan and the <b>hare-lip,</b> I says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There you go!" [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> cried hotly. [...] "Cut out {{the funny}} stuff and talk sensible. What's interested? You talk {{like a baby}} that don't know how." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Hare-Lip</b> {{rubbed his}} bullet head reminiscently, {{and the boys}} {{returned}} to the old man, who was maundering ecstatically about Vesta, the squaw of {{the founder of the}} Chauffeur Tribe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Red is {{good enough}} for me," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> muttered obstinately. [...] "My dad calls red red, and he ought to know. He says {{everybody}} died of the Red Death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{have gone}} into the forest and got food for myself," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> announced; [...] "and if any man tried {{to take it away}} from me, I'd have killed him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' don't {{work all}} that funny lingo on us," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> went on. [...] "Talk sensible, Granser, like a Santa Rosan ought to talk. Other Santa Rosans don't talk like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} get Granser to {{remember}} this here gunpowder stuff," [...] Edwin said softly, [...] "and then I'll have you all on the run. You, <b>Hare-Lip,</b> will do my fighting for me and get my meat for me, and you, Hoo-Hoo, will send the death-stick for me and make everybody afraid. And if I catch <b>Hare-Lip</b> trying to bust your head, Hoo-Hoo, I'll fix him with that same gunpowder. Granser ain't such a fool as you think, and I'm {{going to listen to}} him and some day I'll be boss over the whole bunch of you." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Mary Jane {{she took}} another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly {{anything}} left o' poor <b>Hare-lip.</b> So she hollered.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now they}} will kill me," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> spluttered, [...] "for {{they will know}} I have told you. Yet am I not all a coward, and I will stay with you, master, and die with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't make me sit up," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> boasted to {{the would-be}} medicine-man. [...] "If I paid {{you for a}} sending of the death-stick and it didn't work, I'd bust in your head--understand, you Hoo-Hoo, you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] Edwin counselled soothingly. [...] "Granser's all right. He's just gettin' to the Scarlet Death, ain't you, Granser? He's just goin' to tell {{us about}} it right now. Sit down, <b>Hare-Lip.</b> Go ahead, Granser." ...|$|E
60|$|He was a German, {{and had a}} <b>hare-lip</b> and a most seductive {{gentleness}} of voice. I gladly {{make him}} historical. He sold me the Blue Rat, {{and gave me a}} chance to study a new type of horse.|$|E
60|$|<b>Hare-Lip</b> {{rose to his}} feet, glanced to {{see that}} the goats were safe, and looked at the sun's {{position}} in the afternoon sky, advertising impatience at the prolixity of the old man's tale. Urged to hurry by Edwin, Granser went on.|$|E
6000|$|Mary Jane {{she went}} for him, Susan and the <b>hare-lip</b> {{went for the}} duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And {{everybody}} crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time: ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she put her}} {{arm around}} the king on one side, and Susan and the <b>hare-lip</b> done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud. The doctor says: ...|$|E
60|$|He sprang {{into the}} blaze of sunlight, and from below several rifles pumped rapidly. Bullets smacked about him, and puffs of stone-dust flew out, but he won safely across. Grief followed, and so near did one bullet come that {{the dust of}} its impact stung his cheek. Nor was <b>Hare-Lip</b> struck, though he essayed the passage more slowly.|$|E
60|$|But Grief {{no longer}} heard. Through the trees, from the {{direction}} of the harbour, came a rattle of rifles, and he started on the run for the beach. Pirates from Tahiti and convicts from New Caledonia! A pretty bunch of desperadoes that even now was attacking his schooner. <b>Hare-Lip</b> followed, still spluttering and spitting his tale of the white devils' doings.|$|E
60|$|Then {{followed}} Hare-Lip's nightmare {{experiences as}} the schooner wandered {{on the long}} reaches to the westward. He was the one living witness and knew they would have killed him {{had he not been}} the cook. At Noumea five convicts had joined them. <b>Hare-Lip</b> was never permitted ashore at any of the islands, and Grief was the first outsider to whom he had spoken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Calling red scarlet," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> sneered, then {{returned}} to the attack on Granser. [...] "My dad told me, an' he got it from his dad afore he croaked, that your wife was a Santa Rosan, an' that she was sure no account. He said she was a hash-slinger before the Red Death, though I don't know what a hash-slinger is. You can tell me, Edwin." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Hare-Lip,</b> {{crushed by}} this metaphysical defeat, {{remained}} silent, {{and the old}} man went on. Often and often, though this narrative must not be clogged by the details, was Granser's tale interrupted while the boys squabbled among themselves. Also, among themselves they kept up a constant, low-voiced exchange of explanation and conjecture, as they strove to follow the old man into his unknown and vanished world.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you can't {{see these}} germ-things, Granser," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> objected, [...] "and here you gabble, gabble, gabble about {{them as if}} they was anything, when they're nothing at all. Anything you can't see, ain't, that's what. Fighting things that ain't with things that ain't! They must have been all fools in them days. That's why they croaked. I ain't goin' to believe in such rot, I tell you that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we are {{increasing}} rapidly--your sister, <b>Hare-Lip,</b> already has four children. We {{are increasing}} rapidly and making {{ready for a}} new climb toward civilization. In time, pressure of population will compel us to spread out, and a hundred generations from now we may expect our descendants to start across the Sierras, oozing slowly along, generation by generation, over the great continent to the colonization of the East--a new Aryan drift around the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "He had a rifle {{pointed at}} me, master; what could I do?" [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> whimpered. [...] "Of the rest, two {{went up the}} rigging and were shot. Fanriki was ten miles away. The others went {{overboard}} to swim. They were shot as they swam. I, only, lived, and the two devils; for me they wanted to cook for them. That day, with the breeze, {{they went back to}} Fanrika and took on Frans Amundson, for he was one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good for Chauffeur," [...] <b>Hare-Lip</b> commented in an {{undertone}} to {{the other}} boys. [...] "I remember him before he died. He was a corker. But he did things, and he made things go. You know, Dad married his daughter, an' you ought to see the way he knocked the spots outa Dad. The Chauffeur was a son-of-a-gun. He made us kids stand around. Even when he was croaking he reached out for me, once, an' laid my head open with that long stick he kept always beside him." ...|$|E
60|$|An old gunner's mate of the mess--Priming, the {{man with}} the <b>hare-lip,</b> who, true to his tribe, was charged to the muzzle with bile, and, moreover, rammed home on top of it a wad of sailor superstition--this gunner's mate indulged in some gloomy and savage remarks--strangely tinged with genuine feeling and grief--at the {{announcement}} of the sick-ness of Shenly, coming as it did not long after the almost fatal accident befalling poor Baldy, captain of the mizzen-top, another mess-mate of ours, and the dreadful fate of the amputated fore-top-man whom we buried in Rio, also our mess-mate.|$|E
60|$|When {{we got to}} {{the house}} {{the street in front of}} it was packed, and the three girls was {{standing}} in the door. Mary Jane WAS red-headed, but that don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the <b>hare-lip</b> jumped for the duke, and there they HAD it! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times.|$|E
