40|$|DC-AC Converters (inverters) are {{frequently}} employed as interfaces of distributed power sources and energy storage units to ac distribution grids. The approach of operating {{them as a}} voltage source with droop based control loops and using locally measured quantities offers {{an effective way to}} control the amount of active and reactive power they provide/absorb. In this way, fluctuating renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind, can help with power balancing, while <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> units can better share load variations without dedicated communication channels. Besides, it can allow a smooth transition of a micro-grid from the grid-tie to the autonomous mode in case of a grid fault. However, the dynamic response and steady state operation of a system with droop controlled inverters depends quite a bit on systems parameters, such as feeder impedances, {{as well as on the}} droop characteristics of the other units, what is not usually known. This work focuses on the analysis of the performance of droop controlled inverters operating in various conditions. First, a 10 kVA three-phase inverter with a dq (vector) voltage control loop and active power (P) vs. frequency (f) and reactive power (Q) vs. grid voltage magnitude (V) droop characteristics is designed. Then, its behavior when operating connected to a stiff grid is investigated. Time domain simulations with SIMULINK and the technique of root locus, for which a small signal model is derived, are used to observe how the droop factors, frequency of the low pass filters used in the power measurements and feeder impedance affect the dynamic response. Next, the operation of two <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> inverters in an autonomous micro-grid is considered. Again, the performance of the system is investigated with time domain simulations and root locus. The need for a virtual impedance loop as a means for allowing large droop factors to be used along with feeders with small inductances is observed and the effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated. The adverse impact of the conventional virtual impedance loop on the load voltage regulation is observed and an alternative implementation that minimizes this problem is proposed and its effectiveness is demonstrated. Finally, an autonomous micro-grid consisting of an inverter and a diesel engine generator set (genset) is studied. Time domain simulations are used to show that when the speed of response, in terms of power, of two <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> units is very different, the smallest one can be overloaded. An approach for slowing down the fastest unit is proposed to minimize this issue...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} dynamic frequency control in a diesel-based mini-grid. It is shown that a virtual synchronous machine (VSM) can support dynamic frequency control by adding virtual inertia and damping to the system. However, {{it is found that}} the typical formulation of damping power does not work properly when the <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> gen-set operates in droop mode because of the unknown stabilization value of the grid frequency. As a solution to this problem, an estimator for the stabilization frequency that works in conjunction with the damping function of the VSM is proposed. Theoretical and experimental results provide evidence of a satisfactory performance of the proposed VSM with estimator for different values of the gen-set droop factor. The estimated stabilization frequency converges in approximately 2 s and the maximum frequency deviation during the transient is reduced in 34 %, on average. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Microgrids {{are highly}} {{compatible}} with photovoltaic (PV) sources {{because of their}} ability to internally aggregate and balance multiple PV sources without imposing restrictions on the penetration of such intermittent power sources. There are two major types of inverter control configurations that are used in photovoltaic inverters to provide an interface to a CERTS microgrid. These control configurations exhibit important duality characteristics, and both are capable of tracking maximum input power while abiding by the CERTS droop algorithms. This paper investigates and demonstrates the comparative performance characteristics of these two major controller types: 1) a gridforming droop-style controller similar to those used for controlling distributed generators; and 2) a current-regulated grid-follower controller. It is shown that only the grid-forming controller allows a PV source to operate alone in an islanded CERTS microgrid, but the grid-follower controller enjoys some inherent advantages with regard to faster dynamic response.

40|$|A battery {{energy storage}} system (BESS) was {{conceived}} {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and maintenance costs of diesel-hybrid mini-grids [1]. It operates in 2 different modes. In the genset support mode, it balances the load and maintains a unity PF for genset, and it supplies/absorbs power to force the genset to operate with higher efficiency, less mechanical vibrations and less risk of carbon build-up. In the <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> mode, it provides a balanced voltage to the highly unbalanced load, common in small autonomous power systems. In this Thesis, this theoretical study is taken to the next level by implementing it in the laboratory to assess its performance. This system was so far tested theoretically by simulations, probably with ideal conditions. In this Thesis, after carefully studying the system, some modifications are brought into it, considering the real time challenges of test bench. The first modification is the implementation of a phase lock loop (PLL), considering the voltage unbalance issue, which is likely to occur at the point of common coupling (PCC) due to the highly unbalanced loads. The second modification is the implementation of the proposed per-phase synchronizer, which is required to change the mode of operation from one to another, instead of the formerly employed Intelligent Connection Agent (ICA), making the system simpler to implement. The final modification is in the MSTS block (Mode Selection and Transition System) to bring intentional and unintentional change in the mode of operation, additional features. After applying the above said modifications to the BESS system, it was tested in the laboratory to see if it meets the design specifications, where the control was implemented on a programmable inverter called Triphase® inverter system, and a power supply known as Ametek® (California Instruments) was working as a genset. The battery of the BESS was emulated, a contribution of Thesis, by a diode rectifier connected to Concordia’s grid and a controllable bleeding resistor so that the emulated battery can supply and absorb active power to the AC grid. Based on the experimental evidences, it is concluded that this BESS system is highly suitable for genset support mode, <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> mode and while changing the mode from one to another. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Smart grids are {{critical}} cyber-physical infrastructures {{in the world}} now. Since these infrastructures are prone to large scale outages due to disasters or faults, a resilient and survivable communication architecture is desired. In this work, we propose a resilient and survivable hierarchical communication architecture for the smart grid that mirrors {{the hierarchy of the}} existing power grid. Post-disaster resilience in grid communication is achieved through the grid flattening process. This process involves smart-meters and other disaster surviving elements of higher system levels of the <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> a wireless mesh network. The flattened network of grid elements with one-hop communication links help in reliable and timely relaying of grid’s health information to working regions of the grid. This allows for swift action by control engineers of the utility provider and emergency services with real-time data. We propose analytical models to study the performance of the flattened architecture as a function of outage area, smart-meter density and smart-meter’s neighborhood size. The results from the analytical model will be compared with simulation results from OPNET. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we tackle {{the problem of}} {{providing}} a mobile robot {{with the ability to}} build a map of its environment using data gathered during navigation. The data correspond to the locations visited by the robot, obtained through a noisy odometer, and the distances to obstacles from each location, obtained from a noisy laser sensor. The map is represented as an occupancy grid. In this paper, we represent the process using a Graphical Representation based on a statistical structure resembling a Hidden Markov model. We determine the probability distributions involved in this Graphical Representation using a Motion Model, a Perception model, and a set of independent Bernoulli random variables associated with the cells in the occupancy <b>grid</b> <b>forming</b> the map. Our formulation of the problem leads naturally to the estimation of the posterior distribution over the space of possible maps given the data. We exploit a particular factorization of this distribution that allows us to implement an Importance Sampling algorithm. We show the results obtained by this algorithm when applied to a data set obtained by a robot navigating inside an office building type of indoor environment. ...|$|E
