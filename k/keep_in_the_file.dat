40|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{continuous}} exposure of unmanned aerial vehicles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local battlefield, {{as well as}} the rapid development of UAV technology, UAV’s military application values, especially <b>the</b> advantages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-altitude reconnaissance have been the world’s attention. Unmanned reconnaissance aircraft is becoming very promising new equipment in technology battlefield and an important information combat front. However, most of the current UAV controlling systems only provide manually PTZ controlling functions, which is inconvenient for the user to control the sensor to monitor targets on demand. This paper propose a new UAV PTZ controlling system, which enables user to <b>keep</b> target <b>in</b> <b>the</b> view <b>filed</b> by simply selecting a position from the digital map. The proposed system is also able to do real-time target localization for any pixel of the video. Experimental results show that our system is easy for PTZ controlling and the localization error is small...|$|R

SingletDM. hdf 5 contains the combined results of all sampling runs, and {{is the basis for}} the profile likelihood plots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper. SingletDM_TW_full. hdf 5 and SingletDM_TW_lowmass. hdf 5 contain the results from T-Walk scans over the full and low-mass parameter ranges, respectively. These are the bases for the marginalised posterior plots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper. 	An example pip file correspoinding to each hdf 5 file, for producing plots using pippi <b>The</b> YAML <b>files</b> corresponding to different parameter ranges follow the naming scheme SingletDM_[slice]. yaml, where slice may be full, lowmass or neck. Each of these YAML <b>files</b> contains entries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scanners node for running Diver, MultiNest, TWalk and GreAT. A few caveats to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind: 	 	<b>The</b> YAML <b>files</b> that we give here are updated compared to the ones that we used when generating <b>the</b> hdf 5 <b>file,</b> <b>in</b> order to match the set of available options <b>in</b> <b>the</b> release version of GAMBIT 1. 0. 0. The included physics and numerics are however identical. 	 	 	<b>The</b> YAML <b>files</b> are designed to work with the tagged release of GAMBIT 1. 0. 0, and <b>the</b> pip <b>file</b> is tested with pippi 2. 0, commit 2 ab 061 a 8. They may or may not work with later versions of either software (but you can of course always obtain the version that they do work with via the git history). 	 	 	<b>The</b> pip <b>file</b> is an example only. Users wishing to reproduce the more advanced plots <b>in</b> any of <b>the</b> GAMBIT papers should contact us for tips or scripts, or experiment for themselves. Many of these scripts are in multiple parts and require undocumented manual interventions and steps in order to implement various plot-specific customisations, so please don't expect the same level of polish as for files provided here or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> GAMBIT repo...|$|R

40|$|Summary. This {{article is}} a {{continuation}} of [6]. We present <b>the</b> notion of <b>files</b> and records. These are two finite sequences. One is a record and another is a separator for the carriage return and/or line feed. So, we define the record. <b>The</b> sequential text <b>file</b> contains records and separators. Generally, a record and a separator are paired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> And <b>in</b> a special situation, the separator does not exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> for that <b>the</b> record is only one record or record is nothing.

50|$|Structured storage {{addresses}} some inherent {{difficulties of}} storing multiple data objects {{within a single}} file. One difficulty arises when an object persisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> changes <b>in</b> size due to an update. If the application that is reading/writing <b>the</b> <b>file</b> expects <b>the</b> objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> to remain <b>in</b> a certain order, everything following that object's representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> {{may need to be}} shifted backward to make room if the object grows, or forward to fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space left over if the object shrinks. If <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is large, this could be a costly operation. Of course, there are many possible solutions to this difficulty, but often the application programmer does not want to deal with low level details such as binary file formats.|$|R
