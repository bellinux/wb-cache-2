40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{highlighted}} a lower than expected {{level of understanding}} by some consulting engineers and building operators concerning how to systematically track operation and maintenance problems and provide consistent advice for improving complex systems of the type found in large commercial buildings. Rarely is mention made of permanently installing a system capable of continuously diagnosing problems after the original analysis is complete (MacDonald and Wasserman, in preparation). One system, originally developed at a state university, student recreation center (Rec Center). reduces operation and maintenance problems by analyzing metered consumption data with an expert system. Several papers and reports have been written that describe this particular system, called the Building Energy Analysis Consultant (BEACON) system, how it was developed, its application to four complexes, and it possible future directions (Haberl and Claridge 1987; Haberl et al. 1988). This paper presents additional information concerning the BEACON system, including examples of O&M impacts, {{a review of the}} regression analysis employed in the original BEACON system, a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> process, and reports on recent developments to modify and streamline the statistical analysis.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of a variety of applications of knowledge-based systems and intelligent agents to modeling and simulation for special operations training. There are a number of ways in which intelligent agents can support training; including modeling special-operations individuals, other members of the blue forces, as well as opponent forces. The paper presents examples of each of these and provides a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> and engineering efforts we have developed to build such systems. Applying intelligent agents to simulation-based training provides new opportunities to develop training exercises that are more consistent, less expensive, and more portable. These all provide opportunities for special operations members to train individually when they have time, rather than needing to schedule large-scale events. ABOUT THE AUTHORS Randolph M. Jones, Ph.
