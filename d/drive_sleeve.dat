50|$|In some modern propellers, a hard polymer insert {{called a}} <b>drive</b> <b>sleeve</b> replaces the rubber bushing. The splined or other non-circular {{cross section of}} the sleeve {{inserted}} between the shaft and propeller hub transmits the engine torque to the propeller, rather than friction. The polymer is weaker than the components of the propeller and engine so it fails before they do when the propeller is overloaded. This fails completely under excessive load, but can easily be replaced.|$|E
40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) <b>drive</b> <b>sleeve,</b> (b) coupling sleeve, (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic chip detector (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of drive and coupling sleeves. The mode of failure in the drive and coupling sleeves was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the drive and coupling sleeves. Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the drive and coupling sleeves because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the working flank of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both drive and coupling sleeves were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the drive and coupling sleeves, however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the drive and coupling sleeves, it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between drive and coupling sleeves...|$|E
30|$|During {{driving sleeve}} of cast-in-place piles by {{vibratory}} hammers, soils were squeezed into sleeve and then soil plugging was formed. The physic-mechanical {{properties of the}} soil plug have direct influence on the load transmission between the sleeve wall and soil plug. Nevertheless, the researches on this issue are insufficient. In this study, finite element and infinite element coupling model was introduced, through the commercial code ABAQUS, to simulate the full penetration process of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>driven</b> from the ground surface to the desired depth by applying vibratory hammers. The research {{results indicated that the}} cyclic shearing action decreases both in soil shear strength and in granular cementation force when the <b>sleeve</b> is <b>driven</b> by vibratory hammers, which leads to a partially plugged mode of the soil plug inside the sleeve. Accordingly, the penetration resistance of <b>sleeve</b> <b>driven</b> by vibratory hammers is the smallest compared to those by other installation methods. When driving the sleeve, the annular soil arches forming in the soil plug at sleeve end induce a significant rise in the internal shaft resistance. Moreover, the influence of vibration frequencies, sleeve diameters, and soil layer properties on the soil plug was investigated in detail, {{and at the same time}} improved formulas were brought forward to describe the soil plug resistance inside vibratory <b>driven</b> <b>sleeve.</b>|$|R
40|$|During summer 1996, {{low-pressure}} permeation grouting {{was performed}} inside portions of four unlined, shallow waste disposal trenches at a radioactive waste burial ground that was opened in 1951 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The {{objective was to}} selectively control sources that release about 25 percent of all strontium 90 (90 Sr) discharged from the ORNL complex. A unique grouting methodology was adapted to control interaction of wastes with natural runoff at this humid site. <b>Driven</b> <b>sleeve</b> pipes were injected 4 to 5 times with multiple formulae of type III portland cement- based grouts, ultra fine cement-based grouts, and acrylamide grouts. Multiple-hole grout injection was monitored continuously using real time monitoring equipment. Apparent Lugeon values were calculated during grouting operations and grout formulae were continually adjusted during injection to maximize permeation, durability, and economy. Over 500 cubic meters of combined grout types were emplaced. At the completion of production grouting, the effectiveness of grout spread and in situ hydraulic conductivity of the grouted mass were assessed. The average residual hydraulic conductivity measured in more than 20 check pipes was less than I x 10 ` cm/sec. Hydrologic monitoring has been established to determine the overall effectiveness of the project for 9 OSr control...|$|R

30|$|When the <b>sleeve</b> {{is being}} <b>driven,</b> the <b>sleeve</b> {{transfers}} the periodic vibrating load to the soils around the sleeve (Ekanayake et al. 2013). The strain in the soils around the sleeve continues to increase, and the cohesion and shear strength gradually decrease. Compared to the infinite soils outside the sleeve, the soil plug inside the sleeve undergoes stronger cyclic shear force {{transferred from the}} sleeve wall. Therefore, the fluctuation of the internal shaft resistance is more obvious {{than that of the}} external shaft resistance. As the result, the soil strength and cohesion decrease under cyclic shearing action. Because of the decrease in the soil strength and cohesion, the soil plug becomes partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance of sleeve is much smaller than those by other installation methods.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of electrohydraulic drives is relatively low dynamic load stiffness due to compressibility of oil. Sudden load variations can cause significant deviations {{of the position of}} the drive and, consequently, a reduced precision of the controlled process. This has led to a partial substitution of electrohydraulic drives by electromechanical drives in a low power range recently. One of the approaches to increase dynamic stiffness of a cylinder is to raise valve dynamics. Thus, the system can react to a control deviation and provide the cylinder with a compensating flow faster. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show the development of a stiff cylinder drive using a new high-response servovalve-the hybrid valve. In contrast to a conventional servovalve with an unmovable sleeve, the idea of the hybrid valve is to actuate both the spool and the sleeve simultaneously in opposite directions. Using a piezo-actuator as <b>sleeve</b> <b>drive</b> provides the hybrid valve with very high dynamics in the range of small valve opening, which should be sufficient to increase the disturbance rejection of the cylinder. The performance of the valve prototype and of the cylinder will be shown, and application fields will be discussed in this work...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a frictional analysis on a new rotating sleeve multi-vane rotary (RSMVR) compressor. The new five-vane rotary compressor is adapted from the existing concept of a rotating sleeve single-vane rotary (RSSVR) compressor, in which the extended rounded end of one vane is embedded into the inner surface of the sleeve which allows the vane to swing within a certain small angle. As the rotor rotates, this vane <b>drives</b> the <b>sleeve</b> which in turn pushes and pulls the vane {{into and out of}} the slot in the rotor, respectively. The other four vanes are similarly pushed into the respective slots in the rotor but slide out only when a sufficient centrifugal force is developed. The driving vane ensures that suction, compression and discharge of the gas occur at all speeds of rotation. Although the sleeve rotates along, due to eccentricity between the rotor and the sleeve, each tip of the four vanes still rubs against the inner surface of the sleeve. The focus of the present study limits its analysis on to only frictions between the vane tip and the inner surface of the sleeve and between the vane sides and the respective slot walls. The frictional analysis is carried out by first determining the instantaneous pressure inside the compression cell and all the associated forces that exist. This involves an analysis on the dynamics of each vane when it reciprocates and at the same time rotates eccentrically with the sleeve. The kinematics of the vane are modelled using cosine and sine rules taking the cell leading vane as a reference to the angle of rotation. In the operation the model estimates a dramatic reduction in friction which is up to 82 % lower than that occurs in an existing design of an equivalent conventional multi-vane rotary compressor (MVR). A friction between the rotating sleeve and the two opposite end plates exists in the RSMVR compressor but does not in that of the MVR. This will be included in a later study but on a new integrated brushless DC motor RSMVR compressor concept and on that of the existing shaft driven MVR, to see the overall difference in the frictions exerted...|$|R
50|$|An {{inherent}} disadvantage is {{that the}} piston in its course partially obscures the ports, thus {{making it difficult for}} gases to flow during the crucial overlap between the intake and exhaust valve timing usual in modern engines. Mike Hewland admitted this was a problem at speeds above 10,000 rpm in his engines aimed at racing, but in the middle range, SSV was always better than a poppet valve engine. The 1954 printing of the book by Harry Ricardo: 'The high-speed internal combustion engine', and also some patents on sleeve valve production, point out that the available zone for ports in the sleeve depends on the type of <b>sleeve</b> <b>drive</b> and bore/stroke ratio; Ricardo tested successfully the 'open sleeve' concept in some two-stroke, compression ignition engines. It not only eliminated the head rings, but also allowed a reduction in height of the engine and head, thus reducing frontal area in an aircraft engine, the whole circumference of the sleeve being available for exhaust port area, and the sleeve acting in phase with the piston forming an annular piston with an area around 10% of that of the piston, that contributed to some 3% of power output through the sleeve driving mechanism to the crankshaft. The German-born engineer Max Bentele, after studying a British sleeve valve aero engine (probably a Hercules), complained that the arrangement required more than 100 gearwheels for the engine, too many for his taste.|$|R
30|$|The {{phenomenon}} is well-known, but {{little is known}} about the mechanism of soil plug formation inside pipe piles, especially for the <b>sleeve</b> <b>driven</b> by vibratory hammers. The formation of a soil plug depends upon a number of factors, e.g. installation method, pile diameter, penetration depth, soil density, whereas the investigation on the influencing factors are still not complete. A lot of researches were conducted to evaluate the soil plugging effect during pipe pile driving. Based on the principle of static equilibrium, Randolph et al. (1991) developed the concept of active height of soil plug and established the one-dimensional static equilibrium equation. Holeyman et al. (2013) presented another analytic expression of the shaft resistance of vibratory driven pile taking account of the soil damping. The limitation of the 1  g model test (O’Neill and Raines 1991) is the same with that of the soil samples under low stress, therefore, the ideal stress condition required by the investigation of the soil plug can be achieved by the use of the geotechnical centrifuge. Nicola and Randolph (1997) analyzed the behavior of soil plug during pipe pile driving by model tests. It was found that the height of soil plug decreased with the increase in the relative compactness of the sands during pile jacking, but increased with the relative compactness of the sands during impact pile driving. Experimental studies of Xing et al. (2012) indicated that the height of soil plug inside impact-driven pipe pile increased as the pipe wall thickness decreased. The distribution of the shaft resistance was nonlinear along the pile length, and depended on the impact force and soil conditions. Tan and Lin (2013) found that the soil plug developed from partially plugged mode in the upper soft cohesive soils into fully plugged mode in the underlying medium dense to dense cohesionless soil layers, and the external shaft resistance was about two-thirds of shaft resistance through a series of steel pipe pile static penetration tests. Liyanapathirana et al. (2000) analyzed the behavior of the soil plug during impact pile driving with Eulerian finite element method, and their researches showed that the degree of soil plug inside the sleeve developed from unplugged mode to partially plugged mode. Thongmunee et al. (2011) analyzed the mechanism and influence of soil plugging bearing capacity performance by discrete element method, and their simulated results were consistent with the experimentation results.|$|R
