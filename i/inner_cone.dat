2500|$|The welder {{can adjust}} the {{oxy-acetylene}} flame to be carbonizing (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment {{is made by}} adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame {{as the starting point}} for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> and the darker blue to colorless outer cone. The <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately [...] and provides enough heat to easily melt steel.

40|$|We present {{high-quality}} {{observations of}} PSR B 0826 - 34 at 1374 MHz. The emission from this pulsar exhibits strong bursts of pulses followed by {{long periods of}} `null' pulses. When it is strong, the radiation extends through the whole pulse period. We show {{for the first time}} that there is weak emission during the `null' phases, which should therefore be considered to be a different mode rather than a null. During this weak mode the profile is similar to that observed in the strong mode at low radio frequency. Using a phase-tracking method, the pattern of drifting subpulses during the strong mode is seen to be coherent across the whole profile. The drift rate is variable and includes positive and negative values. Thirteen subpulse bands have been directly observed, covering the whole longitude range. The subpulses and their spacings ($P_ 2 $) are wider in one half of the profile than those in the other half. This difference, and the variation of observed $P_ 2 $ within the two regions, can be accounted for if the magnetic pole is inclined to the rotation axis by about 0. 5 degrees. These two regions appear to represent radiation from outer and <b>inner</b> <b>cones.</b> The intensity modulation of subpulses in all longitude ranges is related to the magnitude of the drift rate.

2500|$|The {{oxidizing}} flame {{is the third}} possible flame adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen.

2500|$|An {{excess of}} {{acetylene}} creates a carbonizing flame. This flame {{is characterized by}} three flame zones; the hot <b>inner</b> <b>cone,</b> a white-hot [...] "acetylene feather", and the blue-colored outer cone. This {{is the type of}} flame observed when oxygen is first added to the burning acetylene. The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being the length of the inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately [...] The reducing flame is typically used for hard facing operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to carbonize it. The carbonizing flame will tend to remove the oxygen from iron oxides which may be present, a fact which has caused the flame to be known as a [...] "reducing flame".|$|E
6000|$|The 'Mother of the Antilles,' {{as she is}} called, {{is worthy}} of her name. Everywhere from the shore the land sweeps up, slowly at first, then rapidly, toward the central mass, the rugged peak whereof {{goes by the name}} of Mount Misery. Only once, and then but for a moment, did we succeed in getting a sight of the actual summit, so pertinaciously did the clouds crawl round it. 3700 feet aloft a pyramid of black lava rises above the broken walls of an older crater, and is, to judge from its knife-edge, flat top, and concave eastern side, the last remnant of an <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> which has been washed, or more {{probably}} blasted, away. Beneath it, according to the report of an islander to Dr. Davy (and what I heard was to the same effect), is a deep hollow, longer than it is wide, without an outlet, walled in by precipices and steep declivities, from fissures in which steam and the fumes of sulphur are emitted. [...] Sulphur in crystals abounds, encrusting the rocks and loose stones; and a stagnant pool of rain-water occupies the bottom of the Souffriere. A dangerous neighbour--but as long as he keeps his temper, as he has done for three hundred years at least, a most beneficent one--is this great hill, which took, in Columbus's imagination, the form of the giant St. Christopher bearing on his shoulder the infant Christ, and so gave a name to the whole island.|$|E

The <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is allowed to rotate within the outer. As the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> rotates, the total signal length changes, more at the wide end than the narrow.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} the use of two‐path experiments for correcting for self‐absorption, experimental studies to determine the rotational "temperatures" and concentrations of OH in flames burning at atmospheric pressure have been carried out. For mixtures of H_ 2, C_ 2 H_ 2, and O_ 2, {{as well as for}} C_ 2 H_ 2 -O_ 2 flames diluted with A, "anomalous" rotational "temperatures" were observed under conditions in which strong self‐absorption was clearly indicated by the intensity ratios for the double‐path to the single‐path experiments. Unequivocal quantitative estimates of rotational temperatures and of OH concentrations cannot be carried out, even {{on the assumption that the}} emitting system is isothermal and in equilibrium. However, by using the results of theoretical studies on two‐path experiments carried out by one of us, it is possible to obtain reasonable upper limits for the temperatures and lower limits for the OH‐concentrations, based on an assumed Doppler contour for the line‐shape and utilizing Oldenberg's estimates for the f values of representative spectral lines. Our experimental studies lead to reasonable rotational temperatures at the tip of luminous cones for mixtures of H_ 2, C_ 2 H_ 2, and O_ 2 and for C_ 2 H_ 2 -O_ 2 flames diluted with up to 60 percent argon. These observations do not disprove the reality of rotational temperature anomalies in the <b>inner</b> <b>cones</b> of flames.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate {{the effects of the}} nozzle length on the air-pollutant-emission and noise-radiation behaviors of a burner utilizing a multi-fuel-jet inverse diffusion flame (MIDF). Comparison of the experimental results obtained from two MIDF burners, one with a long nozzle and the other with a short nozzle, operating under the same air/fuel supply conditions (Re air and F{cyrillic}) shows rather significant differences in the flame appearance, flame centerline temperature, CO/CO 2 concentrations and the noise radiation. The nozzle length influences development of the jets and hence interaction between the air/fuel jets including their mixing process. The short nozzle produces a flame with a shorter base height and a smaller potential core due to the enhanced air/fuel mixing. It also leads to faster and more complete combustion at the <b>inner</b> reaction <b>cone</b> of the flame due to the stronger and faster air/fuel mixing. The nozzle length affects the CO and CO 2 concentrations, and higher peak values are obtained with the short-nozzle flame. Flame noise of the MIDF is defined as the noise radiation at different flame heights, which is of varying strength but of the same dominant frequency in the range of 250 - 700 Hz. The noise radiation from the <b>inner</b> reaction <b>cone</b> of the flame is stronger than that from the lower and upper parts of the flame, and the maximum noise radiation occurs when the total amounts of air and fuel in the combustion zone are at the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. For all the experiments conducted in the present study, the MIDF produced by the long nozzle is always noisier than its counterpart and it is due to the increase of the low-frequency noise components.

40|$|Solutions of Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s {{equations}} {{for directions}} of interest not {{coinciding with the}} direction of propagation of uniform TEM infinite plane waves have been proposed, {{for the first time}} by T. Koryu Ishii, in 1952. His theoretical treatment predicts the existence of rapid non-TEM modes of propagation for these directions of interest. By solving Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations for uniform TEM spherical waves and by using a transmission line analogy, it is possible to obtain the isosceles cones of propagation of a more general wave. It is shown that radiation observed along the outer cones propagates faster than the observed energy along the <b>inner</b> <b>cones.</b> This radiation can be interpreted as non-TEM modes, at any observation point within the cone. At the early generation stages of these waves, an acceleration process takes place, due to the position dependency of the characteristic impedance of the medium. As a further step a theoretical study was performed on the phase velocity concept, applied in the transmission of digital information. Experiments in open space were performed to verify the above stated theory using space and time domain techniques. In addition, time domain experiments were performed inside a waveguide. The time domain experiments were performed by using the time domain reflectometry technique and measuring the transit time between incident and received pulse amplitude modulated signal. It is concluded that the experimental findings seems to support the theory. A definition of a velocity of the signal which can be identified as the velocity of propagation of the early detectable portion of {{the leading edge of the}} wavefront of the microwave pulse is offered. The velocity of the signal is different from the signal velocity concept and is equal to the phase velocity in a free space, which is equal to the intrinsic velocity, the speed of light. However it was found that the radiation emerging from non-TEM modes propagates with a velocity of signal apparently exceeding the speed of light.

The signals and molecular machinery that regulate trafficking and sorting of synaptic proteins within <b>cone</b> <b>inner</b> segments is mostly unknown. In this study, we show that the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase Synaptojanin 1 (SynJ 1) is critical for this process. We used transgenic markers for trafficking pathways, electron microscopy, and immunocytochemistry to characterize trafficking defects in cones of the zebrafish mutant, nrc(a 14), which is deficient in phosphoinositide phosphatase, SynJ 1. The outer segments and connecting cilia of nrc(a 14) cone photoreceptors are normal, but RibeyeB and VAMP 2 /synaptobrevin, which normally localize to the synapse, accumulate in the nrc(a 14) inner segment. The structure of the Endoplasmic Reticulum in nrc(a 14) mutant cones is normal. Golgi develop normally, but later become disordered. Large vesicular structures accumulate within nrc(a 14) <b>cone</b> photoreceptor <b>inner</b> segments, particularly after prolonged incubation in darkness. <b>Cone</b> <b>inner</b> segments of nrc (a 14) mutants also have enlarged acidic vesicles, abnormal late endosomes, and a disruption in autophagy.
