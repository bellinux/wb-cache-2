25|$|The {{geological}} {{formation of the}} state is greatly varied, with the Michigan Basin being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the <b>Huronian</b> <b>system</b> of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period. Devonian and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} based on the Field Work carried out by the writer during the summer of 1957, and on {{subsequent}} laboratory investigations at McGill University during the ensuing winter. The map-area forms part of the concessions in Labrador held by the Iron Ore Company of Canada. The area mapped lies within the "Labrador Trough‚Äù which oonta 1 ns a folded and faulted assemblage of Precambrian sedimentary series intruded by volcanic and plutonic igneous rocks. The first part of this report deals with the general character of the country and the Regional Geology. The second part is a detailed study of the Kaniapiskan (<b>Huronian</b> <b>System)</b> of upper Precambrian, west of Wabush Lake, with emphasis on the iron formation and the iron ore deposits in it...|$|E
