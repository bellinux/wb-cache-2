5|$|In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, {{taking the}} eastern part for {{themselves}} and leaving Ceolwulf with the west. The Vikings went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At almost {{the same time as}} Alfred's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under the <b>hegemony</b> <b>of</b> Wessex.|$|E
5|$|An {{energetic}} and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, {{which ended in}} the disastrous battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political <b>hegemony</b> <b>of</b> the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans {{and the last one}} who attempted to seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen and later by his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Egbert's conquests {{brought him}} wealth {{far greater than}} his {{predecessors}} had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to an expansion of commercial and agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the <b>hegemony</b> <b>of</b> Wessex would prove more permanent than that of Mercia.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was {{determined}} to stop the <b>hegemony</b> <b>of</b> Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders. Houphouët-Boigny refused {{to participate in the}} Inter-African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958, which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed their own political union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation's efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps {{this is the reason}} for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the <b>hegemony</b> <b>of</b> Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hegemony</b> <b>of</b> Yamhad {{affected}} Qatna's economy; {{the trade}} route connecting Mesopotamia and Mari to Qatna through Palmyra lost its importance, while the trade routes from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia {{came under the}} full control of Aleppo, contributing to Qatna's loss of wealth. Following the destruction of Mari by Hammurabi of Babylon around 1761 BC, information about Qatna becomes scarce; in the late 17th century BC, Yamhad invaded and defeated Qatna {{during the reign of}} Yarim-Lim III. The political and commercial importance of Qatna declined quickly during the Late Bronze Age (LB I), around 1600 BC, as a result of growing Egyptian and Mitannian influences. Numerous small states appeared in the region and detached from Qatna.|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{studies on}} <b>hegemony</b> are some <b>of</b> core {{subjects}} in international relations. Hegemony plays {{a very important}} role in the international system. In the new era, hegemony studies should go beyond the hegemonic stability theory and rise and fall <b>of</b> <b>hegemony</b> theory. Finding out the causes <b>of</b> <b>hegemony’s</b> existence seems more important. Based on an analysis <b>of</b> American <b>hegemony,</b> the two vital leverages for <b>hegemony</b> are capability <b>of</b> self-adjustment and amendment and making others dependent on it, which can postpone the fall <b>of</b> <b>hegemony.</b> But no hegemony can get rid of the natural law. On the background <b>of</b> economic globalization, <b>hegemony</b> and rising power can coexist, compete positively and cooperate by excluding the influence of traditional theories. Based on this logic, China may actively be a balancer and supervisor to the hegemony in the international system...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to provide}} an {{understanding}} of how accounting systems have changed across four distinct periods of hegemonic leadership in China. Design/methodology/approach - Using Gramsci&# 039;s concept <b>of</b> <b>hegemony,</b> periods <b>of</b> leadership and accounting change throughout Chinese history are examined, including the Confucian tradition, the rise of the socialist system followed by the Cultural Revolution in the Maoist era, and the move towards the socialist-market system in the Dengist era. Findings - This paper shows how political leaders in these different time periods effectively achieved leadership by destroying an existing hegemony, creating a new ideology, and implanting this into people&# 039;s daily lives in order to successfully mobilise their ideological systems. Consistent with changes in leadership, Chinese accounting systems are shown to have responded to hegemonic shifts across these periods. Originality/value - This paper contributes to understandings of Gramsci&# 039;s concept <b>of</b> <b>hegemony,</b> explanations <b>of,</b> and motivations for, accounting change, and provides an insight into the evolution of accounting systems throughout time in the context of China...|$|R

40|$|English School (ES) {{writers have}} never {{developed}} a systematic account <b>of</b> <b>hegemony,</b> and most set out with assumptions that are `antihegemonial'.

This article excavates an ES theory <b>of</b> <b>hegemony.</b> It develops the argument for hegemony as a potential institution of international society, by analogy with the role of the Great Powers, and by extension of other ES principles. This stresses not just the material power of the Great Powers, but their degree of social recognition. Accordingly, it suggests that such a view <b>of</b> <b>hegemony</b> is no more paradoxical than, say, ES acceptance of war as a similar institution. This fills a major void in ES theory which otherwise has nothing of interest to say about international order in conditions of primacy. Peer reviewe...|$|R
