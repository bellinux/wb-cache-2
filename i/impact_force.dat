When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the <b>impact</b> <b>force</b> on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E

25|$|The nares of some {{birds are}} covered by an {{operculum}} (plural opercula), a membraneous, horny or cartilaginous flap. In diving birds, the operculum keeps {{water out of the}} nasal cavity; when the birds dive, the <b>impact</b> <b>force</b> of the water closes the operculum. Some species which feed on flowers have opercula to help to keep pollen from clogging their nasal passages, while the opercula of the two species of Attagis seedsnipe help to keep dust out. The nares of nestling tawny frogmouths are covered with large dome-shaped opercula, which help to reduce the rapid evaporation of water vapor, and may also help to increase condensation within the nostrils themselves—both critical functions, since the nestlings get fluids only from the food their parents bring them. These opercula shrink as the birds age, disappearing completely by the time they reach adulthood. In pigeons, the operculum has evolved into a soft swollen mass that sits {{at the base of the}} bill, above the nares; though it is sometimes referred to as the cere, this is a different structure. Tapaculos are the only birds able to move their opercula.|$|E
25|$|On October 24, 1985, Evans, who had {{clinched}} the 1985 National Modified title {{the week before}} at Thompson, was practicing for the Winn-Dixie 500 Modified Feature at Martinsville Speedway in Martinsville, Virginia (the races featured 200-lap Modified and Busch Grand National, and a 100-lap Late Model feature), when he crashed heavily in turn 3. The 44-year-old perished in the accident. The racing world was devastated {{by the loss of}} Richie, but his devoted fans have done much to keep his memory alive. Years later other deaths came in the Whelen Modifieds including Charlie Jarzombek at Martinsville in 1987, Corky Cookman at Thompson in 1987, Don Pratt at the Pocono R.o.C. in 1989 and Tony Jankowiak at Stafford in 1990, occasional competitor and two-time defending track champion Tommy Druar in a Lancaster event in 1989, Tom Baldwin, Sr. at Thompson in 2004, and John Blewett III at Thompson in 2007. As a result, officials made more safety features. Evans' crash, along with other fatal crashes in the late 1980s, led to questions about excessive frame rigidity of the Tour Modifieds, and safety changes resulted. In particular, straight frame rails were phased out, with new chassis required to have a step-up which could bend in hard impacts rather than transmitting all its <b>impact</b> <b>force</b> to the driver.|$|E
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} an obese body habitus may protect against {{fracture}} risk (higher bone mineral density [BMD] and greater tissue padding), while others may augment that risk (greater <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> during a fall). To examine these competing pathways, we analyzed {{data from a}} multisite, multiethnic cohort of 1924 women, premenopausal or early perimenopausal at baseline. Obesity was defined as baseline body mass index (BMI) [*]>[*] 30 [*]kg/m 2. Composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> were constructed from DXA‐derived bone size, BMD and body size. Incident fractures were ascertained annually during a median follow‐up of 9 years. In multivariable linear regression adjusted for covariates, higher BMI was associated with higher BMD but with lower composite strength indices, suggesting that although BMD increases with greater skeletal loading, the increase {{is not sufficient to}} compensate for the increase in fall <b>impact</b> <b>forces.</b> During the follow‐up, 201 women had fractures. In Cox proportional hazard analyses, obesity was associated with increased fracture hazard adjusted for BMD, consistent with greater fall <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> in obese individuals. Adjusted for composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall <b>impact</b> <b>forces,</b> obesity was associated with decreased fracture hazard, consistent with a protective effect of soft tissue padding. Further adjustment for hip circumference, a surrogate marker of soft tissue padding, attenuated the obesity–fracture association. Our findings support that {{there are at least three}} major mechanisms by which obesity influences fracture risk: increased BMD in response to greater skeletal loading, increased <b>impact</b> <b>forces,</b> and greater absorption of <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> by soft tissue padding. © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} techniques for elastic impact analyses between two vibrating beams {{are presented in}} details. A load sensor developed for measurements of elastic <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> and the designed vibration exciter are also discussed briefly. By applying the Direct Integration Method, a good agreement between the computed and measured <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> and contact duration are obtained. For {{the assessment of the}} impact on vibrations of the non-excited beam, the periodical measured <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> are approximated by triangular functions, which are then resolved harmonically with the complex Fourier method. If the natural frequencies of the non-excited beam are within the excitation spectrum of the generated impacts, the finite element models of both beams have to be considered in numerical simulations. The discussed Fourier decomposition of the triangular functions representing the analysed <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> can be a useful engineering tool for the elaboration of the effective dynamic models of the elastic structures being in periodical impacts...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{relaxation}} in golf balls follows the logarithmic law, based {{on which a}} logarithmic impact model was developed. The model allows {{the conversion of the}} stiffness measured at different deflection rates into the velocity-independent elasticity parameter, as well as the calculation of <b>impact</b> <b>forces.</b> The stiffness and the viscosity parameter were derived from compression and {{stress relaxation}} tests respectively. The softer, or less stiff, a ball is, the smaller is its viscosity constant. Wound balls are generally less viscous than solid core balls. The <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> calculated from the model were compared to <b>forces</b> measured in <b>impact</b> tests at approximately 10 m/s. The logarithmic visco-elastic model predicts peak <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> accurately. However, the measured <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> were partially inconsistent with a high standard deviation. As a recommendation, golf balls should be graded with two compression numbers (instead of the conventional Atti or Riehle numbers), or with the gradient of the mean stiffness, in addition to the conventional compression numbers...|$|R

[...] The investigation was unable to confirm if this arc was the [...] "lead event" [...] that ignited the flammable covering on MPET insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials. The crew did not recognize that a fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they {{became aware of the}} fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew were soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; intentionally or not, the plane swerved off course and headed back out into the Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt. The recovered standby attitude indicator and airspeed indicators showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 knots (560km/h, 348mph) in a 20 degrees nose down and 110-degree bank attitude, or almost inverted; the <b>impact</b> <b>force</b> of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was later calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity ("g"s).

40|$|Hip {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most serious consequences of falls in the elderly. Martial arts (MA) fall techniques may reduce hip fracture risk, as they are known to reduce hip <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> by approximately 30 % in experienced fallers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether hip <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> and velocities in MA falls would be smaller than in a 'natural' fall arrest strategy (Block) in young adults (without any prior experience) after a 30 -min training session in sideways MA fall techniques. Ten subjects fell sideways from kneeling height. In order to identify experience-related differences, additional EMG data of both fall types were collected in inexperienced (n= 10) and experienced fallers (n= 5). Compared to Block falls, MA falls had significantly smaller hip <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> (- 17 %) and velocities (- 7 %). EMG results revealed experience-related differences in the execution of the MA fall, indicative of less pronounced trunk rotation in the inexperienced fallers. This may explain their smaller reduction of <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> compared to experienced fallers. In conclusion, the finding that a substantial reduction in <b>impact</b> <b>forces</b> can be achieved after a short training in MA techniques is very promising with respect to their use in interventions to prevent fall injuries. status: publishe...|$|R
