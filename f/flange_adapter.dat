50|$|Back-up {{rings are}} used in Polyethylene (PE) pipe connections, such as HDPE pipes, where they are {{connected}} to steel pipe or pipe fittings. The back-up ring is matched to the steel pipe flange specification and is placed behind the HDPE <b>flange</b> <b>adapter</b> - a end piece on the HDPE pipe that looks much like a steel flange {{at the end of}} the HDPE pipe. As the <b>flange</b> <b>adapter</b> does not have much structural strength, the back-up ring supports and compresses the HDPE <b>flange</b> <b>adapter</b> against the steel flange and creates an effective connection between the two piping materials.|$|E

40|$|An engine {{test rig}} at AVL was {{redesigned}} with new components after a failure. The new system {{consists of a}} torsional vibration damper, a cardan axle, a torque <b>flange,</b> and an <b>adapter</b> unit, together with a new dynamometer. To ensure another failure would not occur {{a study of the}} new system was conducted. A general methodology for simulating the behaviour of a test rig powertrain was developed using AVL Excite Designer and applied to the redesigned system. The simulated results were then used to evaluate the new components for durability. The loads obtained from AVL Excite were used for load based analysis, and used as boundary conditions in finite element models in Abaqus of components where load analysis was not sufficient. Based on the results it was recommended that continuous operation at high loads in the RPM range below ⇡ 1650 is to be avoided to reduce the following risks: • Overloading of the torsional vibration damper, which will result in excessive wear of the unit shortening its life-span. • Overloading of the torque flange, which can result in risk of fatigue failure. These results were e↵ects of an issue with excitation of a half-mode of the systems eigenfrequency, Possible alterations to shift the eigenfrequency of the system, and reduce the above described issues, are increasing torsional compliance and/or increasing the rotational inertia of certain components...|$|R
40|$|In a Stirling {{radioisotope}} system, heat must continually {{be removed}} from the GPHS modules, to maintain the GPHS modules and surrounding insulation at acceptable temperatures. Normally, the Stirling convertor provides this cooling. If the Stirling convertor stops in the current system, the insulation is designed to spoil, preventing damage to the GPHS, but also ending the mission. An alkali-metal Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP) is under development to allow multiple stops and restarts of the Stirling convertor. The status of the ongoing effort in developing this technology is presented in this paper. An earlier, preliminary design had a radiator outside the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) casing, used NaK as the working fluid, and had the reservoir located on the cold side <b>adapter</b> <b>flange.</b> The revised design has an internal radiator inside the casing, with the reservoir embedded inside the insulation. A large set of advantages are offered by this new design. In addition to reducing the overall size and mass of the VCHP, simplicity, compactness and easiness in assembling the VCHP with the ASRG are significantly enhanced. Also, the permanently elevated temperatures of the entire VCHP allows the change of the working fluid from a binary compound (NaK) to single compound (Na). The latter, by its properties, allows higher performance and further mass reduction of the system. Preliminary design and analysis shows an acceptable peak temperature of the ASRG case of 140 C while the heat losses caused by the addition of the VCHP are 1. 8 W...|$|R
40|$|SpaceClaim/TD Direct {{has been}} used {{extensively}} {{in the development of}} the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) thermal model. This paper outlines the workflow for that aspect of the task and includes proposed best practices and lessons learned. The ASRG thermal model was developed to predict component temperatures and power output and to provide insight into the prime contractors thermal modeling efforts. The insulation blocks, heat collectors, and cold side <b>adapter</b> <b>flanges</b> (CSAFs) were modeled with this approach. The model was constructed using mostly TD finite difference (FD) surfaces solids. However, some complex geometry could not be reproduced with TD primitives while maintaining the desired degree of geometric fidelity. Using SpaceClaim permitted the import of original CAD files and enabled the defeaturing repair of those geometries. TD Direct (a SpaceClaim add-on from CRTech) adds features that allowed the mark-up of that geometry. These so-called mark-ups control how finite element (FE) meshes were generated and allowed the tagging of features (e. g. edges, solids, surfaces). These tags represent parameters that include: submodels, material properties, material orienters, optical properties, and radiation analysis groups. TD aliases were used for most tags to allow analysis to be performed with a variety of parameter values. Domain-tags were also attached to individual and groups of surfaces and solids to allow them to be used later within TD to populate objects like, for example, heaters and contactors. These tools allow the user to make changes to the geometry in SpaceClaim and then easily synchronize the mesh in TD without having to redefine these objects each time as one would if using TD Mesher. The use of SpaceClaim/TD Direct has helped simplify the process for importing existing geometries and in the creation of high fidelity FE meshes to represent complex parts. It has also saved time and effort in the subsequent analysis...|$|R
40|$|A rotary tuner {{has been}} {{developed}} and tested in a 425 -MHz ramped gradient drift-tube linac and also in a 350 -MHz DTL cold model tank. This type of tuner utilizes a rotary paddle to displace the magnetic field at the tank wall to vary the inductance and resonant frequency of the drift-tube linac. The tuning paddle effective area is about 7 % of the cross-sectional area of the DTL tank and shifts the resonant frequency by about 350 kHz for 90 ” of rotation. Advantages of the tuner include low friction for fast. and accurate response, no RF seals, low wall currents at the shaft feedthrough, and minimal cutout volume at the tank wall. The small cutout volume is important in applications in which tank wall cooling is critical. A smaller helium-cooled version of this device is being developed for use in 850 -MHz, cryogenically cooled drift-tube linacs. Description of the Kotary Tuner A water-cooled version of the rotary tuner is shown in Fig. 1. This device was developed for the 425 -MHz ramped gradient drift-tube linac (RGDTL). The paddle is 12. 7 x 7. 6 X 0. 7 cm thick and cooled using 0. 32 -cm refrigerator tubing soldered between two copper sheets. The drive shaft is 0. 95 cm OD, double-walled copper tubing. The rotary tuner was developed experimentally to replace an existing slug tuner so the drive shaft feeds through a thick copper <b>adapter</b> <b>flange</b> designed to fit the original slug tuner port. The shaft is vacuum sealed with a Ferrofluidic bearing and is belt driven with a stepper motor. The paddle can be overdriven because the tuning effect is approximately sinusoidal and repetitive. Thus, unlike a slug tuner, no limit switches are required. In normal operation, the tuner is driven to maintain the DTL resonance {{close enough to the}} drive frequency so that VSWR limits are not exceeded. A cryogenically cooled version of a rotary tuner has been designed for an 850 -MHz DTL and is shown in Fig. 2...|$|R
