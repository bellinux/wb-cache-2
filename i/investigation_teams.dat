25|$|In mid-April, Gardaí and the PSNI {{informed}} {{the public that}} the <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> were looking for information {{in relation to a}} white coloured Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) that was parked on the Shean Road, Forkhill, Armagh in Northern Ireland either side of 9.45 pm on 25 January 2013, the night Donohoe lost his life. The white lorry may have been broken down, and a number of people were reportedly seen around the vehicle. The two police forces added that they wanted to speak to anyone who owned the truck, had recovered or serviced it, or anyone who saw any activity of this nature on the Shean Road on the night of 25 January.|$|E
25|$|For some <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> {{this means}} that MS is an immunopathogenetically {{heterogeneous}} disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to have in fact MOG-IgG-related encephalomyelitis, suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG encephalomyelitis.|$|E

When <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> enter the ship, they {{discover}} {{a population of}} sick and malnourished extraterrestrials, who are nicknamed [...] "prawns", based on their physical appearance. The South African government confines the aliens to [...] "District 9", a government camp located outside of Johannesburg. Twenty-eight years later, in 2010, following constant unrest and riots between the aliens and the locals living near District 9, the government hires private military company Multinational United (MNU) to relocate the aliens to a new internment camp. Piet Smit (Louis Minnaar), an MNU executive, appoints his son in law, Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a nebbish Afrikaner bureaucrat, to lead the relocation. Assisted by armed MNU personnel, the relocation uses bribes of cat food, which has an addictive quality for the aliens, as well as force, sometimes even deadly.|$|E

2500|$|The looting {{of these}} forests is well {{organized}} and well funded, placing it beyond the regulatory abilities and monitoring of park agents. Workers have been recruited by radio advertisements, the cargo boats of nearby Maroantsetra {{have all been}} hired out (to the exclusion of conventional shipping), a [...] road has been built into a remote park in the north, and a flotilla of small boats has been bypassing ports by landing anywhere on the [...] of wild coastline to collect wood. In July 2009, <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> observed large-scale transport of rosewood logged from national parks in broad daylight along roads policed by posted gendarmerie around Antalaha, demonstrating that these timber traffickers have bribed not only customs officers but also the local law enforcement. This was after a mid-April attempt {{by the government to}} increase law enforcement in the parks and toughen enforcement on the export ban. Illegal activities declined during this time, particularly in areas under closer scrutiny, but also increased activities in remote areas.|$|E
2500|$|The 2007 Georgia missile {{incident}} {{refers to}} the landing of a missile in the Georgian village of Tsitelubani in the Gori district near the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone, some [...] north-west of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, on 7 August 2007. Georgian officials said that two Russian combat aircraft violated its airspace and fired a missile, which fell {{on the edge of}} a village but did not explode. Russia denied this allegation and said that Georgia may have fired the missile on its own territory as a way of provoking tensions in the region. Several expert teams were sent to Georgia to investigate the incident. While two international <b>investigation</b> <b>teams</b> confirmed Georgia's claims, the Russian team dismissed them. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) stated that it was [...] "extremely difficult to have a clear picture", given the conflicting nature of the experts' findings. The organization decided not to launch its own probe into the incident. The Portuguese ambassador to the OSCE has issued a statement on behalf of the EU, which refrained from supporting either Georgian or Russian version of the events.|$|E
