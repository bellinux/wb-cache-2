After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the Secretary General of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organisation.

The use of the word [...] "world", rather than [...] "international", emphasised the truly global nature of what the organisation was seeking to achieve. The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state. The first meeting of the World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of [...] (then [...] ) for the 1949 year. Andrija Stampar was the Assembly's first president, and G.

In a smelting process, a large amount of off-gas emissions are often generated, which can cause serious <b>environmental</b> and plant <b>hygiene</b> problems if not properly treated. Off-gas systems extract and treat the off-gas emissions, and ensure that the smelter operation is in accordance with <b>environmental</b> and industrial <b>hygiene</b> regulations. In this paper, the dynamic models for an industrial smelter furnace and converter off-gas system, tackling hazardous sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), are developed using mass continuity, momentum and energy conservation laws. Based on the developed dynamic models, the effects of important variables on the system’s dynamics are studied via simulations. The developed dynamic models provide a necessary basis for high performance control development of smelter off-gas systems because online measurements are limited and additional ones must be justified.

In addition, it was very close to the Palácio da Liberdade, by then the official residence of the governor of Minas Gerais state. Thus the plan for a zoo raised <b>environmental</b> and <b>hygiene</b> concerns among the locals and the top officers of the state administration.

40|$|The Islamic {{doctrine}} is one which governs the Muslims' religious {{as well as}} civic behavior. That is to say, the secular notion of separation between Church (Mosque) and state is simply non-existant in the Muslim society. Building upon such a conviction, this paper will attempt to investigate those principles and practices which have directed {{the manner of the}} upkeep and the preservation of the <b>environmental</b> quality and <b>hygiene</b> by Muslims. The Holy Quraan, the Prophet's traditions (Sunna), and old practices and legislation adopted by Muslims will represent the major sources for such an investigation. Those principles and practices will be considered inseparable from the totality of the Islamic conception which encompasses all facets of a Muslim's life. For instance, this concept, in the case of purity and cleanliness, regulates the Muslim's relationship with his creator by requiring purity for conducting prayers and rituals, certain standards of cleanliness for his food and drink, and his mutual rights with his fellow Muslims in maintaining a clean and pollution-free environment. The implications and applications of this conception, as it relates to <b>environmental</b> purity and <b>hygiene,</b> are expected to be equally comprehensive as they relate to the environmental quality in modem life in light of current practices and legislation...|$|R
