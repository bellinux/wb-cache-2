The process is similar to the computer controlled paper printers used for office applications. In addition, <b>heat-transfer</b> <b>printing</b> is another popular printing method {{to be used in the}} textile design.Patterns are often designed in repeat to maintain a balanced design even when fabric is made into yardage. Repeat size is the distance directly across or down from any motif in a design to the next place that same motif occurs. The size of the repeat is determined by the production method. For example, printed repeat patterns must fit within particular screen sizes while woven repeat patterns must fit within certain loom sizes. There are several different types of layouts for repeated patterns. Some of the most common repeats are straight and half drop. Often, the same design is produced in many different colored versions, which are called colorways.Once a pattern is complete, the design process shifts to choosing the proper fabrics to get the design printed on or woven into the fabric ...|$|E
40|$|Over 50 % of all {{colorants}} {{which are}} used nowdays are azo dyes and pigments, and among them arylazo pyridone dyes (and pigments) have became of interest in last several decades due to the high molar extinction coefficient, and the medium to high light and wet fastness properties. They find application generally as disperse dyes. The importance of disperse dyes increased in the 1970 s and 1980 s due {{to the use of}} polyester and nylon as the main synthetic fibers. Also, disperse dyes were used rapidly since 1970 in inks for the <b>heat-transfer</b> <b>printing</b> of polyester. The main synthetic route for the preparation of azo dyes is coupling reaction between an aromatic diazo compound and a coupling component. Of all dyes manufactured, about 60 % are produced by this reaction. Arylazo pyridone dyes can be prepared from pyridone moiety as a coupling component, where substituent can be on nitrogen, and diazonim salts which can be derived from different substituted anilines or other heterocyclic derivatives. In addition, arylazo dyes containing pyridone ring can be prepared from arylazo diketones or arylazo ketoesters (obtained by coupling β-diketones or β-ketoesters with diazonim salts) by condensation with cyanoacetamide. Disazo dyes can be prepared by tetrazotizing a dianiline and coupling it with a pyridone or by diazotizing aniline and coupling it with a dipyridone. Trisazo dyes can be also prepared by diazotizing of aniline and coupling it with a tripyridone or by hexazotizing a trianiline and coupling it with a pyridone. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} give a brief review on the synthesis of arylazo pyridone dyes due to the lack of such reviews. In addition, some properties of arylazo pyridone dyes as light fastness and azo-hydrazon tautomerism are disccused...|$|E
40|$|Image as Structure was {{a series}} hand-woven and digital {{jacquard}} woven structures, made using traditional ikat techniques in combination with digital <b>heat-transfer</b> <b>printing.</b> Photographic images are conventionally regarded as surfaces that correspond to their subject matter. The project worked against this understanding by using ikat and digital printing to construct photographs, focusing on the impact that material and process can have on representation and meaning. Ikat is a dyeing technique for patterning textiles that uses bindings to dye patterns into threads before the weaving of the fabric takes place. A specially-developed process was used to heat-transfer a photograph onto yarns, after which they were unraveled and hand-woven. The semi-transparent weft yarns allowed the image to be recognizable, yet the image was misaligned due to shifts in the relative position of the yarns introduced by the hand-weaving process. Against the conventions of weaving, the structures were exhibited {{in such a way}} as to give equal importance to both sides of the fabric. Being able to see both sides of the image, and having the double aspect of an image that is recognizable yet misaligned, has the effect of highlighting the construction of representation, and enabling material to be seen in its own terms while simultaneously cohering to form a picture. The work has toured nationally and internationally, appearing in: the Warp and Weft UK touring exhibition, 2010 - 11; the Kaunas International Textile Biennial, Lithuania, 2011; the Crafts Council Collect exhibition, Saatchi Gallery, 2012; the 7 th International Fiber Art Biennale, China, 2012; and the 8 th International Cheongju Craft Biennial, South Korea, 2013. The work is included in the Warp and Weft, Collect and Kaunas Biennial catalogues. Funding came from an Arts Council of Wales Individual Project Grant, an Arts Council of Wales Training Grant, and a Wales Arts International Award...|$|E
