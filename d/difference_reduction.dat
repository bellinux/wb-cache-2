40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{compared}} WDR-ROI (Wavelet Difference Reduction- region of interest) concept and ASWDR-ROI (Adaptively Scanned Wavelet Difference Reduction-region of interest) algorithm. The term <b>difference</b> <b>reduction</b> {{refers to the}} way in which WDR encodes the locations of significant wavelet transform values. The WDR algorithm combines run-length coding of the significance map with an efficient representation of the run length symbols to produce an embedded image coder. Here we have analyzed WDR-ROI algorithm for the greyscale image. ASWDR algorithm aims to improve the subjective perceptual qualities of compressed images and improve the results of objective distortion measures, especially at low bit rates, than WDR and SPIHT compressed images. ASWDR retains all of the important features of WDR: low complexity, region of interest capability, embeddedness, and progressive SNR. We have analyzed that adaptively Scanned Wavelet <b>Difference</b> <b>Reduction</b> using Region of interest concept given good results compare to Wavelet <b>Difference</b> <b>Reduction</b> algorithm. Using MATLAB Toolbox we have calculated CR, PSNR and BPP and compared their results and found that ASWDR-ROI concept provides improved PSNR value as shown in our results.

These methods retain all of the important features of WDR: lowcomplexity, region of interest, embeddedness, and progressive SNR. They improve the rate-distortion performance of WDR {{so that it is}} essentially equal to that of the SPIHT algorithm of Said and Pearlman when arithmetic compression is not employed. When arithmetic compression is used, then the rate-distortion performance of the ASWDR algorithms is only slightly worse than SPIHT. The perceptual quality of ASWDR images is clearly superior to SPIHT. 1...|$|E

Compression using wavelet algorithm is one of the indispensable techniques to solve this problem.

However, {{there is a lack}} of research evidence that shows the optimal frequency of electro-acupuncture for pain treatment. This study aimed to determine the optimal frequency of electro-acupuncture for the treatment of low back pain. This study was a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. A sample of 40 subjects was selected at random of all (60) patients visiting the acupuncture clinic at puskesmas Sragen from September through Desember 2007. The study subjects were assigned to 10 control subjects (paracetamol), 10 subjects with low frequency (2 Hz), 10 subjects with combined frequency (20 / 50 Hz), and 10 subjects with high frequency (100 Hz) of electro-acupuncture. The electro-acupuncture was administered 7 times. Pain was measured twice, before and after the application of treatment, by use of McGill Pain Questionnaire. The data was analyzed by use of F test (ANOVA) and Post Hoc Test, which was run on SPSS v. 15 program. Results of the study showed statistically significant <b>difference</b> in the <b>reduction</b> of pain before and after the application of electro-acupuncture across different study groups (F= 6. 60; p= 0. 001). There was a statistically significant <b>difference</b> in the <b>reduction</b> of pain between control and low frequency (score difference - 10. 4; p= 0. 032), control and combined frequency (score difference - 12. 1; p= 0. 015), as well as control and high frequency (score difference - 16. 1; p= 0. 004). <b>Difference</b> in the <b>reduction</b> of pain between low and combined frequencies was statistically non-significant (score difference - 1. 7; p= 0. 999). <b>Difference</b> in the <b>reduction</b> of pain between combined and high frequencies was statistically non-significant (score difference - 4. 0; p= 0. 928). Likewise, <b>difference</b> in the <b>reduction</b> of pain between low and high frequencies was statistically non- significant (score difference - 5. 7; p= 0. 726).

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} a fast, low complexity, integer-to-integer compression scheme that is designed to give greater importance to small targets. Practical real-time operation of unmanned aerial vehicle mine/minefield detection systems has two difficult constraints.

In the imagery used for airborne mine/minefield detection, the targets are small, usually on the order of a few pixels. The region-of-interest (ROI) Wavelet <b>Difference</b> <b>Reduction</b> (WDR) compression scheme satisfies both of these constraints and is shown to preserve detection rates of small targets.

30|$|In this paper, the {{prediction}} model {{is used as}} a tool for {{a better understanding of the}} complex mechanism governing chemical reactions in reverse micelles. As a starting point, a nanoparticle is formed from a nucleus, which can grow by building up new layers while new atoms are deposited over the previous ones. If there are two different metal atoms in the reaction medium, the metal distribution in the final particle will be defined by the sequence in the deposition of the two metals. At first, the key factor to decide this sequence is the <b>difference</b> in <b>reduction</b> potentials of both metals [5, 7 – 9]. That is, if ions of two different metals are very close to each other (like inside a micelle), and one metal reduces faster than the other, the nucleus and the inner layers are composed by the faster metal, and then the slower one forms the surrounding shell. In the case of both ions being reduced simultaneously, a mixture of metals is to be expected. However, core-shell geometries have been obtained from metals with quite similar reduction potentials, such as Pt/Ag [10, 11], Pd/Au [12], and Pt/Pd [13 – 17], so the <b>difference</b> in <b>reduction</b> potential is not the only factor.|$|R
