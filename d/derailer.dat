5|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed {{at about}} 10:13am as {{it left the}} Farragut North station in {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic <b>derailer</b> {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E

As it continued, an automatic <b>derailer</b> {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. The front wheels of the first car in the six-car, White Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. [...] Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am [...] The evacuation was completed by moving passengers into the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cars of the consist, decoupling the cars from the lead pair, and then running the remaining four cars back to Farragut North station. [...] The lead pair was left in the tunnel. [...] The train was apparently mis-routed into the pocket. [...] Central Control attempted to align a route back onto the main line but could not clear the signal. [...] The operator, who was newly returned to service from an extended leave, was told to run past the red signal. [...] Neither she nor the supervisor who ordered her to move the train were aware there was a <b>derailer</b> present at that location, or that it had to be moved to allow the signal to clear. [...] The NTSB arrived on the scene by 12:00pm Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The cause is under investigation.|$|E
50|$|The fourth type of <b>derailer</b> is the powered or {{motorized}} <b>derailer,</b> electronically powered {{through an}} actuator. This type of <b>derailer</b> {{can be controlled}} remotely from an external control panel or manually.

50|$|<b>Derailers</b> are {{electrically}} powered. They {{have traditionally}} been regarded as the ultimate safeguard in preventing vehicle access and are fitted to tracks approaching the depot. However, <b>derailers</b> do have drawbacks - they can result in significant damage to infrastructure and Traction and Rolling Stock {{in the event of}} a derailment (which can be costly and extremely disruptive to operations) and in some cases, can be innefective or restrictive (they cannot be fitted in close vicinity to check rails, for example).|$|R
50|$|A <b>derailer</b> {{works by}} derailing any vehicle passing over it. There are {{different}} types of <b>derailer,</b> {{but in some cases}} they consist of a single switch point installed in a track. The point can be pulled into a position to derail any equipment that is not supposed to pass.|$|E

50|$|Derailleur is a French word, spelled dérailleur in French, {{derived from}} the {{derailment}} of a train from its tracks. Its first recorded use was 1930. At least one notable bicycle industry author has attempted to promote the anglicized spelling of <b>derailer.</b> As of 2013, however, neither Merriam-Webster nor the Oxford English Dictionary has an entry for <b>derailer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Derailers</b> are an American {{country music}} band based in Austin, Texas. They were founded by Portland, Oregon natives Tony Villanueva and Brian Hofeldt in 1994.|$|R

50|$|Since Villanueva’s departure, The <b>Derailers</b> have shuffled their lineup, with Brian Hofeldt {{taking on}} the role of primary front man. With these changes they have moved back to the {{independent}} world, releasing two albums on the Palo Duro label, Soldiers of Love (2007) and Under the Influence of Buck (2007), a tribute album to one of their heroes, Buck Owens. While their new music is being once again embraced by Americana stations, it appears that The <b>Derailers</b> may have passed their high water mark in terms of success in the mainstream of country music.|$|R

50|$|A derail or <b>derailer</b> is {{a device}} {{used to prevent}} fouling of a rail track (by {{anything}} being present on the track, such as a person, a train or a fallen branch) by unauthorized movements of trains or unattended rolling stock.

50|$|A-Train entered at #25 {{and started}} {{dominating}} his opponents by performing a <b>Derailer</b> on Cena, an Train Wreck, on Benjamin and a <b>Derailer</b> on RVD before receiving a Savate Kick by Rikishi. Shawn Michaels {{returned to the}} ring after being attacked by Jericho in the earlier match and avenged his elimination by attacking Jericho, helping Test to eliminate Jericho from the match. Michaels continued to attack Jericho after the match. Maven entered at #26 but was dominated by Kane. Goldust entered at #27 and started battling Haas and Benjamin, but they quickly eliminated him. Goldust's tag team partner Booker tried to avenge his partner's elimination by battling Haas and Benjamin, {{but he was too}} eliminated by Haas and Benjamin. Batista entered at #28 and started dominating everyone. Shortly after entering, Batista eliminated Test and then Rikishi. Brock Lesnar entered at #29 and he started fighting all the participants. Lesnar eliminated Haas and Benjamin and then eliminated Matt by tossing him over the top rope onto Haas and Benjamin. Batista and Lesnar then had a stand off due to Batista managing Lesnar earlier in the show. The Undertaker returned to WWE after a three-month injury by entering at #30 as the final entrant of the match.|$|E
5000|$|The Derailers' first LP, Live Tracks, {{was issued}} in 1995. It {{was the first}} release of the Austin-based {{independent}} label Freedom Records. Shortly after the release, The <b>Derailers</b> {{became one of the}} most talked about acts at Austin's 1995 South by Southwest music festival, and the record became profitable within two months. This occurred at a time when “Americana” radio stations were starting to multiply and various forms of non-mainstream country music were coming together under such rubrics as Americana and alternative-country. The <b>Derailers</b> became a major part of that movement, representing the [...] "traditional honky-tonk" [...] end of the subgenre.|$|R
50|$|The band {{toured the}} world, {{including}} Austria, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Scotland and England. The band shared {{the stage with}} artists such as Robert Gordon, Charlie McCoy, Hank Thompson, Wanda Jackson, Carlene Carter and The <b>Derailers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Attempts {{to derail}} the train using a {{portable}} <b>derailer</b> failed and police shot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which had no effect because the button must be pressed for several seconds before the engine is starved of fuel and shuts down. A northbound freight train, Q63615, was directed onto a siding where the crew uncoupled its locomotive, #8392 (another EMD SD40-2), {{and waited for the}} runaway train to pass. #8392 had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, conductor with one year's experience. Together, they chased the runaway train. An EMD GP38 locomotive was prepared further down the line to couple {{to the front of the}} runaway to slow it further, if necessary.|$|E

50|$|Seeking greater {{mainstream}} success, The <b>Derailers</b> {{switched to}} Sony’s Lucky Dog Records {{for their next}} release, Here Come the <b>Derailers,</b> and were paired with Nashville A-list producer Kyle Lehning. This album had the unfortunate release date of September 11, 2001, and was largely overlooked by mainstream radio stations that began emphasizing patriotic songs. A profile of the band on National Public Radio’s Morning Edition in 2002 did help push the album just into the top 50 on the Billboard country charts. The follow-up release for Lucky Dog, Genuine (2003), did slightly better, cresting at No. 44. But soon after that, founding member and primary vocalist Tony Villanueva announced he was leaving the band {{to spend more time}} with his family and become a church pastor.|$|R
50|$|Two of the train's tank cars {{contained}} {{thousands of}} gallons of molten phenol, a toxic ingredient of paints and dyes harmful when it is inhaled, ingested, or brought {{into contact with the}} skin. Attempts to derail it using a portable <b>derailer</b> failed, and police were unable to shoot out the fuel release valve, instead hitting the fuel cap. For two hours, the train traveled at speeds up to 51 mph until the crew of a second train coupled onto the runaway and slowly applied its brakes. Once the runaway was slowed down to 11 mph, CSX trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train and climbed aboard, shutting down the locomotive. The train was stopped just southeast of Kenton, Ohio. No one was seriously injured in the incident.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} signals spaced at {{three-quarters of a}} mile, {{a quarter of a}} mile, and 500 ft from the draw bridge, and an {{automatic}} derailing device fifty feet beyond the third signal. The bridge span had to be down and locked electrically before the signals and derail devices could be cleared for movement on the track. Conversely, all the devices had to be in their most restrictive positions before the bridge could be unlocked and raised. The train ran through two signals and was derailed automatically; the automatic <b>derailer</b> was designed to knock the wheels off the track so that the resistance of the ties and ballast against the train's wheels would bring a slow-moving derailed train to a stop. Train #3314, although derailed, was moving at such a great speed that it did not have sufficient distance to stop before diving off the bridge.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Propulsion and steering== Steering, braking, shifting, and {{propulsion}} are {{accomplished through}} the handlebars. The brakes and brake levers are standard bicycle components. The handle bars {{are specific to}} the Rowbike and cannot be upgraded, although standard grips, bar ends, and other accessories can be mounted on them. The front fork is controlled (or steered) with cables {{in a manner similar}} to a recumbent bicycle. The gears on the rear wheel, the shifter, and the <b>derailer</b> are all standard bicycle equipment. Feet are on fixed foot rests, as opposed to moving pedals. The seat, which is specific to the RowBike, slides back and forth on rollers. Unlike a boat the rider faces forward. If the rider's stroke favors the left or right side, the rowbike will pull off course, as would be the case with a boat. Balancing on a two-wheeled rowbike while rowing requires some practice, even for a skilled bicyclist.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{researchers}} Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls {{can help a}} COO [...] "heir" [...] better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full <b>derailers</b> once {{they are in the}} CEO seat.|$|R
