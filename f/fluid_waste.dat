60|$|I {{mentioned}} {{to you before}} that my expectation of rough usage in consequence of my unattenuated, even if not frivolously aggressive, Teutonism was to prove completely unfounded. No one seems either unduly conscious or affectedly unperceiving of my so rich Berlin background; I’m treated on the contrary with the positive civility which is the portion of every traveller who pays the bill without scanning the items too narrowly. This, I confess, has {{been something of a}} surprise to me, and I’ve not yet made up my mind as to the fundamental cause of the anomaly. My determination to take up my abode in a French interior was largely dictated by the supposition that I should be substantially disagreeable to its inmates. I wished to catch in the fact the different forms taken by the irritation I should naturally produce; for it is under the influence of irritation that the French character most completely expresses itself. My presence, however, operates, as I say, less than could have been hoped as a stimulus, and in this respect I’m materially disappointed. They treat me as they treat every one else; whereas, in order to be treated differently, I was resigned in advance to being treated worse. A further proof, if any were needed, of that vast and, as it were, <b>fluid</b> <b>waste</b> (I have so often dwelt on to you) which attends the process of philosophic secretion. I’ve not, I repeat, fully explained to myself this logical contradiction; but this is the explanation to which I tend. The French are so exclusively occupied with the idea of themselves that in spite of the very definite image the German personality presented to them by the war of 1870 they have at present no distinct apprehension of its existence. They are not very sure that there are, concretely, any Germans; they have already forgotten the convincing proofs presented to them nine years ago. A German was something disagreeable and disconcerting, an irreducible mass, which they determined to keep out of their conception of things. I therefore hold we’re wrong to govern ourselves upon the hypothesis of the revanche; the French nature is too shallow for that large and powerful plant to bloom in it.|$|E

This is out of compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450 and EPA 40 CFR 264.173. Testing confirms that these methods allow chemicals to evaporate, contaminating the surrounding atmosphere and posing a health risk not only to laboratory workers, but to neighboring areas. Additionally, chemical contaminants in the atmosphere, in combination with normal oxygen levels in the lab, fulfill {{two of the three}} components necessary to complete the fire triangle. Further, chemical spills in the laboratory preclude procedures of safe disposal, leading these toxins to end up in landfills, and consequently, soil, rivers and oceans. As plant and animal life are effected, the consequences escalate exponentially.|$|E

50|$|A macellum is {{a fairly}} easy {{building}} to identify from its design. A macellum provides shops arranged around a courtyard which contains a central tholos. The tholos is a round structure, usually built upon {{a couple of steps}} (a podium), with a ring of columns supporting a domed roof. A macellum is usually square in shape. The central courtyard of the macellum is surrounded by tabernae, shops, all of the same size. It was also possible to extend the macellum upwards to include upper stories. Entrance to the macellum was either through central gates on each of the four sides or through some of the tabernae themselves. It appears that the tabernae set aside for butchers (carnificēs) were together in one area of the macellum where they were provided with marble counters, presumably to keep the meat cooler, and drains for the removal of water and <b>fluid</b> <b>waste.</b> It has been suggested that the central tholos, also well provided with water and drains, was where fish was sold (due to excavated fish skeletons), although other uses for the central tholos have been suggested, such as the place where official weights and measures were held for reference or as shrines to the gods of the market place (due to excavated coins). Some macella had a water fountain or water feature in the centre of their courtyard instead of a tholos structure. It is the presence of this central water feature which seems to denote a building a macellum.|$|E

Materials and Methods: To produce enzyme from a single colony of E. cloacae WPL 214, 98 × 1010 CFU/ml of isolates was put into 20 ml of liquid medium and incubated in a shaker incubator for 16 h at 35 °C in accordance with growth time and optimum temperature of E. cloacae WPL 214. Further on, culture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Pellet was discarded while supernatant containing cellulose enzyme activity was withdrawn to assay endo-(1, 4) -β-D-glucanase, exo-(1, 4) -β-D-glucanase, and β-glucosidase. Results: Cellulase enzyme of E. cloacae WPL 214 isolates had endoglucanase activity of 0. 09 U/ml, exoglucanase of 0. 13 U/ml, and cellobiase of 0. 10 U/ml at optimum temperature 35 °C and optimum pH 5.

40|$|The mining {{industry}} produces fluid fine mineral tailings {{on the order}} of millions of tonnes each year, with billions of tonnes already stored globally. This trend is expected to escalate as demand for mineral products continues to grow with increasingly lower grade ores being more commonly exploited by hydrometallurgy.

40|$|Injection of <b>fluid</b> <b>waste</b> into Precambrian {{crystalline}} {{rocks at}} the Rocky Mountain Arsenal triggered earthquakes in the 1960 s. Available {{data suggest that the}} waste fluid was injected into a reservoir composed of connected vertical fractures. Earthquakes are believed to be results of lateral sliding motions along fracture planes. A mathematical model is constructed to simulate fluid pressure build-up caused by injection. Computed pressure build-up is related to the spatial distribution of earthquake epicenters. The results show that the earthquakes are confined to that part of the reservoir where the pressure build-up exceeds 32 bars. This critical value is interpreted as the pressure build-up above which earthquakes occur. The existence of this critical pressure is consistent with the Hubbert-Rubey theory on the role of fluid pressure in fault movement. The migration of earthquake epicenters away from the injection well, a phenomenon noted by previous investigators, can be accounted for by the outward propagation of the critical pressure build-up. The analysis is extended to examining the effects of fracture widening under high injection pressure. The results show that the effect is confined to a small region within one kilometer of the injection well...|$|E
40|$|This {{review is}} focused on the risk of {{exposure}} and adverse impacts from wastewater generated by shale gas development. The primary sources of wastewater are: (1) hydraulic fracture <b>fluid</b> <b>waste</b> that flows back out of the well after wellbore stimulation (“flowback”) and (2) formation water that is produced along with shale gas (also called “produced water ” or “production brines”). These two sources of waste combine to form shale gas wastewater streams that require careful review, consideration, and regulation by the NYSDEC. Hydraulic fracturing flowback not only contains chemicals added during well stimulation, but also includes constituents present in the shale zone formation water that may be released during the hydraulic fracturing process. The data in the DSGEIS is insufficient to adequately evaluate this risk. The DSGEIS provides a general laundry list of chemicals that may potentially be used in hydraulic fracturing fluids; however, the actual formulation and the quantities of each chemical in use is only discussed in minimal terms. There is no information to describe the potential chemical interactions that may also result in additional contaminates formed in the wastewater.

The collapse, which involved {{a significant portion of the}} wall around its center, took place three years after commissioning of the plant. At the moment of the collapse, neither earthquakes nor other environmental extreme events were reported in the area. Moreover, the plant seemed to work properly when failure occurred. A simple elastic analysis, in the presence of the standard service loads, revealed that the stress levels (both in concrete and in reinforcing steel) did not exceed the elastic thresholds, as they have been measured on extracted specimens. Consequently, the possible causes of collapse have been investigated by considering several aspects. The analyses led to the conclusion that the structural collapse can be enclosed in the framework of damage accumulation for the reinforcing steel bars...|$|E
