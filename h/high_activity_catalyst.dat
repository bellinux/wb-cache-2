40|$|This paper {{reports a}} finding, namely a {{cooperation}} between separate phases, which may help understand {{the mechanism of}} oxidative coupling of methane. The activity of co-precipitated bismuth-manganese oxides in the oxidative coupling of methane, measured in the continuous flow regime, is maximum for Bi:Mn = 1 : 2. The catalysts have been investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and microanalysis; catalytic pulse experiments were performed. The Bi 2 Mn 4 O 10 phase is present in these catalysts. But, surprisingly, although it corresponds to the Bi:Mn ratio of 1 : 2 giving maximum activity, it decomposes to alpha-Bi 2 O 3 and alpha-Mn 2 O 3 {{in a few hours}} during the catalytic test. The higher catalytic activity observed at Bi:Mn = 1 : 2 thus does not seem due to the Bi 2 Mn 4 O 10 phase. The <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalyst</b> is actually composed of Bi 2 O 3 in contact with an other phase. This might be a Bi-depleted Bi 2 Mn 4 O 10 -like phase; it is speculated that this phase could donate oxygen to Bi 2 O 3 and make it more active. This would suggest that oxygen mobility or spill-over between phases. observed to be beneficial in other reactions occurring at 350 - 450 -degrees-C, also promotes the selective oxidative coupling of methane above 700 -degrees-C...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of Au/ZnO and Au/Fe 2 O 3 catalysts using two coprecipitation methods is investigated {{to determine the}} important factors that control the synthesis of <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalysts</b> for the oxidation of carbon monoxide at ambient temperature.

Non-calcined Au/ZnO catalysts prepared using both methods are very sensitive to pH and ageing time, and catalysts prepared at a maximum pH = 5 with a short ageing time (ca. 0 - 3 h) exhibit <b>high</b> <b>activity.</b> <b>Catalysts</b> prepared at <b>higher</b> pH give lower <b>activity.</b> However, all <b>catalysts</b> require a short operation period during which the oxidation activity increases.

Two emission control systems consisting of the three technologies (EGR, SCR, and DPF) were calibrated on a Caterpillar C- 12 heavy-duty diesel engine. Results of these calibrations showed good promise in meeting the 2010 heavy-duty emission standards as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

40|$|A key {{discovery}} {{in the last}} two decades has been the realisation that gold, when prepared as supported nanoparticles, is exceptionally effective as an oxidationcatalyst, particularly for the oxidation of carbon monoxide at sub-ambient temperature but also for a number of organic reactions of synthetic significance. To some extent this observation is counterintuitive since extended gold surfaces do not chemisorb oxygen, nor do they corrode. For some oxidation reactions, the catalytic activity is markedly enhanced by the addition of palladium. This paper is concerned with recent advances in understanding the mechanism of catalysis by gold–palladium alloy nanoparticles of one such organic reaction, the oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds by molecular oxygen. We report detailed reaction studies using a <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalyst</b> prepared by sol-immobilisation on a titania support. Using solvent-free conditions, benzyl alcohol is oxidised primarily to benzaldehyde but small amounts of toluene are also formed. The origin of these products is explored using initial rate measurements, deuterium labelling and kinetic isotope effects, and by the study of substituent effects. The effect of changing the nature of the catalyst support is also briefly examined. On the basis of all the results, we consider that we have evidence for multiple reaction pathways in this heterogeneous system. We put forward general mechanisms for the overall processes and describe confirmatory experiments in support of these, and we suggest possible reaction intermediates involved in the heterogeneously catalysed reaction...|$|E
40|$|<b>High</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalyst</b> {{system of}} K 2 CO 3 {{supported}} on perovskite and its reaction mechanism for carbon materials were studied. It showed higher catalytic activity at lower temperature region than the case using gamma-alumina supporter or K 2 CO 3 alone. And also, the catalyst supported perovskites showed one third smaller of catalyst loss after the reaction than {{that with the}} alumina supporter or K 2 CO 3 alone. Catalytic activation of K 2 CO 3 supported LaMn(1 -x) CuxO(3) system {{was considered to be}} progress by two factors. First, K 2 CO 3 has to be decomposed into K+ and CO 32 - ions. Second, decomposed K+ ions are activated with oxygen at the lower temperature than K 2 CO 3 activation temperature. On oxide surface of support, K 2 CO 3 was found to exist in partially dissociated form. In addition, perovskites had the active oxygen at the surface. K+ ions were able to be activated with the active oxygen on the surface of perovskites at the low temperature. The releasing temperature of the active oxygen could be controlled by Cu substitution in LaMn(1 -x) CuxO(3) system. Using these properties, we synthesized a high activity K 2 CO 3 supported on perovskite catalyst for carbon combustion. Oxygen contents of perovskite could be reduced easily. And also, the reduced state could be re-oxidized to the original oxygen level. This reversible property of oxygen contents of perovskites was considered to be the reason of high recovery of catalyst (K+). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} thought that catalysts produced by incipient wetness impregnation (IW) are very poor for low temperature CO oxidation, {{and that it}} is necessary to use methods such as deposition-precipitation (DP) to make <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> materials. The former is true, indeed such IW catalysts are poor, and we present reactor data, XPS and TEM analysis which show that this is due to the very negative effect of the chloride anion involved in the preparation, which results in poisoning and excessive sintering of the Au particles. With the DP method, the chloride is largely removed during the preparation and so poisoning and sintering are avoided. However, we show here that, contrary to previous considerations, <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalysts</b> can indeed be prepared by the incipient wetness method, if care is taken to remove the chloride ion during the process. This is achieved by using the double impregnation method (DIM). In this a double impregnation of chloroauric acid and a base are made to precipitate out gold hydroxide within the pores of the catalyst, followed by limited washing. This results in a much more active catalyst, which is active for CO oxidation at ambient temperature. The results for DIM and DP are compared, and it is proposed that the DIM method may represent an environmentally and economically more favorable route to <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> gold <b>catalyst</b> production.

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of CH 4 {{in the presence}} of C 2 H 4 or C 2 H 2 using a nanosized iron or nickel based catalyst with volume ratios of C 2 H 4 or C 2 H 2 to CH 4 of 1. 75 : 1 to 0. 55 : 1 was investigated. The presence of C 2 H 4 or C 2 H 2 increased the conversion of CH 4 to 3 to 5 times that with no C 2 H 4 or C 2 H 2; that is, it significantly increased the production rate of carbon from 20 - 30 to 45 - 75 g/gcat/h at 723 - 873 K. The online detection of the time dependent composition of the product gas and experiments in which the feeding sequence of CH 4 and C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 2 was changed allowed us to propose a mechanism for the enhanced decomposition as follows. First, the facile exothermic adsorption and {{decomposition of}} C 2 H 4 or C 2 H 2 provides the driving force for the in situ endothermic decomposition of CH 4. Subsequently, the thermodynamically favored intermediate products of aromatics or poly aromatics are formed by the insertion of CH 4 into adsorbed C 2 H 4 or C 2 H 2 fragments. Finally, the intermediate products are rapidly dehydrogenated on the <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalyst</b> to form carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The enhancement effect is dependent on the ratio of C 2 H 4 to CH 4 but independent of the ratio of C 2 H 2 to CH 4, which was explained as being due to the different exothermicities of the C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 reactions. This finding provides a new stimulus for methane activation at low temperature to produce hydrogen and CNTs with high efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Tar is a viscous black liquid {{derived from}} {{pyrolysis}} {{of organic matter}} and a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. The presence of tar in the product gas may cause blockage and corrosion of equipments and be responsible for fouling or reducing overall efficiency of processes. By far, tar removal is the most problematic during biomass gasification. Hence, a successful implementation of gasification technology for gas engines, gas turbines or fuel cells based power projects depend much on the effective and efficient removal or conversion of tar from the product gas. Beside that, the catalytic steam reforming tar {{is one of the}} most promising methods to suppress the problems. The biomass product gas is usually low calorific value; therefore, an enhancement of the product gas quality is other important target. We propose a research topic that to utilise nickel–loaded brown coal char as a new catalyst for decomposing tar from biomass gasification in a fluidized bed gasifier. The method is promising to get benefits from the use of low rank coal char as a catalyst support material, a high catalyst activity of nickel and an enhancement of product gas quality. In this study, yallourn brown coal has been selected to prepare the catalyst support. The coal that is a low rank with high moisture content, a low heat value and high oxygen content is hard to use for generating energy. However, it has a lot of outstanding features such as less ash and sulfur content, and with abundant of oxygen–containing functional groups such as carboxyl and phenol groups which are available for ion–exchange with metals. In this study, the nickel–loaded brown coal char (Ni/BCC) was prepared by an ion–exchange method, dried at 380 K in nitrogen for 24 h, and then pyrolysed at 923 K in nitrogen for 90 min. The works have been carried out is the use of the Ni/BCC catalyst to decompose tar in pyrolysis and steam gasification processes. The experiments were performed on a two–stage fixed–bed reactor and a laboratory–scale fluidized–bed gasifier under mild conditions (temperatures, steam, space velocities, operation time). Inside of the gasifier was constructed by two beds, the primary one is a fluidized bed with sand, and the second one is a catalyst bed. The Ni/BCC catalyst has shown high catalytic activity and stable activity and given the high quality of the product gas. In the presence of steam, approximately 90 % of biomass tar was decomposed and useful gas components (CH 4, CO, and H 2) yields were higher than those of a conventional Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The Ni/BCC catalyst was characterized and exhibited a good dispersion of nickel particles, ultra–fine Ni less than 15 nm and a large surface area (Approximately 350 m 2 /g). Moreover, at the end of its life span, the catalyst can be easily disposed by gasifying or burning the coal char, during which the energy value of the char support can be recovered. Further, the agglomerated nickel residues can be also used as functional materials for powder metallurgy and battery development. The general results suggest that the Ni/BCC catalyst offers a potential to be used as a <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalyst</b> for steam reforming of tar in biomass gasification. 学位記番号：工博甲 398, 学位の種類：博士（工学）, 学位授与年月日：平成 22 年 3 月 24...|$|E

Catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and stability compared with the pure supports, ZnO and Fe 2 O 3, and the best preparation temperature was 80 C.

A comparison between these catalysts was taken rather than an investigation of the effect of the preparation parameters on catalysts prepared by DP method because they have been well studied previously. Several characterization techniques including AAS, BET surface area, XRD, TPR, and XPS, were utilised to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the prepared supported gold catalysts.

The catalyst prepared by impregnation of an aqueous solution of KOH on commercial cobalt carbonate showed the <b>highest</b> <b>activity.</b> The <b>catalysts</b> prepared by various methods were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction, N 2 adsorption, scanning electron microscope, temperature-programmed reduction with H 2, temperature-programmed desorption of O 2, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results suggest that crystallite size and reduction property are key factors for the <b>activity</b> of the <b>catalyst</b> for the direct decomposition of nitrous oxide in the presence of oxygen...|$|R

Both Cr-based catalysts exhibited similar mesoporous channels and textural properties. The catalytic performances of two catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO, were investigated.

The catalysts were prone to deactivate in the reaction but could be partially regenerated by oxygen. Cr species formed in high oxidation state were reduced during the reaction.

40|$|Carbon {{possesses}} unique {{electrical and}} structural properties {{that make it}} an ideal material for use in fuel cell construction. In alkaline, phosphoric acid and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), carbon is used in fabricating the bipolar plate and the gas-diffusion layer. It can also act as a support for the active metal in the catalyst layer. Various forms of carbon - from graphite and carbon blacks to composite materials - have been chosen for fuel-cell components. The development of carbon nanotubes {{and the emergence of}} nanotechnology in recent years has therefore opened up new avenues of matenials development for the low-temperature fuel cells, particularly the hydrogen PEMFC and the direct methanol PEMFC. Carbon nanotubes and aerogels are also being investigated for use as catalyst support, and this could lead to the production of more stable, <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> <b>catalysts,</b> with low platinum loadings (< 0. 1 Mg cm(- 2)) and therefore low cost. Carbon can also be used as a fuel in high-temperature fuel cells based on solid oxide, alkaline or molten carbonate technology. In the direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC), the energy of combustion of carbon is converted to electrical power with a thermodynamic efficiency close to 100 %. The DCFC could therefore help to extend the use of fossil fuels for power generation as society moves towards a more sustainable energy future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ING+JHUNational audienceTypical Fe based {{catalysts}} {{have high}} metal loadings (> 70 wt%) and contain many different phases, which strongly limit {{the establishment of}} structure-activity relationships. We describe here the synthesis of well controlled iron nanoparticles of 3. 5 nm [1] encapsulated in the walls of hollow silicalite- 1. The encapsulation prevents the particle to sinter under reaction conditions leading to a high and stable Fe dispersion. In addition to the <b>high</b> <b>activity,</b> this <b>catalyst</b> is extremely selective as it does not produce any CO 2. High resolution tomography show silicalite- 1 hollow single crystals (~ 100 nm width) with a narrow distribution of the iron particle size centered at 3. 5 nm (cf. figure 1). FTS performances of the Fe@silicalite- 1 (3. 4 %Fe) were measured at 250 °C, 20 bar and H 2 /CO = 2. In terms of activity per mass of iron the Fe@silicalite- 1 catalyst is 10 times more active than a commercial <b>catalyst.</b> Besides the <b>high</b> <b>activity,</b> the <b>catalyst</b> did not produce any CO 2 against 20 % for the commercial catalyst. It also showed a very high C 5 + selectivity. In contrast to all other known Fe-catalysts, this iron ship-in-the-bottle catalyst does not show activity for the water-gas-shift reaction during FTS. Non-significant sintering was observed {{with the exception of}} a few larger Fe particles present in the big zeolite cavity. Further analysis of this catalyst shall provide insights into the sites responsible for CO 2 production, paving the way to a rational design of iron-based FTS catalysts...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} Cu–ZrO 2 {{catalysts}} prepared {{by a co-precipitation method}} were studied for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid to give γ-valerolactone (GVL). The {{effects of a}} range of catalyst preparation parameters, namely molar Cu/Zr ratio, calcination temperature and the ageing time of the precipitates, were systematically investigated. The molar Cu/Zr ratio was found to have a strong influence on the BET surface area of the material leading to a <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> for <b>catalysts</b> prepared with a Cu/Zr molar ratio of unity. Using this molar ratio the calcination temperature was varied from 300 °C to 800 °C, the material calcined at 400 °C showed the <b>highest</b> <b>activity.</b> Increasing the ageing time used in the catalyst preparation identified 6 h as the optimum to achieve the <b>highest</b> <b>activity</b> for LA conversion. Based on characterisation of all materials we conclude that the active Cu species is present in only low concentration suggesting that {{it should be possible to}} produce a <b>catalyst</b> of <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> with much lower Cu content...|$|R
40|$|This short review summarises {{the most}} {{important}} results obtained {{during the past decade}} in the field of palladium catalysed aminocarbonylation. In this reaction, using amines as N-nucleophiles, the carbonylation of enol-triflates/aryl-triflates or their synthetic surrogates, alkenyl halides/aryl halides takes place resulting in the formation of unsaturated carboxamides or aryl carboxamides. In the latter case, 2 -ketocarboxamides are also formed via double carbon monoxide insertion. The efficiency of aminocarbonylation is illustrated by several high-yielding syntheses including transformation of both simple model substrates and skeletons of biological importance. As green chemistry aspects of this reaction, the ambient conditions, <b>high</b> <b>activity,</b> low <b>catalyst</b> loading, the possibility of tuning selectivities and high functional group tolerance should be mentioned...|$|R
