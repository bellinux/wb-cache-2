40|$|Purpose: Hot working dies are {{influenced}} by three main factors causing their destruction: the cyclically changeable mechanical loads, intensive thermal shocks, as well as intensive friction, and erosion. The great variety of the shapes of forgings, the material they are made of (carbon steel, alloy steel, brass) and the precision of their production – whether {{they are supposed to}} undergo further treatment or are considered to be the final products – result in a variety of problems encountered in the production process. In this paper the wear mechanisms of different types of <b>forging</b> <b>dies,</b> covered by the composite layer “nitride layer / PVD coating” were analysed. Design/methodology/approach: In order to estimate the influence of the different shapes of forgings for their wear mechanism, it was decided to that maintenance tests on two series of tools with different shapes made of DIN 1. 2344 steel, coated with composite layer “nitrided layer/CrN coating” needed to be taken. The first one was designed for production of gears pre-forging and the second one was designed for the production of steel synchronizer rings. Findings: The abrasive wear together with thermal-mechanical fatigue and plastic strain is a crucial factor of the process of wearing of <b>forging</b> <b>dies</b> for the production of forgings with high dimensional accuracy and not subject to further mechanical treatment. The variety of the shapes of the forging and the precision with which it is made have strong influence on the intensity of the abrasive wear of <b>forging</b> <b>dies.</b> Research limitations/implications: To ensure higher effectiveness of the application of hybrid technologies of surface treatment for the increase of the durability of <b>forging</b> <b>dies,</b> the complex analysis of the influence of such various aspects of the forging process as: surface treatment, the shape of the die and the cooling and lubricating system are necessary on {{the development of a new}} generation of dies with increased operational durability.

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the most}} {{perspective}} development directions of surface engineering is related to hybrid technologies, which best fulfil {{the expectations of the}} industry concerning the obtainment of adequate properties of the surface of tools and machine components. The best known and widely employed hybrid technology of surface treatment using the diffusion phenomenon is the combination of gas nitriding or plasma nitriding (PN+CrN) followed by the deposition of hard, wear resistant coatings by the PVD methods. In this paper the wear mechanisms of <b>forging</b> <b>dies,</b> covered with the PN+CrN hybrid layer were analysed. Design/methodology/approach: The hybrid layers PN+CrN selected for testing were obtained by means of a multi-stage technology of surface treatment encompassing plasma nitriding (PN) and arc-evaporation process. Maintenance tests were conducted at Institut für Umformtechnik und Umformmaschinen in Hannover, according to different forging time. Findings: It was demonstrated that the dominating mechanisms of the wear process of <b>forging</b> <b>dies</b> covered with the PN+CrN hybrid layer are: thermo-mechanical fatigue of the CrN coating and thermo-mechanical fatigue and plastic deformation of steel substrate. Research limitations/implications: The CrN coating is of great importance in the wear process of <b>forging</b> <b>dies</b> covered with the PN+CrN hybrid layer. Very important in the die wear process is the resistance of the CrN coating to brittle cracking. CrN coating reduces, and as a result significantly limits, stresses initiated in the substrate in the forging process by the operation of external impacts. According to the results of simulation tests, 3 µm-thick CrN coating limits stresses initiated in material and hence reduces the possibility of plastic deformation occurrence in substrate. Practical implications: The obtained results of the tests have been practically applied in the surface engineering laboratory to develop modern surface engineering solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of different hybrid layers PN+CrN. Originality/value: In order to ensure the required level of effectiveness of the use of layered composites of the PN+PVD type to increase the durability of <b>forging</b> <b>dies,</b> it is necessary to properly select the composites {{on the basis of the}} analysis of the intensity of <b>forging</b> <b>dies</b> wear mechanisms...|$|R

In this context, an original approach for generating machining process based on machining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core {{of this approach is}} to decompose a CAD model of complex <b>forging</b> <b>die</b> in geometric features. Technological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric feature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as material, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging process and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and machining strategies.

Geometrical features identification is based on machining knowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL models.
