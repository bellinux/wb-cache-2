For applications, where more quantity is not necessary but slight modification is enough to alter the surface properties, simple groove <b>filling</b> method or groove <b>filling</b> and closing method can be adapted. Groove <b>filling</b> method is also appropriate to obtain thick composite layers compared with other processes as shown in Table  1. Of course, the thickness of a composite layer depends on the FSP tool pin dimensions and processing parameters. Where applications demand more amount of secondary phase at the surface, holes <b>filling</b> or holes <b>filling</b> and closing method can be chosen.|$|R
