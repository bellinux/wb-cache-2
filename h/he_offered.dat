She was also offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.

5|$|After he {{was passed}} over by Johnny Behan for the {{position}} of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882.

Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881 <b>he</b> <b>offered</b> the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers.

5|$|Aiello plotted to {{eliminate}} both Lombardo and Capone, and {{starting in the}} spring of 1927 made several attempts to assassinate Capone.

Instead, the chef exposed the plot to Capone, who responded by dispatching men to destroy one of Aiello's stores on West Division Street with machine-gun fire. More than 200 bullets were fired into the Aiello Brothers Bakery on May 28, 1927, wounding Joe's brother Antonio. During the summer and autumn of 1927 a number of hitmen Aiello hired to kill Capone were themselves slain. Among them were Anthony Russo and Vincent Spicuzza, who Aiello had offered $25,000 each to kill Capone and Lombardo. Aiello eventually offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who eliminated Capone. At least 10 gunman tried to collect on Aiello's bounty, but ended up dead. Capone ally Ralph Sheldon attempted to kill both Capone and Lombardo for Aiello's reward, but Capone henchman Frank Nitti's intelligence network learned of the transaction and had Sheldon shot in front of a West Side hotel, although he didn't die.|$|E
