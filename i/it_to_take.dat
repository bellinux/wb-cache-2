5|$|The brigade was {{the first}} of the US Army's Engineer Brigades to be {{converted}} to a modular design.

5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E

5|$|Now Vice President-elect, Johnson {{was anxious}} to {{complete}} the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for {{the election of a}} new governor did not allow <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's Bench to gain {{jurisdiction}} over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} was inactivated on 15 June 1997 in Germany. Over {{the next}} four months, the unit's inactive components were reorganized and redesignated as a brigade sized unit, allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on a larger support staff that could command more soldiers. This transformation occurred as the brigade was reassigned to the continental United States. It was activated on 24 October 1997 as the 166th Aviation Brigade at Fort Riley, Kansas. It was also activated into the Active duty force.|$|E

5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30, D Company {{launched}} an assault against the ridge {{south of the}} road, with two platoons of Sherman tanks in support from D Company, US 89th Tank Battalion. One tank platoon led the attack followed by the other carrying infantry from 10 Platoon D Company. Under the command of Lieutenant David Mannett, 10 Platoon made a right flanking assault along the road, while 11 and 12 Platoons attacked the ridge frontally across the paddy fields. Meeting stronger resistance than expected however, the attackers {{came under heavy fire}} and one of the Sherman tanks was knocked out by an armour-piercing round that hit its turret. However, with the American tanks providing vital close support to the infantry, 10 Platoon successfully secured its objective, allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the North Koreans in enfilade and to provide fire support to the assault. Thus, despite strong opposition, the remainder of D Company gained the high ground by 16:30. With the earlier airstrikes having been ineffective, D Company had been opposed by a number of T-34 tanks and SU-76 self-propelled guns, however the bulk of these were destroyed by the Shermans during the assault. Another tank had been knocked out by well-directed fire at point-blank range from a Bren light machine-gun by Private John Stafford, which caused the armoured vehicle's auxiliary fuel tanks to ignite, resulting in its ammunition exploding. Stafford was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star for his bravery.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{later in the}} game that the true villain is Ganon, King of Darkness. He has stolen a powerful trident and used <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of parts of Hyrule. He then stole the dark mirror {{and used it to}} create Shadow Link and then sent him to kidnap the shrine maidens and trick Link into releasing Vaati. In order to gain as much power as possible and build up his army, Ganon wants {{to take control of the}} shrine maidens' power as well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army. Vaati unknowingly furthered his plans by creating monsters to add to his army. It {{is revealed}} that the Knights of Hyrule were murdered by Ganon and their souls were trapped in the World of Darkness where they became creatures of Darkness. The four Links eventually save the shrine maidens, retrieve the Dark Mirror, destroy Shadow Link and Vaati, and face Ganon in a final battle. Trying to stop him from plunging the world into chaos, the four Links use the Power of the Maidens of Shrines, Including Zelda, to defeat Ganon, penetrating him.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Kursk, Model had {{anticipated}} {{the possibility of}} a Soviet attack into the Orel Salient, and had (without OKH's knowledge) constructed extensive defensive works to meet such an attack. Following the stalling of his advance, the Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Kutuzov, duly opened on 12 July. It involved not just Rokossovsky's Central Front, but also the Bryansk and Western Fronts, a greater concentration of forces than Model had assaulted in Operation Citadel. For the battle, Kluge placed him in command of Second Panzer Army in addition to Ninth Army—again, a larger total force than he had commanded in Citadel. The Soviet preponderance of strength was such that Stavka expected <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> only 48 hours to reach Orel, splitting the German forces into three parts; instead, the battle ended three weeks later with Model's orderly withdrawal from the salient. An idea of the scale of the fighting compared to Citadel can be gained from the combined casualty lists for Second Panzer and Ninth Armies: from 1 to 10 July, the Germans took 21,000 casualties, and from 11 to 31 July, 62,000. Despite these losses he had inflicted similarly heavy casualties on the three Red Army Fronts, shortened the line, and avoided annihilation. His standing with Hitler thus survived the failure of Citadel.|$|E
