The objective is the description of a pulsatile endoprosthesis capable of applying a chronic pulse within the descending aorta, similar to that produced by intra-aortic balloon. Methods: Pulsatile stents composed of nickel-titanium were built and positioned to engage latex tubes simulating the aorta. Different electric currents were applied to units connected in series in order to cause structure contraction and displacement of a liquid column. There were two sequence tests: first composed of two metallic cages and the second composed of five cages. At first sequence tests was applied a voltage of 16. 3 volts and a current of 5 amperes. In the second, voltage of 15 volts and current of 07 amperes. Results: In the first sequence was obtained the pulsatile effect of stent, with contraction of the tube and displacement of the water column sufficient to validate the pulsating effect of the endoprosthesis. The two structures ejected a volume of 2. 6 ml per cycle, with a range of 29 mm in height of the column of water equivalent to 8 % shrinkage during the pulse.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{generators}} (TEG) and coolers (TEC) {{consist of}} a plurality of n-type and p-type semiconductor TE leg elements, which can be utilized to convert heat into electricity, or conversely, create temperature gradients. The efficiency of a TE device {{is directly related to}} the material 2 ̆ 7 s dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT = S 2 σT/ K, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, sigma is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and k is the thermal conductivity. Bulk-alloy bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3) as the most widely used TE material has a room temperature ZT around unity. Recent research progress in nanostructured materials and composite materials enlightened the path to enhance the ZT above 1. Nanowire array topologies offer promise for engineering the electrical conductivity and phonon scattering effects, both of which have been studied extensively since the 1990 s. Conventional porous anodic alumina (PAA) was used for successful fabrication of Bi 2 Te 3 nanowire arrays, but with array thicknesses limited to tens of microns, too thin for high performance TE devices. The parallel nanowire arrays also suffer from mechanical fragility, low Bi 2 Te 3 volume fraction, limited thermal conductivity suppression, vulnerability to shear load and slow template fabrication. ^ In this work, I investigated the Bi 2 Te 3 branched nanowire array (BNA) topology that features nanostructure-to-bulk-like materials integration and radially modified nanowire compositions, allowing for thermal conductivity reduction, multiscale nanostructure creation, preservation of power factor, strain relaxation and shear compliance. Branched Bi 2 Te 3 nanowire arrays were fabricated from the bottom up by electrochemically depositing Bi 2 Te 3 into 300 - 500 micron thick branched porous anodic alumina (BPAA) templates followed by vapor annealing. The annealing process homogenizes the native point defects and can be used to introduce Se as an axially-graded dopant, which also forms nanocrystalline Bi 2 SeTe 2 phonon scatterers. The thickness of the nanowire array device can be fabricated up to 350 micron (wire aspect ratio 3 ̆e 1000 : 1), which is approaching commercialized bulk-form TE elements. Various characterization techniques including XRD, FESEM, HRTEM, EDS, AFM, etc. were employed to analyze the morphologic, structural and stoichiometric properties of the material. At room temperature, characterization of electrical, thermal and Seebeck properties were performed to demonstrate the device-level fabrication viability. At 300 K, thermal conductivity was measured to be 0. 5 W/m-K. Electrical conductivity was measured at ∼ 1. 43 x 104 S/m. An effective bulk ZT of 0. 31 was measured and the microscopic corrected value was 0. 39. To demonstrate the p-type TE counterpart, pulsed laser assisted electrodeposition was used to fabricate Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 nanowires. In addition, in order to calculate the optimum thermoelectric element leg length under different heat transfer conditions, a numerical model of thermoelectric device for both n- and p-type legs was developed in Matlab and powered by Rappture on nanoHUB. org. ^ The demonstration of Bi 2 Te 3 branched nanowire array structures enables a nano-to-bulk, composition-modulated and potentially scalable method to fabricate thermoelectric materials. The BNA structure maintains the nanowire <b>electrical</b> conduction <b>continuity</b> by electrochemical deposition, and offers extensive control over the wire radial composition and nanostructure. Moreover, the BNA 2 ̆ 7 s phonon scattering effect is attributed to nanowire array branching, high surface-to-volume ratios, grain boundaries, Bi 2 SeTe 2 nanocrystals and atomic alloying, covering length scales ranging from tens of microns down to less than a nanometer. Overall, the branched Bi 2 Te 3 nanowire array as a bulk-like thermoelectric material is a promising structure for enhancing the figure of merit, ZT, and has promise to lead to the development of superior engineered nanomaterials as a substitute for bulk Bi 2 Te 3 alloy materials.

50|$|Pinhole leaks with pitting {{initiating}} on {{the exterior}} surface of the pipe, can occur if copper piping is improperly grounded or bonded. The phenomenon is known technically as stray current corrosion or electrolytic pitting. Pin-holing due to poor grounding or poor bonding occurs typically in homes where the original plumbing has been modified; homeowners may find that a new plastic water filtration device or plastic repair union has interrupted the water pipe's <b>electrical</b> <b>continuity</b> to ground, when they start seeing pinhole water leaks after a recent install. Damage occurs rapidly, usually becoming obvious about {{six months after the}} ground interruption. Correctly installed plumbing appliances will have a copper bonding jumper cable connecting the interrupted pipe sections. Pinhole leaks from stray current corrosion can result in thousands of dollars in plumbing bills, and sometimes require the replacement of the entire affected water line. The cause is fundamentally an electrical defect, not a plumbing defect; once the plumbing damage is repaired, an electrician should promptly be consulted to evaluate the grounding and bonding of the entire plumbing and electrical systems.|$|E
50|$|Stray current {{corrosion}} occurs because: 1) {{the piping}} {{system has been}} connected accidentally or intentionally to a DC voltage source; 2) the piping does not have metal-to-metal <b>electrical</b> <b>continuity</b> throughout its length; or 3) if the voltage source is AC, one or more naturally occurring minerals coating the pipe interior may act as a rectifier, converting AC current to DC. The DC voltage forces the water within the piping {{to act as an}} electrical conductor (an electrolyte). Electric current leaves the copper pipe, moves though the water across the nonconductive section (a plastic filter housing, for example), and reenters the pipe on the opposite side. Pitting occurs at the electrically negative side (the cathode), which may happen to be either upstream or downstream with respect to the water flow direction. Pitting occurs because the electrical voltage ionizes the pipe's interior copper metal, which reacts chemically with dissolved minerals in the water, creating copper salts; these copper salts are soluble in water and wash away. Microscopic pits eventually grow and consolidate to form pin holes. When one is discovered, there are almost certainly more that have not yet leaked. A complete discussion of stray current corrosion can be found in chapter 11, section 11.4.3, of Handbook of Corrosion Engineering, by Pierre Roberge.|$|E

(e.g. early stages of construction where access to a reliable ground might not exist or where portable generators might be used) The use of ground continuity monitors is one option in these environments. GFCI protected circuits are also one option under the OSHA standard. Specifically, the OSHA regulation specifies “The employer shall use either ground fault circuit interrupters … or an assured equipment grounding conductor program … to protect employees on construction sites.” The OSHA regulation also requires that each ground conductor and/or cordset shall be inspected each day, prior to use and after maintenance. The ground is required to be checked for <b>electrical</b> <b>continuity</b> and this test must be documented. The automatic cord mounted GCMs eliminate the need to test each cord or circuit, since the electrical impedance to ground is measured at the attached cord device and visibility indicated there via an LED. These inspections are required by the OSHA regulation on “receptacles which are {{not a part of}} the permanent wiring of the building”. [...] As discussed earlier, the permanent wiring of a building might not be established during the early stages of a construction site and therefore would necessitate some assurance of ground protection.|$|E
