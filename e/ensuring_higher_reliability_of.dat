40|$|Three {{different}} almond cultivars (Spanish Guara, Marcona, and Butte from U. S. A.) {{were characterized}} by using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and thermal analysis techniques (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). All samples were directly analyzed without the need of a previous oil extraction. Similar FTIR bands were observed for all studied cultivars corresponding to specific functional groups characteristics of almond ingredients (water, fat, protein, and carbohydrates). Significant differences were observed between cultivars according to absorbance and maximum wave number values of specific bands observed by FTIR and melting and crystallization parameters obtained by DSC. TGA showed that samples were stable up to around 220 °C. Different stages of degradation were observed with increasing temperature corresponding to the degradation of the complex matrix of the samples. Successful discrimination was obtained for all samples by applying multivariate stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) separately to data obtained from FTIR and DSC. A satisfactory multidisciplinary approach was also performed by inserting together all parameters obtained from the 3 techniques as predictors <b>ensuring</b> <b>higher</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the obtained model. The obtained results proved the suitability of the studied analytical techniques combined with LDA for an easy and fast discrimination among different almond cultivars in food processing. Practical Application: The study of spectroscopic and thermal parameters {{could be used as}} a control tool for the direct and fast assessment of almond samples in food processing, particularly for protected designation of origin products.

40|$|Failures of {{engineered}} {{systems can}} lead to significant economic and societal losses. To minimize the losses, reliability must be ensured throughout the system's lifecycle {{in the presence of}} manufacturing variability and uncertain operational conditions. Many reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) techniques have been developed to <b>ensure</b> <b>high</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> engineered system design under manufacturing variability. Schedule-based maintenance, although expensive, has been a popular method to maintain highly reliable engineered systems under uncertain operational conditions. However, so far there is no cost-effective and systematic approach to <b>ensure</b> <b>high</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> engineered systems throughout their lifecycles while accounting for both the manufacturing variability and uncertain operational conditions. Inspired by an intrinsic ability of systems in ecology, economics, and other fields that is able to proactively adjust their functioning to avoid potential system failures, this dissertation attempts to adaptively manage engineered system reliability during its lifecycle by advancing two essential and co-related research areas: system RBDO and prognostics and health management (PHM). System RBDO <b>ensures</b> <b>high</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> an engineered system in the early design stage, whereas capitalizing on PHM technology enables the system to proactively avoid failures in its operation stage. Extensive literature reviews in these areas have identified four key research issues: (1) how system failure modes and their interactions can be analyzed in a statistical sense; (2) how limited data for input manufacturing variability can be used for RBDO; (3) how sensor networks can be designed to effectively monitor system health degradation under highly uncertain operational conditions; and (4) how accurate and timely remaining useful lives of systems can be predicted under highly uncertain operational conditions. To properly address these key research issues, this dissertation lays out four research thrusts in the following chapters: Chapter 3 - Complementary Intersection Method for System Reliability Analysis, Chapter 4 - Bayesian Approach to RBDO, Chapter 5 - Sensing Function Design for Structural Health Prognostics, and Chapter 6 - A Generic Framework for Structural Health Prognostics.

This scheme assigns a reputation score to network nodes {{based on an}} opinion generation and confidence of the decision.

To calculate this opinion, nodes may consider partial opinions attached to the message, opinions from other nodes (if the sender is known), {{or a combination of}} both. Next time this message is forwarded, the new opinion is attached to it. A long-term reputation system for vehicular networking is proposed in [14]. This system provides reliable reputation scores by taking advantages from nodes’ daily trajectories. Based on this experience, roadside infrastructure could rely on repeated daily observations of the same set of passing-by vehicles to build long-term reputation scores. To be deployed in a vehicular network, this scheme only requires nodes to have a secret and verifiable certificate. Patwardhan et al. [15] propose a reputation management scheme for VANETs.

With the growing complexity of the networks, there exists unprecedented challenges in network optimization and planning, especially activities such as cell outage detection (COD) and mitigation that are labour-intensive and costly. In this paper, we address the challenge of autonomous COD and cell outage compensation in self-organising networks (SON). COD is a pre-requisite to trigger fully automated self-healing recovery actions following cell outages or network failures. A special case of cell outage, referred to as sleeping cell, remains particularly challenging to detect in state-of-the-art SON, because it triggers no alarms for operation and maintenance entity. Consequently, no SON compensation function can be launched unless site visits or drive tests are performed, or complaints are received by affected customers. To address this issue, our COD solution leverages minimization of drive test functionality, recently specified in third generation partnership project Release 10 for LTE networks, in conjunction with state-of-the art machine learning methods. Subsequently, the proposed cell outage compensation mechanism utilises fuzzy-based reinforcement learning mechanism to fill the coverage gap and improve the quality of service, for the users in the identified outage zone, by reconfiguring the antenna and power parameters of the neighbouring cells. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can detect cell outage situations in an autonomous fashion and also compensate for the detected outage in a reliable manner...|$|R

The material investigated in this work is a wound oxide CMC with a defined fiber orientation and highly porous matrix.

Since failure is assumed to be caused by these pores, a statistical investigation of strength is performed, following the Weibull Theory. A number of tensile tests were evaluated and compared with results of finite element simulations (ANSYS). By application of an optimization tool (optiSlang), the parameters of different orthotropic material models were determined. An anisotropic Weibull criterion was set up and adapted to the results of the tensile tests. Thus the non-linear deformation behavior as well as the specimen’s scatter in strength could be reproduced.

The new method for the longitudinal strength forecasting, method <b>ensuring</b> the <b>high</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> forecastings at the relatively small volume of source experimental data, has been developed. The method for the durability forecasting has been introduced into operation.
