40|$|The {{identification}} of <b>innovation</b> in <b>service</b> firms is problematic {{since there is}} no consensus of opinion on its conceptualization. Recent papers suggest both distinctive features of <b>innovation</b> in <b>services</b> and distinctive types of <b>service</b> <b>innovation.</b> This article reviews and evaluates these findings from a Schumpeterian perspective.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{relationship}} between <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> and firm’s performances in the KIBS domain. In line with previous works, we maintain that <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> positively impacts firm’s performances but we also claim that this relationship {{is likely to be}} moderated by how the service firm conceives its service configuration. Particularly, we point out that service configurations based on standard and modular services positively moderate the positive relationship between innovation and performance. Using a sample of 239 Italian KIBS firms, we empirically test our model. Results confirm that <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> is positively associated with firm’s performances both as market size and, albeit weakly, as ROI growth. Results also confirm the positive moderating role of standard services while the moderating role of modular services is only marginal.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and reflect on a set of dynamic capabilities for managing <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> and applies a dynamic capabilities view (DCV) of firms for managing <b>service</b> <b>innovation.</b> Design/methodology/approach - This theoretical paper offers a conceptual framework for managing <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> by proposing six dynamic <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> capabilities. This framework builds on and is integrated with a model of <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> that covers the possible dimensions where <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> can take place. On this basis, avenues for future research into managing <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> are identified and managerial implications discussed. Findings - The six dynamic <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> capabilities identified are: signalling user needs and technological options; conceptualising; (un-) bundling; co-producing and orchestrating; scaling and stretching; and learning and adapting. It is hypothesized that successful service innovators, which may include manufacturing firms developing into providers of service solutions, outperform their competitors in at least some of these capabilities. Research limitations/implications - The six dynamic <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> capabilities identified in this theoretical paper, their mutual links as well as links with dimensions of <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> need to be tested further. Further refinement is required in order to be able to discriminate between various industries, sizes and types of firms.

Design/methodology/approach – A total of 475 sets of questionnaires administrated through mail to all three star and above rating hotel managers in Malaysia, and only 24 percent of it, which is 114 were usable. Regression was utilized to test the link of innovation strategies and performance. Findings – The results showed that hotels in Malaysia used process <b>innovation</b> and <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> as their functional-level strategy. Specifically, both process <b>innovation</b> and <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> strategies positively linked with performance. But, the paired sample t-test result indicated that process innovation has slightly greater effect on performance than <b>service</b> <b>innovation.</b> In addition, this study found that hotel size significantly affected the performance. Research limitations/implications – This study is one of the limited number of studies which has empirically addressed the effect of innovation strategies on performance in hotel industry. Additional researches are needed to address effect of potential mediators or even moderators in innovation strategies and performance linkage. Practical implications – This study found that implementation of process <b>innovation</b> and <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> as their functional strategy could assist to attain better performance in Malaysia hotel industry.

In addition, an open call was issued internally to NASA employees Agency wide (10 Field Centers and NASA HQ) using an open <b>innovation</b> <b>service</b> provider crowd sourcing platform to post NASA challenges from each Center for the others to propose solutions). From 2008 to 2010, the SLSD issued 34 challenges, 14 externally and 20 internally. The 14 external problems or challenges were posted through three different vendors: InnoCentive, Yet 2. com and TopCoder. The 20 internal challenges were conducted using the InnoCentive crowd sourcing platform designed for internal use by an organization. This platform was customized for NASA use and promoted as NASA@Work. The results were significant. Of the seven InnoCentive external challenges, two full and five partial awards were made in complex technical areas such as predicting solar flares and long-duration food packaging. Similarly, the TopCoder challenge yielded an optimization algorithm for designing a lunar medical kit.

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>innovation</b> {{has gained}} {{interest}} {{in recent years}} and new initiatives have been taken to integrate product <b>innovation</b> and <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> research. One of the reasons <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> has gained interest is that it includes not only <b>innovation</b> in <b>service</b> industries, but also <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> as <b>service</b> encapsulation of goods and other services. Still, the literature on <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> is fragmented and more knowledge is required to develop successful innovation policies and innovation management practices. This study investigates the relevance of customer involvement and value network partnerships in <b>service</b> <b>innovation.</b> Both topics are reviewed in separate literature studies reported in section 2. From these reviews, sets of testable propositions are developed. The propositions on customer involvement are further investigated by analyses of secondary data from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS- 3) and primary data from an empirical study of customer involvement in the <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> processes of selected service firms conducted in 2005. Propositions on value network partnerships are investigated by two case studies and by comprehensive analyses of the CIS- 3 secondary data. The method applied in these studies is elaborated in section 3, including how new measurement instruments capturing these <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> characteristics were developed. The investigations show that customer involvement has no universal effect on <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> results. However, they also show that specific types of involvement have positive effects on <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> results and that these effects are universal to all service firms. Thus, customer involvement may be used to improve <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> processes and obtain positive innovation results, but the specific types of involvement must be carefully chosen to obtain the wanted innovation results. Similar results were found for value network partnerships, which had a positive effect on innovation intensity for both newto- the-market and new-to-the-firm innovations, while no general effects were identified on innovation processes. Supplier cooperation, however, showed a positive effect on innovation processes intensity. Thus, engaging in specific cooperative arrangements seems to have positive effects on innovation intensity and innovation processes, and further detail on these relationships are given in sections 4 and 5. This report contributes by the empirical findings reported above and by the other detailed findings reported in sections 4 and 5. In addition, the theoretically derived propositions presented in section 2 summarize much of the status of our knowledge of customer involvement and value network partnerships in <b>service</b> <b>innovation.</b> Furthermore, the measures developed to capture these elements may be applied in further studies of <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> processes and types. The findings from this report have implications for <b>innovation</b> policy, <b>service</b> management and service research, suggesting that <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> differs from product innovation and requires particular attention by innovation policy makers. The findings also guide service firm managers in deciding how to involve customers and engage in value network partnerships to obtain positive <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> results and help <b>service</b> <b>innovation</b> researchers in their development of measurement instruments that better capture the unique characteristics of <b>service</b> <b>innovation...</b>|$|R
