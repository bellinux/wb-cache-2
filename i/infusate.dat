40|$|SUMMARY The {{vasodilator}} adenosine {{is produced}} continuously by the normal dog myocardium. However, {{the relation of}} adenosine production to increased cardiac metabolism requires clarification. This study tested the hypothesis that increased myocardial Oi demand promotes increased adenosine production to match coronary blood flow (CBF) to metabolic requirements. Increased adenosine production, therefore, should correlate with increased CBF and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVOi). Graded changes in CBF were induced through bilateral stellate ganglia stimulation (SGS) in open-chest dogs. Left CBF, MVOi, and the adenosine and lactate contents of pericardial <b>infusate</b> (Krebs-Henseleit solution) were measured. Pericardial <b>infusate</b> was placed {{in contact with the}} epicardium through a cannula introduced through the otherwise intact pericardium.

The correlation of <b>infusate</b> adenosine concentration with CBF was found to be, significant, as was the correlation of adenosine concentration with MVOi.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is {{hypothesised}} that nutrients increase {{pancreatic enzyme}} secretion by converting cyclical interdigestive secretion to a non-cyclical pattern. This study tested the hypotheses that nutrients do not interrupt cycles and determined {{the relation of}} nutrients, calories, and osmotic load to the rate of pancreatic secretion. METHODS: Twenty six healthy persons were intubated with oroduodenal and orogastric tubes. Each had one of four different solutions containing 12 to 36 % of calories as protein, 24 to 48 % as fat, and 40 to 64 % as carbohydrate infused into the duodenum at 40, 90, or 160 kcal/h for 300 minutes. Nine g/l sodium chloride (290 mOsm) was added to 16 infusates; osmolality of the other 10 <b>infusates</b> was 24 to 98 mOsm. Pancreatic enzyme outputs were measured every 15 minutes and peaks of enzyme secretion were identified. RESULTS: The number of enzyme peaks was similar for the different <b>infusates</b> {{and the proportion of}} nutrients in the <b>infusates</b> did not affect secretion of individual enzymes. The nadir, but not the peak of the cycles of enzyme outputs correlated with increasing the caloric load (r = 0. 55, p < 0. 003 for nadir:peak ratio). Increasing osmolality did not affect cycling but reduced (p < 0. 001) enzyme output. CONCLUSION: Nutrients entering the duodenum do not abolish cycles of enzyme secretion; instead they modulate cycles by increasing the nadir. Forty and 90 kcal infusions submaximally stimulate pancreatic secretion and might be used in patients with pancreatitis without producing pain; adding sodium chloride to solutions should increase this effect...|$|R

The trial is being conducted {{to confirm the}} findings of a prior pilot study that indicated this adjuvant therapy may be beneficial in extending survival of recurrent WHO grade III gliomas. To reduce costs of the cellular therapy, we tested a number of synthetic tissue culture media and found the AIM-V growth medium superior for their growth. We also moved the production of the alloCTL from artificial capillary systems to less expensive tissue culture bags. To standardize alloCTL <b>infusates</b> used for therapy, release criteria of ≥ 60 % CD 3 + and ≥ 60 % viability were established that consistently translated to a 4 hr cytotoxicity of ≥ 30 % at a 30 : 1 effector to target ratio. To allow time for completion of quality control testing and transport to the infusion site, we determined that 30, 000 IU of human recombinant Interleukin- 2 in the cellular <b>infusates</b> sufficiently retained cell viability and cytotoxicity to allow a 10 hr expiration time to be placed on the <b>infusates.</b> We identified a cytotoxic T cell subset, CD 3 +/CD 8 +/CD 69 +, that demonstrated upregulated IFN-γ production upon exposure to relevant target cells.

40|$|Aims.

Background. Catheter-related bloodstream infections are a serious and life-threatening complication of intravascular devices. Colonised intravenous fluids are one potential source of infection; however, there is little published literature on incidence rates and few recent studies. Routine intravenous fluid replacement has been advocated as an infection control method, but {{the effectiveness of this}} is unknown and the optimal duration for <b>infusate</b> use remains uncertain. Design. Cross-sectional study over 18 months in a 257 -bed teaching hospital. Methods. <b>Infusate</b> specimens (n = 264) were obtained from crystalloid fluids that had been used for 24 hours or more. Microbiological culture and sensitivity testing was performed and infusate-related bloodstream infection (IRBSI) rates were recorded. Sample testing of previously unopened intravenous solutions acted as a control. Results. The <b>infusate</b> colonisation rate was 0 紥, or 0 簹 per 1000 infusion hours. The only isolated organism was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Infusions had been in use for 24 - 185 hours (1 - 8 days). There was no difference in median duration of use for colonised (35 簠hours) and sterile (34 簠hours) specimens (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0 繹). There were no cases of IRBSI. Conclusion. The incidence of intravenous fluid colonisation and the risk of related bloodstream infection are low even after several days of <b>infusate</b> use. Current practice appears to successfully maintain the sterility of intravenous fluids. Relevance to clinical practice. Routine replacement of intravenous fluids continues in many settings, often 24 hourly, in the belief that this prevents infection. We found no relationship between duration of use and colonisation and routine replacement may be unnecessary. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of routinely replacing intravenous fluids at set time points to prevent colonisation and infection.

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} method using liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC/IRMS) {{was developed for}} measuring the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of glutathione (GSH) in neonates after infusion of [1 -(13) C]-glycine as a tracer. After transformation of GSH into GSSG, its dimeric form, the intra-erythrocytic concentration and (13) C-isotopic enrichment of GSH were determined using 200 microL of blood. The results showed that, using LC/IRMS, the concentration (range of micromol/mL) was reliably measured using norvaline as internal standard with precision better than 0. 1 micromol/mL. In addition, the (13) C-isotopic enrichment measured in the same run gave reliable values with excellent precision (with standard deviation (sd) lower than 0. 3 per thousand) and accuracy (measured between 0 and 2 Atom % Excess (APE)). The inter-assay repeatability of delta(13) C of norvaline used as internal standard with in vivo samples was assessed at - 26. 07 +/- 0. 28 per thousand with coefficient of variance (CV) at 1. 1 %. The FSR calculated either with GSH or GSSG showed similar results with slightly higher values for GSSG (41. 6 +/- 4. 7 and 46. 5 +/- 4. 4, respectively). The slightly lower FSR of GSH is probably due to interfering compounds in the biological matrix.

We used spontaneously occurring canine gliomas to investigate the use of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of liposomal nanoparticles, containing topoisomerase inhibitor CPT- 11. To facilitate visualization of intratumoral infusions by real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we included identically formulated liposomes loaded with Gadoteridol. Real-time MRI defined distribution of <b>infusate</b> within both tumor and normal brain tissues. The most important limiting factor for volume of distribution within tumor tissue was the leakage of <b>infusate</b> into ventricular or subarachnoid spaces. Decreased tumor volume, tumor necrosis, and modulation of tumor phenotype correlated with volume of distribution of <b>infusate</b> (Vd), infusion location, and leakage as determined by real-time MRI and histopathology.

This study evaluated the method of priming the infusion system (PRIMING), and its impact on the target-controlled infusion (TCI) of two remifentanil diluents. Methods: PRIMING was performed using an evacuation of 2. 0 ml to the atmosphere prior to TCI. Forty-eight TCI, using 50 μg/ml (Remi 50) or 20 μg/ml (Remi 20) of diluents, were performed targeting 4. 0 ng/ml of effect-site concentration (Ceff), with PRIMING or not. The gravimetrical measurements of the delivered <b>infusates</b> reproduced actual Ceff. The bolus amount and time to reach 95 % target were compared. Results: Without PRIMING, Remi 50 infused less bolus (43 ± 23 %) than Remi 20 (19 ± 9 %) (P = 0. 003), and showed more delayed increase of Ceff (11. 2 ± 4. 0 min) than Remi 20 (7. 4 ± 0. 4 min) (P = 0. 028). However, PRIMING significantly decreased the deficit of the bolus (2 ± 1 %), as well as the delay of the increase of Ceff in Remi 50 (1. 2 ± 0. 2 min) (both P < 0. 001). In addition, with PRIMING, the start-up bolus showed minimal difference to the nominal bolus (1 and 2 %), and Ceff were increased to 4. 0 ± 0. 1 ng/ml at the expected time of peak effect, irrespective of the diluents.

An extreme systemic inflammatory response may be observed in dogs that experience severe accidental trauma, such as being struck by a car. The inflammatory response may be so extreme that it complicates treatment and causes multiple organ failure. There are few currently available methods to counter an extreme systemic inflammatory response. The aim of this project was to use an ovariohysterectomy model to determine if systemic inflammatory mediators released in response to controlled trauma can be modulated by a fish oil infusion high in omega- 3 fatty acids. Three different cephalic vein <b>infusates</b> (fish oil, soybean oil, or saline) were given to dogs immediately following ovariohysterectomy and cytokine concentrations in jugular venous plasma samples were compared. After fish oil infusion, plasma omega- 3 fatty acid concentration markedly increased, but the increased concentration was not long-lasting. Cytokine production when stimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns was increased by trauma (ovariohysterectomy), but it was not suppressed by fish oil infusion. Assuming cytokine production by circulating leukocytes is a marker of systemic inflammation, fish oil emulsion infusion at the dose and duration studied did not appear to attenuate the systemic inflammatory response...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Convection-enhanced {{delivery}} (CED), {{a direct}} method for drug delivery {{to the brain}} through intraparenchymal microcatheters, is a promising strategy for intracerebral pharmacological therapy. By establishing a pressure gradient {{at the tip of}} the catheter, drugs can be delivered in uniform concentration throughout a large volume of interstitial fluid. However, the variables affecting perivascular distribution of drugs delivered by CED are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether the perivascular distribution of solutes delivered by CED into the striatum of rats is affected by the molecular weight of the infused agent, by co-infusion of vasodilator, alteration of infusion rates or use of a ramping regime. We also wanted to make a preliminary comparison of the distribution of solutes with that of nanoparticles. Methods We analysed the perivascular distribution of 4, 10, 20, 70, 150 kDa fluorescein-labelled dextran and fluorescent nanoparticles at 10 min and 3 h following CED into rat striatum. We investigated the effect of local vasodilatation, slow infusion rates and ramping on the perivascular distribution of solutes. Co-localisation with perivascular basement membranes and vascular endothelial cells was identified by immunohistochemistry. The uptake of <b>infusates</b> by perivascular macrophages was quantified using stereological methods. Results Widespread perivascular distribution and macrophage uptake of fluorescein-labelled dextran was visible 10 min after cessation of CED irrespective of molecular weight. However, a significantly higher proportion of perivascular macrophages had taken up 4, 10 and 20 kDa fluorescein-labelled dextran than 150 kDa dextran (p Conclusions This study suggests that widespread perivascular distribution and interaction with perivascular macrophages is likely to be an inevitable consequence of CED of solutes. The potential consequences of perivascular distribution of therapeutic agents, and in particular cytotoxic chemotherapies, delivered by CED must be carefully considered to ensure safe and effective translation to clinical trials. </p...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{hyperaemia}} is {{the increase}} in blood flow following arterial occlusion. The exact mechanisms mediating this response in skin are not fully understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the individual and combined contributions of (1) sensory nerves and large-conductance calcium activated potassium (BKCa) channels, and (2) nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids to cutaneous reactive hyperaemia. Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to measure skin blood flow in a total of 18 subjects. Peak blood flow (BF) was defined as the highest blood flow value after release of the pressure cuff. Total hyperaemic response was calculated by taking the area under the curve (AUC) of the hyperaemic response minus baseline. <b>Infusates</b> were perfused through forearm skin using microdialysis in four sites. In the sensory nerve/BKCa protocol: (1) EMLA® cream (EMLA, applied topically to skin surface), (2) tetraethylammonium (TEA), (3) EMLA® + TEA (Combo), and (4) Ringer solution (Control). In the prostanoid/NO protocol: (1) ketorolac (Keto), (2) NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), (3) Keto + l-NAME (Combo), and (4) Ringer solution (Control). CVC was calculated as flux/mean arterial pressure and normalized to maximal flow. Hyperaemic responses in Control (1389 ± 794 %CVCmax s) were significantly greater compared to TEA, EMLA and Combo sites (TEA, 630 ± 512, P = 0. 003; EMLA, 421 ± 216, P < 0. 001; Combo, 201 ± 200, P < 0. 001 %CVCmax s).

40|$|When nanoparticles/proteins are infused {{into the}} brain, {{they are often}} transported to distal sites {{in a manner that}} is {{dependent}} both on the characteristics of the <b>infusate</b> and the region targeted. We have previously shown that AAV is disseminated within the brain by perivascular flow and also by axonal transport. Perivascular distribution usually does not depend strongly on the nature of the <b>infusate.</b> Many proteins, neutral liposomes and AAV particles distribute equally well by this route when infused under pressure into various parenchymal locations. In contrast, axonal transport requires receptor-mediated uptake of AAV by neurons and engagement with specific transport mechanisms previously demonstrated for other neurotropic viruses. Cerebrospinal fluid represents yet another way in which brain anatomy may be exploited to distribute nanoparticles broadly in the central nervous system. In this study, we assessed the distribution and perivascular transport of nanoparticles of different sizes delivered into the parenchyma of rodents and cerebrospinal fluid in non-human primates...|$|E
40|$|To date, the {{clinical}} pharmacology of large intravenous doses of azithromycin {{has not been}} described. In the present study, single 2 -h intravenous infusions of 1, 2, and 4 g of azithromycin were administered to three parallel groups (in each group, six received active drug and two received placebo) of healthy male subjects. Toleration (assessed by scores of subject-administered visual analog scale tests spanning 0 [good] to 10 [poor]), safety, pharmacokinetics, and serum motilin levels were monitored for up to 240 h {{after the start of}} each intravenous infusion. Mean nausea scores of 0. 0, 0. 0, 1. 0, and 0. 5 and abdominal cramping scores of 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 4, and 0. 4 for 12 -h periods after doses of 0, 1, 2, and 4 g of azithromycin, respectively, suggested that azithromycin was well tolerated. Because of the standardized 1 -mg/ml <b>infusates,</b> all subjects in the 4 -g dosing group complained of an urgent need to urinate. There were no consistent trends in endogenous motilin levels throughout the study. The maximum concentration of azithromycin in serum (10 micrograms/ml after a 4 -g dose) and the area under the concentration-time curve (82 micrograms. h/ml after a 4 -g dose) were dose related. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters were an elimination half-life of 69 h, total systemic clearance of 10 ml/min/kg, and a volume of distribution at steady state of 33. 3 liters/kg. The pharmacokinetic results suggest that the long half-life of azithromycin is due to extensive uptake and slow release of the drug from tissues rather than an inability to clear the drug. Single intravenous doses of up to 4 g of azithromycin in healthy subjects are generally well tolerated, and quantifiable concentrations may persist in serum for 10 days or more...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} atrial conduction induced by MgSO 4 and glucose, insulin and potassium (GIK) {{during the first}} 12 -h period of sinus rhythm after successful DC-conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF). METHODS: Signal-averaged P-wave duration, QRS-duration and PQ-time were recorded in 20 patients who {{were randomly assigned to}} control or intervention. Ten patients received no <b>infusates</b> (control group) and 10 patients received MgSO 4 and GIK infusions (intervention group). P-wave duration was determined from the X-, Y- and Z-leads, which were further combined to obtain a spatial magnitude. P-wave morphology was studied by analysing global activation patterns and discrete components from the calculated spatial magnitude signal. RESULTS: No changes in the measured parameters were seen in the control group. The P-wave duration, QRS-duration and PQ-time increased from 139 (13) [mean(SD) ] to 149 (15) (p < 0. 01), 90 (7) to 94 (9) (p < 0. 05) and 188 (10) to 207 (13) ms (p < 0. 01). respectively, after bolus infusion of MgSO 4. The time {{from the start of the}} P-wave to its 1 st and 2 nd max. locations increased by 6 ms (p < 0. 01) in both cases after bolus infusion of MgSO 4 and had reversed after 10 h of MgSO 4 and GIK infusion. P-wave duration and PQ-time decreased after 10 h of MgSO 4 and GIK infusion, from 149 (34) (bolus) to 138 (12) and from 207 (13) to 195 (27) ms (p < 0. 05), respectively, in spite of an even higher serum Mg concentration at the end of this period. CONCLUSION: Bolus infusion of MgSO 4 2 h after DC-conversion of CAF produced an intra-atrial conduction delay that could be reversed by adding a GIK infusion, in spite of a concomitant increase in serum Mg concentration. No recovery of the intra-atrial conduction delay, seen after DC-conversion of CAF, was observed in either of the two groups during the 12 -h study period...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to elucidate mechanisms of increased milk protein percentage in cows fed diets containing steam flaked (SFS) vs dry rolled (DRS) sorghum grains. In experiment 1 treatments were: DRS diet plus duodenal infusion of 30 % sodium acetate (DA), or SFS diet plus duodenal water infusion (SFS). In the experiment 2 the DRS diet plus duodenal infusion of 23 % sodium propionate (DP), was compared with the DRS diet plus ruminal infusion of 21 % glucose (RG). Sorghum was 35 % of DM in all diets and <b>infusates</b> were 5 L/d. The SFS diet tended (P. 19) to increase milk protein content and decrease ruminal pH. The DA infusion increased FCM, and tended to increase fat% and yield. The RG infusion increased milk protein percent and decreased ruminal pH, and the DP infusion tended to decrease DMI. In experiment 3 treatments were: (1) SFS, (2) DA, and (3) RG. Diets and infused amounts were similar to previous trials. No parameters was affected by treatment, but milk protein percent, yield of milk and milk protein were numerically higher SFS than DA, similar to the previous study. Milk composition and production for cows fed DRS plus RG {{were the same as}} for cows fed SFS. An in situ trial was conducted to better characterize ruminal starch degradation. The same (DRS and SFS) diets were used as in infusions trials. Treatments were divided into diets and grains as follows: (1) diet DRS, (2) diet SFS, (3) grain DRS, and (4) grain SFS. Material for incubation was ground to pass a 2 mm screen and placed in the rumen for 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h. DM degradability was not affected by treatment. Starch degradability at 4, 8 and 12 h and were higher for the SFS than for DRS diets or grains. In situ data support the infusion data which of higher ruminal starch degradability with SFS than DRS. The studies suggest that increased milk protein content resulting from feeding SFS compared with DRS relates more to increased ruminal starch fermentability (as stimulated by RG) than to greater absorption of acetate or propionate...|$|R
