40|$|We {{studied the}} proliferative {{response}} of mouse T lymphocytes to determinants on ungulate insulins. The <b>immunopotency</b> of defined determinants on the molecule {{was found to}} be regulated by three factors: the immune response genes of the immunized mouse, the mode of presentation of insulin on cells or in adjuvant, and the intramolecular cooperativity between different determinants on the insulin molecule. Autosensitization against self determinants was observed under specific conditions. These findings emphasize the variable expression of immune response genes...|$|E
40|$|Tests, {{exploring}} {{hallmarks of}} cell-mediated immunity (CMI), {{were used in}} order to compare immunogenecity of same numbers of viable units from three different preparations of BCG vaccine derived from the same strain. Specific and non-specific cellular immune responses were assessed by several tests including, active and adoptive acquired resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, local and systemic granuloma formation. BCG persistence in the spleen, delayed type hypersensibility (DTH) to tuberculin, immunopotentiation of DTH to sheep red blood cells, increase resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection and occurrence of non-specific in vitro immunodepression. The ranking order of the three preparations concerning the active specific acquired resistance to tuberculosis did correlate well the ranking established for all <b>immunopotency</b> tests used in our study, however differences in acquired resistance were small as compared to differences observed for <b>immunopotency</b> tests. Moreover, adoptive transfer of same number of lymphoid cells from immune donors gave a different ranking order; the well dispersed fresh frozen (FF) vaccine being more able to induce higher adoptive protection {{as compared to the}} mechanically dispersed preparations. All these results clearly demonstrated that BCG could not be considered as single entity and that the test based on acquired resistance to M. tuberculosis or in vivo or in vitro hallmarks of CMI cannot be used as standard procedures...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{physical}} linkage of TLR ligands and vaccine antigens significantly enhances the <b>immunopotency</b> of the linked antigens. We have used this approach to generate novel influenza vaccines that fuse the globular head domain of the protective hemagglutinin (HA) antigen with the potent TLR 5 ligand, flagellin. These fusion proteins are efficiently expressed in standard E. coli fermentation systems and the HA moiety can be faithfully refolded {{to take on the}} native conformation of the globular head. In mouse models of influenza infection, the vaccines elicit robust antibody responses that mitigate disease and protect mice from lethal challenge. These immunologically potent vaccines can be efficiently manufactured to support pandemic response, pre-pandemic and seasonal vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Five healthy female bonnet monkeys (Macaca radiata) of proven {{fertility}} and normal menstrual cyclicity have been actively immunised with the purified chicken egg white riboflavin carrier protein (cRCP). All the immunised animals exhibited specific antibodies to cRCP and the <b>immunopotencies</b> of their sera varied at 200 - 840 μ g/ml at equivalent point. A definite fraction of antibodies in these sera specifically recognized the purified and ^ 125 I-labelled monkey RCP. Immunisation per se had no {{adverse effect on}} the animals menstrual cyclicity, circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone and the riboflavin status as reflected by glutathione reductase activities and the total flavin contents of the erythrocytes. The fertility of these animals was monitored for a period extending upto 3 years after primary immunisation. Four out of the 5 animals exhibited termination of pregnancy once or more than once depending on their antibody titers. Towards {{the end of the}} study period, when the immune response was poor, all the animals delivered normal babies at term. Circulating anti-cRCP antibodies were monitored by ^ 125 I-labelled cRCP binding. The results show that pregnancy termination, owing to immuno-neutralization of monkey RCP, occurred only in animals which had sufficiently high antibody titers. If the titers fell below a critical threshold level the pregnancies were carried to term...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHCV related {{liver disease}} {{is the most}} common {{indication}} for liver transplantation. Recurrence of HCV infection is universal and has a substantial impact on patient and graft survival. Immunosuppression is a major factor responsible for the accelerated recurrence and compressed natural history of recurrent HCV infection. Accumulating experience has provided data to support certain strategies for immunosuppressive regimens. From the available evidence, more severe recurrence results from repeated bolus corticosteroid therapy and anti-lymphocyte antibodies used to treat rejection. Low dose and slow tapering of steroids are better than high dose maintenance and/or rapid tapering. Recent meta-analyses favour steroid-free regimens but these are complicated to interpret as the absence of steroids may simply represent less <b>immunopotency.</b> There is no difference in HCV recurrence between tacrolimus and cyclosporine regimens, but tacrolimus increases graft and patient survival in HCV transplanted patients. There may be a beneficial effect of maintenance azathioprine given for 6 months or longer. There is no conclusive evidence for benefit of mycophenolate and interleukin- 2 receptor blockers. Few data are available for mTOR inhibitors. Better evidence is needed to establish the optimal immunosuppressive regimen for HCV recipients and more randomized trials should be performed...|$|E
40|$|Leishmania major is a {{protozoan}} parasite {{that causes}} chronic cutaneous lesions that often leave disfiguring scars. Infections in mice {{have demonstrated that}} leishmanial vaccines that include interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) as an adjuvant are able to induce protective immunity. In this study, we assessed the safety, <b>immunopotency,</b> and adjuvant potential of two doses of IL- 12 when used with a killed L. major vaccine in vervet monkeys. The induction of cell-mediated immunity following vaccination was determined by measuring delayed-type hypersensitivity, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation, and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production. Protection was assessed by challenging the animals with L. major parasites and monitoring the course of infection. At low doses of IL- 12 (10 μg), a small increase in the parameters of cell-mediated immunity was observed, relative to those in animals that received antigen without IL- 12. However, none of these animals were protected against a challenge infection. At higher doses of IL- 12 (30 μg), {{a substantial increase in}} Leishmania-specific immune responses was observed, and monkeys immunized with antigen and IL- 12 exhibited an IFN-γ response that was as great as that in animals that had resolved a primary infection and were immune. Nevertheless, despite the presence of correlates of protection, the disease course was only slightly altered, and protection was low compared to that in self-cured monkeys. These data suggest that protection against leishmaniasis may require more than the activation of Leishmania-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells, which has important implications for designing a vaccine against leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compared}} seed {{culture of}} hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) bacteria {{which was used}} to produce vaccine for its antibody induction efficiency before and after passaging in natural host (calf) using laboratory animals. Methods: Serial dilution of virulent bacteria was injected in to mice which were immunized with HS vaccine which was obtained from seed bacteria before and after back passaged in calf. Ratio of survived and dead was calculated by Reed-Meunch hypothesis and the LD 50 value for each vaccine trial groups were calculated. Results: The immunological study revealed that vaccine prepared from back passaged seed culture showed greater improvement in its <b>immunopotency</b> than seed vaccine (before back passage). Around 200 mice were used to study the immuno efficiency of vaccine. Each mouse was from the same source, which were free from the Pastuerella infection previous to expose to trial infection. The same broth culture of HS was used to induce infection in mice in both trials (vaccine before back passage and vaccine after back passage). The 0. 2 mL of broth dilution from 10 − 1 to 10 − 10 was used, as dilution increases, death rate decreases. It indicates the minimum load of bacterium is required to induced infection. Conclusions: Obtained results revealed that back passaged vaccine seed HS bacteria in its natural host had provided better immune efficiency to the culture than laboratory stock culture, and this findings recommended that regular annual back passage was mandatory for the vaccine seed culture of Pastuerella multocida bacteria for better establishment of immune potent vaccines...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} In this work, multifunctional lipid nanocapsules (M-LNC) {{were designed}} to combine {{the activity of the}} cytotoxic drug paclitaxel (PTX) with the immunostimulant CpG. This nanosystem, consisting of modified lipid nanocapsules coated with a cationic polymeric shell composed of chitosan (CS), was able to allocate the hydrophobic drug PTX in the inner oily core, and to associate onto the surface the genetic material CpG. The CS-coated LNC (CS-LNC), showed a narrow size distribution with an average size of 70 nm and a positive zeta potential (+ 25 mV). They encapsulated PTX in a high amount (98 %), and, due to the cationic surface charge, were able to adsorb CpG without losing stability. As a preliminary in vitro study, the apoptotic effect on GL 261 glioma cells was investigated. The drug-loaded CS-LNC exhibited the ability to interact with glioma cells and induce an important apoptotic effect in comparison with blank systems. Finally, the M-LNC made of CS-LNC loaded with both CpG and PTX were tested in vivo, injected via convention enhanced delivery (CED) in GL 261 -glioma-bearing mice. The results showed that the overall survival of mice treated with the M-LNC was significantly increased in comparison with the control, Taxol(®), or the separated injection of PTX-loaded LNC and CpG. This effect was also confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed the reduction of tumor growth in the animals treated with CpG and PTX-loaded M-LNC. All these findings suggested that the developed M-LNC could potentiate both CpG <b>immunopotency</b> and PTX antitumor activity by enhancing its delivery into the tumor microenvironment. </p...|$|E
40|$|The facultative {{intracellular}} bacterium Listeria monocytogenes {{is being}} developed as a cancer vaccine platform because {{of its ability to}} induce potent innate and adaptive immunity. For successful clinical application, it is essential to develop a Listeria platform strain that is safe yet retains the potency of vaccines based on wild-type bacteria. Here, we report the development of a recombinant live-attenuated vaccine platform strain that retains the potency of the fully virulent pathogen, combined with a > 1, 000 -fold reduction in toxicity, as compared with wild-type Listeria. By selectively deleting two virulence factors, ActA (ΔactA) and Internalin B (ΔinlB), the <b>immunopotency</b> of Listeria was maintained and its toxicity was diminished in vivo, largely by blocking the direct internalin B-mediated infection of nonphagocytic cells, such as hepatocytes, and the indirect ActA-mediated infection by cell-to-cell spread from adjacent phagocytic cells. In contrast, infection of phagocytic cells was not affected, leaving intact the ability of Listeria to stimulate innate immunity and to induce antigenspecific cellular responses. Listeria ΔactA/ΔinlB-based vaccines were rapidly cleared from mice after immunization and induced potent and durable effector and memory T-cell responses with no measurable liver toxicity. Therapeutic vaccination of BALB/c mice bearing murine CT 26 colon tumor lung metastases or palpable s. c. tumors (> 100 mm 3) with recombinant Listeria ΔactA/ΔinlB expressing an endogenous tumor antigen resulted in breaking of self-tolerance and long-term survival. We propose that recombinant Listeria ΔactA/ΔinlB expressing human tumor-associated antigens represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for further development and testing in human clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} Peripheral Tissue Equivalent (PTE) module is a {{three-dimensional}} tissue-engineered endothelial cell/collagen matrix culture system, {{which has been}} reported to reproduce in vivo physiological conditions and which generates dendritic cells (DC) autonomously. In the present study, we used the PTE module to investigate the <b>immunopotency</b> of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, including polyinosine-polycytidylic acid, Gardiquimod, CpG 2006 and lipopolysaccharide. Application of TLR agonists in the PTE module induced a wide range of cytokines, including interleukins 1 α/β, 6, 8 and 10 and tumour necrosis factor-α. Compared with traditional peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures, the PTE module produced twofold to 100 -fold higher levels of cytokine secretion, indicating that it can be a highly sensitive assay system. This increased sensitivity {{is the result of the}} natural synergy between the leucocytes and the endothelium. Furthermore, the application of TLR agonists, such as lipopolysaccharide and Gardiquimod, to the PTE module enhanced DC differentiation and promoted DC maturation, as indicated by up-regulated expression of CD 83, CD 86 and CCR 7 (CD 197). In addition, functional assays indicated PTE-derived DC treated with Gardiquimod, a TLR- 7 agonist, significantly augmented anti-tetanus toxoid antibody production. Interestingly, replacing PBMC with purified myeloid cells (CD 33 +) significantly reduced the responsiveness of the PTE module to TLR stimulation. The reduced sensitivity was partly the result of the removal of plasmacytoid DC that participated in the response to TLR stimulation and sensitization of the PTE module. Overall, the in vitro PTE module clearly demonstrated the effects of TLR agonists on DC generation, maturation and antigen-presenting capacity, and may serve as a sensitive and predictive test bed for the evaluation of adjuvant candidates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDue to its conservation, the {{extracellular}} {{domain of}} the influenza A M 2 protein (M 2 e) {{has the potential for}} being applied as a recombinant vaccine candidate against a wide range of strains, though its immunogenicity may need to be improved. The occurrence of several post-translational modifications within the structure of M 2 protein may affect its <b>immunopotency</b> for the induction of humoral immune response. Herein, to construct a recombinant M 2 e-based vaccine candidate with the appropriate structural conformation and immunogenicity the corresponding nucleotide sequence from an H 9 N 2 influenza strain was fused to the N-terminus of the truncated Mycobacterium tuberculosis HSP 70 (359 - 610), as a potent adjuvant, and following its cloning into the pPICZ alpha A plasmid the fusion gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris KM 71 H yeast. The secreted protein was then easily purified from the culture media, based on the presence of polyhistidine tag and used for the production of rabbit polyclonal antisera. This raised antisera could recognize the native M 2 e protein on the surface of H 9 N 2 influenza virus-infected MDCK cells at a comparable level with the commercial H 2 N 2 -specific anti-M 2 antibody, which was evidenced with immunofluorescence and cell-ELISA assays. These results not only re-emphasized on the conservancy of the M 2 e antigen, but also pointed towards the applicability of the M 2 e-HSP 70 (359 - 610) fusion protein for the induction of specific antibodies capable of binding to the native M 2 e antigen on the infected cells. Collectively, this study implied that purified M 2 e-HSP 70 (359 - 610) represents a promising vaccine candidate; however, its in vivo potency for the induction of protection remains to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a strategy for making synthetic peptide vaccines, in which a peptide, HA 127 - 133, derived from the hemagglutinin (HA) of A/Aichi/ 2 / 68 (H 3 N 2) influenza virus (Aichi/ 68) is introduced into the Ab binding component consisting of 43 - 46 and 54 - 58 residues of a pigeon cytochrome c analogue peptide, 46 F 50 V 54 A. Indeed, this hybrid peptide, 46 F/HA 127 - 133 / 54 A, induced impressive T-cell responses and antibody production neutralizing infectivity of Aichi/ 68 in vitro. In a subsequent study we found that 46 F/HA 127 - 133 / 54 A(18 mer) peptide antigen, which had been prepared by substitution at the central five residues of 46 F 50 V 54 A with HA 127 - 133, generated T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses as well. On {{the basis of these}} prior findings, in the present study we analyzed <b>immunopotency</b> of 46 F/HA 127 - 133 / 54 A(18 mer) in vivo administered in several ways to I-Ab mice. We show herein that this peptide vaccine loaded in multilamellar liposomes without adjuvant protects the mice against infection with Aichi/ 68 within 2 weeks after final immunization. Further, this peptide vaccine was shown to be effective in preventing infection with a naturally occurring antigenic variant, A/Texas/ 1 / 77 (H 3 N 2), carrying the same sequence at 127 - 133 of the HA as Aichi/ 68 virus. Since this part of the HA is relatively conserved among H 3 subtype influenza viruses, our peptide vaccine may become the basis for a new strategy to prepare effective vaccines that will overcome the ineffectiveness of classical vaccines attributable to antigenic drift of influenza viruses...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to produce a monoclonal antibody specific for the microgametocytes of Eimeria tenella, examine the site and stage specificity of the antibody, and investigate the <b>immunopotency</b> of the antibody. BALB/c mice were immunized with antigen containing Eimeria tenella microgametocytes isolated from in vitro systems. After three intraperitoneal immunizations with the antigen and one booster immunization administered by tail vein injection, the mice were sacrificed and their spleen cells fused with SP 2 / 0 mouse myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol as a fusing agent. Resultant hybridomas were screened by immunoelectrophoresis, indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay, and immunoelectron microscopy to determine the isotype, subisotype, site and stages pecificity of the antibody. Of four 96 well plates seeded with fusion products, four hybridomas were found to be producing anti body specific for the target antigen. Only the most strongly positive of these hybridomas, clone T 1 A 3 B 9, was used for the study. The antibody produced by this hybridoma was found to be of sub isotype IgG 2 b. T 1 A 389 monoclonal antibody was introduced into Eimeria tenella infected cell cultures on days four, five, and six post-infection. At seven days post-infection, oocyst production was assayed by fixing, staining, and counting the resultant oocysts. Results of the in vitro experiments showed a greater than 50 X reduction in oocyst product ion in experimental cultures over controls. Statistical significance of the data were confirmed by a Mann-Whitney U Test. These results indicate that the monoclonal a ntibod y was exert ing an inhibitory effect on the fertilization process. T 1 A 3 B 9 monoclonal antibody was incubated with Eimeria tenella infected cecal scrapings and cell culture material, immunolabeled with colloidal gold conjugates, and observed by electron microscopy. Results showed that the antibody was binding to the microgametocytes and to no other life cycle stages of the parasite, nor was it binding to host tissue. This indicates that the antibody is stage specific. Additionally, the antibody was seen to bind only to areas in close proximity to the budding flagella of developing microgametes, thus indicating distinct site specificity...|$|E
40|$|A {{platform}} for vaccine {{development has been}} developed at Georgia State University utilizing recombinant Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (FliC) fused to an antigen that can be overexpressed in Escherichia coli grown in a two-stage fermentation. The flagellin acts as an adjuvant to increase the <b>immunopotency</b> of the fused antigen. Flagellin is the ligand for Toll-like Receptor 5 (TLR 5), {{a part of the}} innate immune system. Binding of the flagellin:antigen recombinant protein to TLR 5 triggers a strong innate and adaptive immune response to the fused antigen leading to a potentially strong protective immunity to the antigen. Purification of the recombinant FliC fusion protein must meet rigorous criteria in order {{to be used as a}} vaccine. One of the major issues in purifying recombinant proteins expressed in a Gram-negative bacterium is the removal of endotoxin. Small amounts of endotoxin present in a vaccine can lead to serious complications, including death. Recombinant proteins are also expressed as either soluble or insoluble protein when over expressed in E. coli. Soluble proteins expressed by the bacterium are properly folded and biologically active, however removal of contaminants such as endotoxin, can be problematic. Insoluble protein is improperly folded and biologically inactive. The insoluble proteins aggregate into inclusion bodies with little or no contaminants associated with the protein, making purification easier. However, in order to restore the biological activity of the insoluble protein, it must first be solubilized and then refolded. This process is often expensive and time consuming, as there is currently no standardized method for protein refolding. In this study a purification method for the soluble protein of two FliC constructs, full-length FliC and FliC fused to a Marburg virus antigen, was evaluated for effectiveness in purification, removal of endotoxin and maintaining TLR 5 activity. The proteins of interest were purified utilizing only the soluble protein containing the properly folded and biologically active recombinant protein. Utilizing methods for purification that take advantage of physical and chemical properties of the protein the recombinant proteins were purified and the level of endotoxin reduced to levels acceptable for use as a vaccine. The TLR 5 activity of the soluble recombinant proteins was compared to recombinant protein that had been purified using a denaturing and refolding step. The soluble protein elicited a higher TLR 5 response at a lower concentration of protein than the refolded protein. Purification of the soluble fraction also involved fewer step and less time than purification of both the soluble and insoluble protein...|$|E
