50|$|Field flow {{fractionation}} {{is based}} on laminar flow of particles in a solution. These sample components will change levels and speed based on their size/mass. Since these components will be travelling at different speeds, separation occurs. A simplified explanation of the setup is as follows. The sample separation occurs in a thin, ribbon-like, channel {{in which there is}} an <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> and a perpendicular field flow. The <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> is where the carrier liquid is pumped into the channel and it creates a parabolic flow profile and it propels the sample towards the outlet of the channel.|$|E

50|$|Water being {{introduced}} into the clarifier should be controlled to reduce the velocity of the <b>inlet</b> <b>flow.</b> Reducing the velocity maximizes the hydraulic retention time inside the clarifier for sedimentation and helps to avoid excessive turbulence and mixing; thereby promoting the effective settling of the suspended particles. To further discourage the overt mixing within the clarifier and increase the retention time allowed for the particles to settle, the <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> should also be distributed evenly across the entire {{cross section of the}} settling zone inside the clarifier, where the volume is maintained at 37.7 percent capacity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation {{of the external}} and engine <b>inlet</b> <b>flows</b> for the F- 18 aircraft at typical high-angle-of-attack flight conditions. Two engine <b>inlet</b> mass <b>flow</b> rates, corresponding to flight idle and maximum power, were computed. This was accomplished using a structured, overset grid technique to couple the external and internal grid systems. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions were obtained using an implicit, finite-differencing scheme. Results show a strong coupling of the external and engine <b>inlet</b> <b>flows,</b> especially at the maximum power setting. Increasing the mass flow rate through the inlet caused the primary vortex breakdown location to move downstream. This trend is also observed in flight tests performed on the F- 18. A reversed flow region upstream of the inlet duct is visible in the faired-inlet and flight-idle computations. This flow reversal is not present in the maximum power setting computation. These large-scale changes in flow structure highlight the importance of simulating inlet conditions in high-angle-of-attack aircraft computations...|$|R
5000|$|The split priority, or merge ratio, is {{calculated}} when both inlets are in congestion. At this time, the total flow is μ, with <b>inlet</b> <b>flows</b> of μ1* and μ2*, the minimum capacities of the inlets when both are congested, where μ1* + μ2* = μ. The resultant flows {{are determined by}} the interaction between the two <b>inlet</b> <b>flows,</b> influenced by the physical characteristics of the intersection that cause drivers to merge in a defined manner. This merging process can be defined by split priority, p, which is the ratio of μ2* to μ1* (p = μ2* / μ1*). A common split priority rule is the [...] "zipper rule", which describes two flows merging where vehicles merging alternate between the two input streams.|$|R

BACKGROUND: The North American Neonatal Resuscitation Program manual states that self-inflating bags without a reservoir deliver approximately 40 % oxygen, differing from the PLSR manufacturer’s specifications. METHODS: A neonatal test lung was manually ventilated using PLSRs without a reservoir. A 50 psi 100 % oxygen source and an oxygen flow meter {{were used to}} provide desired oxygen <b>inlet</b> <b>flows.</b> FDO 2 was measured using 3 different PLSRs after 4 min of manual ventilation of a neonatal test lung, at differing inspired tidal volumes (5 mL or 20 mL), respiratory rates (40 breaths/min or 60 breaths/ min), and oxygen <b>inlet</b> <b>flows</b> (1 to 4, 5, and 10 L/min).

5000|$|The {{source of}} {{coefficients}} {{is coming out}} {{from the fact that}} rotating components will in fact change the fluid properties, because of vibrations (compressibility of the flow change). So if one wants to correct the fuel flow then a theta correction exponent should be found through iterations, but for corrections for flow at engine entry (W2) then this aspect on rotating components vibration is not accounted because much smaller than one inside an engine. As a consequence the <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> is corrected just by square root of Theta and divided by delta.|$|E
40|$|PaperPg. 189 - 194. This paper {{describes}} {{the relationships of}} inlet velocity distribution, incipient cavitation and suction performance of centrifugal pumps. It also discusses, in particular, the aspects of cavitation as related to <b>inlet</b> reverse <b>flow</b> (internal recirculation). There are many ways of improving the suction performance of centrifugal pumps. Enlarging the inlet diameter or inlet angle {{are two of the}} most commonly used methods. However, this may increase the capacity at which <b>inlet</b> reverse <b>flow</b> begins. <b>Inlet</b> reverse <b>flow</b> normally starts to occur at about half of the shock-free inlet capacity, and this has no relation to the best efficiency flow. Pump total head begins to drop only during advanced cavitation, especially at partial flow operation. When the impeller is designed with a large inlet angle to improve suction performance, there is a possibility of increasing the capacity where <b>inlet</b> reverse <b>flow</b> occurs, which may even be at the best efficiency point. There are still other ways of improving suction performance without increasing the capacity at which <b>inlet</b> reverse <b>flow</b> occurs, e. g. reducing the number of blades, sharpening inlet edges, etc., and these are also referred to in this paper...|$|R

50|$|Since all pumps require {{well-developed}} <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> to {{meet their}} potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{a nozzle}} {{connected}} to a vacuum source. As the pressure ratio gets to about 2, the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound, and the flow becomes choked flow. When the absolute pressure of the vacuum is decreased further, the flow speed will not increase. This is the Kantrowitz Limit, which limits the mass flow because the velocity {{is limited to the}} speed of sound, and the area, inlet pressure and density are all fixed. Aircraft jet engines are very much affected by this limit, once the <b>inlet</b> <b>flow</b> speed gets to Mach 1 the mass flow rate is limited, regardless of how much suction the engine creates.|$|E
