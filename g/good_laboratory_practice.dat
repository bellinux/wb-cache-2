25|$|Consistent with {{principles}} of <b>good</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>practice,</b> calibration is performed {{with at least}} two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The pH meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature thermocouples in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06volts per pH unit) with the pH scale. <b>Good</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>practice</b> dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed with distilled water or deionized water to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.|$|E

40|$|Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), simple, {{low-risk}} {{tests can}} be waived and performed with no routine regulatory oversight in physicians' offices {{and various other}} locations. Since CLIA was implemented, waived testing has steadily increased in the United States. Surveys conducted during 1999 - 2004 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and studies funded by CDC during 1999 - 2003 evaluated testing practices in sites holding a CLIA Certificate of Waiver (CW). Although study findings indicate CW sites generally take measures to perform testing correctly, they raise quality concerns about practices {{that could lead to}} errors in testing and poor patient outcomes. These issues are probably caused, in part, by high personnel turnover rates, lack of understanding about <b>good</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>practices,</b> and inadequate training. This report summarizes study findings and provides recommendations developed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee for conducting quality waived testing. These recommendations include considerations before introducing waived testing, such as management responsibility for testing, regulatory requirements, safety, physical and environmental requirements, benefits and costs, staffing, and documentation. They also cover <b>good</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>practices</b> for the three phases of testing: 1) before testing (test ordering and specimen collection), 2) during testing (control testing, test performance, and result interpretation and recording), and 3) after testing (result reporting, documentation, confirmatory testing, and biohazard waste disposal). They are intended to be used by those who would benefit from improving their knowledge of <b>good</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>practices.</b> Continued monitoring of waived testing, with a focus on personnel education and training, is needed to improve practices and enhance patient safety as waived testing continues to increase.
