50|$|Longtail Mabuya or Long-tailed Sun Skink is {{a species}} of skink. It is found in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and {{possibly}} in Cambodia. Some populations {{have been found to}} exhibit paternal care in response to predation by <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dasypeltis {{species are}} readily {{available}} in the exotic pet trade, but due to their unique dietary needs {{they can be a}} challenge to keep in captivity. Most <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snakes</b> never get large enough to consume typical chicken eggs, so smaller ones must be provided, such as finch eggs or quail eggs. Once a reliable source(s) of food is obtained, Dasypeltis make easy and hardy vivarium species. Captive breeding is virtually unknown, so almost all specimens available are wild caught.|$|R
25|$|The snake's jaw is {{a complex}} structure. Contrary to the popular belief that snakes can {{dislocate}} their jaws, snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, {{the two halves of}} which are not rigidly attached, and numerous other joints in their skull (see snake skull), allowing them to open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole, even if it is larger in diameter than the snake itself. For example, the African <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snake</b> has flexible jaws adapted for eating eggs much larger than the diameter of its head. This snake has no teeth, but does have bony protrusions on the inside edge of its spine, which it uses to break shells when it eats eggs.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} that facilitates {{the evolution of}} maternal care is ambiguous in egg-laying terrestrial vertebrates: does the ability of mothers to recognize their own eggs lead them under some circumstances to begin providing care or can maternal care evolve from simply being {{in close proximity to}} the eggs (e. g. through territorial behaviour) ? This question is difficult to answer because in most species, parental care is either absent altogether or present; in only a few species we have the opportunity to observe intraspecific variation in the expression of parental care. We studied a population of long-tailed skinks (Eutropis longicaudata) in which females have recently evolved maternal care from a noncaring state. Females on Orchid Island, Taiwan, remain with their eggs during incubation and when doing so, actively deter egg predation by <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snakes</b> (Oligodon formosanus); in all other populations, females lack post-ovipositional maternal care. Nest-guarding females on Orchid Island (i) showed antipredator behaviours only in the original nest site in which they laid eggs, even after we removed all of the eggs or substituted them with those of a conspecific; (ii) protect any eggs present inside the original nest site (even when the eggs belong to a conspecific); and (iii) develop this behaviour while gravid (i. e. prior to laying eggs). This supports the hypothesis that long-tailed skinks cannot recognize their own eggs, suggesting that maternal care is a directed form of territoriality only expressed towards <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snakes</b> and only during reproduction. Nest guarding is among the most primitive forms of parental care, and the recent evolution of this behaviour in a single population provides insight into one of the mechanisms by which parental care can originate in terrestrial vertebrates...|$|R

6000|$|A {{few other}} {{instances}} of mimicry {{in this group}} have been recorded. There is in South Africa an <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snake</b> (Dasypeltis scaber), which has neither fangs nor teeth, yet it is very like the Berg adder (Clothos atropos), and when alarmed renders itself still more like by flattening out its head and darting forward with a hiss as if to strike a foe.[112] Dr. A.B. Meyer has also discovered that, while some species of the genus Callophis (belonging to the same family as the American Elaps) have large poison fangs, other species of the same genus have none; {{and that one of}} the latter (C. gracilis) resembles a poisonous species (C. intestinalis) so closely, that only an exact comparison will discover the difference of colour and marking. A similar kind of resemblance is said to exist between another harmless snake, Megaerophis flaviceps, and the poisonous Callophis bivirgatus; and in both these cases the harmless snake is less abundant than the poisonous one, as occurs in all examples of true mimicry.[113] ...|$|R
50|$|Emydocephalus annulatus, {{commonly}} known as the turtle-headed sea <b>snake</b> or <b>egg-eating</b> sea <b>snake,</b> is a species of sea snake that can be found in waters of Oceania near Australia and some Pacific Islands such as the Philippines and the Loyalty Islands of New Caledonia. The geographic range is sporadic, for example, with populations distributed near the eastern and western coasts of Australia in the Great Barrier Reef and the Timor Sea reefs, respectively. They do not, however, occur in the Gulf of Carpentaria along the north coast.|$|R
40|$|Filial cannibalism, {{the process}} of eating one's own offspring, is {{relatively}} common in some animal species and has been particularly well studied in fishes. However, whole-clutch filial cannibalism committed by terrestrial vertebrate parents has rarely been reported. In this study, I describe the existence of whole-clutch filial cannibalism in the long-tailed skink, Mabuya longicaudata, on Orchid Island, Taiwan. When skinks encountered intruders against which they could defend themselves, such as the <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snake,</b> Oligodon formosanus, and the agamid, Japalura swinhonis, most M. longicaudata females would either attack (O. formosanus) or ignore (J. swinhonis) the predator, but when the frequency of intrusions by the intruder, O. formosanus, increased, whole-clutch filial cannibalism occurred. When females feel threatened by O. formosanus, the best choice (especially for gravid females) may be to eat their entire clutch of eggs. This behavior has evolved in this skink, thus providing a rare case of whole-clutch cannibalism by a mother reptile. Two existing hypotheses (decreasing brood size and brood age) to explain whole-clutch filial cannibalism suggest that cannibalistic parents may eat the entire clutch when the costs of caring outweigh the expected benefits. In the current study, my results suggest that whole-clutch filial cannibalism is primarily induced {{by the presence of}} predators. Thus, I suggest a hypothesis of predation risk of whole-clutch filial cannibalism, in which filial cannibalism by M. longicaudata increases as the predation risk to its offspring increases.

5000|$|In a study, the {{serrated}} hinged terrapin (Pelusios sinuatus) (also {{sometimes referred}} to as the [...] "water tortoise") was more commonly reported in the stomach contents of adult crocodiles from Kruger National Park than any single mammal species. Other turtle species commonly recorded among Nile crocodile prey include the Speke's hinge-back tortoise (Kinixys spekii) and east African black mud turtle (Pelusios subniger). Beyond their ready availability and respectable size, turtles are favored by big crocodiles due to their slowness which allows the cumbersome crocodiles to capture them more easily than swifter vertebrates. While adults have a sufficient bite force to crush turtle shells, sometimes younger crocodiles are overly ambitious and one choked to death attempting to swallow a whole large river turtle. A variety of snakes have been preyed on from relatively small innocuous species such as the common <b>egg-eating</b> <b>snake</b> (Dasypeltis scabra) to the largest African snakes species, the African rock python (Python sebae), which can exceed 6.1 m in length and weigh over 91 kg. Venomous species, including the puff adder (Bitis arietans), the forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca) and the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) have been recorded as Nile crocodile prey. The only frequently recorded lizard prey are the large Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus), although this mesopredator may be eaten fairly regularly as they often share similar habitat preferences, whenever a crocodile is able to ambush the stealthy monitor, which is more agile on land than the bulkier crocodile.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new species}} of <b>egg-eating</b> sea <b>snake,</b> Aipysurus mosaicus sp. nov., from northern Australia and southern New Guinea. This species was previously {{considered to be an}} allopatric population of A. eydouxii, which occurs throughout the Sunda Shelf and in New Guinea. Molecular analyses reveal these two species to be sister lineages with fixed nucleotide substitutions at three independent mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and a deep phylogenetic divergence exceeding that of all other sampled species pairs in Aipysurus. Aipysurus mosaicus sp. nov. is also distinguished from A. eydouxii by morphological characters relating to scalation (e. g. number of ventral scales), colour pattern (e. g. number and shape of transverse body bands), internal soft anatomy (e. g. position of heart in relation to ventral scales), and skeletal morphology (e. g. shape of nasal and caudal neural spines). Additional sampling is needed to clarify the extent of geographic contact between A. eydouxii and the new species in New Guinea where they appear to be sympatric. It is likely that the boundaries between these taxa will be mirrored in other coastal sea snakes with ranges spanning the deep waters of the Timor Trench; discovery of such cryptic species will have important implications for conservation of this highly diverse but relatively poorly studied group of marine vertebrates.
