5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than the last time <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|Kittie {{was formed}} in 1996, when drummer Mercedes Lander and guitarist Fallon Bowman met in gym class. Mercedes' sister, Morgan, became Kittie's lead vocalist and guitarist after Fallon and Mercedes jammed for several weeks; Tanya Candler {{completed}} the lineup as bassist. Kittie recorded demos and began playing dates in 1998. They played Call the Office and the Embassy, and signed up for Canadian Music Week in 1999. Kittie approached Jake Weiner, second-in-command at NG Records; when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> play live, Weiner signed them to NG {{during the summer of}} 1999. NG was acquired by Artemis Records toward the end of 1999, and producer Garth Richardson obtained the band's demo. Kittie recorded Spit, produced by Richardson, at EMAC Studios in London, Ontario. Mercedes Lander said that Spit was recorded in nine days.|$|E

5|$|Samaras {{moved to}} Manchester City on 30 January 2006 {{for a fee}} of £6million, a record for a Greek player. He was given the number 20 shirt. Samaras stated that he was excited about moving to Manchester City, because <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as being the next stage in his development. He {{also said that he}} would relish being in a team with the likes of David James, Andy Cole, and Trevor Sinclair. He made his debut for City on 1 February, as a 65th-minute {{replacement}} for Cole in a 3–0 home win against Newcastle United. His first goal for the club came in the following home match, against Charlton Athletic. The following month Samaras scored in a 2–1 home win against Aston Villa, to put City through to the quarter-finals of the League Cup. This was his fourth goal in six appearances. Samaras scored one further goal that season, in a 2–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Holly {{runs away}} from home and a {{large-scale}} police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having {{to accept the fact that}} Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.|$|E

60|$|The lad {{gave his}} evidence-in-chief {{with great care}} and deliberateness. He swore {{positively}} to Guy, and wasn't {{for a moment to}} be shaken in cross-examination. He admitted he had been mistaken at Tavistock, and confused the prisoner with Cyril--when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> one of <b>them</b> apart--but now that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>'em</b> both together before his eyes at once, why, he could take his solemn oath as sure as fate upon him. Guy's counsel failed utterly to elicit anything of importance, except--and here Sir Gilbert's face grew whiter than ever--except that another gentleman whom the lad didn't know had asked at the gate about the path, and gone round the other way as if to meet Mr. Nevitt.|$|R

25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of special search among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it looked so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E
25|$|Mughal {{played one}} match in the 1998/99 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for Gujranwala {{prior to their}} next big competition, the PCB Patron's Trophy. Having played his final game for the team in the competition, a draw against Faisalabad, he {{switched}} teams in October 1998, moving to the Agriculture Development Bank of Pakistan. Mughal had previously played for ADBP during their 1997/98 run in the Wills Cup, and although <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> past the group stages, the team {{did not make it}} through to the knockout rounds. The team, although winless in the previous season, went undefeated and finished top of the 1998/99 table. Tahir finished the season with another half-century, despite being pushed down the batting line-up. However, in the final, ADBP underperformed, and lost in an innings defeat by Habib Bank Limited.|$|E

25|$|Clemens {{was born}} in Dayton, Ohio, the fifth child of Bill and Bess (Lee) Clemens. He is of German descent, his {{great-grandfather}} Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated {{when he was an}} infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. Booher died when Clemens was nine years old, and Clemens has said that the only time he ever felt envious of other players was when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in the clubhouse with their fathers. Clemens lived in Vandalia, Ohio, until 1977, and then spent most of his high school years in Houston, Texas. At Spring Woods High School, Clemens played baseball for longtime head coach Charles Maiorana and also played football and basketball. He was scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Minnesota Twins during his senior year, but opted to go to college.|$|E
25|$|One of Clark's least {{successful}} acts {{as director}} was buying four early-sixteenth century paintings {{now known as}} Scenes from Tebaldeo's Eclogues. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in 1937 {{in the possession of}} a dealer in Vienna, and against the united advice of his professional staff he persuaded the trustees to buy them. He believed them to be by Giorgione, whose work was inadequately represented in the gallery at the time. The trustees authorised the expenditure of £14,000 of public funds and the paintings went on display in the gallery with considerable fanfare. His staff did not accept the attribution to Giorgione, and within a year scholarly research established the paintings as the work of Andrea Previtali, one of Giorgione's minor contemporaries. The British press protested at the waste of taxpayers' money, Clark's reputation suffered a considerable blow, and his relations with his professional team, already uneasy, were further strained.|$|E
25|$|Under Millward, St Helens {{quickly became}} the most {{exciting}} team in the competition, playing expansive, attacking rugby. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> soundly beaten in the 2000 World Club Challenge, losing 44—6 to Melbourne, but lead them to retaining their Super League title in 2000 beating Wigan 29—16. They also won the Challenge Cup in 2001; 13—6 over Bradford, with the final held at Twickenham Stadium for the first time, and the 2001 World Club Challenge, earning a 20—18 win over the Broncos. Millward then lead Saints {{to the top of}} Super League VII, and to reclaim the Super League title in the 2002 Grand Final, Sean Long snatching a last minute 19—18 win over the Bradford with a drop—goal. They lost the 2002 Challenge Cup Final to Wigan at Murrayfield Stadium by 21 points to 12. They were hammered in the 2003 World Club Challenge by Sydney by 38 points to 0. In this season, they failed to win a trophy after being knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Leeds at the semi—final stage, and the Super League play—offs by Wigan at the same stage. In 2004 they beat arch—rivals Wigan 32—16 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff in front of a capacity crowd of 73,734 people to win the Challenge Cup, Long gaining his second of an eventual three Lance Todd Trophies.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} Al-Biruni’s {{analysis}} is his summary of why many Hindus hate Muslims. Biruni {{notes in the}} beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture. He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which—claimed Al-Biruni—contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, {{and did not want to}} share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents. He also criticized the Hindus on what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion. Al-Biruni's translations as well as his own original contributions reached Europe in 12th and 13th century, where they were actively sought.|$|E
500|$|Several works {{may have}} had an {{influence}} on the writing of A Christmas Carol, including two Douglas Jerrold essays: one from an 1841 issue of Punch, [...] "How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas" [...] and one from 1843, [...] "The Beauties of the Police". More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as stories of conversion and transformation.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of their}} unprepossessing nature, the Myxogastriae were {{for a long}} time not well researched. Thomas Panckow first named the mould Lycogala epidendrum as [...] "Fungus cito crescentes" [...] in his 1654 book Herbarium Portatile, oder behendes Kräuter- und Gewächsbuch. In 1729, Pier Antonio Micheli thought that fungi are {{different}} from moulds, and Heinrich Friedrich Link agreed with this theory in 1833. Elias Magnus Fries documented the plasmodial stage in 1829, and 35 years later Anton de Bary observed the germination of the spores. De Bary also discovered the cyclosis in the cell for the movement, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as animal-like creatures and reclassified them as Mycetozoa, which literally translates [...] "Fungus animals". This theory dominated until {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Merv Griffin {{conceived}} Wheel of Fortune just as {{the original}} version of Jeopardy!, another show he had created, was ending its 11-year run on NBC with Art Fleming as its host. Griffin decided to create a Hangman-style game after recalling long car trips as a child, on which he and his sister would play Hangman. After he discussed the idea with Merv Griffin Enterprises' staff, they thought that the idea would work as a game show if it had a [...] "hook". He decided to add a roulette-style wheel because he was always [...] "drawn to" [...] such wheels when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in casinos.

In low cliffs near the point Darwin found conglomerate rocks containing numerous shells and fossilised teeth and bones of gigantic extinct mammals, in strata near an earth layer with shells and armadillo fossils, suggesting to him quiet tidal deposits rather than a catastrophe. With assistance (possibly including the young sailor Syms Covington acting as his servant) Darwin collected numerous fossils over several days, amusing others with [...] "the cargoes of apparent rubbish which he frequently brought on board".|$|E
