His assistant recommended the Zola novel, and began developing {{the idea in}} detail with the production executive. Later, when Warner Bros. passed on this, the idea and notes that were developed by Ockren't staff members were give to Stroman. Her original <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{make it into a}} ballet, but decided against it, and felt it could be strong enough as a musical. The idea for the musical Contact had also originally been developed at Ockrent's Warner Bros. office by the same two staff members, and then also offered over to Stroman by Ockrent when it didn't fly with the film studio.|$|E
500|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{shortly before the}} conclusion of Clamp's Magic Knight Rayearth, which was serialized in Nakayoshi. Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in Nakayoshi, and Clamp {{decided to make a}} [...] "Nakayoshi-esque" [...] series, as opposed to Rayearth, which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer Nanase Ohkawa's first <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a magical girl series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura {{to be in the same}} age group as the majority of Nakayoshis readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp—Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi—design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "Cubisme" [...] is {{employed}} {{for the first}} time outside France in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking {{in the context of an}} exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Archipenko, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, Segonzac, Le Fauconnier and Jean Marchand. But Jean Metzinger, who had been termed [...] "the Emperor of Cubism" [...] during the spring in Paris, was not among the artist exhibiting works in Brussels. Apollinaire’s <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> define L'Esprit nouveau observed in a range of paintings, from proto-Cubist quasi-Fauve landscapes to the semi-abstract geometric compositions of artists such as Metzinger, Delaunay, Gleizes and a growing group of followers. In his chapter on Picasso, however, there is no mention of the term Cubism.|$|E

Washington first offered command of the expedition to Horatio Gates, the [...] "Hero of Saratoga," [...] but Gates turned down the offer, ostensibly for health reasons. Major General John Sullivan, fifth on the seniority list, was offered command on March 6, 1779, and accepted.

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor went public, Western Airlines responded to a request to move {{ammunition}} to units without it along the Pacific Coast. Other carriers followed the example within hours and on December 11 Gorrell cabled both Chief of the Army Air Forces Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall that the airlines were performing their assigned functions in the plans. Nevertheless, President Roosevelt's initial <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> nationalize the scheduled air carriers and on December 13 he issued Executive Order 8974 {{to take control of the}} airlines. [...] Gorrell was aware that airline responsiveness was crucial to forestalling nationalization and promptly provided aircraft and crews at the first strategic request, made to ATA the same day. The next day, while a deal was being brokered with Assistant Secretary of War for Air Robert A. Lovett to turn over voluntarily more than half the airlines' aircraft and crews to the AAF Ferrying Command (ACFC) on a contract basis, the promised transports arrived at their staging points.|$|E

On the other hand, when the <b>impulses</b> <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> stabilize the system, an upper bound of average impulsive interval is derived; namely, enough <b>impulses</b> <b>are</b> needed <b>to</b> stabilize the system.

40|$|In press, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision ProcessesInternational audienceIndividuals' {{willingness}} {{to act in}} socially desirable ways, such as sharing resources with others and abiding by norms of ethical conduct, is a necessary condition of social life. The current research reconciles two seemingly contradicting sets of findings {{on the role of}} cognitive control in socially desirable behaviors. One set of findings suggests that people are tempted by self-serving impulses and have to rely on cognitive control overriding such impulses to act in socially desirable ways. Another set of findings suggests people are guided by other-regarding impulses and cognitive control <b>is</b> not necessary <b>to</b> motivate socially desirable behaviors. We provide a theoretical and empirical integration of these findings by identifying a key situational variable [...] the salience of interpersonal impact [...] that determines whether the dominant <b>impulse</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> behave in a self-serving or a socially desirable manner. We suggest that the dominant <b>impulse</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> behave in a socially desirable manner when the interpersonal impact of an action is salient, and that the dominant <b>impulse</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> behave in a self-serving manner when the interpersonal impact of an action is not salient. Consistent with this prediction, Studies 1 - 3 found that impairing participants' cognitive control led to less socially desirable behavior when interpersonal impact was not salient, but more socially desirable behavior when interpersonal impact was salient. Study 4 extended these findings by demonstrating that behaving in a socially desirable manner causes cognitive control impairment when interpersonal impact is not salient. But, when interpersonal impact is salient, behaving in a self-serving manner impairs cognitive control. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding and managing socially desirable behaviors...|$|R
