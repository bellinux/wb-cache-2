40|$|Pleiotropic {{effects of}} two ribosomal {{mutations}} for cycloheximide resistance were studied in a double-resistant <b>homocaryon.</b> The results obtained {{indicated that the}} combination of the two ribosomal mutations results in: (i) morphological abnormalities which suggest a severe distortion in the extension of cell walls and membranes; (ii) disturbance in the normal 60 S- 40 S subunit ratio; (iii) decreased rate of cell mass production not necessarily associated with inbalance in the 60 S- 40 S ratio; and (iv) cold sensitivity which does not interfere with mycelial mass production...|$|E
40|$|It is {{discussed}} that the protoplasts isolated enzymatically {{from the plant}} tissues {{may be used for}} the experimental materials of the cytological, genetical and practical studies. A lot of protoplasts could be isolated rapidly from some materials, which had not been done before. Tomato protoplasts fused for less than five minutes at ca. 30 ℃ by means of PEG treatments, and the process of these phenomena was successively chased by photographs. Protoplasts from the tobacco culture cells and the mesophyll cells of Erigeron annuus L. were fused under PEG solutions and they formed heterocaryon. These fused protoplasts (heterocaryon in green and non-green colour mixtures) are clearly distinguished from <b>homocaryon</b> arisen as the results that the same kind of protoplasts fused each other...|$|E
40|$|The tetrapolarity and multiallelism of Lenzites betulinus are {{confirmed}} as established by Vandendries and Brodie in 1932. The genotype {{of the four}} compatibility groups is re-attributed after detection by retroconfrontation of heterocaryosis in A=B not-equal confrontations. The phenotypes of interactions between hemi-compatible <b>homocaryons,</b> particularly that of ''sexual barrier'' (A not-equal B=), are redescribed. The hyphothesis of a gazeous production as the agent of mutual sexual repulsion by Vandendries and Brodie is revised as a repulsive pheromone production...|$|R
30|$|The FSC 1 strain {{possesses}} {{high and}} stable rates of xylose fermentation and ethanol production from a substrate containing glucose and xylose. We {{consider that the}} mutation of the parental strains enabled their fusion to transfer genes for xylose fermentation of C. intermedia and for ethanol production of S. cerevisiae. Since the FSC 1 strain was apparently uninucleate (Figure  4 d), we confirmed that our mutation-fusion technique resulted in nuclear fusion of protoplasts, which is desirable since <b>homocaryons</b> are metabolically more stable than heterocaryons. Since the FSC 1 strain produces spores in KAc medium for sporulation (Figure  2 b, d and f), {{we believe that the}} FSC 1 strain is diploid, resulting from fusion between M 2 and m 11 haploids. This is not contradictory to previous studies reporting that several Candida species have MTL loci with two idiomorphs, namely a and α, which are mating type-like loci similar to MATa and MATα of S. cerevisiae[22], although Candida is a large and heterogeneous taxon.|$|R
