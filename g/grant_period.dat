40|$|Abstract. In a {{perfectly}} periodic schedule, each job must be scheduled precisely every some fixed number of time units after its previous occurrence. Traditionally, motivated by centralized systems, the perfect periodicity requirement is relaxed, {{the main goal}} being to attain the requested average rate. Recently, motivated by mobile clients with limited power supply, perfect periodicity {{seems to be an}} attractive alternative that allows clients to save energy by reducing their “busy waiting ” time. In this case, clients may be willing to compromise their requested service rate in order to get perfect periodicity. In this paper we study a general model of perfectly periodic schedules, where each job has a requested period and a length; we assume that m jobs can be served in parallel for some given m. Job lengths may not be truncated, but <b>granted</b> <b>periods</b> may be different than the requested periods. We present an algorithm which computes schedules such that the worst-case proportion between the requested <b>period</b> and the <b>granted</b> <b>period</b> is guaranteed to be close to the lower bound.
