In the show, Superman travels to the 31st century to help superheroes battle against the Fatal Five villains. In an {{interview}} with The Oklahoman, Lowenthal recalled that he read for Lightning Lad and Brainiac 5 in the original audition, and was called back to do Superman. During the callback, he had begun reading for Superman and Braniac 5 when the producers stopped him. He was later informed that he got the main role, {{and they did not}} need to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> him on other parts.|$|E
500|$|Rap-Up {{labelled}} [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as one {{of their}} favorite songs on the album, alongside [...] "Climax", [...] "Lemme See" [...] and [...] "Twisted", while Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush called [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] a [...] "big standout" [...] on the album. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labelled [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as an [...] "essential track" [...] of Looking 4 Myself and stated that, alongside [...] "What Happened to U", the song displays the same [...] "vocal prowess" [...] {{as the rest of the}} album, but is matched with [...] "beats of higher sophistication which avers his earnest attempt to deviate from a traditional blend of R and hip-hop". According to Verse of SoulCulture [...] "'Sins Of My Father', with its reggae vibe meets Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield sensibilities addressing family issues this is the sort of track we need to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> from our artists." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{convinced}} that she would only play violin, eighteen-year-old Autumn decided to sing {{on one of her}} songs as a way of demonstrating to a major music producer, who wanted to sign her on a label, how it should sound. She became unhappy with the changes done to her songs, and decided to break away from the label and create her own independent record label, Traitor Records. Through it, she debuted with her classical album , which she recorded in 1997 when she was seventeen years old; its title refers {{to the fact that the}} album took only a day to record. It consists of her performing works for the baroque violin accompanied by Roger Lebow on the baroque cello, Edward Murray on harpsichord, and Michael Egan on lute. She considered it [...] "more of a demo despite its length", and released it as [...] "a saleable album" [...] after fans who enjoyed her [...] "rock performances starting asking for a classical album so that they could <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the violin." [...] She also debuted with her poetry book Across the Sky & Other Poems in 2000, later re-released in 2005 as Your Sugar Sits Untouched with a music-accompanied audiobook.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Buried Secrets" [...] left me {{wondering if}} there was even more to Megan's father's death than a simple suicide. There must be a story there and I hope we get to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> it. [...] It {{would be nice to}} see Megan get her answers, no matter what they may be". Orlando called Joan [...] "a real piece of work" [...] saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body. She added that Joan was [...] "cold" [...] saying this adding, [...] "I suddenly understood why Megan avoids Mom like the plague". Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E
500|$|Heather Phares of Allmusic {{rated the}} album 3 out of 5 stars and commented, [...] "her voice is {{pleasant}} enough, but it's not especially distinctive, and she's not {{helped by a}} batch of songs that aren't nearly as charming as High School Musicals tunes." [...] Phares also said that although the album wasn't winning considering the high-profile songwriters and producers involved, [...] "it's fine for anyone who just wants to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Ashley Tisdale's -- and not Sharpay Evans' -- singing." [...] Jon Dolan of Blender said Tisdale did not import her [...] "spunky" [...] High School Musical character in the album, and that even {{with the quality of}} producers, [...] "no stylistic slipper fits right." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said Tisdale went, [...] "the contemporary CHR school of fellow Mouse products Britney Spears and first-album Christina Aguilera—lots of synthesizer-laden, beat-heavy, layered-vocal dance tracks" [...] that varied between [...] "come-hithers" [...] and [...] "self-affirming anthems." [...] Graff commented, [...] "she'll have to develop a more defined identity before she can truly win our affections." [...] James Ross of The Arizona Daily Wildcat commended the album's uptempo songs but critiqued the ballads, commenting she hits the right notes on uptempo numbers, while on ballads, [...] "Any 'Musical' fan knows that Tisdale can belt one out, but this is not apparent on the album." [...] Overall, Ross said, [...] "Although the album fails in places, it is ll [...] a worthy attempt by an up-and-coming pop artist to please her audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{disliked the}} UK cover of Are You Experienced, so {{arrangements}} {{were made for}} a photo shoot with graphic designer Karl Ferris. Hendrix wanted [...] "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release Evolution. During {{a meeting with the}} band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, Axis: Bold as Love. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with Are You Experienced he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was [...] "so far out that it seemed to come from outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a [...] "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." [...] With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a fisheye lens which was then popular in Mod sub-culture. Ferris used what Egan described as [...] "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King's Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of Are You Experienced was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.|$|E

2500|$|The album reached No.9 and {{all three}} singles peaked in the top40. The album {{included}} a cover version of the Beatles track, [...] "Baby, You're a Rich Man". According to Hannan [...] "The first two singles from the release, 'Motor City' and 'Sweet Love', would go close to earning the 'most played' title during silly season rotation.

2500|$|Evans never embraced {{new music}} movements; {{he kept his}} style intact. For example, he lamented {{watching}} Davis shift his style towards jazz fusion, and blamed the change on considerations of commerce. Evans commented [...] "I would like to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the consummate melodic master , but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience. It happens more and more these days, that unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music." [...] However, Evans and Davis kept in touch throughout their lives.|$|E
