500|$|Cast {{members were}} more {{critical}} of Eve's later appearances on the show. Ross reacted negatively to Eve's involvement in Vincent's storylines. She said that Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and she could only complete the birth scenes after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Eve's incorrect reattachment of Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore.

500|$|By season five of Voyager, certain {{characters}} were {{seen by the}} production staff as being under-utilised, Kim amongst them. This led to episodes placing Kim, Chakotay and Tuvok in central positions, including the episode [...] "" [...] for the character of Kim. Wang {{was pleased with the}} episode, and felt that being able to act as the two different versions of Kim showed [...] "a great dichotomy". Following {{the end of the show}} in 2001, Wang had felt that the character should have been promoted during the course of the series, but was told by producers that [...] "someone's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> ensign".|$|E
500|$|Other Passions {{cast members}} {{had a more}} {{uncertain}} understanding of the character. Tracey Ross, who portrayed Eve Russell, responded negatively to Vincent's involvement in her character's storylines. While discussing the filming of the scenes in which Vincent gives birth to his father's child, Ross said she felt [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and could only complete them after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Vincent's manipulation of Eve to incorrectly reattach Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore, ("This has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?"), who cited it {{as a reason for}} the show's cancellation.

He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", {{in sharp contrast to}} what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of".

500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly rated [...] "Irresistible" [...] a B+, {{saying it was}} based on [...] "an unsettling concept to begin with" [...] that was reinforced by [...] "Chinlund's skin-crawling one-man show". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode A, praising the acting, particularly of Chinlund as Pfaster, and describing it as [...] "legitimately scary, a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions". The only criticism was for the scenes where Scully hallucinates Pfaster shapeshifting as [...] "pretty silly, almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in the episode so the fans don't get bored with what is ultimately a very good episode". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+ grade. Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi ranked [...] "Irresistible" [...] the sixth best X-Files episode, saying that [...] "excluding CSM and his cronies, Pfaster has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most disturbing villain that our favorite agents have encountered". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named it the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the second season, describing it as [...] "a genuinely creepy 45-minute horror movie". Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Pfaster among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, and IGN's Christine Seghers ranked Chinlund the seventh best guest star {{in the history of the}} show, considering that [...] "what makes him all the more frightening is how downright passive and polite he is up until the moment he's going to kill; the perfect camouflage for a modern-day monster." [...] TV Guide listed Pfaster among the [...] scariest X-Files monsters describing him as [...] "evil incarnate".|$|E
500|$|... "Heart" [...] {{received}} {{a wide range}} of opinion from reviewers, though the balance was clearly on the positive side. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, wrote that it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called it [...] "a standout episode of the season". Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are." [...] He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as [...] "goofy sitcom characters", unlike Burt or Carole.|$|E

2500|$|Prescott {{explained}} Swope's {{methods in}} a 1997 interview: [...] "What Martin did ... was tape {{something that was}} going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict exactly how it would sound, and that <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there." [...] Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's [...] "That's When I Reach For My Revolver"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's [...] "Red"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: [...] "A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments." [...] Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.|$|E
