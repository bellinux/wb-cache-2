500|$|Tarwater {{entered the}} June 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials {{with a new}} perspective: [...] "I want to swim as fast as I can, be the best man I can be, and let the chips <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> may", he said. [...] "If I make the team ... that would be unbelievable. If I don’t make this team, I plan to still be a champion." [...] He entered the {{competition}} ranked fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, fifth in the 200-meter butterfly, and also qualified in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle. He chose to scratch the 100-meter freestyle {{to concentrate on the}} 200-meter butterfly and freestyle. [...] Tarwater made the 200-meter freestyle finals; the top six finishers qualified for the Olympic 4×200 relay team, but Tarwater finished seventh. [...] He missed making the Olympic team by fourteen one-hundredths (0.14) of a second.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Renzi {{acknowledged}} that he returned to Arizona {{with the intention of}} running for Congress, but defended his state ties. He noted that between college and his return to Arizona, he lived in Flagstaff for a total of seven years. There is proof Renzi was living in Arizona after college because, Renzi and his wife did have several children who were born in Sierra Vista, AZ. Renzi also said he owned more than [...] in northern Arizona through a real estate development and improvement business, in addition to a small vineyard and ranch in Sonoita, Arizona, west of Sierra Vista, in the 8th congressional district, and a home in Kingman.

6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] {{replied the}} Scarecrow; so they soon renewed their journey, {{following}} {{the river for}} a long time until the roar of the waterfall sounded in their ears. By and by they came to the waterfall itself, a sheet of silver dropping far, far down into a tiny lake which seemed to have no outlet. From the top of the <b>fall,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> stood, the banks gradually sloped away, so that the descent by land was quite easy, while the river could do nothing but glide over an edge of rock and tumble straight down to the depths below.|$|E
60|$|It is {{well known}} that the family of the Slopes never starve: they always fall on their feet, like cats; and let them <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> will, they live on the fat of the land. Our Mr. Slope did so. On his return to town he found that the sugar-refiner had died and that his widow was inconsolable--in other words, in want of consolation. Mr. Slope consoled her, and soon found himself settled with much comfort in the house in Baker Street. He possessed himself, also, before long, of a church in the {{vicinity}} of the Red Road, and became known to fame as one of the most eloquent preachers and pious clergymen in that part of the metropolis. There let us leave him.|$|E

Upon this, the illegal couple continued further south into the terrains of the zipa until the Tequendama <b>Falls</b> <b>where</b> <b>they,</b> tired and desillusioned, after hiding in the woods, turned into two stones.|$|R
50|$|Nocturne Falls is a paranormal romance series set in {{the fictional}} tourist town of Nocturne <b>Falls,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> attract {{visitors}} by year round celebrations of Halloween. This gimmick allows its citizens, primarily supernatural creatures such as witches, vampires, and werewolves, to live semi-freely under the guise that they are only acting to entertain tourists. Each book centers around a different pairing solving various issues and {{falling in love with}} one another.|$|R
50|$|Duplexes {{built on}} a mirror plan were not unusual in the area at the time; there are some in nearby Wappingers <b>Falls,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were built mainly to house workers in the village's industries, which {{included}} {{some of the earliest}} cotton textile mills in New York. It is likely that Shay's business as a ragman took him there, where he would have seen them and decided to undertake a similar project in New Hamburg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even if {{that were}} true, their {{testimony}} would lack the convincing power that flames from Morselli's book or Bottazzi's report. The essential weakness of the spiritist's testimony {{lies in the fact}} that for the most part he assumes that the facts of mediumship are somehow, and necessarily, in opposition to somebody's religion. He finds it sustained (or opposed) by the Bible, or he fancies it mixed with deviltry or the black art. He trembles for fear it will affect the scheme of redemption or assist some theosophical system. Whereas, a man like Bottazzi is engaged merely with the facts; he lets the inferences <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> may. He is not concerned with whether Eusapia's manifestations oppose Christian theology or not; he wants the phenomena. He is alert to note their effect on biologic science, but he does not shrink from any report of them. So far as I am concerned, my lot is cast with these men who put the clamps on the fact and wait for larger knowledge before constructing a system of religion on the half-discovered." ...|$|E
60|$|Complete silence {{would have}} reigned {{but for the}} mellow sound of the distant fall and the sweet, plaintive cries of innumerable wildfowl that flew hither and thither, or revelled in the {{security}} of their sedgy homes. Flocks of wild geese passed in constant succession overhead, {{in the form of}} acute angles, giving a few trumpet notes now and then, as if to advertise their passage to the far north to the dwellers in the world below. Bustling teal rose in groups of dozens or half-dozens as the red canoe broke upon their astonished gaze, and sent them, with whistling wings, up or down the river. A solitary northern diver put up his long neck here and there to gaze for an instant inquisitively, and then sank, as if for ever, into the calm water, to reappear long after in some totally new and unexpected quarter. A napping duck or two, being wellnigh run over by the canoe, took wing with a tremendous splutter and a perfectly idiotical compound of a quack and a roar, while numerous flocks of plover, which had evidently meant to lie still among the sedges and hide while the canoe passed, sprang into the air at the unwonted hullabaloo, and made off, with diverse shriek and whistle, as fast as their wings could carry them. Besides these noisy denizens of the wilderness, there were seen, in various places, cranes, and crows, and magpies, and black terns, and turkey-buzzards, all of which were more or less garrulous in expressing surprise at the unexpected appearance of the trappers in their wild domain. And, just as the canoe drew near to the place {{at the foot of the}} <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> meant to land and make the portage, a little cabri, or prong-horned antelope, leaped out of the woods, intending, doubtless, to drink, caught sight of the intruders, gave one short glance of unutterable amazement, and then rebounded into the bush like an electrified indiarubber ball.|$|E

50|$|Having {{graduated}} from Bowdoin College in 1931, on his 24th birthday (October 22, 1932) he married Dorothy Florence Wells of Arlington, Massachusetts. After their honeymoon {{they made their}} home in Brunswick, Maine, where Gould resumed writing for the Brunswick Record and his wife became the newspaper's household editor. A few years later, the couple purchased the Gould family farm in Lisbon <b>Falls,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> would make their home for over thirty years.|$|R
50|$|In 1827, {{he married}} Hannah Green. They {{were married in}} Glens <b>Falls</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> {{remained}} for a few years. Caswell and his family afterwards made several changes {{in the next few}} years like many of the early settlers. They even went to Mississippi and were employed on the river boats. In 1842, Caswell and his family moved to Barrington Station, Lake County, Illinois. Here he bought a farm where he lived for three years.|$|R
50|$|Work on the {{temporary}} power plant was started on October 4, 1928. Its operation began on March 20, 1929, and continued without interruption until No. 1 Unit at Island Falls {{took up the}} load on June 5, 1930. Subsequently, the Spruce Falls plant was dismantled, and, under very difficult freighting conditions due to snow and weak ice, the two small generating units were brought to Island <b>Falls,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were permanently installed in 1933.|$|R
50|$|Halflings: Halflings {{are short}} creatures with small ivory horns {{that began to}} appear after the <b>fall.</b> <b>Where</b> <b>they</b> came from is unsure, but it is {{possible}} that they are the result of careless shielding by dark wizards in the Fall of Kontovar.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1954 by V.L. Smithers in Kent, Ohio after he {{developed}} a water absorbent foam to use in floral arrangements. Since then, other products have been developed including floral accessories, cellular growing media, and post-harvest plant products.

60|$|Captain Pouchot was now {{thoroughly}} alarmed, {{and under}} cover of darkness, sent out messengers in various directions, {{to bring up the}} soldiers, traders, and friendly Indians from Venango, Presqu'île, Detroit, and other points.

5000|$|The name 52 {{may be a}} {{reference}} to the playing card games of 52 Pickup and to the expression [...] "let the cards <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> may." [...] Other theories relate the name to a combat training game involving the use of playing cards and/or to the Supreme Mathematics of the Nation of Gods and Earths. It could even be {{a reference}}, coded, symbolic, or otherwise, to a specific cell block. However, a more likely explanation is that it simply refers to the fifty-two blocking techniques encompassed in the art.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), he {{collaborated with}} his {{colleague}} Franco Modigliani {{on the paper}} The Cost of Capital, Corporate Finance and the Theory of Investment. This paper urged a fundamental objection to the traditional view of corporate finance, according to which a corporation can reduce its cost of capital by finding the right debt-to-equity ratio. According to the Modigliani-Miller theorem, on the other hand, {{there is no right}} ratio, so corporate managers should seek to minimize tax liability and maximize corporate net wealth, letting the debt ratio chips <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> will.|$|E
5000|$|A dark surface under {{a bright}} light can reflect {{the same amount of}} light as a light surface under dim light. The human eye would {{perceive}} the two as being very different but a light meter would measure only the amount of light reflected, and its recommended exposure would render either as Zone V. The Zone System provides a straightforward method for rendering these objects as the photographer desires. The key element in the scene is identified, and that element is placed on the desired zone; the other elements in the scene then <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> may.

5000|$|The trio {{eventually}} {{make it to}} Hokani <b>Falls,</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> {{burn the}} amulet. Without it, Nita can no longer communicate with Kenai or Koda, so she says goodbye. Seeing how depressed Kenai is and realizing that he loves Nita, Koda secretly asks his mother in the Spirit land to turn Kenai back into a human so he can be happy. The next morning, Rutt and Tuke (whom Kenai, Koda, and Nita ran into multiple times throughout their journey, and whom Nita helped woo a pair of female Canadian moose) inform Kenai that Koda went to the village to retrieve Nita. Knowing that Koda could be killed, Kenai follows after him.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of color}} shifts, color film usually does {{not lend itself}} to {{variations}} in development time. Use of the Zone System with color film {{is similar to that}} with black-and-white roll film, except that the exposure range is somewhat less, so that there are fewer zones between black and white. The exposure scale of color reversal film is less than that of color negative film, and the procedure for exposure usually is different, favoring highlights rather than shadows; the shadow values then <b>fall</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> will. Whatever the exposure range, the meter indication results in a Zone V placement. Adams (1981, 95 - 97) described the application to color film, both negative and reversal.|$|E

US intelligence seemed to have been unaware of the BDJ blacklist and tried, too late, to denounce it and avoid Soviet propaganda. The Communists, however, termed it a proof of US-Nazi conspiracy.|$|E
