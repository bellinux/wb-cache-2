25|$|Sectional <b>electric</b> <b>drives</b> were {{developed}} using control theory. Sectional <b>electric</b> <b>drives</b> are used on different sections {{of a machine}} where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections. In steel rolling, the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers, which must run at successively faster speeds. In paper making the paper sheet shrinks as it passes around steam heated drying arranged in groups, which must run at successively slower speeds. The first application of a sectional electric drive was on a paper machine in 1919. One {{of the most important}} developments in the steel industry during the 20th century was continuous wide strip rolling, developed by Armco in 1928.|$|E

40|$|From the EMC {{point of}} view, the {{integration}} of <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> systems into today's cars represents a substantial challenge. The <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> system is a new component consisting of a highvoltage power source, a frequency converter, an electric motor and shielded or unshielded high-power cables. Treating this new <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> system or its components as a conventional automotive component in terms of EMI test procedures and emission limits would lead to substantial incompatibility problems. In this paper the EMC issues related to {{the integration of}} an <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> system into a conventional passenger car are investigated. The components of the drive system have been analyzed being either noise sources or part of the coupling path within the new electrical system of the car.

40|$|This Diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{utilization}} of <b>electric</b> <b>driven</b> cars in Czech Republic. There are two cardinal {{aspects of this}} research. Firstly I {{would like to give}} an answer if expansion of <b>electric</b> <b>driven</b> cars could help Czech Republic with greenhouse gas emission reduction. This goal will be achieved by quantitative analysis when four different scenarios of <b>electric</b> <b>driven</b> cars expansion will be calculated. Result of this analysis will be affected by several significant aspects. The most important aspect is structure of Czech energy mix which influences environmental friendliness of using <b>electric</b> <b>driven</b> car. Outcome of this analysis will tell us if we should support <b>electric</b> <b>driven</b> cars expansion in Czech Republic. Finally Diploma thesis proves {{that it is possible to}} use <b>electric</b> <b>driven</b> vehicles as a tool for greenhouse gas emission reduction in Czech conditions. Second important aspect related with electromobility is the financial competitiveness to combustion engine driven car. In this case the goal of analysis will be set as comparative analysis of lifecycle costs. Social external costs (as greenhouse gas emissions) will be included to the analysis as well. Result of this analysis tells us what type of power drive in passenger car is financially preferable...|$|R
