2500|$|The {{production}} F-102A had the Hughes MG-3 {{fire control}} system, later upgraded {{in service to}} the MG-10. It had a three-segment internal weapons bay under the fuselage for air-to-air missiles. Initial armament was three pairs of GAR-1/2/3/4 (Later re-designated as AIM-4) Falcon missiles, which included both infrared homing and semi-active radar homing variants. [...] The doors of the two <b>forward</b> <b>bays</b> each had tubes for 12 FFARs (for a total of 24) with initially 2in (5.1cm) being fitted and later 2.75in (70mm) replacing them. The F-102 was later upgraded to allow the carrying of up to two GAR-11/AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon missiles in the center bay. The larger size of this weapon required redesigned center bay doors with no rocket tubes.

40|$|The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) {{will perform}} a flight test known as Exploration Flight Test- 1 (EFT- 1) {{currently}} scheduled for 2014. One {{of the primary}} functions of this test is to exercise all of the important Guidance, Navigation, Control (GN&C), and Propulsion systems, along with the flight software for future flights. The Descent and Landing segment of the flight is governed by the requirements levied on the GN&C system by the Landing and Recovery System (LRS). The LRS is a complex system of parachutes and flight control modes that ensure that the Orion MPCV safely lands at its designated target in the Pacific Ocean. The Descent and Landing segment begins with the jettisoning of the <b>Forward</b> <b>Bay</b> Cover and concludes with sensing touchdown.

40|$|Parachute drag {{performance}} has been reconstructed {{for a large}} number of Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) flight tests. This allows for determining forebody wake effects indirectly through statistical means. When data are available in a "clean" wake, such as behind a slender test vehicle, the relative degradation in performance for other test vehicles can be computed as a Pressure Recovery Fraction (PRF). All four CPAS parachute types were evaluated: <b>Forward</b> <b>Bay</b> Cover Parachutes (FBCPs), Drogues, Pilots, and Mains. Many tests used the missile-shaped Parachute Compartment Drop Test Vehicle (PCDTV) to obtain data at high airspeeds. Other tests used the Orion "boilerplate" Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV) to evaluate parachute performance in a representative heatshield wake. Drag data from both vehicles are normalized to a "capsule" forebody equivalent for Orion simulations. A separate database of PCDTV-specific performance is maintained to accurately predict flight tests. Data are shared among analogous parachutes whenever possible to maximize statistical significance...|$|R
40|$|The Orion Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT- 1) mission {{successfully}} flew on Dec 5, 2014 atop a Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle.

The Orion navigation team combined all trajectory data from the mission into a Best Estimated Trajectory (BET) product. There were significant challenges in data reconstruction and many lessons were learned for future missions. The team used an estimation filter incorporating radar tracking, onboard sensors (Global Positioning System and Inertial Measurement Unit), and day-of-flight weather balloons to evaluate the true trajectory flown by Orion. Data was published for the entire Orion EFT- 1 flight, plus objects jettisoned during entry such as the <b>Forward</b> <b>Bay</b> Cover.

40|$|The Orion program's Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{project is}} {{currently}} conducting its third generation of testing, the Engineering Development Unit (EDU) series. This series utilizes two test articles, a dart-shaped Parachute Compartment Drop Test Vehicle (PCDTV) and capsule-shaped Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV), {{both of which}} include a full size, flight-like parachute system and require a pallet delivery system for aircraft extraction. To date, 15 tests have been completed, including six with PCDTVs and nine with PTVs. Two of the PTV tests included the <b>Forward</b> <b>Bay</b> Cover (FBC) provided by Lockheed Martin. Advancements in modeling techniques applicable to parachute fly-out, vehicle rate of descent, torque, and load train, also occurred during the EDU testing series.
