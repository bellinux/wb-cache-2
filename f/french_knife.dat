60|$|There {{were many}} of Namara's people among the {{servants}} now {{come out of}} the alcove, and one of them, a story-teller and poet, a last remnant of the bardic order, who had a chair and a platter in Namara's kitchen, drew a <b>French</b> <b>knife</b> out of his girdle and made as though he would strike at Costello, but in a moment a blow had hurled him to the ground, his shoulder sending the cup rolling and ringing again. The click of steel had followed quickly, had not there come a muttering and shouting from the peasants about the door and from those crowding up behind them; and all knew that these were no children of Queen's Irish or friendly Namaras and Dermotts, but of the wild Irish about Lough Gara and Lough Cara, who rowed their skin coracles, and had masses of hair over their eyes, and left the right arms of their children unchristened that they might give the stouter blows, and swore only by St. Atty and sun and moon, and worshipped beauty and strength more than St. Atty or sun and moon.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} a cook's knife or <b>French</b> <b>knife,</b> the chef's knife is an {{all-purpose}} knife that is curved to allow the cook to rock the knife on the cutting board for a more precise cut. The broad and heavy blade also serves for chopping bone instead of the cleaver making this knife the all purpose heavy knife for food preparation. Chef's knives are most commonly available between 15 cm and 30 cm (6 and 12 inches), though 20 cm (8 inches) {{is the most common}} size.|$|E
50|$|The Mercator's {{construction}} {{is similar to}} that of the <b>French</b> Douk-Douk <b>knife,</b> in terms of the simple folded-metal handle. However, the Douk-Douk is a slipjoint knife, whereas the K55K is a lockback knife and has a different blade geometry.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, western-style double-beveled edged knives {{have become}} much more popular in Japan, the best example being that of the santoku, an {{adaptation}} of the [...] (gyūtō, gyuto, gyutou), the <b>French</b> chef's <b>knife</b> and the Sujihiki which is roughly analogous to a western slicing or carving knife. While these knives are usually sharpened symmetrically on both sides, their blades are still given Japanese-style acute-angle cutting edges of 8-10 degrees per side with a very hard temper to increase cutting ability.|$|R
50|$|In the Victorian era, knife rests {{were created}} {{in a wide variety}} of materials, designs, and configurations. Materials used {{included}} gold, silver, mother of pearl, and ivory. The <b>French</b> also created <b>knife</b> rests, known as porte-couteaux. Russians, Germans, and other Europeans developed knife rests around this time. The Chinese created chopstick rests in the same manner.|$|R

Any student who has ever had her in class will probably never forget the magic-like skill she has in the art of food preparation.

50|$|Today {{the butcher}} knife is used {{throughout}} {{the world in the}} meat processing trade. The heftier blade works well for splitting, stripping and cutting meat. The <b>French</b> chef's <b>knife</b> is a derivation of the butcher knife, and is used as a general utility knife. Other similar meat-cutting knives include the carving knife and the cleaver. The carving knife usually is designed for slicing thin cuts of meat and often has a blunt or rounded point, with a scalloped or granton blade to improve separation of sliced cuts of meat. The cleaver is similar to the butcher's knife, but has a lighter and thinner blade for precision cutting.|$|R
60|$|The ice thus broken, {{conversation}} began, and Harry {{soon learned}} the <b>French</b> for <b>knife,</b> fork, spoon, plate, {{and various other}} articles, and {{felt that he was}} fairly on the way towards talking French. After the meal was over M. du Tillet rose and put on his hat, and signed to Harry to accompany him. They strolled through the town, went down to the quays and looked at the fishing-boats; Harry was feeling more at home now, and asked the French name for everything he saw, repeating the word over and over again to himself until he felt sure that he should remember it, and then asking the name of some fresh object.|$|R
50|$|Swordmakers in Toledo, Spain, {{developed}} {{a market in}} the 1920s for gold plated automatic leverlock knives with pearl handles and enamel inlaid blades. Italian knifemakers had their own style of knives including both pushbutton and leverlock styles, some bearing design characteristics similar to the early <b>French</b> Châtellerault <b>knife.</b> Prior to World War II, hand crafted automatic knives marked Campobasso or Frosolone were often called Flat Guards because of the two-piece top bolster design. Some Italian switchblades incorporated a bayonet-type blade equipped with a blade lock release activated by picking a lever at the hinge end, and were known as picklocks. These were later supplanted by newer designs which incorporated the blade lock release into a tilting bolster, which released a spearpoint or bayonet-style blade.|$|R
50|$|A chef's knife {{generally}} has a blade eight inches (20 centimeters) {{in length and}} 1+1/2 in in width, although individual models range from 6 to 14 in in length. There are two common types of blade shape in western chef's <b>knives,</b> <b>French</b> and German. German-style knives are more deeply and continuously curved along the whole cutting edge; the French style has an edge that is straighter until the end and then curves up to the tip. Neither style is inherently superior; personal preference will dictate the choice.|$|R
5000|$|Caidao or {{so-called}} 'Chinese cleaver' {{is not a}} cleaver, {{and most}} manufacturers warn {{that it should not}} be used as a cleaver. It is more properly referred to as a Chinese chef's knife and is actually a general-purpose knife, analogous to the <b>French</b> chef's <b>knife</b> or the Japanese santoku. The confusion arises from the fact that Chinese chef's knives are rectangular and that some (particularly older, traditional knives made of carbon steel) have somewhat heavy blades. Also, the fact that the blade is heavier toward the tip encourages skilled Chinese chefs to use a swinging or [...] "tapping" [...] stroke as well as a [...] "pushing" [...] stroke. However, the edge has the gradual bevel of a chef's knife and will most probably be damaged if used for splitting bone. Actual cleavers in China have the same profile as chef's knives but have much thicker blades with a sharp bevel and heavier handles.|$|R
6000|$|He leaned far {{over the}} table, till his very {{breast-bone}} {{was over the}} edge, as though his eyes had been stilettos {{and he wanted to}} drive them home into my brain. It was only much later that I understood how near death I had been at that moment. But the knives on the tablecloth were the usual restaurant knives with rounded ends and about as deadly as pieces of hoop-iron. Perhaps in the very gust of his fury he remembered what a <b>French</b> restaurant <b>knife</b> is like and something sane within him made him give up the sudden project of cutting my heart out where I sat. For it could have been nothing but a sudden impulse. His settled purpose was quite other. It was not my heart that he was after. His fingers indeed were groping amongst the knife handles by the side of his plate but what captivated my attention for a moment were his red lips which were formed into an odd, sly, insinuating smile. Heard! To be sure he had heard! The chief of the great arms smuggling organization! ...|$|R
5000|$|The French {{version of}} the Mark I is stamped on the blade ricasso with a {{recumbent}} lion, and the words Au Lion, while the grip is typically stamped [...] "U.S. 1918", and fitted with a four-sided pommel cap. Made under wartime conditions, the <b>French</b> Mark I <b>knife</b> is generally more roughly finished than U.S. contracted examples, and incorporates several deviations from production specifications. Several versions of the French model exist - some with grooves {{on top of the}} grip, some without, and some bearing letters and numbers cast into the bronze fingerguard. As steel was a strategic material in wartime France, the French-manufactured Mark I was issued with a proprietary unmarked scabbard made of iron.|$|R
50|$|Because French {{industry}} was working under wartime conditions with numerous material shortages, often using subcontracted labor, even officially sanctioned <b>French</b> Army trench <b>knives</b> tend to vary significantly from knife to knife. The need for knives {{was so great}} that already-understrength French Army formations were forced to demobilize hundreds of former cutlery workers so that they could return to their former jobs and begin quantity production of trench knives for the armed forces. As the war went on, newer and more versatile blade-type trench knife patterns such as the double-edged dagger Couteau Poignard Mle 1916 dit Le Vengeur began to replace the French Nail and earlier stiletto-style trench <b>knives.</b> The <b>French</b> lead in trench knife development was closely followed by the United States, which introduced three successive trench knife models - the M1917, M1918, and Mark I (1918) - all based directly or indirectly upon previous French designs.|$|R
50|$|In the Old Swiss Confederacy, {{the term}} basler {{seems to have}} {{referred}} to the 14th- to 15th-century weapons with the characteristiccrescent-shaped pommel and crossguard, which occurred with widely variant blade length, and which by the early 16th century had split into the two discrete classes of the short Swiss dagger (Schweizerdolch) and the long Swiss degen (Schweizerdegen), indicating a semantic split between the formerly synonymous terms Dolch and Degen.The baselard proper falls out of use by the early 16th century.The term baselard and its variations persist for some time, but lose their connection with {{a specific type of}} <b>knife.</b> <b>French</b> baudelaire could now refer to a curved, single-edged hewing knife. Basilarda is the name of a sword in Orlando Furioso.Also in English, the term could now refer to a Turkish weapon like the Yatagan.A very late occurrence of the term is found in 1602, {{in the context of a}} duel fought in Scotland, in Canonbie. The document recording the agreement on the weapons used in the duel mentions two baslaerd swords with blades a yard and half quarter long.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{learn that}} things hourly assume {{a more serious}} aspect with the armies. Our troops are pushing north, in large bodies, and the French {{are said to be}} reinforcing. Living as we do, out of the direct line of march, and fully thirty miles {{in the rear of the}} old battle-grounds, I should feel no apprehension, were it not for a report I hear, that the woods are full of Indians. I very well know that such a report {{invariably}} accompanies the near approach of hostilities in the frontier settlements, and is to be received with many grains of allowance; but it seems so probable the French should push their savages on this flank of our army, to annoy it on the advance, that, I confess, the rumour has some influence on my feelings. We have been fortifying still more; and I would advise you not to neglect such a precaution altogether. The Canadian Indians are said to be more subtle than our own; nor is government altogether without the apprehension that our own have been tampered with. It was said at Albany, that much French silver had been seen in the hands of the people of the Six Nations; and that even <b>French</b> blankets, <b>knives,</b> and tomahawks, were more plentiful among them than might be accounted for by the ordinary plunder of their warfare. One of your runners, the man who is called the Trackless, is said to live out of his own tribe; and such Indians are always to be suspected. Their absence is sometimes owing to reasons that are creditable; but far oftener to those that are not. It may be well to have an eye on the conduct of this man. After all, we are in the hands of a beneficent and gracious God, and we know how often his mercy has saved us, on occasions more trying than this!" ...|$|R
