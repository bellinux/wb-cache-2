40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} combined computational and experimental study {{to understand the}} fundamental electrostatic, thermal, electromagnetic, and discharge related processes during the ageing of metallised polymer film capacitors. In the event of <b>internal</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> these capacitors are capable of 'self-healing' through a controlled isolation of defects on the electrode surfaces by mosaic patterning the electrode. The objective of this project is to develop viable computer models to unravel electrothermally activated ageing processes in capacitors. To provide the necessary validation to any capacitor models developed, our work is supported by comprehensive experiments including industrial standard accelerated life tests and associated breakdown damage analyses of tested capacitors. These have enabled an empirical identification of main factors affecting the reliability and lifetime of capacitors. Relevant raw data and the qualitative picture enabled by these data are crucial to the development and refinement of viable computational models of capacitors. Given the complexity of ageing processes, it is both very difficult and unnecessary to develop a one-for-all model that describes indiscriminately all relevant processes. The approach adapted in this work has been to prioritise key ageing processes and modularise each process with its own computer model. The overall picture of capacitor ageing can then be unravelled by integrating all modules together. For instance, the fine geometrical features of the electrode mosaic pattern and the capacitor's laminated structure have been assessed through a concept of field intensification using a 2 D electrostatic finite element computation. With fine geometrical features {{accounted for by the}} field intensification concept, fast electric events in capacitors can be simulated using a simple equivalent circuit model. Similar assessment of heat transfer has led to an equally efficient modelling of thermal events in capacit...|$|R

Three out of four apples corresponding to the sample maintained under controlled atmosphere did not developed mealiness while three out of four fruits corresponding to the sample stored at 2 °C became mealy after 6 months of storage. The minimum T 2 values obtained for the mealy apples show to be significantly lower (F = 13. 21) when compared with non-mealy apples pointing that a more desegregated structure and a lower juiciness content leads to lower T 2 signal.

Elevated temperature is a key aging factor for metallized polymer film capacitors with the capacitor life expectancy halved with every 8 °C of temperature rise. For film capacitors in service, both application of a time-varying external voltage and the extinction of <b>internal</b> <b>breakdown</b> events can deposit significant heat onto the capacitor structure leading to an undesirable temperature rise. Often such heat generation is localized spatially and the resulting temperature gradient enhances the probability of subsequent breakdowns. To facilitate a thorough and generic understanding, a thermal model of metallized film capacitors is developed to simulate the dynamics of heat generation and transfer under the switching impact of an external voltage. Thermal processes in solids (polymer layers, electrode coating, and zinc-spray segment) are modeled with conduction mechanism, whereas convection mechanism is considered for silicone oil and air. Heat generation is induced either by ohmic losses of the externally applied electric field, or by <b>internal</b> <b>breakdown</b> events within the metallized film capacitor structure. This allows a seamless interface between the heat transfer model and the equivalent circuit based field calculation model. Based this electrothermal model, numerical examples are used to study temperature distribution within film capacitors and then to examine the likelihood of localized temperature hot-spots that may lead to spatially preferential breakdowns...|$|E

The inactive nodes cannot take part in routing/relaying and thus may affect the connectivity. A wireless ad hoc network containing inactive nodes is then said to be connected if each inactive node is adjacent {{to at least one}} active node and all active nodes form a connected network. This paper is the first installment of our probabilistic study of the connectivity of wireless ad hoc networks containing inactive nodes. We assume that the wireless ad hoc network consists of n nodes which are distributed independently and uniformly in a unit-area disk and are active (or available) independently with probability p for some constant 0 <p ≤ 1. We show that if all nodes have a maximum transmission radius rn = ln n+c πpn for some constant c, then the total number of isolated nodes is asymptotically Poisson with mean e −c and the total number of isolated active nodes is also asymptotically Poisson with mean pe −c.

40|$|Internal {{browning}} in pears (Pyrus communis L. cv. Blanquilla) {{has been}} studied by NMR and MRI {{in order to develop}} a non-destructive procedure for on-line disorder identification. For NMR relaxometry, disordered tissue shows higher transverse relaxation rates compared to sound tissue, especially at higher magnetic field strength and for long pulse spacing. Membrane alteration and therefore tissue disintegration, as well as water evaporation, appear to be the main causes of this response. Correlation between relaxation times and diffusion showed that the proton pools in disordered tissue are grouped into a smaller number of populations compared to sound tissue, also highlighting cell decompartmentation in disordered tissue. At a macroscopic level, fast low angle shot MR images, effective transverse relaxation-weighted (TR 11 ms and TE 3. 7 ms) and proton density-weighted (TR 7. 6 ms and TE 2. 5 ms), were acquired for pears at a rate of 54 mm/s. Images have been discriminated for <b>internal</b> <b>breakdown</b> according to histogram characteristics. Up to 94 and 96 % of pears, respectively, were correctly classified in the former and the latter type of images. In this study a minimum value of 12 % of tissue affected by breakdown was always clearly identifie...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} results are summarized that were {{obtained in the}} development of a Teflon solid propellant pulsed plasma thruster. The feasibility was established of storing and feeding solid propellant in the form of an open circular loop into an operational thruster. This technique was verified to be practical by feeding over 20 inches of Teflon into a micro-thruster over an accumulated life test of 1858 hours. High energy density capacitors were evaluated under vacuum conditions when the capacitor is coupled directly to a plasma thruster. Numerous early capacitor failures were encountered. It was concluded that essentially all of the failures encountered in a vacuum environment are due to an <b>internal</b> electrical <b>breakdown</b> that will occur inside a capacitor that is not truly hermetically sealed. A steady input power significantly in excess of 130 watts can safely be tolerated if heat conduction can be provided to a sink whose temperature is about 16 C. A vacuum life test of the capacitor bank was carried out while discharging into a milli-lb. (milli-Newton) type pulsed plasma thruster. More than 1500 hours of vacuum testing of this milli-Newton type system has been accumulated without any capacitor problems. Recommendations are made for future capacitor designs...|$|R
40|$|An ESA {{study has}} {{resulted}} {{in the development of a}} new software tool, called DICTAT, to model internal dielectric charging in the outer radiation belt. Analytical equations are used to describe current deposition in simple structures consisting of a single dielectric plus an optional shield. A variety of grounding scenarios are permitted. The analytical approach is fast and gives charging currents to sufficient accuracy given the uncertainties in other aspects of the problem- particularly conductivity characteristics. The variation of these characteristics with temperature, electric field and dose-rate are all modelled by the code. A worst-case model of electron fluxes in the outer belt has been created specifically for the internal charging problem and is built into the code. The tool gives a YES or NO decision on the susceptibility of the structure to <b>internal</b> electrostatic <b>breakdown</b> and if necessary, calculates the required changes to the dielectric and shield thickness that would bring the structure below the breakdown threshold. A complementary programme of laboratory irradiations has been carried out to validate the tool. The results for Epoxy samples show that the code models electric field realistically for a wide variety of shields, dielectric thicknesses and electron spectra. Results for Teflon samples indicate that some further experimentation is required and the radiation-induced conductivity aspects of the code have not been validated. 1...|$|R
40|$|I {{apply the}} Beveridge-Nelson {{business}} cycle decomposition method {{to the time}} series of per capita murder in the State of California. (1933 - 2005). Separating out “permanent” from “cyclical” murder, I hypothesize that the cyclical part coincides with documented waves of organized crime, <b>internal</b> tensions, <b>breakdowns</b> in social order as riots, crime legislation, social, and political unrest, and recently with the periodic terrorist attacks to the U. S. The estimated cyclical component of murder, or attacks index found is optimal, and warns that terrorist attacks against the U. S., and riots in California have created estimated turning point dates marked by those tragic events. The index peaked {{to point out the}} World Trade Center Bombing in 1993, and 9 / 11 2001, and for California it amazingly well captured the riots of 1965 and 1992. This paper belongs to the series of papers helping the U. S, and Homeland Security identify the closeness of terrorist attacks through the construction of Attacks indexes across the U. S. Other indexes constructed include the Index for the U. S. [URL] New York State [URL] New York City [URL] Arizona State [URL] Massachusetts State [URL] These indexes must be used as dependent variables in structural models for terrorist attacks, and in models assessing the effects of terrorism over the U. S. economy. ...|$|R
