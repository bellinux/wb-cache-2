40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the significance of performing patient specification quality assurance for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme treated with <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiation therapy. The study evaluated ten <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiation therapy treatment plans using 10 MV beams, a total dose of 60 Gy (2 Gy/fraction, five fractions a week for a total of six weeks treatment). For the quality assurance protocol we used a two-dimensional ionization-chamber array (2 D-ARRAY). The results showed a very good agreement between the measured dose and the pretreatment planned dose. All the plans passed &# 62; 95 % gamma criterion with pixels within 5 % dose difference and 3 mm distance to agreement.

5000|$|Tomotherapy or helical tomotherapy (HT) {{is a type}} of {{radiation}} therapy in which the radiation is delivered slice-by-slice (hence the use of the Greek prefix , which means [...] "slice"). HT is a form of computed tomography (CT) guided <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiation therapy (IMRT). HT machines are purpose built for IMRT and differ from IMRT delivered by conventional medical linear accelerators (LINACs) in a number of ways. The main difference is that in HT a narrow <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> pencil beam is delivered from a rotating gantry while the patient is simultaneously moved through the bore, compared to the much wider <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> beam and static patient in conventional IMRT. HT units are therefore better able to target treatment sites throughout the body without a pause for the patient to be moved and set-up differently.|$|R

40|$|<b>Intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> {{radiotherapy}} {{is increasingly}} used in non-small-cell lung cancers despite {{a low level}} of evidence. A literature review was conducted. Several critical physical and dosimetric uncertainties are however unsolved. Methods to circumvent these limitations are being developed. In several retrospective studies, survival rates were at least similar with intensity-modulated radiotherapy as those reported with three-dimensional irradiation. To date, <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiotherapy might be authorized in complex anatomical situations such as tumours close to the spinal cord (such as Pancoast Tobias, paraspinal and paracardiac tumours) or with limited motion amplitudes. Dosimetric benefits should also account for 4 D dose distribution issues. The reduction of intermediate and high doses in the organs at risk with <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiotherapy is advantageous. However, the effect of low doses in large volumes (lung, bone, unspecified tissues along beam paths) and the effect of increasing integral dose are still poorly known. In conclusion, dose-volume correlations need to be better documented and prospective randomized trials should be encouraged. SCOPUS: sh. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

You should read it alongside the Macmillan Cancer Support booklet ‘Understanding Radiotherapy’. Your radiotherapy centre can give you a copy of this booklet. This information is being provided so that you can discuss with your oncologist if you would benefit from having this type of treatment. What is IMRT? <b>Intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiotherapy (IMRT) can create radiation beams of differing strengths; this is not possible with convetional radiotherapy. IMRT can also shape the radiotherapy beams more precisely. This means that different doses of radiotherapy can be given to different parts of the treatment area so the dose to nearby tissues is kept as low as possible. Why is IMRT beneficial to people? The goal of radiotherapy is to keep the dose of radiation to the normal tissues as low as possible. With IMRT, lower doses of radiotherapy can be given to healthy tissue. This means that both short-term and long-term side effects are reduced...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To use Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) {{models and}} {{comparative}} planning studies {{to explore the}} (cost-) effectiveness of swallowing sparing <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> proton radiotherapy (IMPT) compared with swallowing sparing <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiotherapy with photons (IMRT) in head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods and Materials: A Markov model was constructed to examine and compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the following strategies: (1) IMPT for all patients; (2) IMRT for all patients; and (3) IMPT if efficient. The assumption of equal survival for IMPT and IMRT in the base case analysis was relaxed in a sensitivity analysis. Results: <b>Intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> proton radiation therapy and IMRT for all patients yielded 6. 620 and 6. 520 QALYs and cost (sic) 50, 989 and (sic) 41, 038, respectively. <b>Intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> proton radiation therapy if efficient yielded 6. 563 QALYs and cost (sic) 43, 650. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IMPT if efficient versus IMRT for all patients was (sic) 60, 278 per QALY gained. In the sensitivity analysis, IMRT was more effective (0. 967 QALYs) and less expensive ((sic) 8218) and thus dominated IMPT for all patients. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on normal tissue complication probability models and planning studies proved feasible and informative and enables the analysis of individualized strategies. The increased effectiveness of IMPT {{does not seem to}} outweigh the higher costs for all head-and-neck cancer patients. However, when assuming equal survival among both modalities, there seems to be value in identifying those patients for whom IMPT is cost-effective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} optoacoustic tomographic imaging using <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> light {{sources and}} collecting amplitude and phase {{information in the}} frequency domain.

40|$|Nowadays {{more and}} more {{radiotherapy}} departments use <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> beams for treatment of patients. <b>Intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiotherapy (ImRT) is able to modificate intensity of radiation across the iradiated field. In this way it is posible to achieve better dose conformity than in conventional radiotherapy. Implementation of ImRT allows us to escalate dose to target volume with same side effects of organs at risk as in conventional radiotherapy or to reduce normal tissue complication - decrease dose to organ at risk with the same tumour dose. This fact reguires extension of our guality system to all network of delivery dose to patients, inclusive linear accelerator with multileaf collimator, treatment planning system, electronic portal imaging device and so on. Quality assurance is guaranteed both periodical user tests and independent verification of The State Office for Nuclear Safety.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: New {{radiotherapy}} {{techniques are}} under development to improve tumor control and {{to decrease the}} long-term side effects of breast cancer. These include accelerated partial breast irradiation, <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> and image guided radiotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Follow-up data of multicatheter brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation and intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy confirm excellent 5 -year local control rates in well selected patients. Early side effects seem to be improved, but recent data show increasing skin toxicity in multicatheter and intracavitary balloon brachytherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy, proton beam partial breast irradiation, <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> and image guided radiotherapy improve dose homogeneity and decrease normal tissue complication probability. For breast-only treatment, two tangential fields with different segments provide an attractive and feasible alternative to the conventional technique. The proposed <b>intensity</b> <b>modulated</b> radiotherapy techniques for comprehensive locoregional radiotherapy, however, result in increased doses to the contralateral lung and breast. SUMMARY: Input from long-term clinical data on new radiotherapy techniques is needed. Consensus on target volume contouring and dose volume constraints for nontarget tissue {{has not yet been}} reached. Further research on skin toxicity with multicatheter or intracavitary brachytherapy is needed to improve the results. status: publishe...|$|R
