5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} <b>fisheries,</b> though small <b>fisheries</b> for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where <b>fisheries</b> target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by <b>fisheries,</b> they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E

5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea <b>fisheries</b> are {{increasingly}} being targeted for exploitation. Because deep sea fish are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea <b>fisheries</b> are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal <b>fisheries</b> have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by <b>fisheries</b> in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted <b>fisheries</b> have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A <b>fisheries</b> study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted <b>fisheries</b> for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E

5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline <b>fisheries</b> operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch <b>fisheries.</b> Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian <b>fisheries</b> was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005. The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for <b>fisheries</b> off southern Africa; {{in the remainder of}} its range, little information is available on fishery impact.|$|E
5|$|The main {{tension between}} <b>fisheries</b> {{science and the}} fishing {{industry}} {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of <b>fisheries</b> to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it. On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E

40|$|The <b>fishery</b> {{education}} {{of high school}} in Japan made the successor promotion for <b>fishery</b> an important purpose at the Showa era. The present study tries to clarify that meaning of "Successor". In postwar, the middle industrial school education changed {{to the high school}} education. The <b>fishery</b> {{education of}} high school also restarted. This education introduced the large scale training vessel and valued the oversea <b>fishery</b> education, because the <b>fishery</b> in Japan has developed from the coast to open sea. And, as the work force of coastal fishing was excessive, the reduction of that work force became an agent policy which started controlling coastal fishing at the high economic growth period. At that period, "Diversification" was proposed to the industrial education of high school as an educational policy. According to those policies, <b>Fishery</b> Management Department, that was made to bear the successor promotion concerning coastal fishing, was set up in the <b>fishery</b> education of high school. And then, <b>Fishery</b> Department that has used the large scale training vessel was able to concentrate on the oversea <b>fishery</b> education. However, <b>Fishery</b> Management Department began to disappear from the <b>fishery</b> education at once.
