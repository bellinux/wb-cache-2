5|$|Collectively, {{this body}} of {{research}} established the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA. This dogma has since {{been shown to have}} exceptions, such as reverse transcription in retroviruses. The modern study of <b>genetics</b> at the level of DNA is known as molecular <b>genetics.</b>|$|E

5|$|Irving Isadore Gottesman (December 29, 1930 – June 29, 2016) was an American {{professor}} of psychology who devoted {{most of his career}} {{to the study of the}} <b>genetics</b> of schizophrenia. He wrote 17 books and more than 290 other publications, mostly on schizophrenia and behavioral <b>genetics,</b> and created the first academic program on behavioral <b>genetics</b> in the United States. He won awards such as the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award from the American Psychiatric Association for psychiatric research. Lastly, Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota, where he received his Ph.D.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, <b>genetics,</b> and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in <b>genetics,</b> genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular <b>genetics.</b> After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect <b>genetics</b> to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. <b>Genetics</b> experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. <b>Genetics</b> {{may contribute to the}} risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between <b>genetics</b> and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|The section {{summarizes}} {{the concepts of}} population <b>genetics,</b> a branch of evolutionary theory combining Mendelian <b>genetics</b> and natural selection in mathematical form to explain the pressures on animal societies. In particular, altruism, self-sacrificing behaviour, would die out unless something such as kin or group selection maintains it.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of <b>genetics</b> and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of <b>genetics</b> and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric <b>genetics.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural <b>Genetics</b> (later renamed Axis <b>Genetics)</b> and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{earned her}} PhD in 1969 at the University of California, Davis, {{completing}} her thesis on the <b>genetics</b> of plants {{under the supervision}} of G. Ledyard Stebbins. She joined the faculty of Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1968, then was hired by UC Davis in 1973, and {{at the time of her}} death in 2000 was an adjunct professor and executive associate director of the Veterinary <b>Genetics</b> Laboratory (VGL) at UC Davis.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{molecular}} <b>genetics</b> {{suggested the}} concept that one gene makes one protein. This concept (originally called the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis) emerged from an influential 1941 paper by George Beadle and Edward Tatum on experiments with mutants of the fungus Neurospora crassa. Norman Horowitz, an early colleague on the Neurospora research, reminisced in 2004 that “these experiments founded the science of what Beadle and Tatum called biochemical <b>genetics.</b> In actuality they {{proved to be the}} opening gun in what became molecular <b>genetics</b> and all the developments that have followed from that.” The one gene-one protein concept has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.|$|E

5|$|Genes, Brain and Behavior (also {{known as}} G2B) is a peer-reviewed online-only {{scientific}} journal covering {{research in the}} fields of behavioral, neural, and psychiatric <b>genetics.</b> It is published by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the International Behavioural and Neural <b>Genetics</b> Society. The journal was established in 2002 as a quarterly and is currently published monthly. G2B is a hybrid open access journal, but two years after publication all content is available for free online.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genetics</b> {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that <b>genetics</b> are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman first {{studied the}} <b>genetics</b> of {{schizophrenia}} {{on a large}} scale using the Maudsley–Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric <b>genetics</b> and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion and aggressive tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart.|$|E
5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new <b>genetics</b> with evolution; {{building}} on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population <b>genetics,</b> with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian <b>genetics,</b> producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} <b>Genetics</b> and the Origin of Species (1937), Theodosius Dobzhansky {{established}} {{the idea that}} mutation, once seen as a rival to selection, actually supplied the raw material for natural selection by creating genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the century the ideas of {{population}} <b>genetics</b> began to be applied in the new discipline of the <b>genetics</b> of behavior, sociobiology, and, especially in humans, evolutionary psychology. In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an evolutionary perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of adaptationism and contingency in evolutionary theory.|$|E
5|$|Methods to {{diagnose}} {{the likelihood of}} a patient with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 getting cancer were covered by patents owned or controlled by Myriad <b>Genetics.</b> Myriad's business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad <b>Genetics</b> lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of <b>genetics.</b> The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical <b>genetics</b> formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular <b>genetics</b> has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E

5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population <b>genetics.</b> This integrated natural selection with Mendelian <b>genetics,</b> which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
