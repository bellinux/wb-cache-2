5|$|In 1920 keen {{supporters}} of the Port Adelaide Football Club, headed by Mr. Swain, collectively raised £77.13.8 and bought Harold a Rover 3.5hp motor-cycle so he could make his commute of over 200km to and from Berri where he eventually settled on his own property as a <b>fruit</b> <b>grower</b> during the 1920 season.|$|E
25|$|Freight {{carriage}} in the North {{tended to}} suffer from thin settlement and heavy competition from New Zealand's coastal shipping. In one 1910 example, a <b>fruit</b> <b>grower</b> found it cheaper to ship canned fruit to Auckland by boat via Christchurch, rather than pay rail rates.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, coastal {{shipping}} {{has long}} {{played a significant}} role in New Zealand. It was very efficient for moving large amounts of goods, and relatively quick. In 1910, it was noted in a discussion with the Minister of Railways that a <b>fruit</b> <b>grower</b> at Port Albert (near Wellsford, less than 150km from Auckland) had found it cheaper to ship his canned fruit to Lyttleton in the South Island by boat, and thence back to Auckland again, rather than pay rail freight rates from nearby Wellsford to Auckland.|$|E

25|$|Frederic F. Heath {{was born}} September 6, 1864 to a Republican family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a young man, Heath worked {{variously}} as a teacher, a printer, a wood engraver, and an artist for wood engravers, the latter trades rendered largely obsolete by {{the invention of}} the linotype machine and the half-tone printing process. He moved to Chicago in 1886, moving to Florida in 1887 to publish a magazine called the Florida <b>Fruit</b> <b>Grower.</b> In 1888 he returned to his native Milwaukee, where he drew portraits and wrote editorials for the Milwaukee Daily Sentinel.|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of World War II, Józef Ulma (born in 1900) was a {{prominent}} citizen {{in the village of}} Markowa: a librarian, a photographer, active in social life and the local Catholic Youth Association. He was an educated <b>fruit</b> <b>grower</b> and a bee-keeper. His wife Wiktoria (born Wiktoria Niemczak in 1912), was a homemaker. The Ulmas had six children: Stanisława, age 8, Barbara, age 7, Władysław, age 6, Franciszek, age 4, Antoni, age 3 and Maria, age 2. Another child was due to be born just days after the family's summary execution on 24 March 1944.|$|E
60|$|I was {{surprised}} to hear that on the large plantations the men employed were not allowed to use shot, the aim of the <b>fruit</b> <b>grower</b> being only to scare the birds away.

50|$|Thomson and John Riley, a Lockheed {{engineer}} from Santa Clara, California, {{and fellow}} fruit enthusiast, began {{working together to}} publish a newsletter beginning in 1960.

Today the California Rare <b>Fruit</b> <b>Growers</b> publishes a glossy, bimonthly magazine, The Fruit Gardener, an outgrowth of the early, mimeographed newsletters. The California Rare <b>Fruit</b> <b>Growers</b> Association currently has over 3,000 members in approximately 35 countries worldwide.

40|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{financial}} results of the fruit industry in the last decade, the changing trade structures and more consumer-driven fruit chains, Dutch <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> change their market behaviour. In these circumstances, the fruit industry itself and the applied fruit research are also changing. Applied Plant Research (PPO-Fruit) is involved in different projects related to consumer-driven fruit chain development and their side effects on <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> and firms. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe two projects about new Dutch fruit chains in which PPO-Fruit is involved and their impact on <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> and research. The projects are: a special variety chain, based on the Dutch apple variety Santana, which is scab resistant (Vf) and a regional crop chain ¿Betuwe framboos¿, (= Betuwe raspberry). It is clear that being part of a fruit chain means another way of working for the <b>fruit</b> <b>growers</b> and the other partners as well. They have to work according growing recipes and also recipes/procedures for other activities, like storage, packaging. This means a decrease of independence for the growers. PPO-Fruit works as a facilitator, a knowledge centre and executes experiments to solve new problem...|$|R
