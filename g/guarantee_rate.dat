30|$|The network {{capacity}} shrinks to 1, 378.15 Mbps when another cell is reduced, i.e. 11 cells, which {{is lower than}} the guaranteed data rate. The violation is inevitable for the cell layout with less than 12 cells. In these situations, the main objective function becomes infeasible and VRRM switches to the objective function with violation, presented in (21). While no capacity is allocated to VNO BE, the other two VNOs share the violation between them. Since the model tries to minimise the weighted average violation, {{it can be seen that}} VNO GE always receive a relatively larger portion of the {{network capacity}}, since it has a higher <b>guarantee</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} optimal sub-carrier allocation in OFDMA. We show, via a counter example, that water-filling based subcarrier allocation policies, contrary to conventional wisdom, fail to provide rate-stability for an otherwise stabilizable OFDMA system. Water-filling is too myopic when considering long-time average performance, e. g. delay, queue lengths, and even long-run throughput. This is because such policies ignore variable state (queue length) information, while, in fact, such an information is necessary to <b>guarantee</b> <b>rate</b> stability and/or to minimize average delay. In this paper, we identify an optimal non-idling policy which balances the queue lengths, when the channel follows an ON/OFF model. In such case, we show that such a policy achieves the minimum average holding cost (mean response time) at any time. I...|$|E

It is a population-based, direct search algorithm, and has been successfully applied in various fields. Optimal allocation of water resources {{is an important part}} of the planning of water resources. Traditional planning methods prove insufficient for the multi-objective system of water resources. In this paper, multi-objective differential evolution(MODE) algorithm applied to the regional water resources optimal allocation, through definition of economic, social, Eco-environmental three objective function and the constraints, the regional water resources optimal allocation model has been established, and then multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to solve the model.

Authorized capital is an abstract number and it expresses the financial value of assets invested in the stock capital by its partners. The Commercial Code shall expressly stipulate the duty of authorized capital formation for the limited liability company as well as joint- stock company. The duty to form authorized capital at their formation may be indirectly permitted also for limited partnerships. In professional literature, the three basic functions of authorized capital are traditionally listed. Guarantee function, authorized capital as profit and loss measure and authorized capital {{as a mean to}} specify partner's share in the company. The concept of real authorized capital formation adopted by most European legal systems is based on achieving correspondence between the authorized capital and real capital and capital preservation through protective rules.

40|$|While {{existing}} {{research shows that}} feedback-based congestion control mechanisms are capable of provid-ing better video quality and higher link utilization for rate-adaptive packet video, there has been relatively little study on how to share network bandwidth among competing rate-adaptive video connections, when feedback control is used in a fully distributed network. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a framework of network bandwidth sharing for transporting rate-adaptive packet video using feedback. We show how a weight-based bandwidth sharing policy {{can be used to}} allocate network bandwidth among com-peting video connections and design a feedback control algorithm using an available bit rate (ABR) -like ow control mechanism. A novel video source rate adaptation algorithm is also introduced to decouple a video source's actual transmission rate from the rate used for distributed protocol convergence. Our feedback control algorithm provides guaranteed convergence and smooth source rate adaptation to our weight-based bandwidth sharing policy under any network conguration and any set of link distances. Finally, we show the on-line minimum rate renegotiation and weight adjustment options in our feedback control algorithm, which oer further exibility in network bandwidth sharing for video connections.

Firstly, pseudo excitation method and Mazar damage model were used to analyze how to calculate damage expected value excited by random seismic loading and deterministic static load {{on the condition that}} initial elastic modulus was deterministic. Moreover, response surface method was improved from the aspects of the regression of sample points, the selection of experimental points, the determined method of weight matrix and the calculation method of checking point respectively. Then, the above method was used to analyze <b>guarantee</b> <b>rate</b> of damage expected value excited by random seismic loading and deterministic static load on the condition that initial elastic modulus was random. Finally, a test example was given to verify and analyze the convergence and stability of this method. Compared with other conventional algorithm, this method has some strong points: this algorithm has good convergence and stability and greatly enhances calculation efficiency and the storage efficiency. From what has been analyzed, we find that damage expected value is insensitive to the randomness of initial elastic modulus so we can neglect the randomness of initial elastic modulus in some extent when we calculate damage expected value...|$|E

40|$|The water {{resources}} {{situation in the}} water-stressed Weihe River Basin, China, is more serious now than ever before because of a decrease in {{water resources}} and socio-economic development. A "Zero increase of socio-economic water use" in recent years gives people a wrong understanding and conceals the water crisis in the basin because the socio-economic water consumption has actually increased. Water use for the hydro-ecological system has been greatly reduced by a decrease in water resources and socio-economic water consumption increase. New concepts of hierarchical water uses for every sector and water consumption control are suggested for coordinating water uses of the socio-economy and ecosystems in the water-stressed basin. The traditional water resources allocation and regulation in China usually set up a priority sequence for water use sectors. Generally speaking, domestic water use has the highest priority and a highest <b>guarantee</b> <b>rate,</b> followed by industrial water use, irrigation and lastly ecological water use. The concept of hierarchical water use for every sector is to distinguish the water use of every sector into minimum part, appropriate part, and expected extra part with different guarantee rates, and the minimum parts of all sectors should be first guaranteed. By applying a water allocation model, we compared the water allocation results of the traditional approach and the newly suggested approach. Although further study is desired, the results {{are believed to be}} of an important referential value to sustainable development in the basin...|$|E
