5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of liquid water entirely <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to basic troops, there are Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) who according to Bungie's mythology are collectives of worm-like aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular shields and razor-sharp spines.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Owen's class goes ice-skating on a river. Cornered by the bullies, Owen hits Kenny {{with a metal}} pole, {{splitting}} {{his left}} ear. At the same moment, the students spot the neighbor's body <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> the ice.|$|E
50|$|He died on 20 September 1543 and {{was buried}} in Bottesford Church, Leicestershire. His body was embalmed with spices {{purchased}} in Nottingham and a surgeon <b>encased</b> it <b>in</b> wax. A plumber then <b>encased</b> it <b>in</b> a close fitting leaden shell.|$|R

5|$|There is no perspectival {{order in}} the foreground; instead it {{comprises}} {{a series of small}} motifs wherein proportion and terrestrial logic are abandoned. Bosch presents the viewer with gigantic ducks playing with tiny humans under the cover of oversized fruit; fish walking on land while birds dwell in the water; a passionate couple <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> an amniotic fluid bubble; and a man inside of a red fruit staring at a mouse in a transparent cylinder.|$|E
5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, {{which are now}} <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 {{glaciologist}} Charles R. Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} factors have led to wide {{speculation}} {{that most of the}} 3.5million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound up in this landfill, crushed and <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> concrete. It has also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fuels speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes. Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided the popularity of the story.|$|E

50|$|As the {{wrapping}} machine {{traveled around the}} dome, 2,467 times, the wires were placed in 44 vertical rows and each row decreased from 77 wires on the innermost row to 37 wires for the outer row. Each row was separated by a 1⅛ in. wide and ⅛ in. thick steel bar. These spacers were used in order allow each wire to be fully <b>encase</b> <b>in</b> grout, thus creating a permanent bond.|$|R
40|$|The {{computerized}} system for controlling package <b>encasing</b> <b>in</b> {{the food industry}} is an integrated system of computing and control created for a total control of the encasing of the canned product.

5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{an unfortunate}} {{accident}} during the Spring of April 6, 2009, Makoto Yuki (Akira Ishida) {{arrives in the}} city late at night on a delayed train. Upon disembarking at midnight, a strange phenomenon grips the city—shutting down all forms of technology and causing humans to become <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> coffins. Unperturbed, Makoto casually {{makes his way to}} the Iwatodai Dormitory where a mysterious boy (Akira Ishida) greets him with a contract after which he meets fellow dormmates, Yukari Takeba (Megumi Toyoguchi) and Mitsuru Kirijo (Rie Tanaka), albeit the pair weary of his arrival at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Gotcha was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who they saw as focused primarily on creating Pong clones. The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> pink domes meant to represent breasts. Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing {{a woman in a}} nightdress, it was changed to use regular joysticks soon after release.|$|E

5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|Later, at FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a {{photo of}} the missing loggers, telling her that another group of loggers {{disappeared}} in the forest in 1934. The two agents head to the forest, where they meet Park Ranger Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys, head of security for the logging company. While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a large cocoon hanging from a tree.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

50|$|Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. has the Mothra {{from the}} {{original}} 1961 film send her priestesses to demand that Japan dismantle the anti-Godzilla weapon Mechagodzilla or face destruction, as she considers the cyborg to be against the natural order, having been created using {{the bones of the}} first Godzilla. When the second Godzilla lands, Mothra attempts to fight the monster alongside Mechagodzilla, but is killed in the process. Two larvae hatch on Infant Island, and reach Tokyo in order to fight Godzilla, whom they <b>encase</b> <b>in</b> a cocoon, which is then transported into the ocean by Mechagodzilla.|$|R
5|$|Scully {{meets with}} Frank Briggs, the detective who {{investigated}} Tooms' 1933 murders. Briggs {{claims that the}} body {{of one of the}} victims from that spree was never discovered. Scully and Briggs visit a chemical plant where a piece of the victim's liver was found, ultimately discovering a skeleton <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> concrete. Meanwhile, Mulder harasses Tooms at work as he stalks a would-be victim. Later that night, Mulder follows him when he tries to break into a man's house. Tooms flees without attacking anyone.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument's exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> glass to prevent vandalism, while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument's place in history, were also added.|$|E

5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates {{embedded in the}} dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth {{have been replaced by}} sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half {{and turning it}} into a fortress, but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but the next major alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans were opposed by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval double walls began to be <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> sloping ramparts.|$|E
5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was <b>encased</b> <b>in</b> the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E
