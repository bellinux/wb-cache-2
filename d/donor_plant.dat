We studied the transfer of carbon through this fungal network, from a Medicago truncatula <b>donor</b> <b>plant</b> to a receiver (1) M. truncatula plant growing under decreased light conditions and (2) M. truncatula seedling. Autotrophic plants were grown in bicompartmented Petri plates, with their root systems physically separated, but linked by the extraradical network of Glomus intraradices.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{relevance of}} allelopathy is highly debated {{due to the}} lack of phytotoxic concentrations of allelochemical in natural field conditions. Most of the putative allelochemicals are exuded at low concentrations, and subsequently undergo rapid chemical and biological degradation in soil matrices. At sub-toxic concentrations, due to hormesis effect, these compounds could possibly have a stimulatory effect on plant growth. Many of the suggested allelopathic compounds are chelants and can complex-with and mobilize metal ions in soil. These complexation reactions will detoxify the compound, but will increase the chemical-nutrient-foraging ability of the <b>donor</b> <b>plant.</b> The concentration in which these compounds are exuded matches with other similar secondary metabolites facilitating plant nutrient acquisition. Irrespective of whether the implicated PSMs facilitate <b>donor</b> <b>plant</b> in chemical nutrient-foraging or in poisoning the neighbors, the conferred advantage translates in terms of resource availability—in first case the donor enjoys uncontested nutrient uptake efficiency, where as in the latter the donor gain an uncontested access to resources. This further reaffirms the notion that resource competition and allelopathy are inextricable. Since most of the secondary metabolites could mobilize nutrients from soil, along with its phytotoxic effect, complementary self-facilitation roles of these compounds should be investigated...|$|E

Optimization of transformation is essential in order to overcome the relatively low transformation frequencies encountered with wheat.

All the plants regenerated from protoplast culture had the same PGI/ 2 phenotype as the <b>donor</b> <b>plant</b> but were hyperpolyploid. The loss of activity of individual PGI/ 2 alleles in plants derived from protoplasts was masked by gene duplication because of their hyperpolyploid nature.

40|$|Rooting of {{cuttings}} depends {{not only}} on the rooting treatment and the genotype, but also on the condition of the cuttings at the time of excision. The physiological and developmental conditions of the <b>donor</b> <b>plant</b> may be decisive. We have examined in Arabidopsis the effect of two <b>donor</b> <b>plant</b> pre-treatments, etiolation and flooding, on the capability of flower stem and hypocotyl segments to root. For etiolation, plantlets were kept in the dark, hypocotyls up to 12 days and plantlets for 12 weeks. Flooding was applied as a layer of liquid medium on top of the semi-solid medium. This procedure is also referred to as “double layer”. Both pre-treatments strongly promoted rooting and we examined possible mechanisms. Expression of strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling related genes indicated that promotion by etiolation may be related to enhanced polar auxin transport. Increased rooting after flooding may have been brought about by accumulation of ethylene in the cutting (ethylene has been reported to increase sensitivity to auxin) and by massive formation of secondary phloem (the tissue close to which adventitious roots are induced). Both pre-treatments also strongly lowered the endogenous sucrose level. As low sucrose favors the juvenile state and juvenile tissues have a higher capability to root, the low sucrose levels may also play a role...|$|E

Inoculation with D. spurca resulted in formation of a CMN between trifoliate orange and white clover, whilst the best AM colonization occurred in the donor trifoliate orange-receptor white clover association.

Eucalyptus globulus quickly loses rooting capacity of cuttings as the <b>donor</b> <b>plant</b> ages, although the molecular and biochemical mechanisms behind this process are still unclear. To better understand the bases of rooting competence loss in E. globulus, the time required for a significant decline in rhizogenic ability without exogenous auxin was determined in microcuttings derived from donor plants of different ages after sowing. Tip cuttings of donor plants were severed before and after loss of rooting competence of microcuttings to test the hypothesis that auxin and carbohydrate homeostasis regulate rooting competence decline. There were no significant changes in concentration of carbohydrates, flavonoids, or proteins before and after the loss of rooting capacity. Peroxidase (EC 1. 11. 1. 7) total activity increased with loss of rooting competence. Auxin concentration showed the opposite pattern. In good agreement, TAA 1, a key gene in auxin biosynthesis, had lower expression after loss of rooting capacity. The same applied to the auxin receptor gene TIR 1, suggesting reduced auxin sensitivity. On the other hand, genes associated with auxin response repression (TPL, IAA 12) or with the action of cytokinins, the rhizogenesis inhibitor-related ARR 1, showed higher expression in plants with lower rooting competence. Taken together, data suggest that age negatively affects E. globulus rooting by a combination of factors. Decreased endogenous auxin concentration, possibly caused by less biosynthesis, lower auxin sensitivity, higher expression of genes inhibiting auxin action, as well as of genes related to the action of cytokinins, appear to play roles in this process...|$|E

40|$|Rooting and {{sprouting}} {{traits of}} single-node leafy cuttings (SNCs) of Grewia optiva {{have been studied}} in relation to age of <b>donor</b> <b>plants</b> and auxin treatments. SNCs from 1 -, 5 -, 10 - and 15 -year- old donors and treated IBA 3000 mg L - 1 gave the best responses. Periodic sampling was performed to examine Total Soluble Sugar (TTS), Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) oxidase and peroxidase (PER) activities in the rooting zone during Adventitious Root Formation (ARF). TTS decreased with passage of time from 0 to 40 days of analysis. Auxin treatments exhibit higher TSS in all donors. IAA-oxidase and PER reduced with maturation. IAA-oxidase was highest in untreated cuttings while auxin treatments had enhanced PER activity. IAA-oxidase was found to decrease up to 20 days and increased thereafter. PER increased with time from the day of planting upto its 30 days, followed by a remarkable decline at 40, irrespective of age of <b>donor</b> <b>plants</b> or auxin treatments. Both enzyme activities remained higher in SNCs of 1 -year-old donors which rooted more profusely as compared other donors. Present study suggests auxin treatments have activated carbohydrate metabolism to release energy for ARF. IAA-oxidase and PER activities seems to involve for triggering, initiation and elongation of root primordia...|$|R

The growth of cultures, consisting of callus, adventitious shoots and leaf sections, was stimulated by combinations of BA at 0, 5 – 2, 0 mgdm− 3 and NAA at 0, 01 – 2, 0 mgdm− 3. The sucrose concentration affected the formation and growth of shoots and callus. At 30 gdm− 3 sucrose, shoots developed roots and at 50 – 70 gdm− 3, bulblets with short leaves developed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the thesis}} "Saving {{the gene pool}} of {{selected}} varieties of old roses from the area Flora Olomouc using in vitro propagation" are listed procedures for sampling explants and primary cultures foundation varieties of roses Klimentina, Jan Palach, Fortissimo, Pastorale and Julius Fabiancs de Misefa. It was developed a protocol in vitro propagation of roses and selected media and culture conditions {{for the maintenance of}} multiplication in gene bank. Varieties Klimentina, Jan Palach, Fortissimo, Pastorale and Julius Fabiancs de Misefa formed its foundation. An integral part of the above results indicate that the formation of roots and convert rooted plants in non-sterile conditions. Finally, we tested the stability of <b>donor</b> <b>plants</b> and plant tissue using SSR primers in the varieties Klimentina, Jan Palach, Fortissimo and Julius Fabiancs de Misefa...|$|R
