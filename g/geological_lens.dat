Analytical solutions have been rigorously derived for the pore-fluid velocity, stream function and excess pore-fluid pressure near a circular lens in a hydrodynamic system. These analytical solutions provide not only {{a better understanding of}} the physics behind the problem, but also a valuable benchmark solution for validating any numerical method. Since a <b>geological</b> <b>lens</b> is surrounded by a medium of large extent in nature and the finite element method is efficient at modelling only media of finite size, the determination of the size of the computational domain of a finite element model, which is often overlooked by numerical analysts, is very important in order to ensure both the efficiency of the method and the accuracy of the numerical solution obtained. To highlight this issue, we use the derived analytical solutions to deduce a rigorous mathematical formula for designing the computational domain size of a finite element model. The proposed mathematical formula has indicated that, no matter how fine the mesh or how high the order of elements, the desired accuracy of a finite element solution for pore-fluid flow near a <b>geological</b> <b>lens</b> cannot be achieved unless the size of the finite element model is determined appropriately. Once the finite element computational model has been appropriately designed and validated in a hydrodynamic system, it is used to examine general pore-fluid flow patterns near geological lenses in hydrothermal systems. Some interesting conclusions on the behaviour of geological lenses in hydrodynamic and hydrothermal systems have been reached through the analytical and numerical analyses carried out in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the history of}} Christian interpretation of the seven-day framework of Genesis 1 : 1 - 2 : 3 in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament from the post-apostolic era to the debates surrounding Essays and Reviews (1860). I first establish a context for the discussion using a consideration of literary and textual issues that relate to this text. In subsequent chapters I survey, patristic, medieval, Renaissance/Reformation, eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and finally early to mid-nineteenth-century interpretations of the days of creation. I make three arguments: 1) concerning ‘depth’ in this history of interpretation, that readings of Genesis 1 : 1 - 2 : 3 belonging to the modern era often have roots much deeper than first realized, reaching far back into Renaissance, medieval or even patristic eras, via the commonly available channels of literal interpretation, figurative readings including spiritual allegory, Platonic metaphysics and mystical approaches, and the prophetic world-week periodic scheme. Thus the ‘day-age’ scheme reveals its roots in Augustine’s figurative creation days, the world-week historical scheme, Renaissance Platonism, and Newtonian science, while the ‘literal’ alternative of the gap theory combines ancient literal interpretation with a chaos idea derived from Greco-Roman origins myths interpreted through a <b>geological</b> <b>lens.</b> 2) My second argument concerns ‘difference’: that despite such deep-rootedness, treatments of Genesis 1 : 1 - 2 : 3 in these earlier eras are rather alien and little-understood in many ways, due to their very different philosophical and theological contexts. The hasty appropriation of ancient precedents as authoritative support for modern interpretations frequently overlooks or oversimplifies this ‘difference’. 3) Genesis 1 : 1 - 2 : 3 experienced a remarkable ‘trajectory’ in its intellectual and social influence as an authoritative text, steadily gaining influence through the formative early centuries of the Christian church’s existence and exercising a cognitive dominance regarding origins and ontology, regarding all categories of created things, that peaked in the Reformation and Renaissance. Yet with the growing confidence in reason of the early Modern era, the revival of alternate classical philosophies, the renewed reception of the mythic literature of ancient nations, and the input of new data from telescope and microscope, from sea voyage and continental volcano, that cognitive dominance slowly shook and crumbled. By {{the time of the}} very qualified reception of Genesis 1 : 1 - 2 : 3 represented by Goodwin’s essay in Essays and Reviews (1860), this once-dominant biblical text was {{well on the way to}} its present intellectual marginalization. Yet it still bears its own unique stamp and terse grandeur, and still forms the subject of debates that betray an ideological importance disproportionate to its length. This study permits an insight into the mighty career of a biblical text of seminal importance...|$|E
