The following control techniques were compared in field conditions, investigating the late pest control of two determinate tomato cultivars: a) Conventional- sprayings of metamidophos, buprofezin, acephate, cipermetrin, abamectin, permetrin, teflubenzuron and lufenuron, applied every three to six days; b) IPM- action threshold of each pest to the spraying of imidacloprid, triflumuron, lufenuron and abamectin; c) IPM- Azadirachta indica (neem) - Action threshold of each pest to the spraying of the nim oil (1. 2 % of azadirachtin) at a concentration of 0. 5 %. The IPM and IPM- Neem control techniques were efficient controlling the late pest of the tomato cultivar, not differing from the conventional treatment that presented the lowest levels of infestation. The conventional control technique, IPM and IPM-neem promoted bigger tomato production with <b>increasements</b> of up to 74 %.

O uso de plantas inseticidas e de variedades pode ser forte aliado ao Manejo Integrado de Pragas (MIP), podendo reduzir o número de aplicações de inseticidas e minimizar seus efeitos ao homem e ao meio ambiente. Em condições de campo, visando o controle de pragas tardias do tomateiro em duas cultivares de crescimento determinado, compararam-se as seguintes táticas de controle: a) Convencional - pulverizações com os produtos metamidofós, buprofezin, acefato, cipermetrina, abamectina, permetrina, teflubenzuron e lufenuron, aplicados em intervalos de três a seis dias; b) MIP - nível de ação de cada praga para aplicações de imidacloprid, triflumuron, lufenuron e abamectina; c) MIP - Azadirachta indica (nim) - nível de ação de cada praga para aplicações de óleo de nim (1, 2 % de azadiractina) a 0, 5 %. As táticas de controle MIP e MIP - nim foram eficientes no controle das pragas tardias do tomateiro, quando a pressão da população é baixa, não diferindo do tratamento convencional que apresentou as menores médias de infestação.

In 1989, the Kampfwertsteigerung (combat potential <b>increasement)</b> program was initiated in Germany with the delivery of first prototypes. The official military requirements were published in March 1990. The KWS program was projected to consist of three stages. The first stage of the KWS program replaced the Rh 120 L/44 gun barrel and the corresponding gun mount with a longer-barreled and more lethal Rh 120 L/55 version. This stage was adopted in form of 225 Leopard 2A6 tanks starting in 2001 and a lasting to 2005. The KWS stage 2 focused on improvements of armour protection and survivability, it was adopted in form of the Leopard 2A5 starting in 1995. The base armour of the tank was exchanged and additional armour modules were installed at the turret. A first batch of 225 Leopard 2 tanks was upgraded to Leopard 2A5 configuration between 1995 and 1998, a second batch of 125 followed 1999 to 2002.|$|E
