50|$|The {{meal moth}} (Pyralis farinalis) and the <b>grease</b> <b>moth</b> (Aglossa pinguinalis) are pests of stored food products, {{in the case}} of the <b>grease</b> <b>moth</b> {{including}} fats (which are also eaten by the adult moths), and have been inadvertently spread almost world-wide by transport of such goods. Most other species' caterpillars are leaf feeders; the extremely polyphagous larvae of Pyralis manihotalis have been reared from bat guano.|$|E

5000|$|The similar {{scavenger}} species Aglossa cuprina, formerly misidentified as Aglossa pinguinalis, is {{most commonly}} known as the [...] "grease moth". It belongs to the lepidopteran family, Pyralidae, (the snout moths). The <b>grease</b> <b>moth</b> is closely related to the genus Pyralis, and as a result, is usually associated with the meal moth, Pyralis farinalis.|$|E
5000|$|A. cuprina {{is often}} {{involved}} in stored product entomology. Stored product entomologists often advise producers {{on ways to}} reduce the chances of insect infestation and thus remain under food defect action levels. A. cuprina is a common aspect of stored product entomology due to its caterpillarsâ€™ feeding habits. <b>Grease</b> <b>moth</b> larvae infest dried grain products and as it feeds it produces a silken substance that intertwines with the surrounding product. With substantial infestations, the larvae will spread throughout the product and with them spread their silk rendering the product unsellable. Most infestations occur in products that are stored {{for long periods of time}} in storage facilities.|$|E
