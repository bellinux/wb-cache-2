2500|$|Hoffman {{was born}} November 30, 1936, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to John Hoffman and Florence Schanberg. Hoffman {{was raised in}} a middle-class {{household}} and had two younger siblings. As a child in the 1940s–50s, {{he was a member of}} what has been described as [...] "the transitional generation between the beatniks and hippies". He described his childhood as [...] "idyllic" [...] and the '40s as [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> grow up in." [...] On June 3, 1954, 17-year-old Hoffman was arrested for the first time, for driving without a license. During his school days, he became known as a troublemaker who started fights, played pranks, vandalized school property, and referred to teachers by their first names. In his sophomore year, Hoffman was expelled from Classical High School, a now-closed public high school in Worcester. As an atheist, Hoffman wrote a paper declaring that [...] "God could not possibly exist, for if he did, there wouldn't be any suffering in the world." [...] The irate teacher ripped up the paper and called him [...] "a Communist punk". Hoffman jumped on the teacher and started fighting him until he was restrained and removed from the school. After his expulsion, he attended Worcester Academy, graduating in 1955. Hoffman engaged in many behaviors typical of rebellious teenagers in the 1950s, such as riding motorcycles, wearing leather jackets, and sporting a ducktail haircut. Upon graduating, he enrolled in Brandeis University, where he studied under professors such as noted psychologist Abraham Maslow, often considered the father of humanistic psychology. He was also a student of Marxist theorist Herbert Marcuse, who Hoffman said had a profound effect on his political outlook. Hoffman would later cite Marcuse's influence during his activism and his theories on revolution. He was on the Brandeis tennis team, which was coached by journalist Bud Collins. Hoffman graduated with a B.A. in psychology in 1959. That fall, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed coursework toward a master's degree in psychology. Soon after, he married his pregnant girlfriend Sheila Karklin in May 1960.|$|E

A random-utility approach yields a grouped-data, multinomial logit model and predicts that time allocation decisions depend systematically on both personal and institutional attributes.

40|$|Cultural {{management}} practices that reduce the off-site transport of herbicides applied to row crops {{are needed to}} protect surface water quality. A soybean [Glycine max (L.)

One day after the foliar application of metolachlor to 2. 03 m wide by 2. 43 m long plots, 60 mm h− 1 of simulated rainfall was applied until 25 min of runoff was generated per plot. Th e calculated mass of metolachlor intercepted by the soybean foliage was greater in narrow-row than wide-row soybean, 0. 39 kg ha− 1 vs. 0. 23 kg ha− 1, respectively. Field and laboratory studies indicated that less than 2 % of the metolachlor intercepted by the soybean foliage was available for foliar wash-off 1 d after application. Antecedent soil water content {{at the start of}} the simulations was lower in narrow-row soybean. In turn, there was a 1. 7 -fold <b>greater</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> runoff on narrow-row plots. Th e <b>greater</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> runoff likely contributed to lower metolachlor concentration in runoff from narrow-row plots.

40|$|Background The goal of {{this study}} was to design and {{implement}} a novel surgical telementoring system called the System for Telementoring with Augmented Reality (STAR) that uses a virtual transparent display to convey precise locations in the operating field to a trainee surgeon. This system was compared with a conventional system based on a telestrator for surgical instruction. Methods A telementoring system was developed and evaluated in a study which used a 1 × 2 between-subjects design with telementoring system, that is, STAR or conventional, as the independent variable. The participants in the study were 20 premedical or medical students who had no prior experience with telementoring. Each participant completed a task of port placement and a task of abdominal incision under telementoring using either the STAR or the conventional system. The metrics used to test performance when using the system were placement error, number of focus shifts, and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> task completion. Results When compared with the conventional system, participants using STAR completed the 2 tasks with less placement error (45 % and 68 %) and with fewer focus shifts (86 % and 44 %), but more slowly (19 % for each task). Conclusions Using STAR resulted in decreased annotation placement error, fewer focus shifts, but <b>greater</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> task completion. STAR placed virtual annotations directly onto the trainee surgeon's field of view of the operating field by conveying location with great accuracy; this technology helped to avoid shifts in focus, decreased depth perception, and enabled fine-tuning execution of the task to match telementored instruction, but led <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> task completion...|$|R

The result was a labyrinth of tunnels within a cat and mouse-like game of tunnelling, counter-tunnelling and counter tactics.

The result was a <b>greater</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dig, resulting in a greater vulnerability to both leakage of information and tunnel collapse, and a higher loss of lives in the most hideous of circumstances: entombment, drowning, gassing or obliteration in cramped and claustrophobic galleries beneath no man's land.|$|R
