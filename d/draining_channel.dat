50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, behind the Arch of Septimius Severus were found some ancient tufaceous foundations that probably belonged to the Volcanal and traces of a rocky platform, 3.95 meters long and 2.80 meters wide, that had been covered with concrete and painted in red. Into its upper surface are dug several narrow channels and in front of it are the remains of a <b>draining</b> <b>channel</b> made of tufaceous slabs. The hypothesis has been suggested that this was Vulcan's area itself. The rock shows signs of damages and repairs. On the surface there are some hollows, either round or square, that bear resemblance to graves and were interpreted as such in the past, particularly by Von Duhn. After the discovery of cremation tombs in the Forum the latter scholar maintained that the Volcanal was originally the site where corpses were cremated.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the signatures of catchment geomorphology on base flow recession curves. Its relevance {{relates to the}} implied predictability of base flow features, which are central to catchment-scale transport processes and to ecohydrological function. Moving from the classical recession curve analysis method, originally applied in the Finger Lakes Region of New York, a large set of recession curves has been analyzed from Swiss streamflow data. For these catchments, digital elevation models have been precisely analyzed and a method aimed at the geomorphic origins of recession curves {{has been applied to}} the Swiss data set. The method links river network morphology, epitomized by time-varying distribution of contributing channel sites, with the classic parameterization of recession events. This is done by assimilating two scaling exponents, β and bG, with |dQ/dt| ∝ Qβ where Q is at-a-station gauged flow rate and N(l) ∝ inline image where l is the downstream distance from the channel heads receding in time, N(l) is the number of <b>draining</b> <b>channel</b> reaches located at distance l from their heads, and G(l) is the total drainage network length at a distance greater or equal to l, the active drainage network. We find that the method provides good results in catchments where drainage density can be regarded as spatially constant. A correction to the method is proposed which accounts for arbitrary local drainage densities affecting the local drainage inflow per unit channel length. Such corrections properly vanish when the drainage density become spatially constant. Overall, definite geomorphic signatures are recognizable for recession curves, with notable theoretical and practical implications...|$|E
40|$|Skanska Sweden has {{produced}} low energy housing since 2009 using prefabricated concrete sandwich elements, as a cost-effective {{way to reach}} high quality and excellent energy performance. Some of these projects have faced problems related to water infiltration due to rainfall during construction, resulting in extra resources for drying the structure, time delays and complicated leakage investigations. If moisture levels remain high when the construction phase is completed, there is risk of moisture damage or inconvenience for the users. Initial interviews and observations at construction- and manufacturing sites reveal some details with large potential for improvement; vertical sandwich element joints, connections between external walls and slabs, external walls and foundation and between balcony door and balcony slab. To improve these details, existing connections and joints were assessed using a list of functional requirements according to Swedish national building regulations that each connection need to fulfil to ensure proper functioning of the building. Suggestions for improvement were gathered and new ideas generated. These propositions were tested by interviewing experts in material purchasing, construction techniques and structural engineering. The study shows {{that there are many}} possible ways to improve connection details to avoid water infiltration without increasing energy losses or air leakage. - Vertical joints can be protected from rain using a P-shaped rubber profile or by changing the geometry of the external facade panel. - Leakage from massive concrete slabs into sandwich walls can be prevented by an vertically extended part of the inner concrete panel or a <b>draining</b> <b>channel</b> for installations. - Self-adhesive sealing strips covering the top of the sandwich elements can prevent moistening of the building materials during transport and construction. - Inserting a rubber or bitumen membrane to the inner concrete panel during casting can ensure drainage and prevent leakage to lower structures such as cellars, terraces or parking garages. - Channels in the balcony slab can ensure drainage without reducing accessibility for disabled persons. However, many of the suggested details increase cost and complicate the assembly of the building. Further studies are required to identify the probability and the consequences of water infiltration to assess the accepted cost of preventing actions. Practical experiments are also needed to establish the performance of each new detail. Details should be better presented on drawings to avoid misunderstandings and it is highly necessary that the designer always consider the constructability of a detail. This master thesis does not include finished solutions, but a theoretical evaluation of alternatives of which some have potential to enter Skanska’s system for standardized components after further evaluation.

40|$|Both in {{electrodialysis}} and {{in reverse}} electrodialysis ionic shortcut currents through feed and <b>drain</b> <b>channels</b> cause a considerable loss in efficiency. Model calculations {{based on an}} equivalent electric system of a reverse electrodialysis stack reveal {{that the effect of}} these salt bridges could be reduced via a proper stack design. The critical parameters which are to be optimized are ¿/r and R/r, where ¿ is the lateral resistance along the spacers, R is the resistance of the feed and <b>drain</b> <b>channels</b> between two adjacent cells, and r is the internal resistance of a cell. Because these two parameters are dimensionless, different stacks can be easily compared. The model is validated with two experimental stacks differing in membrane type and spacer thickness, one with large ionic shortcut currents and one where this effect is less. The loss in efficiency decreased from 25 to 5 % for a well-designed stack. The loss of efficiency in reverse electrodialysis and in electrodialysis can be reduced with the aid of the design parameters presented in this paper...|$|R

However, {{little is known about the}} process and mechanisms of suspended sediment transport in <b>drain</b> <b>channels</b> directly connected to agricultural fields. This paper explains sediment dynamics using averaged 5 min flow discharge Q (m 3 s 1) and suspended sediment concentration C (mg l 1) collected during one crop season in a small catchment containing a first-order <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> and its connected six agricultural fields within the Salton Sea watershed. The statistical properties and average trends of Q and C were investigated for both early (i. e. November) and late (i. e. January) stages of a crop season. Further in-depth analysis on sediment dynamics was performed by selecting two typical single-field irrigation events and two multiple-field irrigation events. For each set of irrigation events, the process of suspended sediment transport was revealed by examining hydrograph and sediment graph responses. The mechanisms underlying suspended sediment transport were investigated by analysing the types of corresponding hysteresis loop. Finally, sediment rating curves for both hourly and daily data at early and late stages and for the entire crop season were established to seek possible sediment-transport predictive model(s). The study suggests that the complicated processes of suspended sediment transport in irrigation-dominated watersheds require stochastic rather than deterministi...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} for the low-frequency {{dispersion}} aspect of large-signal modeling of microwave III-V field-effect transistors is presented. The approach circumvents the integrability problem between the small-signal transconductance G mRF and the output conductance G dsRF {{by means of}} an integral formulation and simultaneously yields a proper description of the <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> current in the small- and large-signal regime. In the theoretical description of the approach and in an extraction example of an AlGaN/GaN HEMT, it is shown that three independent 2 -D nonlinear quantities determine the intrinsic <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> current (G mRF, G dsRF, and dc current). The concept is transferred to the modeling of the nonlinear charge control, where the integrability problem between the large-signal charge functions and the small-signal intrinsic capacitance matrix (C gs, C gd, and C ds) is addressed consistently under consideration of the charge control delays. For the large-signal modeling under pulsed-dc/RF excitation, the dc continuous wave (dc-CW) modeling approach is combined with the state-modeling concept using a superposition formula for drain current and charges, respectively. The new model is implemented in ADS using a 12 - and 14 -port symbolically defined device for both the dc-CW and pulsed-RF case, respectively. The model has been verified by comparison to measured CW and pulsed-RF load-pull and waveform data at 10 -GHz fundamental frequency...|$|R

METHODS: A vertical banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in 33 morbidly obese patients. Drainage of the peritoneal cavity was performed in each case using three different types of drain selected in a randomized manner: a latex tubular drain, a Watterman tubulolaminar drain, and a silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain.</b> Drain permeability, contamination of the drained fluid, ease of handling, and patient discomfort were evaluated postoperatively over a period of 7 d. RESULTS: The patients with the silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain</b> had larger volumes of drainage compared to patients with tubular and tubulolaminar drains between the third and seventh postoperative days. In addition, a lower incidence of discomfort and of contamination with bacteria of a more pathogenic profile was observed in the patients with the silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain.</b> CONCLUSION: The silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain</b> was more comfortable and had less chance of occlusion, which is important in the detection of delayed dehiscence.

40|$|Basaltic 'a'ā {{lava flows}} often {{demonstrate}} compound morphology, consisting of many juxtaposed and superposed flow units. Following observations {{made during the}} 2001 eruption of Mt. Etna, Sicily, we examine the processes that can result from the superposition of flow units when the underlying units are sufficiently young to have immature crusts and deformable cores. During this eruption, we observed that the emplacement of new surface flow units may reactivate older, underlying units by squeezing the still-hot flow core away {{from the site of}} loading. Here, we illustrate three different styles of reactivation that depend on the time elapsed between the emplacement of the two flow units, hence the rheological contrast between them. For relatively long time intervals (2 to 15 days), and consequently significant rheological contrasts, superposition can pressurise the underlying flow unit, leading to crustal rupture and the subsequent extrusion of a small volume of high yield strength lava. Following shorter intervals (1 to 2 days), the increased pressure caused by superposition can result in renewed, slow advance of the underlying immature flow unit front. On timescales of < 1 day, where there is little rheological contrast between the two units, the thin intervening crust can be disrupted during superposition, allowing mixing of the flow cores, large-scale reactivation of both units, and widespread channel drainage. This mechanism may explain the presence of <b>drained</b> <b>channels</b> in flows that are known to have been cooling-limited, contrary to the usual interpretation of drainage as an indicator of volume-limited behaviour. Because the remobilisation of previously stagnant lava can occur swiftly and unexpectedly, it may pose a significant hazard during the emplacement of compound flows. Constant monitoring of flow development to identify areas where superposition is occurring is therefore recommended, as this may allow potentially hazardous rapid drainage events to be forecast. Reactivation processes should also be borne in mind when reconstructing the emplacement of old lava flow fields, as failure to recognise their effects may result in the misinterpretation of features such as <b>drained</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R

For this purpose, we develop a 10 -region general equilibrium model {{of the world economy}} characterized by overlapping-generations dynamics.

This latter effect is particularly important in globalization, where capital investments are made in places with high production efﬁciencies.
