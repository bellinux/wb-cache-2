25|$|The {{effect of}} free {{electrons}} in the ionosphere, {{in conjunction with}} the earth's magnetic field, causes <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation,</b> a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in interstellar space as mentioned below. The magnitude of <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation</b> caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave frequencies used by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or short wave transmissions received following refraction by the ionosphere are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the Faraday effect or <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation</b> is a {{magneto-optical}} phenomenon—that is, {{an interaction}} between light and a magnetic field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of polarization which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field {{in the direction of}} propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal.|$|E

25|$|The {{reported}} composite magnetic/plasmonic nanostructure can be visualized to be {{a magnetic}} particle {{embedded in a}} resonant optical cavity. Because of the large density of photon states in the cavity, {{the interaction between the}} electromagnetic field of the light and the electronic transitions of the magnetic material is enhanced, resulting in a larger difference between the velocities of the right- and left-hand circularized polarization, therefore enhancing <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{many areas}} of astronomy, the study of {{polarized}} electromagnetic radiation from outer space is of great importance. Although not usually {{a factor in the}} thermal radiation of stars, polarization is also present in radiation from coherent astronomical sources (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol masers), and incoherent sources such as the large radio lobes in active galaxies, and pulsar radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent), and is also imposed upon starlight by scattering from interstellar dust. Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar magnetic field via <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation.</b> The polarization of the cosmic microwave background is being used to study the physics of the very early universe. Synchrotron radiation is inherently polarised. It has been suggested that astronomical sources caused the chirality of biological molecules on Earth.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009 [...] γ-Fe2O3-Au {{core-shell}} nanostructures were synthesized {{to integrate}} [...] magnetic (γ-Fe2O3) and plasmonic (Au) properties into one composite. <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation</b> {{with and without}} the plasmonic materials was tested and rotation enhancement under 530nm light irradiation was observed.

2500|$|<b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation</b> is an {{important}} tool in astronomy for the measurement of magnetic fields, which can be estimated from rotation measures given {{a knowledge of the}} electron number density. In the case of radio pulsars, the dispersion caused by these electrons results in a time delay between pulses received at different wavelengths, which can be measured in terms of the electron column density, or dispersion measure. A measurement of both the dispersion measure and the rotation measure therefore yields the weighted mean of the magnetic field along the line of sight. [...] The same information can be obtained from objects other than pulsars, if the dispersion measure can be estimated based on reasonable guesses about the propagation path length and typical electron densities. In particular, <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation</b> measurements of polarized radio signals from extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona can be used to estimate both the electron density distribution and the direction and strength of the magnetic field in the coronal plasma.|$|E

40|$|The valley {{dependent}} optical selection {{rules in}} recently discovered monolayer group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make possible optical control of valley polarization, a crucial step towards valleytronic applications. However, in presence of Landaul level(LL) quantization such selection rules are {{taken over by}} selection rules between the LLs, which are not necessarily valley contrasting. Using MoS$_{ 2 }$ as an example we show that the spatial inversion-symmetry breaking results in unusual valley dependent inter-LL selection rules, which directly locks polarization to valley. We find a systematic valley splitting for all Landau levels (LLs) in the quantum Hall regime, whose magnitude is linearly proportional to the magnetic field and in comparable with the LL spacing.

2500|$|Circular {{birefringence}} is also termed {{optical activity}} especially in chiral fluids, or <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation</b> when {{due to the}} presence of a magnetic field along the direction of propagation. When linearly polarized light is passed through such an object, it will exit still linearly polarized but with the axis of polarization rotated. A combination of linear and circular birefringence will have as basis polarizations two orthogonal elliptical polarizations; the term [...] "elliptical birefringence" [...] however is rarely used.|$|E
2500|$|In 1845, Michael Faraday {{discovered}} that the plane of polarisation of linearly polarised light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction {{in the presence of}} a transparent dielectric, an effect now known as <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation.</b> [...] This was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines.

40|$|We {{describe}} a dispersive Faraday optical probe of atomic spin which performs a weak measurement of spin projection of a quantum gas continuously {{for more than}} one second. To date focusing bright far-off-resonance probes onto quantum gases has proved invasive, due to strong scalar and vector light shifts exerting dipole and Stern-Gerlach forces. We show that tuning the probe near the magic-zero wavelength at 790 nm between the fine-structure doublet of ^ 87 Rb cancels the scalar light shift, and careful control of polarization eliminates the vector light shift. <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotations</b> due to each fine-structure line reinforce at this wavelength, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio for a fixed rate of probe-induced decoherence.

40|$|Faraday {{tomography}} is {{a powerful}} method to diagnose polarizations and <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotations</b> {{along the line of}} sight. The quality of Faraday tomography is, however, limited by several conditions. Recently, it is reported that Faraday tomography indicates false signals in some specific situations. In this paper, we systematically investigate the condition of the appearance of false signals in Faraday tomography. We study this by pseudo-observing two sources within a beam, and change in the intrinsic polarization angles, rotation measures, intensities, and frequency coverage. We find that false signals arise when rotation measure between the sources is less than 1. 5 times the full width at half maximum of the rotation measure spread function. False signals also depend on the intensity ratio between the sources and are reduced for large ratio. On the other hand, the appearance of false signals does not depend on frequency coverage, meaning that the uncertainty should be correctly understood and taken into consideration even with future wide-band observations such as Square Kilometer Array (SKA).

2500|$|Radio waves {{passing through}} the Earth's {{ionosphere}} are likewise subject to the Faraday effect. The ionosphere consists of a plasma containing free electrons which contribute to <b>Faraday</b> <b>rotation</b> {{according to the above}} equation, whereas the positive ions are relatively massive and have little influence. In conjunction with the earth's magnetic field, rotation of the polarization of radio waves thus occurs. Since the density of electrons in the ionosphere varies greatly on a daily basis, as well as over the sunspot cycle, the magnitude of the effect varies. However the effect is always proportional to the square of the wavelength, so even at the UHF television frequency of 500MHz (λ = 60cm), there can be more than a complete rotation of the axis of polarization. [...] A consequence is that although most radio transmitting antennas are either vertically or horizontally polarized, the polarization of a medium or short wave signal after reflection by the ionosphere is rather unpredictable. However the Faraday effect due to free electrons diminishes rapidly at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) so that at microwave frequencies, used by satellite communications, the transmitted polarization is maintained between the satellite and the ground.|$|E

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a sensitive imaging technique that generates cross-sectional images of turbid tissues with a micrometer-scale resolution. Polarization-Sensitive (PS) OCT adds additional contrast to OCT by detecting polarization alterations within tissues, and provides accurate OCT images in polarization-altering tissues.

The use of light to probe neural activity allows outstanding resolution, and the possibility for simultaneous measurement from a range of targeted locations without physical contact with the tissue.
