40|$|Abstract — The {{systems and}} {{software}} development industry {{is characterized by}} a paradigm of project failure. There are various factors that can lead to project failure. One such factor is <b>gold</b> <b>plating.</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>plating</b> can cause various problems in the projects like increase in project complexity, use of more resources, and increase in time and budget of the project and many more. If effects of <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> are not estimated it will lead to the failure of the project. So, in order to estimate the effects of <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> we have designed a tool based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM). With the help of this tool developer can know the effects of doing <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> on the project and based on the output of the tool the developer can make subsequent decisions regarding the project.

Between 1901 and 2016, the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 579 times to 911 people and organisations.

5|$|Raghunath Temple {{consists}} of a complex of seven Hindu shrines, {{each with its own}} Shikhara. It {{is one of the largest}} temple complexes of north India. It is located in Jammu in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The temple was built during the period 1822–1860 by order of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, while Jammu was under his administration by Maharaja Gulab Singh. The temple has many gods in its complex of shrines, but the presiding deity is Rama, an Avatar of Vishnu. The Mughal architectural influence is seen in all the spiral shaped towers which have <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> spires, except the tower over the main shrine which is said to be in Sikh architectural style. The niches in the walls of the shrines are decorated with 300 well crafted images of deities. The paintings in the 15 panels of the main shrine are based on themes from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>plating</b> is very {{commonly}} used in different areas of techniques, for decorative purposes and corrosion protection. Electrolytes based on cyanide and ferrous cyanide solutions are still present in most of <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> baths, in spite of large efforts to replace them by some less toxic substance [1]. <b>Gold</b> <b>plating</b> from electrolyte based on cyanide is known as high-risk technology from ecological point of view. In this work the results of synthesis {{a new type of}} electrolyte based on gold complex on mercaptotriasole based are presented. Electrolyte itself is described elsewhere [2]. The goal was to establish the optimal parameters for decorative <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> for this type of electrolyte and compare the results with those obtained from cyanide electrolyte. The methods used were: recording of polarization curves to obtain limiting current densities, experiments in Hull cell and experiments in laboratory cell for <b>gold</b> <b>plating.</b> All experiments were performed with additives. The same experiments were conducted with the cyanide electrolyte but with all additives normally used for decorative plating [3]. This electrolyte can be successfully used for <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> in comparasion with expensive and risky cyanide bath. Final efects and characteristics pertaing decorative quality of gold coating are well satisfactory. Decomposition and recovery of waste solution can simply be done. Toxicity is not identified.

The {{results show that the}} TPL and SHG intensity of <b>gold</b> <b>plates</b> is dependent on the wavelength and polarization of excitation laser. The TPL intensity of <b>gold</b> <b>plates</b> decreases with the increase of the excitation wavelength except for a small peak around 820 – 840 nm, while SHG intensity increases with the excitation wavelength redshift. In addition, it is found that the TPL intensity of the <b>gold</b> <b>plate’s</b> edge is related with the angle between the edge orientation and the polarization direction of the excitation light.
