50|$|Heracleum sphondylium, {{commonly}} known as hogweed, common hogweed or cow parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial or biennial plant, in the umbelliferous family Apiaceae that includes fennel, cow parsley, <b>ground</b> <b>elder</b> and giant hogweed. It is native to Europe and Asia. The common name eltrot may also be applied, but is not specific to this species. Umbelliferous plants are so named because of the umbrella-like arrangement of flowers they produce. The North American species Heracleum maximum (also called cow parsnip) is sometimes included as a subspecies of H. sphondylium.|$|E
5000|$|Aegopodium podagraria L. {{commonly}} called <b>ground</b> <b>elder,</b> herb gerard, bishop's weed, goutweed, gout wort, and snow-in-the-mountain, and sometimes called English masterwort, and wild masterwort, is a perennial {{plant in the}} carrot family (Apiaceae) that grows in shady places. The name [...] "ground elder" [...] comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder (Sambucus), which is unrelated. It is the type species of the genus Aegopodium. This species is native to Eurasia, and has been introduced {{around the world as}} an ornamental plant, where it occasionally poses an ecological threat as an invasive exotic plant.|$|E

He was first buried at St George's Chapel and later transferred to the Royal Burial <b>Ground,</b> Frogmore. His <b>elder</b> son, the Earl of Eltham, succeeded him as Marquess of Cambridge.|$|R
50|$|The most {{well-known}} member is the Aegopodium podagraria, the <b>ground</b> <b>elder</b> {{also known as}} snow-on-the-mountain, Bishop's weed, goutweed, native to Europe and Asia. It is variegated green and white that sometimes reverts to solid green within a patch. Small, white, five-petal flowers are held about three feet high, above the leaves, in flat topped clusters. Underground are long white branching rhizomes that vaguely resemble quackgrass. Regarded as an ecological threat, goutweed is aggressive, invasive and forms dense patches reducing species diversity in the ground layer. On the other hand, because of this, it is often used as a low maintenance ground cover.|$|E
50|$|The most {{persistent}} perennials spread by underground creeping rhizomes that can regrow {{from a tiny}} fragment. These include couch grass, bindweed, <b>ground</b> <b>elder,</b> nettles, rosebay willow herb, Japanese knotweed, horsetail and bracken, as well as creeping thistle, whose tap roots can put out lateral roots. Other perennials put out runners that spread along the soil surface. As they creep they set down roots, enabling them to colonise bare ground with great rapidity. These include creeping buttercup and ground ivy. Yet another group of perennials propagate by stolons- stems that arch back into the ground to reroot. The most familiar {{of these is the}} bramble.|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) as surfactants in, for example textiles,cookware and aqueous firefighting foams (AFFFs) during the last decades has resulted in widespread environmental contamination. Due to the persistent and bioaccumulative characteristics of PFASs, they are ubiquitously found in the environment, wildlife and humans. Currently, the knowledge of remediation techniques for environments contaminated with PFASs is limited. Therefore, this study aims at evaluating the potential of plant uptake of 26 different PFASs from contaminated soils and groundwater. Arlanda airport, Sweden’s biggest airport, has a fire training facility that is suffering from severe PFAS contamination due to former regular practices with PFAS-containing AFFFs for safety purposes. Samples from different plant species, namely silver birch (Betula pendula), Norway spruce (Picea abies), bird cherry (Prunus padus), mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), <b>ground</b> <b>elder</b> (Aegopodium podagraria), long beechfern (Phegopteris connectilis) and wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca), surface soil and groundwater were taken near the fire training site to assess the accumulation potential and eligibility of selected plants for phytoremediation. In comparison to typical background levels, elevated ΣPFAS levels were detected in soil and groundwater ranging from 16 - 156 ng g⁻¹ dry weight (dw) and 1, 200 and 34, 000 ng L⁻¹, respectively. The plants showed a high variability of concentrations with highest ΣPFAS concentrations in vegetative compartments, particularly the foliage. Birch leaves exceeded all other sampled tissues and species with a maximum of ΣPFAS 327 ng g⁻¹ dw, followed by spruce needles with 222 ng g⁻¹ dw. The leaves and twigs of mountain ash were generally the least contaminated (< 10 ng g⁻¹ dw, while the other twigs had concentrations of up to 76 ng g⁻¹ dw (birch). Interestingly, the annual ground cover plants were highly contaminated and accumulated high amounts of PFASs. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs; plant/soil ratios) {{were found to be}} as high as 143, 700 for 6 : 2 FTSA (birch leaves), which turned out to have the highest accumulation potential in plants. Moreover, the BCFs were highest for short-chained C 3 -C 5 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs; median ~ 0. 9) and decreased for the longer chained C 7 -C 9 PFCAs (~ 0. 4), while being lowest for the long-chained C 6 -C 8 perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs; ~ 0. 2). In conclusion, silver birch, Norway spruce, bird cherry and long beechfern seem promising candidates for phytoremediation of PFASs...|$|E

As the guests arrived, the {{participants}} aimed their guns {{at the sky and}} fired a salute, intended as a sign of respect for their ancestors before starting the nyobeng. Guests were welcomed to show the bond between the village and people outside the village. Later, a local community leader would throw a puppu into the air as visitors attempted to slash it with swords as it fell, repeating the process if the animal reached the <b>ground</b> alive. The <b>elder</b> then repeated the process with a chicken. Later, residents would toss chicken eggs {{in the direction of the}} guests. Breaking eggs in such a way was seen as a demonstration of sincerity. If the egg did not break, it meant that the guests who came to the village were not sincere or genuine.|$|R

60|$|Winter {{was nearing}} its end when {{one morning in}} late July I ventured out of doors for the first time, though still but a skeleton, a shadow of my former self. It was a windy day of {{brilliant}} sunshine, a day I shall never forget, {{and the effect of}} the air and the sun and smell of earth and early flowers, and the sounds of wild birds, with the sight of the intensely green young grass and the vast crystal dome of heaven above, was like deep draughts of some potent liquor that made the blood dance in my veins. Oh what an inexpressible, immeasurable joy to be alive and not dead, to have my feet still on the earth, and drink in the wind and sunshine once more! But the pleasure was more than I could endure in that feeble state; the chilly wind pierced me like needles of ice, my senses swam, and I would have fallen to the <b>ground</b> if my <b>elder</b> brother had not caught me in his arms and taken me back to the house.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the accessibility of wheelchairs users in public parks in Kuantan, Malaysia and Adelaide, South Australia. Anthropology of wheelchairs users locally is identified comprehensively. The investigation takes into consideration the needs and difficulties of wheelchairs users to access public parks as well as fundamental facilities required by wheelchair user in public parks. An inclusive study on Malaysian legislation, The Persons with Disabilities Act 2008, Australian legislation, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Malaysian Standard MS 1184 : 2002, Australia Standard AS 1428. 1 - 2001 and policies and guidelines used by Majlis Perbandaran Kuantan (MPK) and Adelaide City Council (ACC) when planning {{for people with disabilities}} specifically wheelchair users is undertaken. The effectiveness of these governments documents is analysed and compared by conducting observation and documentation on accessibility in selected public parks in Kuantan and Adelaide. Esplanade Park, Kerang Park, Karrawirra-Park 12 Parade <b>Grounds</b> Park and <b>Elder</b> Park are chose to serve as case studies. Comparison on the observations and documentations conducted between these four parks found that the Australian government document is more effective when compared to Malaysian government documents. The study also found, in providing accessibility for wheelchair users in public parks, common issues such as budgets, conflicts with infrastructure, conflicts with other disabilities, natural factors, effectiveness of government documents, and lack of awareness arise in both states. However the issues in Kuantan are more critical...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, adult Indigenous {{language}} learners are being {{identified as the}} “missing generation” of learners who hold great potential {{to contribute to the}} revival of Indigenous languages by acting as the middle <b>ground</b> between <b>Elders,</b> children and youth within their communities. Our research project NEȾOLṈEW̱ ‘one mind, one people’ investigated adult Indigenous language learning through the popular Mentor-Apprentice Program (MAP) method (Leanne Hinton, 2001). Over the course of 14 months, our team conducted 133 interviews with four groups of participants involved in MAP. The participants were current and past apprentices, mentors, and administrators of MAP programs in British Columbia, Canada. Our primary interest was to learn about the successes and challenges of MAP for language learning, but we also included interview questions that gave participants space to share how participating in MAP may have affected them. During thematic analysis of the interviews (Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2014) we noticed repeating comments across all four participant groups on how their involvement with MAP impacted their own and their community’s wellbeing. Six exploratory themes were identified: • Language loss negatively impacts the wellbeing of Indigenous people: “[the word] doesn’t just mean a bad, misbehaving child, it also means a poor child that has been uprooted […] and is disconnected from their culture” • The relationship between burden and wellbeing among participants in MAP: “there’s so much to be done. […] that’s the exhausting part of it. It’s trying to learn and teach at the same time” • Strengthening MAP apprentices to become future community leaders: “it brings a huge sense of pride […] and helps me be an inspiration to anyone else” • Elder’s healing through becoming language mentors: “we once again have that believe in ourselves where we can feel free” • Cultural and spiritual health and healing: “I am keeping something very precious alive by speaking my language” • Health outcomes: “it was […] the language that [...] . pushed me to sobriety, […] it gave me [...] . a sense of who I was”. Although studies have reported protective effects of Indigenous language use on health (Ball & Moselle, 2013; Hallett, Chandler, & Lalonde, 2007; McIvor, 2013), health-related outcomes of language revitalization efforts, including MAP, remain underexplored (Whalen, Moss, & Baldwin, 2016). In addition to discussing the six exploratory themes from our study, our paper also proposes that these themes can inform future {{research in the area of}} language revitalization and wellbeing.

60|$|She {{had been}} afraid of the {{particular}} passage with Charlotte that would determine her father's wife to take him into her confidence as she couldn't possibly as yet have done, to prepare for him a statement of her wrong, to lay before him the infamy {{of what she was}} apparently suspected of. This, should she have made up her mind to do it, would rest on a calculation the thought of which evoked, strangely, other possibilities and visions. It would show her as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to be able to assure herself that, with his daughter thrown on the defensive, with Maggie's cause and Maggie's word, in fine, against her own, it wasn't Maggie's that would most certainly carry the day. Such a glimpse of her conceivable idea, which would be founded on reasons all her own, reasons of experience and assurance, impenetrable to others, but intimately familiar to herself--such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had come into view; for if so much as this was still firm <b>ground</b> between the <b>elder</b> pair, if the beauty of appearances had been so consistently preserved, it was only the golden bowl as Maggie herself knew it that had been broken. The breakage stood not for any wrought discomposure among the triumphant three--it stood merely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them. She was unable at the minute, of course, fully to measure the difference thus involved for her, and it remained inevitably an agitating image, the way it might be held over her that if she didn't, of her own prudence, satisfy Charlotte as to the reference, in her mocking spirit, of so much of the unuttered and unutterable, of the constantly and unmistakably implied, her father would be invited without further ceremony to recommend her to do so. But ANY confidence, ANY latent operating insolence, that Mrs. Verver should, thanks to her large native resources, continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve, glimmered suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer, for meeting her, a new basis and something like a new system. Maggie felt, truly, a rare contraction of the heart on making out, the next instant, what the new system would probably have to be--and she had practically done that before perceiving that the thing she feared had already taken place. Charlotte, extending her search, appeared now to define herself vaguely in the distance; of this, after an instant, the Princess was sure, though the darkness was thick, for the projected clearness of the smoking-room windows had presently contributed its help. Her friend came slowly into that circle--having also, for herself, by this time, not indistinguishably discovered that Maggie was on the terrace. Maggie, from the end, saw her stop before one of the windows to look at the group within, and then saw her come nearer and pause again, still with a considerable length of the place between them.|$|R
