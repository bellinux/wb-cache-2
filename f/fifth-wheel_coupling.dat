50|$|A trailer hitch, <b>fifth-wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> {{or other}} type of tow hitch is needed to draw a trailer with a car, truck or other {{traction}} engine.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fifth-wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> with an {{integrated}} lifting mechanism allows the semi-trailer's legs {{to remain in}} the lowered position during movement. 15 in and 70,000 lb of hydraulic lift is typical.|$|E
5000|$|To {{connect the}} second {{of a set of}} doubles to the first trailer, and to support the front half of the second trailer, a {{converter}} gear known as a [...] "dolly" [...] is used. This has one or two axles, a <b>fifth-wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> for the rear trailer, and a tongue with a ring-hitch coupling for the forward trailer. Individual states may further allow longer vehicles, known as [...] "longer combination vehicles" [...] (or LCVs), and may allow them to operate on roads other than Interstates.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} tractor-cab layout has a forward engine, one {{steering}} axle, and two drive axles. The <b>fifth-wheel</b> trailer <b>coupling</b> on most tractor trucks is movable fore and aft, to allow adjustment {{in the weight}} distribution over its rear axle(s).|$|R
5000|$|The second Actros {{generation}} {{comes with}} an electronic sequential gearbox that Mercedes-Benz has dubbed the [...] "Telligent Gearbox". It pushes forward the principle used in some earlier Mercedes-Benz tractors; using the gearshift lever to command a pneumatically actuated system that changes the gears. The Telligent gearbox utilizes a computer, together with a load-sensing system on the <b>fifth-wheel</b> <b>coupling,</b> to estimate the proper gear that the truck must be in. For example, {{if you want to}} upshift, the computer estimates the load on the tractor and the current engine mode, and gives you the proper gear for decreasing engine RPM. On the other hand, if you want to downshift, the computer assumes you wish to overtake, and gives you a proper gear for acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fifth-wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> {{provides}} {{the link between}} a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some camper trailers use a fifth-wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle, and [...] "fifth wheel" [...] is therefore sometimes used as a synonym for such campers in North America. The coupling consists of a kingpin, a 2 or 3+1/2 in steel pin {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. The surface of the semi-trailer (with the kingpin at the center) rotates against the surface of the fixed fifth wheel, which does not rotate. To reduce friction, grease is applied to the surface of the fifth wheel. The configuration is sometimes called a turn-table in Australia and New Zealand, especially if it is a rotating ball-race-bearing type. The advantage of this coupling is improved towing stability.|$|E
5000|$|These are {{available}} for loads between 10000 and 30000 lb. They are used for larger trailers and provide considerably more stability than does a traditional hitch. Both styles have trailers attach to a coupler mounted above the axle within {{the bed of the}} tow vehicle such as a flat deck or pickup truck. A <b>fifth-wheel</b> <b>coupling</b> is also referred to as a kingpin hitch and is a smaller version of the semi-trailer [...] "fifth wheel". Though a fifth wheel and a gooseneck trailer look much the same, their method for coupling is different. A fifth wheel uses a large horseshoe-shaped coupling device mounted a foot or more above the bed of the tow vehicle. A gooseneck couples to a standard 2+5/16 in ball mounted on the bed of the tow vehicle. The operational difference between the two is the range of movement in the hitch. The gooseneck is very maneuverable and can tilt in all directions, while the fifth wheel is intended for level roads and limited tilt side to side. Gooseneck mounts are often used for agricultural and industrial trailers. Fifth-wheel mounts are often used for recreational trailers. Standard bumper-hitch trailers typically allow a 10% or 15% hitch load while a fifth wheel and gooseneck can handle 20% or 25% weight transfer.|$|E
