5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a welding torch {{in one hand}} and a separate <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> in the other, and in shielded metal arc welding, the operator must frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes. GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. [...] Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also importantit should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas usedwith pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Stainless steels are {{regularly}} used {{as one of}} the preferred material of construction in the pressure vessels and heat exchangers manufactured by welding for process plants and energy sector at BHEL, Tiruchirappalli.

50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of orbital TIG welding, even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents heat from tinting, even with the most sensitive of materials. For tube diameters between 8 and 275mm, {{it is possible to}} use more manageable open welding heads (except for high purity applications). A flexible hose system is used to supply the welding head with power, inert gas, cooling water and <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> where required. The need for <b>filler</b> <b>wire</b> during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality weld seams it is essential that tube ends are carefully prepared with the edges of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to prepare the edges more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|E
50|$|Absorption of {{the laser}} {{radiation}} is substantially influenced by {{the temperature of the}} workpiece surface. Before the laser welding process can start, the initial reflectance must be overcome, especially on aluminum surfaces. This can be achieved by preheating the material. In the hybrid process, the arc heats the metal, helping the laser beam to couple in. After the vaporisation temperature has been reached, the vapor cavity is formed, and nearly all radiation energy can be put into the workpiece. The energy required for this is thus determined by the temperature-dependent absorption and by the amount of energy lost by conduction into the rest of the workpiece. In Laser Hybrid welding, using MIG, vaporisation takes place not only {{from the surface of the}} workpiece but also from the <b>filler</b> <b>wire,</b> so that more metal vapor is available to facilitate the absorption {{of the laser}} radiation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Joining of iron with {{aluminium}} in {{the liquid}} phase is complicated {{due to the}} formation of brittle intermetallics within Fe-Al melts. In this work we present the technology of a laser welding-brazing (LWB) process to join zinc-coated steel and aluminium sheets in an overlap geometry. The process is divided into welding of the aluminium sheet and brazing of filler material and molten aluminium sheet onto the zinc-covered steel sheet to avoid the liquid stage of iron. It is possible to join those materials with a single laser beam. However, with a second laser beam, the melt flow can be controlled more effectively and the wetting behaviour can be improved by preheating the zinc-covered steel sheet surface. This is beneficial since the process works without any flux agent. Wetting lengths increase by using this technique and generate a joint that exceeds the tensile strength of the base material. Due to the zinc cover on the steel sheet there are two possible filler materials that have miscibility with zinc as well as aluminium. Zinc based filler materials have the advantage of a lower melting point and thus lower process temperatures. And aluminium based <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> result in more ductile brazed seams, making it possible to deform such joints in a later application as tailored blanks...|$|R

The modern arc technologies such as modified pulsed spray arc have been used to promote the deeper penetration of the filler material in the narrow laser weld. The edge preparation with a root face of 14 mm has been proposed as optimum, because no penetration of the filler material could be detected over this depth limit and therefor any metallurgical influences on the properties of the weld metal through the welding wire are not possible...|$|R

40|$|Twin-wire welding based {{additive}} manufacturing (TWAM) {{is a novel}} {{additive manufacturing}} (AM) process for creating metallic objects using {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW). The twin-wire welding, apart from offering higher deposition rates, also makes it possible to create gradient objects by the use of dissimilar <b>filler</b> <b>wires.</b> However, there is necessity to manage the thermal stresses while depositing multiple layers on the substrate plate; {{this is one of the}} major challenges to be addressed. With the help of finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental methods, this paper studies the effect of area-filling paths on the residual stresses developed during weld-deposition. Three area-filling patterns viz. raster, spiral-in, and spiral-out were chosen. FEA for these three patterns was done using ANSYS Mechanical APDL. The twin-wire arc weld-deposition was modeled as a set of two moving heat sources separated at a fixed distance. The deposited material was activated by element birth method once the arc passes over a location, simulating the weld material deposition. The temperature gradient induced residual stresses produced during and post material deposition was predicted using passively coupled thermo-mechanical simulations. For validation, the weld-deposition experiments were done using twin-wire GMAW welding set up, and residual stresses were measured using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) system. Temperature distribution plays a critical role in the evolution of the residual stresses during weld-deposition. Hence, two metrics viz., thermal mismatch profile, and secant-temperature rate were introduced to quantify preheat and conduction. It was observed that raster patterns had the lowest thermal mismatch and secant rates resulting in the lowest residual stresses of the three area-fill patterns. Residual stresses from experiments has reasonable correlation with those obtained from elastic-FE simulations in order as well as trend and provide valuable insights into the evolution of the stresses for various area-fill patterns in TWAM...|$|R

40|$|A {{microstructural}} {{investigation was}} performed on {{a new type of}} friction joining – stationary shoulder corner friction stir welding (SSCFSW). This technique involves welding at a 45 ° angle and using filler materials in order to produce rounded corner welds. The filler materials were later coated in copper to ascertain the flow behaviour of the material and to determine what happens to the interface between the vertical and horizontal columns being welded. A new phenomenon – the so called “blades” effect – demonstrated two clearly defined regions within the dynamically recrystallised zone (DRX) which had different chemical compositions from each other. 	The investigation focused on some of the most commonly used wrought aluminium alloys – 2 xxx, 5 xxx, 6 xxx, and 7 xxx series aluminium. These were selected to give a good comparison between heat treated and non-heat treated alloys. Different aluminium series were also cross welded (2 xxx to 7 xxx) in order to assess feasibility and material flow behaviour. The vast majority of welds were performed in the 6 xxx series material; these included the copper tracer samples and a stationary shoulder friction stir butt weld. 	The first type of analysis was hardness mapping and was initially applied to cross welded alloys AA 2014 -T 4 and AA 7075 -T 6. The hardness maps showed that there were sharp hardness transitions within the DRX. Further analysis with SEM/EDS revealed that the “blades” region - which demonstrated highest hardness within the DRX – was exclusively AA 7075 -T 6 and that the “non-blades” region was exclusively AA 2014 -T 4. Hardness maps were also performed on SSCFSW 6082 -T 6 and 5083 -O. As these were not cross welded materials they didn’t exhibit the same sharp transitions in hardness across the “blade” and “non-blade” regions. However, the hardness profiles did highlight the difference heat treated and non-heat treated alloys, as the 6 xxx series saw a drop of hardness across the DRX with some recovery, and the 5 xxx series material saw an increase in hardness across the DRX. Both AA 7075 -T 6 and AA 2014 -T 4 are heat treated alloys, so the intense thermo-mechanical process of FSW is expected to cause the hardening precipitates to coarsen and dissolve. Depending on the post weld cooling process the dissolved second phase precipitates may reprecipitate and cause the material to regain some of its hardness. The blade and non-blade regions in the cross welded alloys were segregated on the basis of alloys composition, i. e. the blade region was entirely AA 7075 and the non-blade region was entirely AA 2014. Thus the post weld cooling phase favoured reprecipitation in AA 7075 over AA 2014, hence the far higher hardness measurements found in the blade region. For alloys that weren’t cross welded, {{the difference between the two}} regions is negligible, indicating that blade and non-blade regions are a primarily a result of material flow. 	Further tests were carried out on 6082 -T 6 welds but using copper tracers either between the interfaces of the two aluminium plates to be welded or around the <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> that would be incorporated into the SSCFSW. A visual inspection showed the distinct presence of the blade and non-blade regions and that copper had preferentially distributed itself into the blade regions. A SEM and EDS {{was performed on}} the blade and non-blade regions and confirmed that the blades were copper rich and the non-blades regions were copper free. The <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> that were coated in copper also saw the copper distributed preferentially into the blade region, however, as the <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> are only consumed the in the top half of the weld, no copper was found towards the base the weld. This indicated that while material is being segregated during welding it is not massively being dragged down. A copper tracer was also placed between the interface of two plates in a stationary shoulder FSW butt weld, and once again the copper preferentially segregated itself into the blade regions. This indicates that the main mechanism for the blade effect is the stationary shoulder and tool, not the angle of the weld. Crystallographic texture analysis was performed using EBSD for the DRX stretching from the advancing side to the retreating side of weld region. Both regions towards the base and top of the weld region were analysed for a single material SSCFSW of AA 6082 -T 6. The texture had a strong crystal orientation, and was dominated by simple shear torsion texture. The simple shear components of / and C were detected, but instead of a uniform distribution, alternating bands of the B and components, and trace amounts of the C components. For the stationary shoulder butt welds in AA 6082 -T 6 a similar pattern emerged, but with a much stronger detection of the C component, and more in a banded formation. For the other aluminium alloys tested, the prevalence of the crystal texture was also observed, along with the simple shear components of / and C, but the presence of banding was either faint or non-existent. There was no evidence of the blade effect occurring in terms of texture, as EBSD runs were performed across bands that contained both blade and non-blade regions. The blades effect appears to be primarily a result of material flow behaviour and not dynamic recrystallisation mechanisms. The DRX has a consistent grain size throughout, but certain materials during welding preferentially distribute themselves either into the ‘blade’ or ‘non-blade’ regions. This phenomenon is likely to be linked to the threading on the tool used for the SSCFSW process, and the lack of interference of the shoulder. ...|$|R

This project aimed at characterizing the hardness, tensile properties, corrosion behaviour and fatigue properties (in air and in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution) of aluminium 5083 and 6061 in the as-received and welded conditions. Plates of 5083 -H 111 and 6061 -T 651 aluminium, prepared with double-V or square butt joint preparations, were joined using semi-automatic or fully automatic pulsed gas metal arc welding (GMAW). The pulsed GMAW process allows close control over the welding arc and facilitates the use of lower average heat inputs, thereby improving the bead appearance and mechanical properties. During this investigation, three <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> were evaluated, namely magnesium-alloyed ER 5183 and ER 5356 aluminium, and silicon-alloyed ER 4043. Hardness measurements revealed a decrease in hardness in the weld metal of the 5083 -H 111 welds. Dressed welds failed in the weld metal during transverse tensile testing, whereas undressed (as-welded) specimens failed at the weld toe or weld root due to the stress concentration introduced by the weld geometry. Significant softening, attributed to the partial dissolution and coarsening of strengthening precipitates and recrystallization during welding, was observed in the heat-affected zones of the 6061 -T 651 welds. During tensile testing, failure occurred in the heat-affected zone of all 6061 welds. Welding reduced the room temperature fatigue life of all specimens tested. In the 5083 welds, fatigue cracks initiated preferentially at gas pores, lack-of-fusion type defects and second phase particles in dressed welds, and at the stress concentration presented by the weld toes or the weld root in undressed welds. In 6061 welds, failure occurred preferentially in the softened heat-affected zone of the welds. As a result of improved control over the weld profile and a lower incidence of weld defects, fully automatic welds consistently outperformed semi-automatic welds during fatigue testing. The presence of a corrosive environment (a 3. 5 % NaCl solution in this investigation) during fatigue testing reduced the fatigue properties of all the samples tested. Corrosion pits formed preferentially at second phase particles or weld defects, and reduced the overall fatigue life by accelerating fatigue crack initiation.
