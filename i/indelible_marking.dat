After the séance {{he examined the}} tape covering Flint's mouth {{and it was no}} longer in line with the <b>indelible</b> <b>marking</b> that he had made. West believed that Flint had removed the tape during the séance and cheated. West asked Flint for further testing but Flint refused.|$|E
40|$|<b>Indelible</b> <b>marking</b> of sterile insects {{released}} in a control program allows pest management and quarantine or regulatory personnel to distinguish definitively between {{released in}}sects and indigenous, non-sterile pest insects. Additionally, genetic manipulation through DNA-mediated transformation of pink bollworm demands such a genetic marker. Ideally, {{there should be}} multiple, independent methods for detection of the marker. To this end we are investigating an indelible genetic marker, enhanced green fluorescent protein, that can be distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods. Definitive detection of enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence in pink bollworm can be difficult; so, {{there is a need for}} additiona...|$|E
40|$|In a {{recently}} introduced transgenic multicolor labeling strategy called “Brainbow, ” Cre-lox recombination {{is used to}} create a stochastic choice of expression among fluorescent proteins (XFPs), resulting in the <b>indelible</b> <b>marking</b> of mouse neurons with multiple, distinct colors. This method has been adapted to non-neuronal cells in mice and to neurons in fish and flies, but has yet to realize its full potential in the mouse brain. Here, we present several new lines of mice that overcome limitations of the initial lines and an adaptation of the method for use in adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. We also provide technical advice about how best to image Brainbow transgenes...|$|E

40|$|Persistent viral infections {{induce the}} {{differentiation}} and accumulation {{of large numbers}} of senescent CD 8 (+) T cells, raising the possibility that repetitive stimulation drives clones of T cells to senesce. It is therefore unclear whether T cell responses are maintained by the self-renewal of Ag-experienced peripheral T cell subsets or by the continuous recruitment of newly generated naive T cells during chronic infections. Using a transgenic mouse model that permits the <b>indelible</b> <b>marking</b> of granzyme B-expressing cells, we found that T cells primed during the initial stages of a persistent murine γ-herpes infection persisted and continued to divide during a latent phase of up to 7 mo. Such cells maintained an ability to extensively replicate in response to challenge with influenza virus expressing the same Ag. Therefore, Ag-experienced, virus-specific CD 8 (+) T cell populations contain a subset that maintains replicative potential, despite long-term, persistent antigenic stimulation...|$|E
