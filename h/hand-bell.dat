500|$|In a {{collection}} of Renaissance metalwork Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71) represents the ultimate attribution, as his genuine works as a goldsmith are rarer than paintings by Giorgione. [...] In his 1902 catalogue Charles Hercules Read mentions {{that many of the}} pendants had been attributed to Cellini, but refrains from endorsing the attributions. [...] A small silver <b>hand-bell</b> (WB.95) had belonged to Horace Walpole, who praised it extravagantly in a letter as [...] "the uniquest thing in the world, a silver bell for an inkstand made by Benvenuto Cellini. It makes one believe all the extravagant encomiums he bestows on himself; indeed so does his Perseus. Well, my bell is in the finest taste, and is swarmed by caterpillars, lizards, grasshoppers, flies, and masques, that you would take it for one of the plagues of Egypt. They are all in altissimo, nay in out-issimo relievo and yet almost invisible but with a glass. Such foliage, such fruitage!" [...] However Baron Ferdinand had realized that it was more likely to be by Wenzel Jamnitzer, goldsmith to the Emperor Rudolf II, to whom it is still attributed. [...] Another piece no longer attributed to Cellini is a large bronze door-knocker, with a figure of Neptune, 40cm high, and weighing over 11 kilos.|$|E

50|$|To {{mark the}} 50th {{anniversary of his}} death, members of the Llandaff and Monmouth DACBR rang his {{composition}} of Grandsire Doubles, as was rung on the same bells at St Catharine's Church, Baglan, immediately after his funeral. Prior to the peal, prayers were said at the graveside, followed by a ringing of <b>hand-bells.</b> This was all {{in the company of}} many of his grandchildren, great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Hand-bells</b> {{have been}} found in sanctuaries and other {{settings}} that indicate their religious usage, and were used at the Temple of Iuppiter Tonans, [...] "Jupiter the Thunderer." [...] Elaborately decorated pendants for tintinnabula occur in Etruscan settings, depicting for example women carding wool, spinning, and weaving. Bells were hung on the necks of domestic animals such as horses and sheep {{to keep track of the}} animals, but perhaps also for apotropaic purposes.|$|R
60|$|He {{postponed}} {{till the}} morrow {{his attempt to}} examine the deserted edifice, and {{turned his attention to}} the noise. It was compounded of steam barrel- organs, the clanging of gongs, the ringing of <b>hand-bells,</b> the clack of rattles, and the undistinguishable shouts of men. A lurid light hung in the air in the direction of the tumult. Thitherward he went, passing under the arched gateway, along a straight street, and into the square.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally the Prayers of the Night and Midnight Hours are said. Then {{follows the}} most {{dramatic}} moment in the service, the Announcement, when all {{the lights in the}} church are extinguished other than from the Altar candles and those held by those serving at the altar. The veil separating the sanctuary from the congregation is drawn aside. The chief celebrant stands in the centre of the sanctuary, holding a cross covered in a red embroidered cloth. This is the cross which has been used in the Good Friday service for the procession commemorating the Carrying of the Cross to Calvary and then ritually embalmed and buried in a small coffin-shaped box behind the altar, to commemorate the Burial. The chief celebrant is flanked by the altar-servers, holding candles and <b>hand-bells.</b> In a loud voice, the chief celebrant announces to the congregation, “Dearly beloved, I bring you all news of great joy. Our Lord Jesus Christ has resurrected from the dead and defeated His enemies.” Amid the ringing of the <b>hand-bells</b> and church-bells, the congregation responds, [...] "Truly, we believe that He is risen!” This is done three times.|$|R

50|$|The last prioress, Joyce Bekeley, {{offered to}} buy the priory from King Henry VIII for 2,000 marks and to give Cromwell 100 marks to buy a gelding. The King was unmoved, and ordered the commissioners to {{suppress}} the priory, which they did {{before the end of}} 1536. Bekeley was granted a pension of £20, her nine nuns and 26 dependants were evicted, all the priory's furnishings were seized, two <b>hand-bells</b> were broken up for scrap, and the lead from the roofs of the priory church and buildings was taken and sold for scrap.|$|R

Thomas Cromwell's commissioners {{inspected}} the priory in September 1535 and May 1536, {{and reported that}} the prioress and her nine nuns were of good faith and blameless character. Henry VIII nonetheless ordered the commissioners to suppress the priory, which they did {{before the end of}} 1536. The last prioress was pensioned off, her nuns and dependents were evicted, all the priory's furnishings were seized, its <b>hand-bells</b> were scrapped, and the lead from the roofs of the priory church and buildings was taken and sold for scrap.|$|R
50|$|Ancient cymbals or tuned cymbals {{are much}} more rarely called for. Their timbre is entirely different, more like that of small <b>hand-bells</b> or of the notes of the keyed harmonica. They are not struck full against each other, but by one of their edges, and the note given in by them is higher in {{proportion}} as they are thicker and smaller. Berlioz's Romeo and Juliet calls for two pairs of cymbals, modelled on some old Pompeian instruments no larger than the hand (some are {{no larger than a}} crown piece), and tuned to F and B flat. The modern instruments descended from this line are the crotales.|$|R

25|$|Priaulx Rainier's largest work of {{that period}} was the orchestral suite Aequora Lunae, a {{continuous}} piece in seven sections, each one descriptive {{of one of the}} Moon's seas. It was dedicated to Barbara Hepworth, whose acquaintance she made in the summer of 1949 when she stayed in St Ives, Cornwall, using a fisherman’s loft as a studio. She remained a close friend of Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. She claimed that only sculptors and architects fully understood her music. Another work premiered at a Prom Concert was Ploërmel (1973), an evocation of one her favourite places, Ploërmel in the North West of France, near the mouth of the River Loire. It uses an orchestra of winds and percussion, including timpani, tubular bells, <b>hand-bells,</b> antique cymbals, high and low gongs, xylophone, and marimba.|$|R

60|$|We {{were now}} in the Soubahship of the Gangtok Kajee; {{a member of the}} oldest and most wealthy family in Sikkim; he had from the first repudiated the late acts of the Amlah, in which his brother had taken part, and had always been hostile to the Dewan. The latter {{conducted}} himself with disagreeable familiarity towards us, and hauteur towards the people; he was preceded by immense kettle-drums, carried on men's backs, and great <b>hand-bells,</b> which were beaten and rung on approaching villages; on which occasions he changed his dress of sky-blue for yellow silk robes worked with Chinese dragons, to the indignation of Tchebu Lama, an amber robe in polite Tibetan society being sacred to royalty and the Lamas. We everywhere perceived unequivocal symptoms of the dislike with which he was regarded. Cattle were driven away, villages deserted, and no one came to pay respects, or bring presents, except the Kajees, who were ordered to attend, and his elder brother, for whom he had usurped an estate near Gangtok.|$|R
6000|$|Who {{was that}} shabby-looking big man Mr. Warrington bowed to {{as they went}} out after dinner {{for a walk in}} the gardens? That was Mr. Johnson, an author, whom he had met at Tunbridge Wells. [...] "Take the advice of a man of the world, sir," [...] says Mr. Draper, eyeing the shabby man of letters very superciliously; [...] "the less you have to do with that kind of person, the better. The {{business}} we have into our office about them literary men is not very pleasant, I can tell you." [...] "Indeed!" [...] says Mr. Warrington. He did not like his new friend the more as the latter grew more familiar. The theatres were shut. Should they go to Sadler's Wells? or Marybone Gardens? or Ranelagh? or how? [...] "Not Ranelagh," [...] says Mr. Draper, [...] "because there's none of the nobility in town;" [...] but, seeing in the newspaper that at the entertainment at Sadler's Wells, Islington, there would be the most singular kind of diversion on eight <b>hand-bells</b> by Mr. Franklyn, as well as the surprising performances of Signora Catherina, Harry wisely determined that he would go to Marybone Gardens, where they had a concert of music, a choice of tea, coffee, and all sorts of wines, and the benefit of Mr. Draper's ceaseless conversation. The lawyer's obsequiousness only ended at Harry's bedroom door, where, with haughty grandeur, the young gentleman bade his talkative host good night.|$|R
5000|$|Horse or {{hand-drawn}} wooden carts {{conveyed the}} hapless victims {{out to the}} Burgh Muir between the hours of 9.p.m. and 5 a.m. These primitive ambulances were preceded by [...] "Bailies of the Mure", voluntarily recruited men wearing black or grey tunics and St Andrew's Crosses. They carried long staffs used to touch infected materials and rang <b>hand-bells</b> to warn citizens of their dangerous charges. The carts halted at the Burgh or South Loch, now the Meadows. On its south bank were prepared large cauldrons of boiling water in which other Bailies of the Mure, known as [...] "clengeris" [...] cleansers, carrying long staffs with metal hooks at the tips, attempted to disinfect the victims' clothes.The Town Council laid down strict regulations to contain the plague. People suspected of infection, because they lived in proximity to others who had died, were taken with their household goods to be [...] "clengit" [...] (cleansed) on the muir. In October 1568, a shoemaker, John Forrest, was appointed as cleanser on the west part of the [...] "Borrow Mure." [...] Another shoemaker and a weaver were made Baillies of the Muir, among whose responsibilities was giving permission to those cleansed to return home. No-one was allowed to visit those suspected of infection on the muir except {{in the company of}} these officers. They were issued with similar gowns bearing a white St Andrew's cross on the back and front, and carried a stick with a white cloth on the end [...] "quhairby thai may be knawin quhaireuer thay pas".|$|R

60|$|The lady on awaking rang {{a little}} <b>hand-bell</b> that {{stood on a}} table by her bed to call her maid. Then as the maid did not appear at once she tapped impatiently {{on the floor with}} the heel of her slipper. The watch in the next line was a repeater.|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, {{loosening}} {{the cord}} around his left wrist, [...] "drink that, {{and think it}} over. We shall be gone for about ten minutes. If {{you change your mind}} before, ring that little <b>hand-bell.</b> If you have not changed your mind when we return, it will be the cellars." ...|$|E
6000|$|The second resolution, which {{recognised}} the expediency of immediately abolishing 'all muffin (or crumpet) sellers, all {{traders in}} muffins (or crumpets) of whatsoever description, whether male or female, boys or men, ringing <b>hand-bells</b> or otherwise,' {{was moved by}} a grievous gentleman of semi-clerical appearance, who went at once into such deep pathetics, that he knocked the first speaker clean out of the course in no time. You might have heard a pin fall--a pin! a feather--as he described the cruelties inflicted on muffin boys by their masters, which he very wisely urged were in themselves a sufficient reason {{for the establishment of}} that inestimable company. It seemed that the unhappy youths were nightly turned out into the wet streets at the most inclement periods of the year, to wander about, in darkness and rain--or it might be hail or snow--for hours together, without shelter, food, or warmth; and let the public never forget upon the latter point, that while the muffins were provided with warm clothing and blankets, the boys were wholly unprovided for, and left to their own miserable resources. (Shame!) The honourable gentleman related one case of a muffin boy, who having been exposed to this inhuman and barbarous system for no less than five years, at length fell a victim to a cold in the head, beneath which he gradually sunk until he fell into a perspiration and recovered; this he could vouch for, on his own authority, but he had heard (and he had no reason to doubt the fact) of a still more heart-rending and appalling circumstance. He had heard of the case of an orphan muffin boy, who, having been run over by a hackney carriage, had been removed to the hospital, had undergone the amputation of his leg below the knee, and was now actually pursuing his occupation on crutches. Fountain of justice, were these things to last! ...|$|R

60|$|The philosopher {{looked a}} little {{astonished}} at my request, as if the washing of hands at irregular times and seasons offered a comparatively new subject of contemplation to him; but he rang a <b>hand-bell</b> on his table immediately, and told the old servant to take me up into his bedroom.|$|E
