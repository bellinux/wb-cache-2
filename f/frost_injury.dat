50|$|Many {{soft fruit}} berries require {{a period of}} {{temperatures}} between 0 °C and 10 °C for breaking dormancy. In general, strawberries require 200-300 hours, blueberries 650-850 hours, blackberries 700 hours, raspberries 800-1700 hours, currants and gooseberries 800-1500 hours, and cranberries 2000 hours. However, too low a temperature will kill the crops: blueberries do not tolerate temperatures below -29 °C, raspberries, depending on variety, may tolerate as low as -31 °C, and blackberries are injured below -20 °C. Spring frosts are, however, much more damaging to berry crops than low winter temperatures. Sites with moderate slopes (3-5%), facing north or east, in the northern hemisphere, near large bodies of water, which regulate spring temperature, are considered ideal in preventing spring <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to the new leaves and flowers. All berry crops have shallow root systems. Many land-grant university extension offices suggest that strawberries should not be planted {{more than five years}} on the same site, due to the danger of black root rot (though many other illnesses go by the same name), which is controlled in major commercial production by annual methyl bromide fumigation. Besides the number of years in production, soil compaction, the frequency of fumigation, and herbicide usages increase the appearance of black root rot in strawberries. Raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and many other berries are susceptible to verticillium wilt. Blueberries and cranberries grow poorly if the clay or silt content of the soil is more than 20%, while most other berries tolerate a wide range of soil types. For most berry crops, the ideal soil is well drained sandy loam, with a pH of 6.2-6.8 and a moderate to high organic content; however, blueberries have an ideal pH of 4.2-4.8 and can be grown on muck soils, while blueberries and cranberries prefer poorer soils with lower cation exchange, lower calcium, and lower levels of phosphorus.|$|E
40|$|Cold deacclimation and {{associated}} changes in soluble carbohydrates and water status of two Hydrangea species differing in susceptibility to <b>frost</b> <b>injuries</b> was followed undernatural conditions. In fully cold hardy plants of H. macrophylla stem freezing tolerance fluctuated {{in parallel with}} changes in air temperature, while in a seasonal perspective increased temperatures caused a sigmoid deacclimation pattern in both H. macrophylla and H. paniculata. Timing of deacclimation was approximately synchronized in the two species, but H. paniculata, the hardier species based on mid-winter hardiness, deacclimated faster than H. macrophylla, indicating that deacclimation kinetics {{were not correlated with}} mid-winter hardiness. In both species concentrations of soluble sugars decreased during deacclimation and were highly correlated with stem cold hardiness and air temperatures. This suggests that sugar hydrolysis may be an important temperature-driven mechanism of deacclimation in Hydrangea. Accumulation patterns of specific carbohydrates differed between the two species, suggesting that they utilize different strategies to overcome cold. In H. paniculata, deacclimation was associated with an increase in stem water content, which occurred shortly before bud burst and hence may be a prerequisite for leafing out...|$|R

40|$|Late {{frost damage}} {{represents}} a significant hazard to grape production in cool climate viticulture regions such as Luxembourg. The main aim {{of our study}} is to analyze the frequency of these events for the Luxembourg’s winegrowing region in the future. Spring <b>frost</b> <b>injuries</b> on grape may occur when young green parts are exposed to air temperature below 0 C. The potential risk is determined by: (i) minimum air temperature conditions and the (ii) the timing of bud burst. Therefore, we developed and validated a model for budburst of the grapevine (*Vitis vinifera) * cultivar Rivaner, the most grown local variety, based on multi-annual data from 7 different sites across Europe and the US. An advantage of this approach is, {{that it could be}} applied {{to a wide range of}} climate conditions. Higher spring temperatures were projected for the future and could lead to earlier dates of budburst as well as earlier dates of last frost events in the season. However, so far it is unknown if this will increase or decrease the risk of severe late frost damages for Luxembourg’s winegrowing region. To address this question results of 10 regional climate change projections from the FP 6 ENSEMBLES project (spatial resolution = 25 km; A 1 B emission scenario) were combined with the new bud burst model. The use of a multi model ensemble of climate change projections allows for a better quantification of the uncertainties. A bias corrections scheme, based on local observations, was applied to the model output.

The <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> index at- 20 °C differed between prove-nances, with a significant provenance-by-plot interaction.

40|$|Several {{different}} silvicultural treatments {{were studied}} in two experiments. In the first, mechanical scarification, slash removal, vegetation control, clear-cut age and seedling types were investigated {{with respect to}} <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings. Frost damage was also related to near-ground minimum temperature. In the other experiment, the effects of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) shelterwood density gradients, ranging from dense, uncut forest to complete clear-cuttings, were analysed. Near-ground temperature and radiation were monitored close to planted Norway spruce cuttings with a mobile data acquisition system. Growth, frost damage and chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored and analysed in relation to microclimate. Budburst date was estimated and the nocturnal near-ground temperature during the period when the seedlings were most susceptible to frost was analysed in both experiments. The shelterwood moderated near-ground radiation fluxes and diurnal temperature varia-tions, while the daily mean temperature was unaffected. Near-ground minimum tempera-tures were lower, and vertical temperature inversions were more pronounced in clear-cuttings than in shelterwoods, during clear and calm nights. The effects were most pro-nounced during a dry period. Budburst was delayed in the shelterwood. Later budburst was shown {{to reduce the risk}} of exposure to frosts during the most frost-susceptible period, when cuttings of two clones, differing in budburst date, were compared. Mechanical scarification reduced frost damage to seedlings in the first growing season, but neither herbicide treatment, nor mowing affected the frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury.</b> The frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> was higher amongst containerised seedlings than amongst bare-rooted seedlings, especially in the first growing season. Neither clear-cut age nor slash removal affected the frequency of frost damage. <b>Frost</b> <b>injury</b> to the cuttings was reduced by the shelterwoods, since 80 % were damaged by frost in clear-cuts and low-density shelterwoods, 27 % in moderately dense shelterwoods, and only 5 % in dense shelter-woods. Of the climatic variables tested, the accumulated net and global radiation the day after a severe frost event were the most strongly correlated with the degree of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> among cuttings, and the variation in their Fv/Fm ratios, in the graduated shelterwoods. Frost injuries were rarely lethal, but reduced growth and increased the proportion of seed-lings with multiple leaders and spike knots, especially amongst seedlings that were re-peatedly injured over several years.

40|$|Planting {{white spruce}} (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) under {{established}} aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands has substantial potential for regenerating mixedwood ecosystems {{in the western}} Canadian boreal forest. The presence of an aspen overstory serves to ameliorate <b>frost</b> and winter <b>injury</b> problems and suppresses understory vegetation that may compete with white spruce. Under future climatic regimes with more frequent and severe drought episodes, underplanting may be a costeffective strategy for lowering the risk of mortality in mixedwood regeneration. We examine the growth of white spruce during the first 18 years after being planted beneath a 39 -year-old stand of trembling aspen. Treatments included thinning from over 6000 stems·ha− 1 to 3000, 2000, and 1000 stems·ha− 1 and fertilization. Initial stimulation of understory vegetation by fertilization had no measureable effect on spruce heights or diameters at year 18. Aspen thinning treatments {{did not have a}} significant effect on spruce height growth rates after spruce crowns had emerged above the understory shrub layer due to rapid aspen basal area increases after thinning. Small, but significant, increases for spruce height and diameter were present in the 1000 and 2000 stem·ha− 1 aspen thinnings.

40|$|Radiant frost {{during spring}} is a {{significant}} problem for field pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in Mediterranean environments as plants are at the vulnerable reproductive stage when frost occurs. In such environments, radiant frost events after the commencement of flowering of field pea may lead to severe <b>frost</b> <b>injuries</b> on plants, and can adversely affect the grain yield. Despite {{the importance of the}} impact of frost on grain yield, no dedicated study has been conducted on reproductive frost tolerance (RFT) in field pea. One aim of this research was to develop a simple and reliable screening method to evaluate frost tolerance of eight reproductive organs (from immature buds to mature pods) which are often present at the same time on a single plant. A controlled environment screening method that exposed plants to a defined temperature regime, including a minimum temperature of - 4. 8 °C for 4 hr, was developed. A scoring key was devised to record frost symptoms on each reproductive organ, and five categories were defined to evaluate frost damage on seeds. Using this screening method, a diverse collection of germplasm was screened, including 83 accessions sourced from high altitude and frost prone areas in 39 countries. A locally adapted variety, Kaspa, the most widely cultivated field pea variety in southern Australia, was included in the screening. The flowering stage was found to be more susceptible to frost than the pod development stage. Buds and set pods were found to be the most frost-susceptible reproductive organs, and mature pods were the most frost-tolerant reproductive organs. Genetic variation was found among field pea genotypes for frost tolerance at the flowering stage. Eight accessions, ATC 104, ATC 377, ATC 947, ATC 968, ATC 1564, ATC 3489, ATC 3992 and ATC 4204, each from a different country, were identified with more than 20 % frost survival of flowering stage organs. Kaspa was highly susceptible to frost at reproductive stages, with no buds, flowers or pods surviving the frost treatment. A BC 1 F 1 population was derived from frost- tolerant ATC 1564 and frost-sensitive Kaspa, and segregation of the frost survival trait and SSR markers was studied. Little marker polymorphism was observed between the two genotypes, with only 41 (12. 3 %) of the 332 primer pairs assayed on DNA samples of the parental lines, exhibiting polymorphic products in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unfortunately, most of these markers were not linked with any other loci, and only two linkage groups were developed: one with three markers, and the other with only two. No strong marker-trait associations were observed for frost tolerance. Responses of reproductive-stage plants to low positive temperature (10 / 5 °C day/night, and 150 – 250 μmole m⁻² s⁻¹ PPFD) for 7, 14 and 21 days were studiedas were the effects of these cold treatments on survival of vegetative and reproductive tissues after frost, for frost-tolerant (ATC 968 and ATC 1564) and frost-sensitive (ATC 1040 and Kaspa) genotypes. Under long exposures (21 days), all genotypes exhibited an ability to maintain the photosynthetic rate. All genotypes were found to be adversely affected by chilling at the reproductive stage, however frost-sensitive genotypes were more responsive to low positive temperatures (cold) than frost tolerant genotypes. Evidence of symptoms of chilling injuries was found in the frost-sensitive genotype: distortion in the ultrastructure of chloroplasts was observed in parenchyma cells of stipules in Kaspa. A decrease and/or non-accumulation of soluble sugar in vegetative and reproductive tissues found in all genotypes under cold conditions reflected the inability in reproductive stage plants to acclimate. In contrast to what has previously been observed for pea seedlings, cold treatment of reproductive-stage pea plants did not result in acclimation, did not improve reproductive frost tolerance, and in fact reduced frost tolerance. In conclusion, a drop in temperature under radiant frost conditions is lethal for reproductive stage pea plants. Reproductive organs are inherently sensitive to frost, and severe frost damage may lead to abortion of buds, flowers and set pods, and significantly reduce the seed weight. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Fall {{frost damage}} {{is a major}} threat to maize (Zea mays L.) seed {{production}} in the central United States. Frost events prior to harvest can cause various physical, mechanical, biochemical, and physiological changes to immature seed corn. These changes can lead to decreased germination and vigor. Early detection of frost damage could reduce the financial loss caused by poor emergence when these seed lots are planted. The central hypotheses of this dissertation are that the severity of a frost event can be quantified shortly after seed has been harvested and dried, and that the magnitude of the damage is associated with seed development and genetic background of the seed. This information can be used to predict field emergence of frosted seed lots. Many different aspects of frost damage have been explored in this project, which provides several methods for identifying frost damage in maize seed. This project advances our understanding of seed physiology as related to frost damage and changes in physiology during seed maturation. Chapter 2 is a practical application of the tetrazolium test for identifying frost damage in seed corn and relating these results to vigor. Chapter 3 discusses the influence of female parent and moisture content at harvest in <b>frost</b> tolerance or <b>injury.</b> Chapter 3 also provides a detailed analysis of seed quality tests and their usefulness in predicting field emergence of frost damaged seed.

Exposure to high light intensities after freezing stress increased <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> significantly in all genotypes studied. Compared with S. tuberosum cultivars, the hybrids were more tolerant both of freezing and intense light stresses. In field experiments the mechanism of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> varied according to the severity of night frosts.

As a result, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> developed slowly, indicating that damage occurred to the photosynthetic apparatus. However, as the temperature at ground level and inside the canopy fell below - 4 °C, cellular freezing occurred and the canopy was rapidly destroyed.

Therefore, in an attempt to improve low temperature tolerance in potato, it is important to increase tolerance to both freezing and chilling stresses...|$|E

40|$|For grass-based {{agriculture}} at high latitudes, poor overwintering of perennial {{forage grasses}} often has economic consequences due to yield loss and re-establishment of grass fields. In {{order to assess}} the performance of grass cultivars currently used in Norway under a future changing climate, a wholeyear grassland model has been developed. The basis of this whole-year model was a grassland model developed for the growing season. In order to incorporate the winter season, this grassland model needed additional sub-models for simulating snow cover, soil frost, ice encasement {{and the development of}} frost tolerance in the plants. The main objective of this thesis has been to develop these additional sub-models, calibrate them using Bayesian methods and identifying key parameters using sensitivity analysis. The sub-models were also used to construct agroclimatic indices in order {{to assess the impact of}} climate change on the winter survival of two forage grasses. There are several challenges emerging when applying Bayesian calibration to a dynamic model. The Bayesian approach regards parameters as random and allows integration of prior knowledge. Using the snow cover sub-model as case study, it is here demonstrated how prior information and new data affect the calibration process, parameters and model outputs, with focus on uncertainty. Point estimates and uncertainties are calculated and visualized for both parameters and model outputs. Generally, uncertainty decreased when new data were incorporated. Uniformly distributed priors gave the best fit for this model according to root mean square error, while the more informative beta distributed priors gave more physically meaningful parameter estimates. Markov chains of samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters were obtained by the random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Crucial points when using these methods are reaching and determining convergence of these chains. In order to reach convergence faster, informative priors, Sivia’s likelihood, reflection and updating the proposal distribution with parts of the data gave successful results. To determine convergence objectively and correctly, the use of multiple chains and the Gelman Rubin method was found useful. Several decisions must be made when implementing Bayesian calibration, and we highlight and visualize the choices that were found to be most effective. We developed a simple model SnowFrostIce which simulates depth of snow cover, the lower frost boundary of the soil and the freezing of surface puddles. We parameterised the model by means of Bayesian calibration, and identified important model parameters using the sensitivity analysis method of Morris. Verification of the model suggests that the results are reasonable. Due to the simple model structure, some overestimation occurs in snow and frost depth. Both the calibration and the sensitivity analysis suggested that the snow cover module could be simplified with respect to snow melt and liquid water content. The soil frost module should be kept unchanged, while the surface ice module should be changed when more detailed topographical data become available, such as better estimates of the fraction of the land area where puddles may form. Timothy (Phleum pratense L.) is the most important forage grass in Scandinavia and it is therefore highly interesting to study how it will perform in a changing climate. In order to model winter survival, the dynamics of hardening and dehardening must be simulated with satisfactory precision. We investigated an early timothy frost tolerance model (LT 50 model), and an LT 50 model for winter wheat. Based on the assumption that timothy has no vernalization requirement, unlike winter wheat, but does have the ability to adapt to cold temperatures in a process linked to stage of development, two alternative versions of the winter wheat model were also constructed. These four models were calibrated by a Bayesian approach using observations on LT 50 for the timothy cultivar Engmo. The models were validated using independent observations at different locations reflecting differences in climate. A sensitivity analysis using the Morris method to identify important model parameters suggested that there is a connection between frost tolerance and stage of plant development, even if there is no vernalization requirement. The simplified winter wheat model was selected as the best candidate based on model selection criteria and its ability to capture the hardening and dehardening processes. The results from the Bayesian calibration suggests that there are no major regional differences in Norway calling for regional calibration. However, cultivar-specific calibration is probably required, since there are hardy and less hardy cultivars within the same species. A functional LT 50 model would allow risk assessments to be made of future winter survival using specifically tailored and downscaled climate scenarios. We assessed the impact of climate change on the winter survival of timothy (Phleum pratense L.), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) under Norwegian conditions using agroclimatic indices and a simulation model of frost tolerance. Available to this study was locally adjusted climate scenarios (two for the period 2071 - 2100; one for the period 2020 - 2049) for six important agricultural regions, represented by one location each. We proposed and validated a rough way to estimate the daily minimum air temperatures from scenario data. Compared to the control period 1961 - 1990, the hardening period would be shortened by up to 21 days. As a consequence the modelled maximum frost tolerance is expected to be reduced by up to 3. 9 ℃ and 1. 9 ℃ for timothy and perennial ryegrass, respectively, under the warmest scenario. In spite of this reduction in hardiness, the plants are expected to be hardy enough to withstand the predicted autumn frosts, and also we expect a general reduction in risk of winter <b>frost</b> <b>injuries.</b> The plant data available to this study suggests that the agroclimatic indices developed for Canadian conditions can be useful for assessing the hardening status in timothy and perennial ryegrass. They are, however, less suitable for assessing the risk of plant <b>injury</b> related to <b>frost</b> and ice encasement in Norway since the dynamics of cold adaptation is not accounted for by these indices. Although less snow is expected, this is in most cases not accompanied by an increase in the risk of ice encasement injuries. There is little risk of winter <b>injuries</b> related to <b>frost</b> and ice encasement in the hardier grass species timothy. The better overwintering conditions in general indicate that it will be possible to grow perennial ryegrass in areas where it is not grown today, given that the risk of fungal diseases is not increased...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Spring {{frost damage}} to pears in the Pacific Northwest {{frequently}} results in substantial crop losses. This research was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effects of frost on pear buds, flowers, and fruit through controlled freezing tests and field studies {{in order to better}} understand the frost phenomenon and refine frost protection decisions. Controlled freezing studies on 'Bartlett' pear (Pyrus communis L.) showed that the percent of florets injured by frost increased with decreasing temperature, advancing developmental stage, and increasing duration at minimum temperatures of - 2, - 3, and - 4 ° C. Increases in injury occurred with exposures of 30 or 60 minutes at all stages except the small fruit stage, in which injury continued to increase for 2 hours at - 2 ° C. No significant effects of freezing rate were found at - 2, - 3, or - 4 ° C. However, there was a significant effect of freezing rate at - 5 ° C. No hardiness differences were found between comparable floral developmental stages from weak and vigorous trees. Bloom delay through evaporative cooling resulted in a loss of hardiness beyond that found earlier in the season on non-misted trees for similar stages of development. However, under field conditions a certain amount of frost protection was gained through bloom delay. Simulated <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to small fruit ovaries at intervals after full bloom significantly-increased fruit malformation, reduced fruit weight, and increased fruit drop of 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Comice' pear trees. Time of injury did not affect fruit weight and malformation in most cases, but early injury did significantly increase fruit drop. Significant positive correlations were found between fruit weight and seed content, while negative correlations were found between fruit malformation and seed content for all cultivars. Crop density was correlated significantly with sum of percent floral injury from frost, orchard design, and height in the tree for 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Anjou' pear. Regression models for crop density, regressed on sum of the percent injury, orchard design, and height in the tree differed between cultivars indicating that one model cannot be used to estimate crop density at harvest for all cultivars. Crop density was greater at low levels of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in free standing than in hedgerow trees, and at greater elevations in the trees.

Survival of organisms, under such environmental conditions, has been determined by selective forces which have evolved into adaptations including avoidance or tolerance to freezing. These adaptations have been studied in diVerent species of trees, shrubs and perennial herbs in páramo ecosys-tems, while they have not been considered in grasses, an important family of the páramo. In order to under-stand survival of Poaceae, resistance mechanisms were determined. The study was performed along an altitu-dinal gradient (2, 500 – 4, 200 m a. s. l.) in the páramo. Supercooling capacity and <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> temperature were determined in nine species in order to establish cold resistance mechanisms. Grasses registered a very low supercooling capacity along the altitudinal gradi-ent, with ice formation between ¡ 6 and ¡ 3 °C. On the other hand, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> temperature oscillated between ¡ 18 and ¡ 7 °C. Our results suggest that grasses exhibit freezing tolerance as their main cold resistance mecha-nism.

In our observation, on the April 9 th 1954, each blossom of the two varieties of pears (Pyrus serotina) Nijiseiki and Yakumo, cultured in pots, were both exposed to the constant temperatures of - 1 ℃ and - 3 ℃ {{for about an hour}} in the low temperature room at the Meteorological Research Institute in Suginami-ku Tokyo and then they were planted in an open field of that Institute. The dates of the blooming of clusters of flowers are shown in Table 1 in the text. The results of our observations are shown as follows: -(1) The low temperatures kill a large percentage of blossoms of Nijiseiki, while they do not do so in the case of Yakumo as sh wn in Table 2. (2) The appearance and the shape of the damaged fruits in both varieties were not normal as compared with that of normal fruits in th orchard. Therefore, in our present observation, it may be said that the damage to pear fruits caused by <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> depends upon the varieties, the stage of flower development and the location of flower clusters...|$|E
40|$|Freezing inactivates the phosphorylating {{systems of}} {{isolated}} chloroplasts and mitochondria. Since electron transport is {{not affected by}} freezing of isolated spinach chloroplasts, breakdown of A TP synthesis is considered as an uncoupling effect. Uncoupling can be prevented {{by the addition of}} small amounts of glurnse, sucrose and raffinose to the chloroplast system. Oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria can also be preserved by sugars. The protective action of sugars on chloroplasts can be overcome by NaCI, KCI, MgCl$_{ 2 }$ and Na$_{ 2 }SO_{ 4 }$. lt is possible to establish a balance between the protective effects of sugars and the deleterious effects of salts over a wide range of concentrations. However, although salts promote uncoupling of photophosphorylation by freezing, washed chloroplasts are uncoupled also. Bovine albumin is also capable of protecting photophosphorylation, although to a much smaller extent than sugars. Cysteine and glutathione fail to protect the chloroplast system. For this reason, and since no oxidation of protein SH-groups due to freezing can be detected, the sulfhydryl-disulficle theory of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> is rejected. In order to examine whether the same events take place in isolated cell organelles and in whole cells, tracer experiments were performed with intact tissue. These experiments provide evidence that ATP synthesis is primarily damaged by freezing. On the basis of the observed results, a biochemical mechanismof <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> and frost hardiness is discussecl...|$|E

40|$|Freezing {{tolerance}} in grasses {{along an}} altitudinal gradient in the Venezuelan Andes (Márquez, Edjuly J., Rada, Fermín y Fariñas, Mario) Abstract The tropical high Andes experience greater daily temperature oscillations compared to seasonal ones {{as well as}} a high frequency of night frost occurrence year round. Survival of organisms, under such environmental conditions, has been determined by selective forces which have evolved into adaptations including avoidance or tolerance to freezing. These adaptations have been studied in diVerent species of trees, shrubs and perennial herbs in páramo ecosystems, while they have not been considered in grasses, an important family of the páramo. In order to understand survival of Poaceae, resistance mechanisms were determined. The study was performed along an altitudinal gradient (2, 500 - 4, 200 m a. s. l.) in the páramo. Supercooling capacity and <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> temperature were determined in nine species in order to establish cold resistance mechanisms. Grasses registered a very low supercooling capacity along the altitudinal gradient, with ice formation between - 6 and - 3 °C. On the other hand, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> temperature oscillated between - 18 and - 7 °C. Our results suggest that grasses exhibit freezing tolerance as their main cold resistance mechanism. Since grasses grow at ground level, where greatest heat loss takes place, tolerance may be related to this life form as reported for other small life forms.

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} growth of Silver fir {{plantations}} on clear-cut areas in the regime of different sheltering and mixing with the European larch. The experiment was carried out on a permanent research plot where Silver fir was planted on an unsheltered open space, on an open space sheltered by the gradually overgrowing European larch, alternating in rows and mixed within the row with the gradually overgrowing European larch. It was also planted in a SW corner of the clear-cut area sheltered on two sides by a mature spruce stand. Results of measurements demonstrated that {{the conditions of the}} unsheltered clear-cut area or only partly sheltered clear-cut area have no principal adverse influence on {{the growth of}} Silver fir. However, a considerably higher mortality, more severe <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> and impaired vitality of plants were observed. The most suitable option for the regeneration of Silver fir on a clear-cut area, i. e. the option in which Silver fir individuals would exhibit good growth, low mortality, low <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> and high vitality (needle length and colour) appeared to be the plantation of Silver fir in mixed rows with the European larch (N-S direction of rows), where the larch starts to overgrow the fir very rapidly, thus providing the necessary shelter. Pure fir groups are then recommended to be planted in marginal stand parts that are sheltered for a greater part of the day by the surrounding stand...|$|E
40|$|Selected {{plant species}} and {{environmental}} conditions were investigated for their influences on expression of ice nucleation activity by 15 Pseudomonas syringae strains grown on plants in constant-temperature growth chamber studies. Ice nucleation frequencies (INFs), {{the fraction of}} cells that expressed ice nucleation at − 5 or − 9 °C, of individual strains varied greatly, both on plants and in culture. This suggests that the probability of <b>frost</b> <b>injury,</b> which {{is proportional to the}} number of ice nuclei on leaf surfaces, is strongly determined by the particular bacterial strains that are present on a leaf surface. The INFs of strains were generally higher when they were grown on plants than when they were grown in culture. In addition, INFs in culture did not correlate closely with INFs on plants, suggesting that <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> prediction should be based on INF measurements of cells grown on plants rather than in culture. The relative INFs of individual strains varied with plant host and environment. However, none of seven plant species tested optimized the INFs of all 15 strains. Similarly, incubation for 48 h at near 100 % relative humidity with short photoperiods did not always decrease the INF when compared with a 72 h, 40 % relative humidity, long-photoperiod incubation. Pathogenic strains on susceptible hosts were not associated with higher or lower INFs relative to their INFs on nonsusceptible plant species. The ice nucleation activity of individual bacterial strains on plants therefore appears to be controlled by complex and interacting factors such as strain genotype, environment, and host plant species...|$|E

At − 5 °C, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to corn seedlings colonized by ice nucleation-active bacteria was reduced after exposure to smoke aerosols.

40|$|Cranberries, {{like many}} other {{temperate}} crops, are sensitive to below-freezing temperatures during the active growing season. This sensitivity {{is an important factor}} in cranberry management. Cranberry bogs have traditionally been placed in lowland areas such as swamps and marshes, compounding frost concerns since the temperatures on cranberry bogs tend to be lower than those in surrounding lands. In recent years bogs have also been constructed in upland areas on mineral soils. However, all bogs are constructed with the planted area at a lower level than its adjacent surroundings. This arrangement contributes to the development of ‘frost pockets’ on the bogs. The cold air drains from the adjacent high ground into the low areas on clear, calm nights. In addition, the enormous amount of vegetation present on a cranberry bog is extremely efficient at radiating heat under clear, calm skies, a process known as radiational cooling. Due to these factors, it is not unusual for bog temperatures to be 10 degrees colder than those of nearby non-bog areas. There may be as much as a 20 degree difference in some locations. Sprinkler irrigation systems (and flooding on rare occasions) are used to protect the cranberry plants and fruit from freezing temperatures. Sprinklers are the most common method of cranberry frost protection. As the water applied to the plant cools, heat is released preventing the plant from freezing. If a film of water is maintained by continuous application of water, the temperature of the plant tissue will remain above freezing, even if a layer of ice forms. The critical temperature or frost tolerance varies with plant development and color of the fruit. Protection is required to keep the plants above the critical temperature and avoid injury. Preventing <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to the flower buds in the spring and to the fruit in the fall is arguably the single most important cultural practice in cranberry production. <b>Frost</b> <b>injury</b> is the only hazard in cranberry production where major crop loss can occur in as little as one hour and total crop loss in one night...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 General {{outcomes}} {{of this study}} show that early growth of planted red alder is often slowed {{in the presence of}} neighboring vegetation, and overwhelmingly by salmonberry, a common associate in disturbed Oregon Coast Range habitats. Additionally, young red alder plantations located in riparian areas may be highly susceptible to <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> or death and animal damage, particularly by beavers and mountain beavers. Growth analysis of two- and three-year old red alder planted at seventeen planting densities in a type 1 a Nelder design are represented in this study. Each density is also analyzed in the presence and absence of salmonberry-dominated "weedy" vegetation native to the Oregon Coast Range. Red alder volume growth was reduced with increasing density of planted seedlings when salmonberry was not present, but intraspecific competition was eliminated in the presence of salmonberry. Red alder seedlings grew less in volume with salmonberry competition than at the highest weed-free planting densities. Although salmonberry presence played a significantly larger role in decreasing early growth of young alder than intraspecific competition among experimentally-induced planting densities, competition between individual red alder seedlings began at plantation age two, where alders were weed free and grew large enough to compete with other alders. Indications show that density competition between trees will increase as the stand develops. Drought stress did not significantly affect young red alder growth on these generally mesic sites. Among growth parameters, diameter and volume increment and height:diameter ratios were the most sensitive indicators of planting density and shrub and herbaceous competition among young red alders. Therefore, these measurements may be used to best predict early competitive stress in tree seedlings. Conversely, early height growth was too variable to be of significant predictive value for density and salmonberry competition effects. Study results imply that the successful establishment of red alder in Oregon Coast Range habitats may benefit from proper spacing of planted seedlings and minimizing the potential for salmonberry invasion, animal browsing and <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to trees in the initial years of stand development...|$|E
