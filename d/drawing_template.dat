In the recent years, nanoformulations have become a major concept of modern drug delivery due to their increased surface area, [3, 4] and improved dissolution rate of the less water-soluble drugs [5].

30|$|Nanofibers are {{of great}} {{importance}} due to their high surface to volume ratio, porosity, and good mechanical performance {{in a wide variety}} of applications (Ciera 2011). They are used in vast areas such as tissue engineering (Semnani et al. 2017), wound dressing (Vargas et al. 2010), drug delivery systems (Hu et al. 2014; Zamani et al. 2010), filtration (Su et al. 2017), and self-cleaning surfaces (Huang et al. 2017). There are different methods for producing nanofibers such as <b>drawing,</b> <b>template</b> synthesis, phase separation, self-assembling, and electrospinning (Yoon et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2005). In comparison with electrospinning, other methods can produce limited amount of nanofibers. In addition, these methods have more disadvantages. Drawing is a discrete method, self-assembling is complicated, phase separation is limited to special polymers, and template synthesis has fiber diameter limit (Caruso et al. 2001). On the other hand, electrospinning is widely used due to its cost effectiveness, simplicity, flexibility, and ability to use various range of polymers (Caruso et al. 2001; Hu et al. 2014; Ramakrishna 2005; Semnani et al. 2017).|$|E

We believe that the proposed idea will help J 2 ME game developers to write better re-usable code faster. We consider a single player Sudoku board game {{which is based on}} the model-view-controller architecture. The view is configured with a Game Controller Choice pattern so that different controllers can be selected. The view and the model implement the Game State Observer pattern. The Canvas drawing logic is created using the <b>Drawing</b> <b>Template</b> pattern, which ensures reusability of the board size computation as well as provides a means for the programmer to implement game specific drawing functionalities. A generic undo method is provided using the Game Memento pattern. Setting of the current display is achieved through the Change Screen pattern. We note that the use of patterns in the Sudoku game makes it possible to cater for changes without breaking up the overall architecture of the game. By considering a downgraded version of the standard Soduko game, we show that patterns allow modifications to be made without opening up too many classes. We also show how the proposed design of the Sudoku game facilitates the design of other games. ...|$|E

30|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{demonstrate}} in vivo SERT binding in the human hypothalamus using [123 I]FP-CIT SPECT. We were able to demonstrate hypothalamic SERT binding by fusing SPECT scans with individual conventional MRIs. Previous SPECT studies have reported SERT binding in the human thalamus/hypothalamus region, hypothalamic/midbrain area, or diencephalon [18, 22, 36], and one study examined human hypothalamic SERT binding using PET imaging and [11 C]DASB [21]. However, the delineation of the hypothalamus in those studies was not as precise as in our present method. We used 3 T-MRI for anatomical reference to manually <b>draw</b> unique <b>templates</b> of each hypothalamus. The technique used overcomes the lack of anatomical reference on SPECT images, which has often been a methodological limitation. Moreover, two experts with extensive knowledge on the neuroanatomy of the human hypothalamus delineated the hypothalamus with a very good interobserver agreement. This is an important aspect as the exact borders of the hypothalamus are not a matter of clear-cut certainty [37, 38], and the distribution of important cell types is not necessarily limited by classical hypothalamic neuroanatomical landmarks as visualized by Nissl staining.|$|R
40|$|The Sandvik Coromant {{division}} of Sandvik Group produces and sells products for metalworking applications. Coromant {{is a leading}} manufacturer of cemented carbide tools for turning, milling and drilling. The insert (cemented carbide) {{is the part of}} the tool that does the actual cutting in the workpiece. The thesis assignment was to develop a CAD Toolbox available to insert designers in UGS NX 3 CAD-system at Sandvik Coromant. It could contain for instance geometry or help programs or a combination of them. The main purposes with the Toolbox should be to facilitate the designer’s daily work, maintain standard and to integrate engineering knowledge. The thesis work was carried out at Sandvik Coromant, CTDP department in Sandviken, Sweden. Part of the project task was {{to find out what the}} Toolbox should be filled with in the future and to create the first object in the Toolbox. The chosen example object was the Wiper Cutting Edge, which is a patented insert nose configuration with several connected radii after each other, providing better workpiece surface finish or increased productivity. To find out the designers needs and therefore what objects to add in the Toolbox a survey was conducted at the Design Insert department at Sandvik Coromant. A questionnaire was handed out to the designers and the answers generated a list of widely different objects, for example ready NX 3 <b>drawing</b> <b>templates.</b> A number of NX 3 functions that might be useful in the Toolbox were tested and evaluated in the thesis, e. g. User Interface Styler, User Defined Feature (UDF) and Knowledge Fusion (KF). KF is a Knowledge Based Engineering application within UGS NX 3, which can enable rules controlling the user when designing. To evaluate the different functions a Wiper NX 3 sketch was created meeting the demands from the insert designers and thesis assignment. One stated demand was that the Toolbox has to be compatible with Teamcenter Engineering, which is a Product Lifecycle Management solution from UGS. The final selected Wiper Object solution was Knowledge Fusion enabled UDF’s with added Open C API-functions. Among the advantages with the KF enabled UDF concept compared to other solutions are that a new NX 3 dialog window can be connected to the UDF and that programming rules can evaluate dialog input data and give interactive feedback to the user. Depending on type of Toolbox object the application technique in NX 3 could vary. Sometimes standalone UDF’s are advantageous and sometimes KF could be beneficial to use together with a UDF. The Toolbox objects are accessed through a CAD Toolbox icon toolbar or a CAD Toolbox menu inside NX 3. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Digital Human Models (DHM) {{have been}} used for over 25 years. They have evolved from simple <b>drawing</b> <b>templates,</b> which are {{nowadays}} still used in architecture, to complex and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) integrated design and analysis tools for various ergonomic tasks. DHM are most frequently used for applications in product design and production planning, with many successful implementations documented. DHM from other domains, as for example computer user interfaces, artificial intelligence, training and education, or the entertainment industry show that there is also an ongoing development towards a comprehensive understanding and holistic modeling of human behavior. While the development of DHM for the game sector has seen significant progress in recent years, advances of DHM in the area of ergonomics have been comparatively modest. As a consequence, we need to question if current DHM systems are fit for the design of future mobile work systems. So far it appears that DHM in Ergonomics are rather limited to some traditional applications. According to Dul et al. (2012), future characteristics of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) can be assigned to six main trends: (1) global change of work systems, (2) cultural diversity, (3) ageing, (4) information and communication technology (ICT), (5) enhanced competiveness and the need for innovation, and; (6) sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Based on a literature review, we systematically investigate the capabilities of current ergonomic DHM systems versus the ‘Future of Ergonomics’ requirements. It is found that DHMs already provide broad functionality in support of trends (1) and (2), and more limited options in regards to trend (3). Today’s DHM provide access to a broad range of national and international databases for correct differentiation and characterization of anthropometry for global populations. Some DHM explicitly address social and cultural modeling of groups of people. In comparison, the trends of growing importance of ICT (4), the need for innovation (5) and sustainability (6) are addressed primarily from a hardware-oriented and engineering perspective and not reflected in DHM. This reflects a persistent separation between hardware design (engineering) and software design (information technology) in the view of DHM – a disconnection which needs to be urgently overcome in the era of software defined user interfaces and mobile devices. The design of a mobile ICT-device is discussed to exemplify the need for a comprehensive future DHM solution. Designing such mobile devices requires an approach that includes organizational aspects as well as technical and cognitive ergonomics. Multiple interrelationships between the different aspects result in a challenging setting for future DHM. In conclusion, the ‘Future of Ergonomics’ pose particular challenges for DHM in regards to the design of mobile work systems, and moreover mobile information access...|$|R
