5|$|Skeet Shoot {{still had}} <b>glitches</b> {{when it was}} released; one caused the image to flip vertically. Salvo learned of the glitch and fixed it, and the only {{cartridges}} that bear the bug are European versions.|$|E
5|$|Aside from map packs, {{the game}} is {{supported}} by regular matchmaking playlist updates. These updates make playlist and balance changes, sandbox tweaks and fix minor <b>glitches.</b> A title update to fix various game issues and <b>glitches</b> was released in December 2012. Spartan Ops went on a mid-season break that December and resumed on January 21, 2013; the back {{half of the season}} was made available as a free download from the Xbox Live Marketplace. On January 29, an in-game search feature was implemented for Halo 4s file sharing system; a web version of the Halo 4 file browser was made available on February 27, 2013. On April 8, 343 Industries launched a competitive skill ranking system akin to that featured in Halo 2 and Halo 3.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Anniversary {{was generally}} positive. The updated graphics, sounds, {{and ability to}} toggle between the remastered and original visuals were praised. Complaints included technical <b>glitches,</b> faults with the original game's level design, and the multiplayer mode's implementation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Glitch</b> is {{becoming}} an important topic both in popular culture and academia. In 2012, Disney cast a <b>glitch</b> as a major character in its movie homage to arcade video games Wreck-It Ralph. More and more studies about <b>glitch</b> are emerging across various disciplines, from media studies to aesthetics. So far, researchers were focusing mostly on theoretical and technological aspects of the <b>glitch.</b> This Master's thesis aims to analyze the "everyday" <b>glitch</b> and the roles it plays in the video game culture, conducting a qualitative content analysis of online discussion forums of three recent hit video games: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Mass Effect 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic. The {{first part of the}} thesis reviews the literature connected to the <b>glitch</b> and explains its connection to similar scientific concepts: error, noise and emergence. It also introduces different aspects and roles of the <b>glitch,</b> ranging from cheating and metagaming to humor and aberrant use. The second part consists of the analysis of online discussion forums concerning the player definition of the <b>glitch,</b> the process of finding and sharing the <b>glitch</b> and about the main aspects of the <b>glitch</b> from the viewpoint of active participants in online discussions: <b>glitch</b> as an error or a feature, patching the <b>glitch,</b> cheating, metagaming and humor.

5|$|Announced as Alien Fear in April 2012, {{the game}} was renamed to Alien Rage in May of the {{following}} year. The game was released on 24 September 2013 for Windows, 18 October 2013 for the Xbox 360, and 21 October 2013 for the PlayStation 3. Alien Rage was met with mixed to negative reviews upon release, with critics viewing the game as generic and prone to major <b>glitches.</b>|$|E
5|$|Encountering MissingNo. causes {{graphical}} {{errors and}} the mass replication of the sixth item in the player's item menu; the latter effect resulted in the glitch's coverage by strategy guides and game magazines. IGN has noted MissingNo.'s appearance in Pokémon Red and Blue {{as one of the}} most famous video game <b>glitches.</b> Fans of the series have attempted to rationalize MissingNo. as part of the games' canon, and sociologists have studied its impact on players.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{characters are}} non-playable characters unless using <b>glitches</b> or cheat cartridges, that appear {{only in the}} various Single Player modes throughout the series, controlled by the computer, as hazards in specific stages, or in Smash Run. Most of the non-playable characters were created {{for use in the}} Super Smash Bros. series although some of them, such as Goombas, come from other game franchises.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>glitch</b> {{came to be}} {{associated}} with music in the mid 90s to describe a genre of experimental/noise/electronica (see <b>glitch</b> music). Shortly after, as VJs and other visual artist began to embrace the <b>glitch</b> as an aesthetic of the digital age, <b>glitch</b> art came to refer to a whole assembly of visual arts.|$|R
50|$|As <b>Glitch</b> {{searches}} for Zobby, he takes control of General Corrosive, and initiates the permanent shutdown of the Milbots. Seeing that {{the station is}} lost, Exavolt begins a self-destruct countdown in the station. <b>Glitch</b> and Zobby escape in an escape pod and land back on Iron Star. Once back on the surface, <b>Glitch</b> is challenged by General Corrosive, and <b>Glitch</b> defeats him. <b>Glitch</b> is received as a hero for destroying the Milbots, while Exavolt, watching from his shuttle in orbit, vows revenge.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a don’t-care-based synthesis technique for reducing <b>glitch</b> power in FPGAs. First, {{an analysis of}} <b>glitch</b> power and don’t-cares in a commercial FPGA is given, showing that <b>glitch</b> power comprises an average of 26. 0 % of total dynamic power. An algorithm for <b>glitch</b> reduction is then presented, which takes advantage of don’t-cares in the circuit by setting their values based on the circuit’s simulated <b>glitch</b> behavior. <b>Glitch</b> power is reduced by up to 49. 0 %, {{with an average of}} 13. 7 %, while total dynamic power is reduced by up to 12. 5 %, with an average of 4. 0 %. The algorithm is applied after placement and routing, and has zero area and performance overhead. Index Terms – FPGA, <b>glitch</b> power, don’t-cares, SAT I...|$|R
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed to poor reviews. Critics {{found its}} physics modelling unrealistic, and many {{believed that the}} game's graphics and gameplay were outdated, {{particularly in light of}} contemporary simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik. The limited number of missions and large number of <b>glitches</b> were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped that fans would improve the game with the included physics and mission editors.|$|E
5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains a number of software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough to get past them. There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some <b>glitches</b> and lowers the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and <b>glitches,</b> and {{the slow pace of}} the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Glitch</b> removal is the {{elimination}} of glitchesunnecessary signal transitions without functionalityfrom electronic circuits. Power dissipation of a gate occurs in two ways: static power dissipation and dynamic power dissipation. <b>Glitch</b> power comes under dynamic dissipation in the circuit and is directly proportional to switching activity. <b>Glitch</b> power dissipation is 20%-70% of total power dissipation and hence <b>glitching</b> should be eliminated for low power design.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} different {{techniques for}} reducing <b>glitch</b> power in digital circuits. The {{aim of this}} study is to minimize <b>glitch</b> power as <b>glitch</b> power comes under dynamic power, so that power dissipation will reduce up to some extent in digital circuits. Warren Shum et. al [2011] work shows <b>glitch</b> power in FPGA’s varies from 4 % to 73 % of total dynamic power having an average of 22. 6 %. Warren Shum et. al [2011] and J. Lamoureux et. al [2008] motivates us to reduce <b>glitch</b> power in digital circuits as well as FPGA’s. Different techniques are available for reducing <b>glitch</b> power like gate sizing, gate freezing, multiple threshold transistors, hazard filtering, balancing path delay, by reducing switching activity etc...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception. Criticism {{was directed at}} the game's perceived lack of polish, with reviewers citing long loading times, a poor camera system, gameplay <b>glitches,</b> a complicated plot, and imprecise control. It has been considered among the worst games {{not only in the}} Sonic series but also in the video game medium. Sega delisted the game from retailers in 2010 following its decision to remove all Sonic games with below-average Metacritic scores to increase the value of the brand.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Brian Reynolds {{discussed}} {{the use of}} the demo in the development process. Originally a marketing tool released prior to the game, they started getting feedback. They were able to incorporate many suggestions into the retail version. According to Brian Reynolds, they made improvement in the game's interface, added a couple of new features and fixed a few <b>glitches.</b> They also improved some rules, fine-tuned the game balance and improved the AI. Finally, he adds that they continued to add patches to enhance the game after the game was released.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been {{compared}} by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and <b>glitches</b> to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E

50|$|<b>Glitch</b> Bob {{returns to}} Mainframe {{to stop the}} wedding, where he reveals that Megabyte has {{previously}} stolen part of his code. <b>Glitch</b> is able to return this code to Bob, which forces Megabyte to emerge— <b>Glitch</b> Bob is the original, while the new Bob had been Megabyte in disguise.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glitch</b> {{is found}} {{deactivated}} in a ruined city by Droid rebels. He is reactivated in Droid Town, the last stronghold for the rebellion, {{where it is}} discovered that <b>Glitch's</b> memory has been erased. When he is brought {{up to date on}} the rebellion, Droid Town is attacked by Milbots. <b>Glitch</b> aids in the defense of the city and pursues a Mil, Vlax, that got away, so he could not report the location of Droid Town to General Corrosive. While almost everyone is safely in hiding, one of <b>Glitch's</b> friends, Zobby, was taken by Exavolt. <b>Glitch</b> finds Exavolt on a space shuttle ready to take off. <b>Glitch</b> attaches himself to the outside of the shuttle as it takes off. The shuttle docks with a space station in hiding behind a fake moon in orbit over Iron Star.|$|R
5|$|The {{international}} {{version was}} imported by Bergsala AB into Scandinavian countries {{in small amounts}} and was re-titled Mr. Gimmick. It was released on 19 May 1993. Unlike its Japanese counterpart, this version features nine lives instead of four to counter the game's extreme difficulty. The game also contains downgraded music {{due to the lack}} of an expanded sound channel chip. Since the European cartridge is encoded for PAL region, the game will not work properly on a North American NTSC NES due to graphical <b>glitches,</b> but an identical NTSC prototype ROM has been leaked online which functions properly.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{original}} release, a patch was available for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, which contained over 200 quest and scripting-related fixes. The update released on December 14, 2010, has fixed further <b>glitches</b> and save game problems, including companion-related bugs. Subsequent updates were released in February and April that corrected numerous bugs and gameplay issues. A patch was released on July 5, 2011, that included a provision that automatically creates a save prior to the endgame sequence. After credits, the user is prompted to load this save game, allowing single save players to play DLC without creating a new game.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing {{that he had been}} told that the load times and <b>glitches</b> in his review copy would not be in {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glitch</b> hop is {{a fusion}} genre of hip hop and <b>glitch</b> music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-2000s in the United States and Europe. Musically, it is based on irregular, chaotic breakbeats, glitchy basslines and other typical sound effects used in <b>glitch</b> music, like skips. <b>Glitch</b> hop artists include Prefuse 73, Dabrye and Flying Lotus. Wonky is a subgenre of hip hop that originated around 2008, but most notably in the United States and United Kingdom, and among international artists of the Hyperdub music label, under the influence of <b>glitch</b> hop and dubstep. Wonky music is of the same glitchy style as <b>glitch</b> hop, but it was specifically noted for its melodies, rich with [...] "mid-range unstable synths". Scotland {{has become one of the}} most prominent wonky scenes, with artists like Hudson Mohawke and Rustie.|$|R

5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} {{the only person in the}} room when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly <b>glitches,</b> displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E
5|$|Prime was {{released}} for the GameCube in five versions. The original North American and Japanese NTSC versions {{and the second}} North American version, which contained minor changes, all used a loader that sometimes caused the game to freeze in specific rooms. The European PAL version resolved these <b>glitches</b> and contained altered elements of the gameplay to prevent sequence breaking, a slower loader that prevented the occasional crashes, slightly different story details, and narration in the opening and closing scenes. Some of these changes were carried over from the PAL version to the NTSC region's Player's Choice re-release, along with additional changes not made in other releases. This version, which was bundled with a silver GameCube, also contained a second disc featuring a preview trailer and a demo for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, a timeline of Metroid games, and an art gallery.|$|E
5|$|Ralph and Vanellope build a kart, {{and they}} flee to Diet Cola Mountain, an {{unfinished}} race track. Learning that Vanellope cannot drive, Ralph helps teach her. King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers {{to him in}} exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her <b>glitches</b> would {{be brought to the}} attention of players, their game would be unplugged and Vanellope would die, unable to leave the game because she is a glitch. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his own game, but notices Vanellope's image on the side of the Sugar Rush cabinet, and realizes she was meant to be a playable character.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glitch</b> hop and wonky {{are popular}} among a {{relatively}} smaller audience interested in alternative hip hop and electronic music (especially dubstep); neither <b>glitch</b> hop nor wonky have achieved mainstream popularity. However, artists like Flying Lotus, The <b>Glitch</b> Mob and Hudson Mohawke have seen success in other avenues. Flying Lotus's music has earned multiple positive reviews on the independent music review site Pitchfork.com {{as well as}} a prominent (yet uncredited) spot during Adult Swim commercial breaks. Hudson Mohawke is one of few <b>glitch</b> hop artists to play at major music festivals such as Sasquatch! Music Festival.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Glitch</b> {{was officially}} {{launched}} on September 27, 2011, but reverted to beta status on November 30, 2011, citing accessibility and depth issues. <b>Glitch</b> was officially shut down on December 9, 2012. In 2013, Children of Ur was created as a fan project and is currently up and running for public use.
