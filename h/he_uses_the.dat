5|$|Scalia doesn't {{come into}} oral {{argument}} all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on {{the nuances of}} the case before him. He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle.

5000|$|I {{would like}} to {{disclose}} to you {{the meaning of the}} term [...] "infinite Intelligence" [...] as the author of the books I read meant it. It refers to God. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "infinite Intelligence" [...] because he found that the books would sell better if <b>he</b> did not <b>use</b> <b>the</b> word God. On his first book, The Law of Success, <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> word God, which led to his book not being sold extensively and being pulled out by book stores from their book shelves if memory serves me well. I think he found resistance from publishers, too, when <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> word God.|$|R

5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets as long as <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E

5|$|The overweighting of the {{stressed}} syllables {{strengthens the}} humour of the lines. Busch also uses dactyls, where one accented syllable {{is followed by}} two unaccented syllables, as in his Plisch und Plum, where they underline the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher Bokelmann educates his pupils. They create tension in the Sourdough chapter from Adventures of a Bachelor, through the alternation of trochees and dactyls. Busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems, as in Fips the Monkey, where <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> epic hexameter in a speech about wisdom.|$|E
5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects <b>he</b> <b>uses,</b> <b>the</b> designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E

5|$|The Oberon's log {{reveals that}} the apes on board, led by Semos, {{organized}} a mutiny and {{took control of the}} vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> Oberons last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle is halted as a familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. The pod is piloted by Pericles, the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now found his way to the planet.
