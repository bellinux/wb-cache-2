40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the numerical density the cerebellar Purkinje cells in human fetal brain. The numerical density was calculated in flocculus, vermis and <b>hemispherium</b> <b>cerebelli.</b> For that purpose, we used fetal brains of various stages of development (12, 5 th to 31 st gestation week) and one brain of 6 -day old newborn. The brains were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, then cut in 6, 15, 30 Î¼m, and stained with Cresyl-violet. Each fifth slice was analyzed using the light microscope. Numerical density of the Purkinje cell nuclei was performed by point counting method according to Weibel. The analysis of the obtained value for the numerical density of Purkinje cell nuclei showed a constant decrease during development in all investigated parts of the cerebellar cortex...|$|E
