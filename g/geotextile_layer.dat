The use of geotextiles as capillary cutoff layers to prevent frost heave {{has been proposed}} as well. In recognition {{of the need to}} investigate properties of geotextiles in cold regions applications, a laboratory test program was conducted with five representative geotextile types. Freeze-thaw durability of geotextiles in fresh and saline water was studied. Geotextile strength before and after 300 freeze-thaw cycles showed no serious degradation. Geotextile load-deformation-time relationships were determined at + 22 °C and - 12 °C by wide strip tensile and static creep tests. Temperature had little effect on strength, but creep was significantly affected. Lower temperatures resulted in lower creep rates and delayed the onset of tertiary creep. Geotextile structure and polymer type were significant to creep. Polypropylene geotextiles were affected to a greater extent by the temperature differences considered than were polyester geotextiles. A preliminary laboratory investigation was-performed to determine the potential of geotextiles to serve as capillary breaks to reduce frost heave. Three columns of a highly frost susceptible Alaskan silt were frozen simultaneously from the top at a constant rate. Free water was available at the bottom for two columns - one contained a <b>geotextile</b> <b>layer</b> and one did not. The third column, a control specimen, was frozen without free water or a <b>geotextile</b> <b>layer.</b> Heave and water content increase during freezing were determined for each soil column.

The geotextile encapsulated sand barrier systems are made of cubical wire mesh formwork lined with geotextile and form a thick protective barrier when filled with granular materials. In the present study, dry sand particles of size varying from microns to few millimeters (fine and coarse) are used as infill granular material. Spherical shaped glass beads are also used as the infill material to study the influence of shape of the infill particle on the attenuation behavior. The process of shock wave attenuation by the sand barrier, with and without the geotextile facing formwork is examined. The experiments are performed using a conventional shock tube, where shock waves with incident Mach number in the range of 129 - 1. 70 are generated. The experimental results show that the presence of <b>geotextile</b> <b>layer</b> has contributed significantly towards shock wave attenuation. The geotextile also plays an important role as a regulator, which is able to deliver gradual pressure rise at the downstream end of the barrier. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the results of the {{numerical}} analysis of the stress-strain state of a 50 m high earthfill cofferdam. A geocomposite membrane (geo-membrane and <b>geotextile</b> <b>layers)</b> in its upper part (20 m) serves as a seepage control element. The grout curtain is installed in {{the lower part of the}} cofferdam and in the foundation. The cofferdam design implements the idea of using riprap to reduce the weight of the geocomposite membrane. The analysis proves that the high weight of the membrane considerably worsens the stress state of both the membrane and the whole dam. First of all, the load causes additional deflection of the membrane and consequently increases tensile stresses inside it. Second, due to the low value of the friction coefficient (approximately 0. 3 0. 4) in the point of contact between the geocomposite membrane and soil the dam upstream shell may slide down along the geocomposite membrane. Additional dam displacements may cause considerable tensile forces in the geomembrane. Their maximum values are comparable to the strength of the polymer material used for the manufacturing of the membrane. Any rupture of the membrane and <b>geotextile</b> <b>layers</b> may be expected. The analysis proves that it is necessary to get compensators in the polymer membrane allowing for the extension of the membrane absent of any tensile forces. The analysis proves that the geocomposite membrane does not affect the stressstrain state of the earth fill due to its small thickness. Non-linear effects of “earth – geomembrane” contacts are to be taken into account, because tensile forces appear inside geo-membranes due to the presence of friction forces.

The interaction mechanism is affected by factors such as: state of stress within the reinforced mass; nature of loading; direction of reinforcement; boundary conditions; and material and interface properties. In the case of monotonic loading, three mechanisms of interaction have been identified: passive anchorage; enhanced confinement; and tensile membrane action. Under cyclic loading conditions, other mechanisms such as dynamic interlock have been observed [18]. Shin et al.

Centrifuge tests were performed in a 4. 5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. In order to simulate the failure to reinforcement layers, ratio of length of the reinforcement to height of the slope is maintained as 0. 85 and the slope is constructed with a scaled-down geotextile material by using a wrap-around technique to represent flexible facing. Three centrifuge model tests were carried out on geotextile reinforced sand slopes by varying the type of reinforcement and vertical spacing while, slope inclination (2 V: 1 H) and placement void ratio were maintained as constant.

The test tank had an arrangement for the water table rise, {{from the bottom of}} the sand bed constructed in the tank. The model strip footing was placed at the surface of the sand bed, and measurement of the settlement occurring with the rise of the water table, was taken to observe the effect of water table rise. When the water table reached the top surface of the sand bed, that is, the sand bed was fully submerged under water; the measurement of settlement of the footing was continued, by applying the load incrementally through the hydraulic jack. The results show that the rise of the water table causes a significant settlement of the footing for both unreinforced and reinforced cases. However, the beneficial effect of reinforcement layers was observed in terms of increased load-bearing capacity. An increase in the number of reinforcement layers, from 1 to 4 as well as providing the wraparound ends to the reinforcement, brought a significant increase in load-bearing capacity. When compared to the dry situation, there is a significant decrease in the load-bearing capacity as well as in the modulus of subgrade reaction of the unreinforced and reinforced sand beds with the rise of water table and full submergence. ...|$|R
40|$|Permeable {{pavements}} {{are increasingly}} being used as urban stormwater management systems. Permeable pavement systems enable stormwater to infiltrate through the pavement surface and into the filter layer. Three common recycled construction and demolition (C&D) materials; crushed brick (CB), recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) were investigated in combination with nonwoven geotextile to assess their suitability as filter materials in permeable pavements. A series of laboratory tests was undertaken to assess the geotechnical and hydraulic characteristics of the C&D materials in permeable pavement applications. As a worst case scenario, stormwater mixtures were prepared in the laboratory with a slightly {{higher than the average}} pollutant concentrations in stormwater runoff events occurring in urban areas. Constant head permeability tests were carried out to investigate the stormwater filtration capacity and clogging behaviour of C&D materials. A series of hydraulic conductivity tests was also conducted to investigate the effect of variations in the properties of filter media, sediment particle sizes, density of the filter media and clogging effects over time. This research found that the <b>geotextile</b> <b>layer</b> increases pollutant removal efficiency of the C&D materials; however has potential to cause more clogging due to continuous accumulations of sediments in a long period. In terms of usage in permeable pavement filter layer, C&D materials were found to have geotechnical and hydraulic properties equivalent or superior to that of typical quarry granular materials. The Model for Urban Stormwater Improvement Conceptualisation (MUSIC) was furthermore employed to predict the pollutant removal efficiency of the C&D materials and the predicted results were validated with the laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|Geotechnical {{engineers}} face {{serious problems}} when construction sites contain collapsible soils, which are known by their strength when dry and experience sudden and excessive settlement when inundated. The {{amount of soil}} collapse depends {{on the extent of}} the wetting zone and the degree of saturation reached when the surface water is the source of inundation. On the other hand, full saturation of the collapsible soil and accordingly, the maximum collapse are expected when the source of inundation is the rise of groundwater table. In this thesis, experimental investigation was carried out on prototype set-up to simulate the case of a surface rigid strip footing resting on collapsible soils. The objective of this research has been to evaluate the collapse settlement of the footing when the collapsible soils are subjected to full inundation due to the rise of ground water table. The case of footings on homogeneous collapsible soils having various collapse potentials, heights and applied stresses were first examined. Then, the case of footing resting on partially replaced collapsible soils by compacted sand was tested to establish the optimum thickness of the soil replaced on the collapse settlement of these footings. In addition, tests were carried out on these footings where geosynthetic layers were placed at the interface between the replaced and the collapsible soil layers and within the replaced soil layer. Analytical and empirical models were developed to predict the collapse settlement of these footings for a given soil / replacement layer / <b>geotextile</b> <b>layer</b> conditions. Design procedures and charts were provided for practicing use...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the aggregate thickness required for unpaved roads resting on c-φ soil. Conventional practice of design of unpaved roads mostly considers the subgrade layer to be purely cohesive such as in soft marshy lands. However, a huge bulk of Indian sub-urban and rural unpaved roads rest on c-φ soil subgrade soil whose strength characteristics are contributed both by cohesion (c) and angle of internal friction (φ). It is imperative that if cohesion is considered as the sole strength criterion, it will provide lower bearing resistance, and hence, will overestimate the aggregate thickness required, which will eventually lead to undesirable increase in the overall project cost. In this regard, this article reports the result of an attempt made to identify the diminution in the required aggregate thickness of the unpaved road when both the strength characteristics of the subgrade soil are taken into account. Utility of a single <b>geotextile</b> <b>layer</b> beneath the aggregate has also been investigated towards further reduction of the required aggregate thickness. Incorporating bearing capacity estimation of the c-φ soil, necessary expressions have been developed for estimating the required aggregate thickness {{as a function of the}} axle load, tire inflation pressure, cohesion and angle of internal friction of subgrade soil, angle of internal friction and load distribution angle of the aggregate. Extended ranges of the aforementioned parameters, as suitable in Indian context, have been considered and the effect of the same, in the absence and presence of geotextiles, has been reported. Efficacy of the geotextiles has been elucidated in terms of the degree of improvement represented as reduction of aggregate thickness. Encouraging improvement up to the level of 70 % has been observed in many instances...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} reduced scale tests, at unit gravity, performed on circular footings supported by reinforced sand. Reinforcement by multiple layers of geocell was investigated and performance of the footing was compared to one on the same sandy soil containing multi-layered planar geotextile reinforcement. The comparison used geocell and <b>geotextile</b> <b>layers</b> formed from the same parent geosynthetic material having the same characteristics but with less mass of geocell. Results show that the reinforcements’ efficiency (described {{in terms of the}} load carrying and subgrade modulus enhancement) decreased as the number of layers increased. In tests at moderate and low footing settlements, significant improvements in bearing capacity and subgrade modulus were obtained with the application of three layers of geocell. On the whole, multi-layered geocell-reinforced soil provides a more effective and much stiffer system that can deliver greater foundation loads and subgrade modulus, as compared to the multi-layered planar-reinforced soil, even when less parent geosynthetic material is used in the multi-layered geocell arrangement. Furthermore, reinforcement benefit is achievable at settlements as small as 0. 2 - 0. 4 % of footing diameter for the geocell installations whereas settlements 4 to 5 times larger are needed before benefit is gained from a comparable planar geotextile system. To achieve comparable performances, the multi-layered geocell requires 1 / 4 to 1 / 2 the mass of geosynthetic material as needed {{in the form of a}} multi-layered planar geotextile reinforcement (depending on the settlement allowable). The multi-layered geocell reinforcement needs considerably less parent geosynthetic (reducing transport and, perhaps supply costs) and reduces the size of reinforcement zone required, consequently reducing excavation and the amount of backfill required...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] modelling techniques can be used to examine the serviceability limit states of landfill side-slope lining systems in response to waste placement. A study has been conducted in which the variability of significant model input parameters have been investigated within a probabilistic framework using Monte Carlo simulation. Key model parameters are treated as random variables, and the statistical information required to describe their distributions has been derived from a laboratory repeatability testing programme, a literature survey and an expert consultation process. Model outputs include relative shear displacements between lining components, and tensile strains in the geosynthetic layers that occur in response to staged placement of waste against the side slope. It was found that analyses including input parameter variability were able to identify mechanisms influencing liner performance and their probability of occurrence. These mechanisms include large (i. e. ≫ 100 mm) relative displacements at interfaces that can generate post-peak strengths, and mobilised tensile strains in the geomembrane and <b>geotextile</b> <b>layers.</b> Additionally, it was found that relative displacements at the controlling (i. e. weakest) liner interface are greater for landfills with a steep side slope, for stiffer waste and thicker waste lifts, while tensile strains in the geosynthetic elements are greater for steep side slopes, more compressible waste and thinner waste lifts. Outputs from probabilistic analyses such as that used in this study can guide engineers regarding geometries and materials that could produce waste-settlement-generated serviceability limit state failures, and hence can be used to support more reliable designs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a controlled outflow capillary pressure cell for the measurement of geotextile-water characteristic curves. Fine sand with a known soil-water characteristic curve and a geotextile column drainage experi-ment were used to validate the controlled outflow cell. The controlled outflow cell was also used to measure drainage geotextile-water characteristic curves for one, three, and six vertically stacked nonwoven <b>geotextile</b> specimen <b>layers.</b> Test results indicate the following: (i) the controlled outflow cell can measure a complete nonwoven drainage geotextile-water characteristic curve with a water entry pressure of 50 mm; (ii) vertical stacking of the nonwoven geotextile has little influence on the geotextile-water charac-teristic curve; and (iii) a geotextile-water characteristic curve can be measured in less time when compared with Klute’s method. Test results also indicate that ASTM D 854 may be used to determine the specific gravity of the nonwoven geotextile...|$|R
