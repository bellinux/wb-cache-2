The receiver is an extension of the Weaver single-sideband architecture [2].

There is also a library including other blocks like the antenna, <b>duplexer</b> <b>filter</b> and switches, required to implement reconfigurable architectures. Behavioral models of building blocks include the main ideal functionality {{as well as the}} following non-idealities: thermal noise, characterized by the noise figure and the signal-to-noise ratio, and non-linearity, represented by the input-referred second-order and third-order intercept points, IIP_ 2 and IIP_ 3, respectively. In addition to these general parameters, some block-specific errors have also been included, like oscillator phase noise and mixer offset. These models have been incorporated into the SIMULINK environment making an extensive use of C-coded S-functions and reducing the number of library block elements. This approach reduces the simulation time while keeping high accuracy, which makes the proposed toolbox very appropriate to be combined with an optimizer for the automated high-level synthesis of radio receivers.

In a mobile connected device, the transmitter and receiver {{are linked to the}} same antenna by means of a duplexer. Duplexer isolation of > 45 dB is considered feasible by the industry. If the duplexer isolation is not sufficient then the handset may experience self-desensitization. Multi-mode, multi-band handsets often have mode- and band-specific duplexers. Duplexer technology affects choice of duplex separation and centre band gap which have been designed for the APT band plan with these considerations in mind.|$|R

40|$|The {{staggering}} {{advances in}} mobile phone industry and wireless technologies {{have led to}} abundance of wireless and cellular standards {{over the past few}} years. Most of the emerging radio standards (such as 4 G LTE and WiMax) require flexible RF transceivers capable of handling various bandwidths and modulation scheme. Meanwhile, the demand by manufacturers for miniaturization, power and cost reduction have compelled further integration of RF transceivers by juxtaposing multiple RF SoC cores on a single silicon die. The prominent challenge in multi-radio chips is blocker interference. Blocker constraint in cellular radios is very stringent, requiring external SAW filters or high performance <b>duplexers.</b> However, SAW <b>filters</b> are bulky and expensive; plus, they reduce the receiver flexibility and degrade the RX sensitivity by a few dB. To circumvent these issues, “true SAW-less ” receivers (by removing the SAW filter at the input of the RX) have been proposed in the literature. To achieve the ultimate flexible and multi-core radio operation, wide-band RX RF front-ends robust against interference, in excess of the requirements usually specified by a radio standard, are required. In this work, a highly selective, very linear LNTA capable of large-signal handling for current-mode RX front-ends is proposed and implemented in 65 -nm CMOS technology.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for high performance and miniature high frequency electronics has motivated {{the development of}} Micro-electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) resonators, {{some of which have}} already become a commercial success for the making of <b>filters,</b> <b>duplexers</b> and oscillators used in radio frequency (RF) front-end systems for portable electronic devices. These MEMS components not only enable size, power and cost reduction with respect to their existing counterparts, but also open exciting opportunities for implementing new functionalities when used in large arrays. Almost all MEMS resonators require interfacing with one or more Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit components or modules in processing raw signals from individual MEMS devices. Hence, these devices should be integrated with CMOS circuits in an efficient and robust way in order to facilitate their deployment in large arrays with minimal parasitics, delay and power losses due to signal routing and CMOS-MEMS interconnects. Among the MEMS resonators developed to date, Aluminum Nitride (AlN) MEMS Contour-Mode Resonators (CMRs) offer high electro-mechanical coupling coefficient (2) and quality factor (Q), and a center frequency (f 0) that can be set lithographically by varying the device in-plane dimensions. Also, AlN MEMS CMRs can be fabricated using state-of-the-art CMOS processes and micromachining techniques. These properties allow the synthesis of multi-frequency band-pass filters (BPFs) on a single chip with a low insertion loss and the capability of direct matching to 50 Ω systems. All these advantages, along with a sufficiently mature fabrication process, make AlN CMRs one of the ideal candidates for pursuing their integration with CMOS technology and implement high performance filters with programming capability. In this work we develop {{for the first time a}} three-dimensional (3 D) heterogeneously integrated AlN MEMS-CMOS platform that enables the realization of such systems as self- healing filters for RF front-ends and programmable filter arrays for cognitive radios.

40|$|Lacking {{inversion}} symmetry in {{the crystal}} structure of LiNbO 3 manifest {{itself as the}} material's strong piezoelectric and converse-piezoelectric effect, pyroelectric effect, electro-optic effect, optical nonlinearity and photorefractive effect. In addition, the material exhibits low acoustic loss, and low optical loss in the infrared range. In this work, I investigated the possibility of combining these properties with the highly versatile micro-fabricated structures on a layer transferred LiNbO 3 thin film platform to achieve novel devices or improve the performance of existing device technologies. First, I focused on components for multi-frequency RF front-end applications. Specifically, I demonstrated LiNbO 3 thin-film contour mode resonators (CMRs) for multi-frequency wide bandwidth RF filters. The resonators exhibit mechanical Q ranging from 1, 000 to over 3, 000, and kt 2 ranging from 4 % to 15 %. The highest kt 2 xQ demonstrated is 194. Along with the high Q and high kt 2, comes with the low motional impedance, which is important for achieve low filter insertion loss. In addition, the resonator frequencies are defined by photolithography, thus enabling devices with different frequencies to be integrated on a single chip. On a single chip, I demonstrated resonators with frequencies ranging from 400 MHz to 2 GHz. As the achievable bandwidth of the filter is ultimately limited by the electro-mechanical coupling factor (kt 2) of the resonators, while the roll-off is determined by resonator quality factor (Q). Therefore, LiNbO 3 thin-film CMR technology shows great potential in achieving filters with wide bandwidth, steep roll-off and low insertion loss. In the meantime, I also investigated low temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) LiTaO 3 thin-film resonators for oscilla- tor applications, another key component for multi-frequency RF front-ends. As LiTaO 3 also exhibits low acoustic loss and strong piezoelectric effect, LiTaO 3 CMRs also have high mechanical Q and kt 2, which is important to achieve low oscillator phase noise, jitter and good power handling capability. With the capability of multi-frequency integration, I demonstrated resonators with frequencies ranging from 500 MHz to 900 MHz and a TCF as low as 16 ppm/K and Q as high as 3200. In addition, these devices exhibit low motional impedance (10 - 20), which {{is important for the}} power handling for oscillator application. While commercial markets demand multi-frequency band-select <b>duplexer</b> and diplexer <b>filters,</b> with fractional bandwidth (BW) ranging from 3 % to 10 %, steep filter roll-off and low insertion loss; components for reconfigurable RF front-ends are actively pursued for defense applications. In this work, frequency programmable RF MEMS resonators for reconfigurable RF front-ends is investigate. Exploiting tip based piezoelectric domain engineering in LiNbO 3 thin film, the mechanical resonance coupled by the electrode transducers can be programmed. Therefore, resonator frequency can be "written" and "erased". Particularly, a 681 MHz resonance peak is "written" on the programmable resonator and "erased". Finally, LiNbO 3 thin-film disk resonators are demonstrated exhibiting intrinsic optical quality factor of 484 k, which is highest demonstrated from thin-film LiNbO 3 resonators to date. Taking advantage of the high quality factor, acousto-optic modulation is demonstrated. As a demonstration of concept, electrical field is applied to the photonic disk resonator through a metal probe, and causes modulation of the optical carrier. A 35 dBm beat note between the optical carrier and the modulated side band was generated from the photodetector. The thin-film LN platform can open up paths to many novel and high performance devices. Presented here are building blocks for RF and photonic applications. Combin- ing mechanical resonators with optical ones, acousto-optic modulator is also demonstrated. In parallel, leveraging piezoelectric domain engineering, reconfigurable RF front-end can also be achieved. Moving forward, other novel devices (chip-scale optical frequency combs, high efficiency chip scale optical frequency doubling and THz generation) can be achieved leveraging other multi-domain coupling properties of LiNbO 3 with the building blocks demonstrated here. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R
