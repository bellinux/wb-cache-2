50|$|Former {{elements}} of Gwambygine Farm {{that have not}} survived the vicissitudes of time and decay due to flooding and earthquake, are the large shed north of the Homestead, the timber-framed building and the air raid shelter between the Homestead and the Pool, the <b>duck</b> <b>yards,</b> parts of the orchard which included olives, pears, figs and pomegranates, the vegetable garden and the jetty into the Pool. The sheep pens and pigsty were removed during the restoration when found {{to be full of}} white ant. The tennis court paved in rammed anthill, hard against the western side of the Homestead, is now open space but no longer suitable for tennis. Some former building onto {{the north side of the}} barn has also disappeared.|$|R
50|$|The teams traded {{scores in}} the first overtime; Arizona started the second OT with the ball and hit a field goal only to watch the <b>Ducks</b> drive 25 <b>yards</b> in four plays for the win.|$|R
5000|$|Although Oregon {{got off to}} {{an early}} 7-3 lead and held that lead for nearly half the game, 22:38, the offense was unable to muster much against an Oklahoma defense that {{recorded}} four sacks (two by junior defensive end C.J. Ah You), held the <b>Ducks</b> to 2.6 <b>yards</b> per carry, and allowed only six third-down conversions in 18 attempts.|$|R
5000|$|Oregon {{has run a}} high-octane, up-tempo spread offense recently, {{causing the}} Ducks to shatter {{offensive}} records. The Ducks have had over 5,000 yards of total offense 17 times, all since 1997. The Ducks have broken the 6000-yard barrier eight times as a team, all since 2007. The <b>Ducks</b> eclipsed 7,000 <b>yards</b> in 2011 and 2013, and topped 8,000 yards in 2014.|$|R
5000|$|In 1859 Richardson, Duck {{took over}} the Rake Kimber yard at Middlesbrough. They built about 11 vessels at Middlesbrough and then sold the yard to Backhouse and Dixon in 1862. In 1870 Richardson, <b>Duck</b> built [...] (<b>yard</b> no. 160) which in 1884 was re-engined with a triple-expansion engine made by Blair & Co of Stockton-on-Tees. In 1893 the company built the German {{merchant}} ship SS Athen.|$|R
50|$|Top {{performances}} are: Justin Roper completing 13 of 18 {{passes for}} 173 yards and 1 touchdown, LeGarrette Blount rushing 132 yards and 2 touchdowns on 18 carries and Jeffrey Maehl completing 4 receptions for 72 yards. During the game, the <b>Ducks</b> had 688 <b>yards</b> of total offense which set {{a school record}} for yards of offense in one game. The previous record was 667 against BYU in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The Wildcats had {{the ball}} to start the second {{overtime}} but gained just 1 yard on three plays. Zendejas gave the UA a 41-38 lead with a 41-yard field goal. It didn't last. Masoli found Dickson on a 23-yard pass on Oregon's first play of the second overtime. The <b>Ducks</b> gained a <b>yard</b> on their next two plays, setting up third-and-goal from the 1. Masoli faked on a lead-option play and ran in the score.|$|R
2500|$|... 1969: With {{the score}} tied at 7 {{and less than}} a minute left, Oregon State placekicker Mike Nehl {{attempted}} a 29-yard field goal to put the Beavers ahead. Nehl had already had one field goal blocked and missed one field goal on the day, and this one was blocked by Oregon's Jim Franklin, hit an official, bounced off the foot of Oregon linebacker Don Graham, and was recovered by Oregon State tight end Bill Plumeau at the <b>Duck</b> 4 <b>yard</b> line. Nehl again came on to try his fourth field goal, and this time, connected on a 21-yard kick to give the Beavers a 10–7 win—the sixth on the way to what would be eight straight OSU Civil War wins. This was the first Civil War game played on artificial turf.|$|R
50|$|Halfway {{through the}} second quarter, Oregon State drove to the Oregon 9 yard line, but kicker Marty Breen missed a 26-yard field goal. A few plays later, the Beavers tackled Oregon punter Kevin Hicks back at the 7 yard line and took {{possession}} deep in Duck territory. On the next play, however, a fumble by Beaver fullback James Terrell was recovered by the Ducks' Ron Johnson. Just before halftime, Oregon's freshman quarterback Miller, who had completed just 1 of 7 passes in the half in his first college start, fumbled on the <b>Duck</b> 31 <b>yard</b> line and the Beavers recovered with four {{seconds left in the}} half. The Beavers attempted a field goal from the spot, but kicker Breen missed his second field goal attempt, this time from 48 yards.|$|R

50|$|As {{the game}} began, the Beavers, though heavy underdogs, seemed {{determined}} {{to end their}} eight-year losing streak and dominated the first half both defensively and offensively. The Beavers held the <b>Ducks</b> to 45 <b>yards</b> and a single pass completion. Oregon did not breach Oregon State's 49 yard-line in the first half. The Beavers opened {{the game with a}} 55-yard drive to the Duck 20, but a fumble by tailback Bryce Oglesby was recovered by Duck defensive tackle Dan Ralph.|$|R
5000|$|The Trojans defense did {{slow down}} the Oregon offense, keeping them 212 yards below their season average, {{allowing}} the USC offense to out-gain the <b>Ducks,</b> 378 <b>yards</b> to 339. [...] The Ducks' senior quarterback, Dennis Dixon, ran for 76 {{yards and a touchdown}} in 17 carries and completed 16 of 25 passes for 157 yards without an interception. However, the Oregon defense ultimately won the game for the Ducks. Sanchez threw for 277 yards and two touchdowns, but also had the two interceptions, including the game-ender. USC Offensive Coordinator Steve Sarkisian's decisions on several key plays were called into question by fans in the week following the game. [...] Eugene's newspaper, The Register-Guard, recorded the crowd noise at 127.2 decibels, making it the loudest crowd for a college football game; 1.2 decibels louder than the 126 decibels made by 77,381 Clemson fans during a game in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Passages from Frd Blackburn Roger's book Montgomery and the Portsmouth {{describe}} the boatload of supplies sent to Fremont."Soon came {{the task of}} loading the Portsmouth's launch with the requisitioned supplies, among which were: [...] "5 Bbls Flour, one dozen pork, one box soap, 2 boxes tobacco, 10 lbs candles, 3 dozen pair stockings, 100 Blue Flannel shirts, one sack coarse salt, one Breaker, 50 lbs Lead, 400 Percussion Caps, 37 <b>yards</b> Russia <b>Duck,</b> 73 <b>yards</b> No. 6 cotton canvas, 4 lbs. twine, one box Medicines, 500 lbs iron.

Russell, a pilot, and [...] "a lawless Frenchman who had crossed the mountains with Capt. Fremont".|$|R
5000|$|The {{temperature}} was 26 degrees with a windchill of 5. There were pockets of ice {{all over the}} field. Oregon took the opening kickoff and drove 69 yards for a 7-0 lead. Three plays later, the Ducks' E.J. Duffy recovered a fumble at the Beaver 32. Four plays later, Oregon lead 14-0. Less than 10 minutes into the game and before attempting a single pass, Gonzales was knocked out with a head injury. Duffy recovered two more first half fumbles in the Duck red zone. The second at Oregon's eight with 1:53 left in the half. The <b>Ducks</b> drove 92 <b>yards</b> in 1:34 to take a 31-0 lead into the locker rooms.|$|R
50|$|In {{their home}} opener the Ducks {{defeated}} the South Dakota Coyotes 62-13 {{in their first}} ever meeting. To open the game the Ducks won the coin toss, elected to receive and marched down the field on a four-play, 74-yard drive lasting 94 seconds, which ended in a 62-yard touchdown pass from Marcus Mariota to Dwyane Stanford, followed by a successful two-point conversion run in by Taylor Alie. This touchdown was Mariota's 78th overall as a Duck, beating Joey Harrington for most career combined touchdowns. The Coyotes responded with a 4 and a half-minute drive which ended in a 47-yard field goal from Miles Bergner. On the next Oregon drive, the <b>Ducks</b> went 63 <b>yards</b> in three plays lasting just over a minute, culminating in a 41-yard touchdown pass from Mariota to Byron Marshall. A two-point conversion was attempted, but nullified due to an illegal formation penalty caused by too many players on the line of scrimmage, putting the game at 14-3. South Dakota was forced to punt on the next possession; the punt was downed at the Oregon 1-yard line, and pushed back an additional 6 yards due to an illegal blocking penalty. The Ducks responded with a 9-play, 97-yard drive finished off with true freshman Royce Freeman scoring his first touchdown as an Oregon Duck.|$|R
50|$|In {{the opening}} five minutes, Oregon State fumbled and Oregon {{recovered}} at the Beaver nine. Three Oregon carries only netted the <b>Ducks</b> seven <b>yards.</b> Oregon went for it, choosing {{to hand the}} ball to Mel Renfro on the left side. Oregon State's Rich Koeper, Paul Seal, and Dan Sieg combined to stop Renfro for no gain. The Beavers took over at their own two. Oregon State got possession again {{late in the first}} quarter, when Espalin intercepted a Bob Berry pass at the Beaver 25 and returned it to the 30. An Oregon personal foul tacked on an additional 15-yards, so Oregon State began the drive at their 45. The Beavers' first two plays only netted two yards, but Baker hit Dan Sieg for 10 to keep the drive alive on third-and-eight. On third-and-10 at the Duck 31, Baker hit Len Frketich for 10 for a first down just outside the 20. On third-and-one at the 11, Bruce Williams rushed for two yards to set up first-and-goal at the nine. As the quarter came to a close, three rushes netted Oregon State six yards. To start the second quarter, the Beavers found themselves on fourth-and-goal at the Oregon three. Baker hit Burke for a three-yard touchdown. Oregon State lined up for the extra point but faked it. Baker completed his pass to Sieg but Sieg fell outside of the end zone. The touchdown catch gave Burke 67 receptions in 1962, the most ever recorded by a college football receiver in a single season. The touchdown was the Beavers' first passing touchdown in the Civil War since 1954, the year before Tommy Prothro began coaching at Oregon State. The touchdown was also only the third passing touchdown that Oregon had allowed all season. The Ducks responded with 17 points in a 10:04 period of the second quarter. Oregon took the kickoff and drove 71 yards on seven plays, 49 on a Berry pass to H.D. Murphy. Berry scampered in from three yards to complete the drive with 11:29 left in the half. Buck Corey kicked the extra point to put the Ducks up 7-6. A little more than seven minutes later, Berry hit Mel Renfro for a 50-yard touchdown pass, to complete a two-play, 56-yard drive. Corey again kicked the extra point to put Oregon up 14-6 with 3:12 left. Jim Sinyard fumbled the ensuing kickoff, which Corey recovered at the Oregon State 27. Three Oregon plays only netted five yards, so Corey came on the field to kick a 38-yard Oregon field goal to put the Ducks up 17-6 at halftime. It was only Corey's second field goal of the year.|$|R
6000|$|After {{that come}} {{memories}} of Sligo, where I {{live with my}} grandparents. I am {{sitting on the ground}} looking at a mastless toy boat, with the paint rubbed and scratched, and I say to myself in great melancholy, [...] "it is further away than it used to be," [...] and while I am saying it I am looking at a long scratch in the stern, for it is especially the scratch which is further away. Then one day at dinner my great-uncle William Middleton says, [...] "we should not make light of the troubles of children. They are worse than ours, because we can see the end of our trouble and they can never see any end," [...] and I feel grateful for I know that I am very unhappy and have often said to myself, [...] "when you grow up, never talk as grown-up people do of the happiness of childhood." [...] I may have already had the night of misery when, having prayed for several days that I might die, I had begun to be afraid that I was dying and prayed that I might live. There was no reason for my unhappiness. Nobody was unkind, and my grandmother has still after so many years my gratitude and my reverence. The house was so big that there was always a room to hide in, and I had a red pony and a garden where I could wander, and there were two dogs to follow at my heels, one white with some black spots on his head and the other with long black hair all over him. I used to think about God and fancy that I was very wicked, and one day when I threw a stone and hit a <b>duck</b> in the <b>yard</b> by mischance and broke its wing, I was full of wonder when I was told that the duck would be cooked for dinner and that I should not be punished.|$|R
50|$|The Holiday Bowl, {{which as}} of 2005 became the second post-season college {{football}} game played at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, {{is considered to}} be part of this group in spite of the fact that the game is not played on New Year's Day, given the bowl's payout of $2,000,000 and the frequency with which highly ranked teams participate. The 2005 edition was the second of two games played on December 29, 2005, with the Big 12's Oklahoma Sooners defeating the Pac-10's Oregon Ducks, 17-14, in a matchup of teams each with something to prove. The Ducks were playing to show that they deserved a BCS bowl bid, having gone 10-1 during the regular season (the only loss coming to the nation's top-ranked team, Southern California), while the Sooners, who had lost in the BCS championship game each of the past two years, were trying to show that they really were the team that came into the season ranked fifth in the USA Today coaches' poll and seventh in the AP writers' poll than the team that lost to Texas by 33. Although Oregon got off to an early 7-3 lead and held that lead for nearly half the game, 22:38, the offense was unable to muster much against an Oklahoma defense that recorded four sacks (two by junior defensive end C.J. Ah You), held the <b>Ducks</b> to 2.6 <b>yards</b> per carry, and allowed only six third-down conversions in 18 attempts. Rotating between Dennis Dixon and Brady Leaf (whose brother, Ryan, was once the quarterback for the San Diego Chargers and played in said stadium) at quarterback, as they had done since losing starter Kellen Clemens earlier in the year, the Ducks gained 244 passing yards on 44 attempts, but much of that came in the fourth quarter as the Sooners defense tired during two extended drives. Oregon managed little success on the ground, with their top rusher, senior Terrence Whitehead, going for only 42 yards. Oklahoma's offense played largely efficiently, gaining 365 yards, with redshirt freshman quarterback Rhett Bomar completing 59 percent of his passes for 229 yards and one touchdown (freshman Malcolm Kelly was the team's top receiver, hauling in seven Bomar throws for 78 yards). Sophomore Adrian Peterson led the way on the ground, accumulating 79 yards on 23 carries. In spite of their general success, Bomar and Peterson each provided Oregon hope, with Bomar's throwing an interception and Peterson's fumbling within a yard of the goal line. The Ducks, trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter, were unable to convert a first-down in the shadow of their own goal posts against the aggressive Sooners defense and thus failed to capitalize on the Peterson turnover. Their defense, though, stymied every Oklahoma drive in the fourth quarter, getting two more possessions for the offense, and Oregon drove 81 yards in 14 plays, with Brady Leaf's hitting Tim Day for a three-yard touchdown. Once more the Sooners offense failed to convert a third-down on their ensuing possession as the Ducks defense tightened, and, behind a resurgent Leaf, Oregon drove to the Oklahoma 19-yard-line before Sooners senior linebacker Clint Ingram intercepted a Leaf pass to seal the victory for the Sooners.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a bright}} sunny day on Sodor, as Thomas chuffs along his branch line with Annie and Clarabel. When he sees Bertie, he decides to have a race with him, but nearly gets into trouble along the way, {{narrowly}} avoiding rail work and nearly having a head-on collision with Toby when he passes a red signal. Bertie believes that he will win, due to him being in first place {{for the majority of}} the race, but his chances of winning become slim when he has to slow down for Oliver the excavator, who is slowly trundling along the small countryside road. Thomas gets the upper hand in the race and Bertie finally gets past Oliver, who takes a shortcut, passing by a familiar man on a bicycle. When Thomas stops at Ffarquhar, he is very pleased with himself for winning, but Annie and Clarabel are not pleased and sternly scold him for racing, but he just ignores their scolding, remarking he has raced on his branch line for years. Bertie arrives at the station, cross that he has lost, remarking that ever since the new branch line's construction site, he has been held-up by construction vehicles. Annie and Clarabel fear their branch line will be closed in favour of the new one, but Thomas dismisses it, saying that his branch line is the most important part of the whole railway and that he will always be the Fat Controller's number 1 engine. Meanwhile, Marion is on her way to the construction yard, fascinated by the enchanted scenery of the forest at Arlesburgh. As she chuffs along, two small engines dart pass her, taking her by surprise. She shuts her eyes and bumps into Toad and Oliver, who are waiting at the ballast chute. A small red engine races up the chute with some hoppers, frightening Marion. Toad introduces Marion to Rex, Mike and Bert, three miniature engines. Marion is interested by the little engines' size, asking if they are real. A cross Mike tells her they are real and that they deliver ballast, wool and passengers for the big railway. Toad and Oliver then leave for the construction yard, just as two black engines race past Marion. At the construction <b>yard,</b> <b>Duck</b> is shunting trucks, just as Donald and Douglas arrive. Duck is delighted to see them, remarking that it has been ages since he has last seen them, but the twins tell him they have only been away to fetch new rails and sleepers for the construction. Meanwhile, Jack and Alfie are getting to work, just as Oliver arrives, apologising for being late as he took a wrong turn. The next morning, Thomas cannot wake up. His fire goes out and there is not enough steam to get him going. Percy, James and Henry all wake him up, reminding him that he needs to shunt Gordon's coaches, but Thomas is in no hurry to do that. Meanwhile, Gordon grumpily waits at Knapford for Thomas, just as he finally arrives. Annie and Clarabel remind Thomas it is time for their first train, but Thomas tells them he has to get Gordon's coaches first, criticising Gordon for being lazy for not getting his own coaches. Gordon tells Thomas that he knows full well that tender engines are too large for shunting, telling him that is what common little tank engines do. Determined to prove Gordon wrong, Thomas decides that he will take the express today and thunders out of the station with the coaches. Unfortunately, due to being behind the coaches, this results in an accident occurring when he fails to slow down, collides with Emily as she tried to stop to avoid being hit and leading to the express coaches coming off the rails.|$|R
