50|$|Since 1993 Roger Oates {{has sold}} Venetian flatweave, {{designed}} and woven in the United Kingdom on specially adapted narrow <b>width</b> <b>looms</b> for floor runners. The heavy woven fabric is fitted onto staircases by trained fitters, {{and can be}} fitted around corners and on winding stairs. The warp is always striped, and so the company produces a variety of stripe designs. A line of tartan fabrics has also been created.|$|R

5000|$|Custom. Custom face-frame {{cabinets}} {{offer more}} {{efficient use of}} space because <b>double</b> <b>width</b> stiles (see above) can be avoided. They also provide far greater flexibility with regard to materials and design. Every aspect of custom cabinetry {{can be made to}} specifications, which makes it both the most desirable and the most expensive choice in the majority of kitchen installations.|$|R

Also, the ground state properties of all the nuclei are also described well. In the low mass region, the obtained nuclei are less bound but stable.

50|$|The Arway was a single-decker {{coach for}} {{suburban}} routes. The bus {{was designed to}} replace the MyWay (original Iveco model) and the Ares (original Renault model), whence came the name Arway. The Arway was equipped with a {{heating and air conditioning}} (HVAC) system, music and announcement system and also, optionallyk, a wheelchair lift. It has two doors, with the central one available in single or <b>double</b> <b>width.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Originally the Jacquard {{machines}} were mechanical, and the fabric design was {{stored in a}} series of punched cards which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the <b>loom</b> <b>width.</b> Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the <b>loom</b> <b>width.</b>|$|R
50|$|To use AMCs in ATCA-systmes {{a special}} carrier card known as hybrid or cutaway carrier is {{required}} to hold one Full-size Module or two Compact-size (see connectors below). Each height is paired with a <b>width,</b> single or <b>double,</b> describing how many carrier slots the board fills. A <b>double</b> <b>width</b> card allows more component space, but does not provide any additional power or bandwidth because it only uses a single connector.|$|R

The rails were 28lbs per yard fish-bellied, procured from the Bedlington Iron Company. They were held in 9lb iron chairs secure to whinstone block sleepers by two iron pegs.

All of these except those that affected font size and spacing were displayed on the screen. Reverse video was an on-screen reminder to the user and was never printed, while the other effects were printed, except on daisy wheel printers.|$|R

40|$|Substrate {{mediated}} ordering and intermolecular {{interactions are}} {{used to create a}} long-range supramolecular network of perylenetetracarboxylic diimide and melamine on a reconstructed Au (111) - (22 × 3) surface. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that the network is composed of a succession of <b>double</b> <b>width</b> honeycomb cell rows separated by a more closely packed row of parallelograms. This periodicity of the supramolecular configuration matches that of the reconstructed gold substrate allowing an epitaxial relationship between network and substrate reconstruction. © 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
