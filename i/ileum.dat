5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to {{some people}} who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (<b>ileum),</b> and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and <b>ileum)</b> where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{action of}} some fibers {{is to reduce}} the reabsorption of bile acids in the <b>ileum</b> and hence the amount and type of bile acid and fats reaching the colon. A reduction in the reabsorption of bile acid from the <b>ileum</b> has several direct effects.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory conditions. Ileitis is an {{inflammation}} of the <b>ileum,</b> colitis is an {{inflammation of}} the large intestine.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} the effects of synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) on strips of guinea pig aorta and on the field-stimulated guinea pig <b>ileum</b> showed that synephrine had an agonist potency of −logKa = 3.75 in the aorta assay. In comparison, {{epinephrine}} had a potency of −logKa = 5.70. There was no significant effect on the <b>ileum</b> at synephrine concentrations up to about 2 × 10−4 M, indicating selectivity for the α1 receptor, but relatively low potency.|$|E
25|$|The {{appendix}} {{is connected}} to the mesentery in the lower region of the <b>ileum,</b> by a short region of the mesocolon known as the mesoappendix.|$|E
25|$|Bile acids may {{be trapped}} within the lumen of the <b>ileum</b> {{either because of}} a high luminal {{viscosity}} or because of binding to a dietary fiber.|$|E
25|$|Meckel's {{diverticulum}} {{is located}} in the distal <b>ileum,</b> usually within 60–100cm (2feet) of the ileocecal valve. This blind segment or small pouch is about 3–6cm (2inch) long and may have a greater lumen diameter than that of the <b>ileum.</b> It runs antimesenterically and has its own blood supply. It is a remnant of the connection from the yolk sac to the small intestine present during embryonic development. It is a true diverticulum, consisting of all 3 layers of the bowel wall which are mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria.|$|E
25|$|A further {{factor is}} an {{increase}} in the bacterial mass and activity of the <b>ileum</b> as some fibers e.g., pectin are digested by bacteria. The bacterial mass increases and cecal bacterial activity increases.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} {{campylobacteriosis}} is tissue {{injury in the}} gut. The sites of tissue injury include the jejunum, the <b>ileum,</b> and the colon. C jejuni appears to achieve this by invading and destroying epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|Lignin {{in fiber}} adsorbs bile acids, but the un{{conjugated}} {{form of the}} bile acids are adsorbed more than the conjugated form. In the <b>ileum</b> where bile acids are primarily absorbed the bile acids are predominantly conjugated.|$|E
25|$|The mesoappendix is {{the portion}} of the {{mesocolon}} connecting the <b>ileum</b> to the appendix. It may extend to the tip of the appendix. It encloses the appendicular artery and vein, as well as lymphatic vessels, nerves, and often a lymph node.|$|E
25|$|The small {{intestine}} {{consists of the}} duodenum, jejunum and <b>ileum.</b> Inflammation of the {{small intestine}} is called enteritis, which if localised to just part is called duodenitis, jejunitis and ileitis, respectively. Peptic ulcers are also common in the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{surgical}} approaches to treat megacolon, {{such as a}} colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining <b>ileum</b> and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and rectum) followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.|$|E
25|$|Jejunum: This is the {{midsection}} of {{the small}} intestine, connecting the duodenum to the <b>ileum.</b> It is about 2.5 m long, and contains the circular folds, and villi that increase its surface area. Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream here.|$|E
25|$|In the duodenum, proteases digest R-proteins {{and release}} their bound B12, which then binds to IF, {{to form a}} complex (IF/B12). B12 must be {{attached}} to IF {{for it to be}} efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal <b>ileum</b> of the small bowel only recognize the B12-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from catabolism by intestinal bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} cobalamin, B12 is an {{essential}} vitamin necessary for normal blood formation. It is also important {{for the maintenance of}} neurological function and psychiatric health. The absorption of B12 into the body requires adequate amounts of intrinsic factor, the glycoprotein produced in the parietal cells of the stomach lining. A functioning small intestine is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin, as absorption occurs within the <b>ileum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because the {{terminal}} <b>ileum</b> {{is the most}} common site of involvement and is the site for vitamin B absorption, people with Crohn's disease are at risk for B deficiency and may need supplementation. In cases with extensive small intestine involvement, the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K may be deficient. Folate deficiency is a risk for patients treated with methotrexate who do not simultaneously receive folate supplementation.|$|E
25|$|Another receptor-oriented {{study by}} Wikberg {{revealed}} that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) {{was a more}} potent agonist at guinea pig aorta α1 receptors (pD2 = 4.81) than at <b>ileum</b> α2 receptors (pD2 = 4.48), with a relative affinity ratio of α2/α1 = 0.10. Although clearly indicating a selectivity of synephrine for α1 receptors, its potency at this receptor sub-class is still relatively low, in comparison with that of phenylephrine (pD2 at α1 = 6.32).|$|E
25|$|The lower {{gastrointestinal}} tract includes {{most of the}} small intestine {{and all of the}} large intestine. In human anatomy, the intestine (bowel, or gut) is the segment of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the anus and, in humans and other mammals, consists of two segments, the small intestine and the large intestine. In humans, the small intestine is further subdivided into the duodenum, jejunum and <b>ileum</b> while the large intestine is subdivided into the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal.|$|E
25|$|Defined as the sodium-dependent proline {{transporter}} not inhibited by alanine, system IMINO, {{believed to}} be formed by the SLC6A20 (SIT1) gene, is a crucial mammalian transport mechanism responsible for both renal reabsorption and intestinal absorption of proline and other imino acids, such as hydroxyproline and pipecolate. The mRNA sequence for SIT1 is expressed in {{a great deal of}} the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, <b>ileum,</b> cecum and colon. It is also found in the kidney, optical choroid, and parts of the central nervous system such the brain and microglial cells.|$|E
25|$|In Meckel's diverticulum, the {{proximal}} part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute, which remains as {{a remnant of}} variable length and location. The solitary diverticulum lies on the antimesenteric border of the <b>ileum</b> (opposite to the mesenteric attachment) and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo. The left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta, and travel with the vitelline duct. The right becomes the superior mesenteric artery that supplies a terminal branch to the diverticulum, while the left involutes. Having its own blood supply, Meckel's diverticulum is susceptible to obstruction or infection.|$|E
25|$|As the vitelline duct {{is made up}} of {{pluripotent}} cell lining, Meckel’s diverticulum may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types. Jejunal, duodenal mucosa or Brunner's tissue were each found in 2% of ectopic cases. Heterotopic rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel's diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, <b>ileum</b> should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} gut {{is suspended}} from the posterior abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the celiac trunk, the midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of development. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the navel. During herniation, the midgut rotates 90° anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves {{to the right and}} the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This rotation occurs at about the eighth week of development. The cranial portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum, while most of the <b>ileum</b> and the caudal part of the loop eventually form the terminal portion of the <b>ileum,</b> the ascending colon and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180° rotation, completing a total of 270° rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the caecum lies close to the liver. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.|$|E
25|$|Flexural anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises {{at the point where}} the <b>ileum</b> is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} is usually a digital rectal examination, to examine {{the tone of the}} {{sphincter}} and to determine if preparation has been adequate. The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon, the cecum), and ultimately the terminal <b>ileum.</b> The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which gives one the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as Indigo carmine) may be sprayed via the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E
25|$|Ileal {{hypertrophy}} {{occurs when}} the circular and longitudinal layers of the ileal intestinal wall hypertrophy, and can also occur with jejunal hypertrophy. The mucosa remains normal, so malabsorption {{is not expected to}} occur in this disease. Ileal hypertrophy may be idiopathic, with current theories for such cases including neural dysfunction within the intestinal wall secondary to parasite migration, and increased tone of the ileocecal valve which leads to hypertrophy of the <b>ileum</b> as it tries to push contents into the cecum. Hypertrophy may also occur secondary to obstruction, especially those that have had surgery for an obstruction that required an anastomosis. Hypertrophy gradually decreases the size of the lumen, resulting in intermittent colic, and in approximately 45% of cases includes weight loss of 1–6 month duration and anorexia. Although rectal examination may display a thickened ileal wall, usually the diagnosis is made at surgery, and an ileocecal or jejunocecal anastomosis is made to allow intestinal contents to bypass the affected area. If surgery and bypass is not performed, there is a risk of rupture, but prognosis is fair with surgical treatment.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{experiments}} on frogs, the Japanese group {{carried out a}} series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also mydriasis followed by miosis, and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06–0.12mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time-dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the hypertension was not inhibited by atropine, but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by atropine pre-treatment. Concentrations of 3-6μg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig <b>ileum</b> which were inhibited by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or chlorpheniramine. Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and sympathomimetic effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of BSE is {{not well}} understood or documented like other diseases of this nature. Even though BSE is a disease that results in neurological defects, its pathogenesis occurs in areas that reside outside of the nervous system. There was a strong deposition of PrPSc initially located in the Ileal Peyer’s patches of the small intestine. The lymphatic system has been identified in the pathogenesis of scrapies, it has not, however, been determined to be {{an essential part of}} the pathogenesis of BSE. The Ileal Peyer’s patches have been the only organ from this system that has been found to play a major role in the pathogenesis. Infectivity of the Ileal Peyer's patches has been observed as early as 4 months after inoculation. PrPSc accumulation was found to occur mostly in tangible body macrophages of the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Tangible body macrophages involved in PrPSc clearance are thought to play a role in PrPSc accumulation in the Peyer’s patches. Accumulation of PrPSc was also found in follicular dendritic cells; however, it was of a lesser degree. Six months after inoculation, there was no infectivity in any tissues, only that of the <b>ileum.</b> This led researchers to believe that the disease agent replicates here. In naturally confirmed cases, there have been no reports of infectivity in the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Generally, in clinical experiments, high doses of the disease are administered. In natural cases, it was hypothesized that low doses of the agent were present, and therefore, infectivity could not be observed.|$|E
25|$|Just {{behind the}} presumed {{position}} of the stomach a very conspicuous large and thick intestine is visible, that {{has been identified as}} the duodenum. It is preserved partly {{in the form of a}} natural endocast, partly as a petrification still showing the cellular structure, including the mucosa and connective tissue. Some mesenteric blood vessels cover the intestine in the form of up to a centimetre long and 0.02 to 0.1 millimetre wide hollow tubes. The duodenum forms a large loop, the descending part of which first is directed downwards towards the gastralia and then runs to the back. There in a sharp bend, the folds of which are clearly visible, it turns to the front, proceeding as an ascending tract, its visible part ending near the stomach. At this point the tract is directed to the left of the body, perpendicular to the fossil slab, and its course can thus no longer be followed. Nearby and slightly above, a subsequent intestine part surfaces that has been interpreted as the jejunum. This thinner intestine turns to the back, running parallel to the ascending tract of the duodenum and ultimately disappearing under it, at the level of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Apparently a loop to the front is made because it resurfaces below the tenth dorsal vertebra, first running upwards and then turning to the back below the hind vertebral column — or at places even over it: probably after death its position partly shifted upwards. The jejunum seems to blend with an exceptionally short <b>ileum.</b> A contraction below the thirteenth dorsal vertebra might indicate the transition to the rectum. A caecum seems absent. The rectum runs to the back between the upper shafts of the pubes and ischia. Then it bends downwards parallel to the ischium shaft, at the end of it turning upwards again. In this final part faeces are still present. The cloaca is lacking. Dal Sasso & Maganuco suggested the cloaca exit was rather low, at the level of the ischial feet and that a rectocoprodaeal valve separated faeces and urine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diverticulum}} {{itself or}} tumour within it may cause intussusception. For example, from the <b>ileum</b> to the colon, causing obstruction. Symptoms of this include [...] "currant jelly" [...] stools and a palpable lump {{in the lower}} abdomen. This occurs when the diverticulum inverts into the lumen of the <b>ileum,</b> due to either: ...|$|E
2500|$|A slowing of {{bile acid}} {{absorption}} in the <b>ileum</b> so bile acids escape {{through to the}} cecum ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{abnormal}} {{connections between}} the bacteria-rich colon and the small bowel can increase the bacterial load in the small bowel. [...] Patients with Crohn's disease or other diseases of the <b>ileum</b> may require surgery that removes the ileocecal valve connecting the small and large bowel; this leads to an increased reflux of bacteria into the small bowel. [...] After bariatric surgery for obesity, {{connections between the}} stomach and the <b>ileum</b> can be formed, which may increase bacterial load in the small bowel.|$|E
2500|$|According to parents, {{onset of}} {{behavioral}} symptoms {{was linked to}} recent (within two weeks) immunization with MMR vaccine in eight of the children diagnosed with developmental disorders. The most consistent report was lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the terminal <b>ileum</b> in nine of the children. [...] This feature has also {{been reported to be}} very common in non-autistic children. [...] A variety of colonic and rectal mucosal features were reported in eight cases. Biopsies of the <b>ileum</b> were reported to have shown reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in seven. [...] Biopsies of the colon were reported to have shown a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate in six.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>ileum</b> is {{the last}} part of the small {{intestine}} that ends in the cecum. Ileal impaction can be caused by obstruction of ingesta. Coastal bermuda hay is associated with impactions in this most aborad (adj. [...] "In a direction away from the mouth".) segment of the small intestine, although it is difficult to separate this risk factor from geographic location, since the southeastern United States has a higher prevalence of ileal impaction and also has regional access to coastal Bermuda hay. Other causes can be obstruction by ascarids (Parascaris equorum), usually occurring at 3–5 months of age right after deworming, and tapeworms (Anoplocephala Perfoliata), which have been associated with up to 81% of ileal impactions (See Ascarids). Horses show intermittent colic, with moderate to severe signs and with time, distended small intestinal loops on rectal. Although most ileal impactions will sometimes pass without intervention, those present for 8–12 hours will cause fluid to back up, leading to gastric reflux, which is seen in approximately 50% of horses that require surgical intervention. Diagnosis is usually made based on clinical signs, presence of reflux, rectal exam, and ultrasound. Often the impaction can not be felt on rectal due to distended small intestinal loops that block the examiner. Those impactions that are unresponsive to medical management, which includes IV fluids and removal of reflux, may be treated using a single injection into the <b>ileum</b> with 1 liter of carboxymethylcellulose, and then massaging the <b>ileum.</b> This allows the impaction to be treated without actually cutting into the <b>ileum.</b> Prognosis for survival is good.|$|E
2500|$|After the B12-haptocorrin {{complexes}} {{pass from}} the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF). [...] These B12-IF complexes {{travel to the}} <b>ileum</b> portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood.|$|E
