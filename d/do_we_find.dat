She writes that [...] "Only in such early works <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> this kind of obvious solution.

500|$|Crime Cutz {{has been}} {{described}} by Lily Moayeri of Under the Radar as an EP that strongly showcases the nu-disco side of the duo. The music of the EP was influenced by records by Russian jazz musicians that were released in the 1970s and 1980s but were never distributed in the duo's home country; these musicians attempted to copy the disco style of American and French acts such as Chic. Frankel, who was sent mp3 files of these tracks by a Russian record dealer on eBay, said that their failure to mimic the style of the popular songs they wanted to recreate due to their different synthesizer sounds is what made the songs unique: [...] "I guess that's kind of what Nick and I <b>do</b> ... <b>We</b> <b>find</b> a sound we like, try to make it and fail, but in the process we make something new." [...] The rhythm of each track was developed first before writing the melodies and lyrics, given that the main goal of the EP was for it to be [...] "instantly rhythmically gratifying", as member Nick Millhiser described. In addition to its disco element, Crime Cutz features exaggerated arrangements and childlike R vocals that gives it a 1980s-esque atmosphere. Consequence of Sound's David Sackllah noted Crime Cutz to be Holy Ghost!'s cleanest-sounding release to date. As for the lyrical content, Frankel wanted the songs' seductive lyrics to be [...] "phonetically fun" [...] as with most other disco records.|$|E

2500|$|David Russell Hulme {{provides}} {{further evidence}} that the music of The Zoo, or {{at least part of}} it, was already in existence before Trial by Jury opened.

[...] Aside from a key change, it is the same tune that Sullivan would use for Carboy's aria in The Zoo, [...] "I loved her fondly." [...] But because Sullivan entered only a bit of the tune in his sketch, Hulme concluded that the composer [...] "needed only a few notes to remind him of his intentions.

2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of... the way you manipulate and distort the documents".|$|E

2500|$|The Kierkegaardian pseudonyms {{who speak}} of stage theory {{consider}} religion {{to be the}} highest stage in human existence. In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called Religiousness A and Religiousness B. One type is symbolized by the Greek philosopher Socrates, whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by {{the realization that the}} individual is sinful and is the source of untruth. [...] In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the paradox that is Jesus, the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox—God, the transcendent, coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason—indeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the Incarnation nor the meaning of human sinfulness. For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> the possibility of offense here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, and by the same token, that man’s sin should be of concern of God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular human phantastically into the human race. It is exactly for this reason that a disbelieving Christianity {{came up with the idea}} that sin is sin, that it is neither here nor there whether it is before God. In other words, it wanted to get rid of the specification ‘before God’, and to that end invented a new wisdom, which nevertheless, curiously enough, was neither more nor less than what the higher wisdom generally is-old paganism. The Sickness Unto Death, Hannay, 1989 p. 115 Admittance is only through the consciousness of sin; to want to enter by any other road is high treason against Christianity. … The simple soul who humbly acknowledges himself to be a sinner, himself personally (the single individual), has no need at all to learn about all the difficulties that come when one is neither simple or humble. … To the extent Christianity, terrifying, will rise up against him and transform itself into madness or horror until he either learns to give up Christianity or-by means of what is anything but scholarly propaedeutics, apologetics, etc., by means of the anguish of a contrite conscience, all in proportion to his need-learns to enter into Christianity by the narrow way, through the consciousness of sin.
