25|$|Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an <b>encryption</b> <b>program</b> that {{provides}} cryptographic {{privacy and authentication}} for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.|$|E
25|$|The {{functionality}} {{of a few}} {{computer programs}} can be hampered by active anti-virus software. For example, TrueCrypt, a disk <b>encryption</b> <b>program,</b> states on its troubleshooting page that anti-virus programs can conflict with TrueCrypt and cause it to malfunction or operate very slowly. Anti-virus software can impair the performance and stability of games running in the Steam platform.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{there were}} several {{challenges}} to US export regulation of cryptography. After the source code for Philip Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) <b>encryption</b> <b>program</b> found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by RSA Security (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI, though no charges were ever filed. Daniel J. Bernstein, then {{a graduate student at}} UC Berkeley, brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds. The 1995 case Bernstein v. United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States Constitution.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of publicly available <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> allow {{the user to}} create virtual encrypted disks {{which can only be}} opened with a designated key. Through the use of modern encryption algorithms and various <b>encryption</b> techniques these <b>programs</b> make the data virtually impossible to read without the designated key.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{one can use}} {{modes of}} {{operation}} specifically designed for disk encryption (see disk encryption theory). This weakness affected many disk <b>encryption</b> <b>programs,</b> including older versions of BestCrypt {{as well as the}} now-deprecated cryptoloop.|$|R
25|$|In June 2015, {{the special}} {{rapporteur}} from the United Nation's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights specifically mentioned Tor {{in the context}} of the debate in the U.S. about allowing so-called backdoors in <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> for law enforcement purposes in an interview for The Washington Post.|$|R

50|$|Most <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> {{have the}} ability to perform a number of {{additional}} functions that make digital forensic efforts increasingly difficult. Some of these functions include the use of a keyfile, full-volume encryption, and plausible deniability. The widespread availability of software containing these functions has put the field of digital forensics at a great disadvantage.|$|R
50|$|A modern {{block cipher}} can be {{run in a}} mode {{similar to that of}} Playfair, where the same block (in Playfair, a pair of letters) always encrypts to the same bit of ciphertext: in our example, CO will always come out as OW. Indeed, many poorly written <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> use just this technique, called Electronic Codebook, or ECB.|$|R
25|$|FreeOTFE is a {{discontinued}} {{open source}} computer program for on-the-fly disk encryption (OTFE). On Microsoft Windows, and Windows Mobile (using FreeOTFE4PDA), it {{can create a}} virtual drive within a file or partition, to which anything written is automatically encrypted before being stored on a computer's hard or USB drive. It is similar in function to other disk <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> including TrueCrypt and Microsoft's BitLocker.|$|R

5000|$|A more {{specialized}} definition of state {{is used in}} some computer programs that operate serially (sequentially) on streams of data, such as parsers, firewalls, communication protocols and <b>encryption</b> <b>programs.</b> Serial programs operate on the incoming data characters or packets sequentially, one at a time. In some of these programs, information about previous data characters or packets received is stored in variables and used to affect the processing of the current character or packet. This is called a [...] "stateful protocol" [...] and the data carried over from the previous processing cycle is called the [...] "state". In others, the program has no information about the previous data stream and starts [...] "fresh" [...] with each data input; {{this is called a}} [...] "stateless protocol".|$|R
5000|$|In May 2014, Recorded Future {{released}} a report called [...] "How Al-Qaeda Uses Encryption Post-Snowden (Part 1)." [...] Part 2 of the report was released on August 1, 2014, supposedly with a strengthened [...] "earlier hypothesis about Snowden leaks influencing Al-Qaeda’s crypto product innovation." [...] On the same day National Public Radio aired Recorded Future claims of [...] "tangible evidence" [...] that Edward Snowden harmed national security by prompting terrorists to develop more sophisticated <b>encryption</b> <b>programs.</b> Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman criticized the NPR report in an article on August 12, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Architecture: What Lessig calls [...] "West Coast Code", {{from the}} {{programming}} {{code of the}} Silicon Valley. These mechanisms concern the parameters of how information can and cannot be transmitted across the Internet. Everything from internet filtering software (which searches for keywords or specific URLs and blocks them before they can even appear on the computer requesting them), to <b>encryption</b> <b>programs,</b> to the very basic architecture of TCP/IP protocols and user interfaces falls within this category of mainly private regulation. It is arguable that all other modes of internet regulation either rely on, or are significantly affected by, West Coast Code.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{a variety}} of {{encryption}} algorithms were proposed to enhance the security of software and systems. Validating whether encryption algorithms are correctly implemented is a challenging issue. Software testing delivers an effective and practical solution, but it also faces the oracle problem (that is, under many practical situations, it is impossible or too computationally expensive {{to know whether the}} output for any given input is correct). In this paper, we propose a property-based approach to testing <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> in the absence of oracles. Our approach makes use of the so-called metamorphic properties of encryption algorithms to generate test cases and verify test results. Two case studies were conducted to illustrate the proposed approach and validate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that even without oracles, the proposed approach can detect nearly 50 % inserted faults with at most three metamorphic relations (MRs) and fifty test cases. © 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

30|$|<b>Encryption</b> <b>programs</b> can be {{implemented}} to cover any harmful wrongdoing that could potentially be exposed {{throughout the course of}} the operation and, as this is being done, a system of hidden messages can be put into place (Paul 2008). Many of these messages range content-wise going so far to include instructions, step-by-step illustrated renderings of how an attack should be carried out, and detailed communicated plans enclosed in a secure network that requires a designated password to access. US Military computers have shown evidence of being a popular and frequent target by attackers. In 1998, cyberterrorists cracked into computers used by the Pentagon, using these methods of attack, and downloaded technical materials sensitive in nature (Lenzner and Vardi 2007). After a federal investigation, the source of the attacks proved to be a Moscow-based series of dial-up connections. The investigation, dubbed Moonlight Maze, was ineffective in catching the attackers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Cloud servers {{are being}} used to store data and {{application}} but its security is a major issue in current context. To solve the data security problems in public environment we propose an effective model for security and integrity of data stored in a cloud, through data segmentation followed by data <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> in a multiple cloud architecture. This architecture forms a multi cloud system where primary cloud is available for multiple users for data storage offering lesser load on client systems thereby using the cloud computing architecture. This architecture introduces a secondary cloud controlled by a single administrator which provides the data backup for primary cloud after undergoing specific segmentation and encryption algorithms to ensure security and integrity of data. The proposed system also offers protection against virus attacks by using linux as the base OS.

40|$|The {{advent of}} easy-to-use <b>encryption</b> <b>programs</b> like Bitlocker for Windows and FileVault for OS X, along with {{increasing}} awareness {{and knowledge of}} cryptography, means that forensic investigators increasingly must deal with strongly encrypted data. Directly attacking strong encryption is generally futile, but all is not lost: there are recent laws in the UK which force computer users {{to give up their}} encryption keys to police as part of an investigation, {{and there are a number}} of techniques that forensic investigators can utilise to try and discover keys or obtain plaintext copies of encrypted data. Additionally, users can become careless and may believe that if they use encryption software they need not take further security precautions. This can potentially make their computer easier to investigate. This report will discuss file and full disk encryption and how they have had positive and negative effects on digital investigations in the past and present...|$|R
