50|$|In chain {{terminator}} sequencing (Sanger sequencing), extension is initiated {{at a specific}} site on the template DNA by using a short oligonucleotide 'primer' complementary to the template at that region. The oligonucleotide primer is extended using a DNA polymerase, an enzyme that replicates DNA. Included with the primer and DNA polymerase are the four deoxynucleotide bases (DNA building blocks), along with a low concentration of a chain terminating nucleotide (most commonly a <b>di-deoxynucleotide).</b> Limited incorporation of the chain terminating nucleotide by the DNA polymerase results {{in a series of}} related DNA fragments that are terminated only at positions where that particular nucleotide is used. The fragments are then size-separated by electrophoresis in a slab polyacrylamide gel, or more commonly now, in a narrow glass tube (capillary) filled with a viscous polymer.An alternative to the labelling of the primer is to label the terminators instead, commonly called 'dye terminator sequencing'. The major advantage of this approach is the complete sequencing set can be performed in a single reaction, rather than the four needed with the labeled-primer approach. This is accomplished by labelling each of the dideoxynucleotide chain-terminators with a separate fluorescent dye, which fluoresces at a different wavelength. This method is easier and quicker than the dye primer approach, but may produce more uneven data peaks (different heights), due to a template dependent difference in the incorporation of the large dye chain-terminators. This problem has been significantly reduced with the introduction of new enzymes and dyes that minimize incorporation variability.This method is now used {{for the vast majority of}} sequencing reactions as it is both simpler and cheaper. The major reason for this is that the primers do not have to be separately labelled (which can be a significant expense for a single-use custom primer), although this is less of a concern with frequently used 'universal' primers. This is changing rapidly due to the increasing cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation systems from Illumina, 454, ABI, Helicos, and Dover.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The p 16 gene, which encodes a {{physiological}} inhibitor of the cyclin D-CDK 4 complex, {{is now considered}} as an important tumour-suppressor gene {{in a variety of}} tumours. A marked reduction of its expression has been reported to occur without significant genetic alterations in human pituitary adenomas, although rare point mutations of uncertain functional significance have been described. On the other hand, p 16 gene silencing due to hypermethylation has been reported in several human primary tumours. The aim {{of this study was to}} further investigate the pathogenetic events leading to p 16 gene inactivation in pituitary tumours. DESIGN: To screen a european series of human pituitary tumours for p 16 gene alterations and possible gene hypermethylation. PATIENTS: A representative series of 31 human pituitary tumours- 30 macroadenomas, including a MEN- 1 non-secreting pituitary adenoma and a non-MEN- 1 familial giant GH-secreting adenoma, and one FSH-secreting pituitary carcinoma-was studied. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis was used to screen for p 16 gene alterations in all cases. Direct sequencing of PCR-products was obtained by the <b>di-deoxynucleotide</b> method where suspected abnormalities of the PCR-SSCP analysis were observed. In 24 samples, a methylation-specific PCR assay (MSP-PCR) was used to determine p 16 gene methylation status. RESULTS: Two sporadic cases of pituitary adenomas had a similar single A to G base substitution leading to an heterozygous Ala 140 Thr p 16 polymorphism, which has not previously been described in such tumours, but is known to be functionally silent. No other p 16 abnormality could be suspected from PCR-SSCP analysis in this series. In contrast, the presence of methylated-specific PCR products was observed in 20 / 24 cases (83. 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that p 16 gene mutations are not involved in the pathogenesis of human pituitary tumours, although polymorphisms can be demonstrated, depending on the population considered. In contrast, the high incidence of hypermethylation of the p 16 gene suggests that such an alteration occurs early in pituitary tumours, and may play a role in pituitary tumorigenesis...|$|E
