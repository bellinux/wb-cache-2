25|$|Also in 1896 Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance was {{released}} as a short kinetoscope film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, {{one of the}} earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risqué films that featured exotic dancers. In the same year, The May Irwin Kiss contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 20-second <b>film</b> <b>loop,</b> with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips ("the mysteries of the kiss revealed"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and pornographic to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. A tableau vivant style is used in short film The Birth of the Pearl (1901) featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.|$|E

50|$|In 1969 Denmark legalized the {{production}} {{of all kinds of}} pornography. In the 1970s CCC began to produce 8 mm pornographic <b>film</b> <b>loops.</b> By the 1980s, video tape had replaced the <b>film</b> <b>loops,</b> sometimes as compilations of previously released material. CCC films usually had a wider range of contents including bestiality, some of which last starred Bodil Joensen, and other content not widely available at the time. Urolagnia was also displayed. By 2004, Color Climax had past film stars such as Rocco Siffredi and John Holmes in their archives on their website.|$|R

50|$|Process, {{commissioned}} by the 25th Music Biennale Zagreb, is based on Orson Welles' film adaption of Franz Kafka's unfinished novel The Trial. The piece is presented by an ensemble of historical media artefacts comprising four mechanical gramophones which play back a pre-recorded consort of viols, the Virginals played with five electromagnets, and two vintage 16mm film projectors connected by a 24 meters long <b>film</b> <b>loop.</b> Both, the audio and visual parts of Process {{are based on a}} text fragment of Kafka's novel, which is translated to a string of binary code.|$|E

Her handmade cinematic effects have been compared to Fernand Léger's Ballet mécanique (1921) or Hans Richter's Ghosts Before Breakfast (1928) and predated the visual technology of MTV and special-effects blockbuster films like Tron.|$|R
40|$|Module 6 {{continues}} with {{the application of}} the concept of developmental stages in your physics teaching. The module concentrates on the analysis of physics texts and <b>film</b> <b>loops,</b> which provide important instructional inputs for students. As you read the excerpts we have selected for your review, keep in mind the characteristics of concrete and formal thought explained in Module 2. Also, remember that all students, regardless of their developmental stage, will find the text easier and will understand a new topic in a more broadly-based way if they can progress gradually from a concrete view of the subject. Of course, some students will progress further than others in grasping all the implications and subtleties contained in their reading. This module includes four text passages, two <b>film</b> <b>loops</b> and a review item to be analyzed for their demand on a student 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning patterns. We have highlighted certain features of these excerpts to indicate what makes a passage more or less accessible to the use of concrete reasoning only. In conclusion, we have listed criteria that you may use to evaluate physics texts or to help you prepare instructional materials of your own...|$|R

50|$|Biograph retaliated {{for being}} frozen {{out of the}} Trust {{agreement}} by purchasing the patent to the Latham <b>film</b> <b>loop,</b> a key feature of virtually all motion picture cameras then in use. Edison sued {{to gain control of}} the patent; however, after a federal court upheld the validity of the patent in 1907, Edison began negotiation with Biograph in May 1908 to reorganize the Edison licensing system. The resulting trust pooled 16 motion picture patents. Ten were considered of minor importance; the remaining key six pertained one each to films, cameras, and the Latham loop, and three to projectors.|$|E
50|$|Until 1997, when he {{represented}} Canada at the Venice Biennale with the <b>film</b> <b>loop</b> Vexation Island, Graham was most {{well known for}} his series of photographs of Welsh oaks seen upside-down. For this project, he employed a photographer to take monochrome pictures of majestic, isolated trees in the English countryside with a large-format camera. He then hung the black-and-white pictures upside down, like camera obscura images. In 1998 Graham produced his definitive work on this theme, a series of seven monumental images of Welsh oaks printed on color paper to produce warm deep sepia and charcoal hues.|$|E
50|$|Pardo's online {{multimedia}} game, {{originally developed}} at the National Film Board {{in the summer of}} 1968, was centered on children playing in teams watching <b>film</b> <b>loops</b> - and based on their personal visual processing, making up questions (and multiple answer choices) to stump other players, who although watching the same imagery, naturally watched them from their personal perspective, history and emotional experience. Exposure to the fact that everyone saw the same visual information differently was a critically important learning process for the children.|$|R

In 2008, Slade exhibited alongside Aaron Carpenter and Steven Hubert in the exhibition titled Hold On at the Or Gallery; her short film [...] "Tugboat" [...] features [...] "a tugboat 'wrapping doughnuts' in Vancouver’s industrial harbour.
