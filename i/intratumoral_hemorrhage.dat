40|$|Abstract We {{report the}} case of a 61 -year-old man with {{supratentorial}} extraventricular anaplastic ependymoma who presented with repeated <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> The patient was admitted with headache. Computed tomogra-phy and magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing mass with <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in the right temporal lobe. Gross total resection was performed. The tumor was well demarcated from the brain tissue, and showed no continuity with the ventricular system. Histopathological examination revealed the features of anaplastic ependy-moma. Therefore, additional radiation therapy and adju-vant chemotherapy were administered. Ten months later, the tumor recurred with hemorrhage in the spinal canal. This case showed rapid malignant progression and repeated <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> within a short period of time, both of which are characteristics of anaplastic ependymomas.

40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} shown that <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is a common finding in {{glioblastoma}} multiforme, but is rarely observed in primary central nervous system lymphoma. Our aim was to reevaluate whether <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> observed on T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 WI) as gross <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and on susceptibilityweighted imaging as intratumoral susceptibility signal can differentiate primary central nervous system lymphoma from glioblastoma multiforme. Patients and methods. A retrospective cohort of brain tumors from August 2008 to March 2013 was searched, and 58 patients (19 with primary central nervous system lymphoma, 39 with glioblastoma multiforme) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Absence of gross <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> was examined on T 2 WI, and an intratumoral susceptibility signal was graded using a 3 -point scale on susceptibility-weighted imaging. Results were compared between primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma multiforme, and values of P < 0. 05 were considered significant. Results. Gross <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> on T 2 WI was absent in 15 patients (79 %) with primary central nervous system lymphoma and 23 patients (59 %) with glioblastoma multiforme.

An 81 -year-old male with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis {{was diagnosed with a}} HCC of 35 mm in diameter in S 5 detected by dynamic computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS). DEB-TACE with DC Bead® and epirubicin hydrochloride was performed because the patient declined to undergo surgical resection. The treatment was completed, and the course after DEB-TACE was favorable. However, right hypochondriac pain suddenly developed about 1 month after DEB-TACE. Unenhanced CT showed an increase of the tumor diameter and intratumoral high-intensity area, which was not enhanced in the arterial phase. CEUS performed at the time of right hypochondriac pain (5 weeks after DEB-TACE) showed nonenhancement of almost the entire tumor in the vascular phase. The cause of the symptom may have been DEB-TACE-associated <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Tumor hemorrhage has been reported after DEB-TACE with tumors > 5 cm in diameter, and the tumor locations were subcapsular in all previous reports.

Tumor specimens of 67 patients surgically treated for a histologically proven unilateral vestibular schwannoma were studied. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were used to determine tumor size and to classify tumors as homogeneous, inhomogeneous, and cystic. Immunohistochemical studies evaluated cell proliferation (histone H 3 and Ki- 67), microvessel density (CD 31), and inflammation (CD 45 and CD 68). <b>Intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> was assessed by hemosiderin deposition.

40|$|Purpose: Although {{hemorrhage}} within pituitary adenomas frequently exacerbates the symptoms, {{there are}} many grades of severity. Moreover, the contributing factors for symptom severity are still controversial. Methods: This retrospective study included 82 patients who underwent transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas with <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> The grades of preoperative symptoms were classified into group A, asymptomatic or minor symptoms; group B, moderate symptoms sufficient for complain; and group C, severe symptoms disturbing daily life. Results: The hemorrhage volume within an adenoma was significantly higher in group C (92. 6 %) than in groups A (48. 6 %) and B (58. 7 %). Both headache and diplopia were dominant in group C, occurring in 72. 2 % and 27. 8 % of the patients, respectively. In group C, {{there was no significant}} difference in frequency between adenoma extensions into the sphenoid sinus (0 %) and involvement of the cavernous sinus of Knosp grade 4 (0 %), and extensions into the suprasellar region were not common (38. 9 %). The most distinctive feature was that “no extrasellar extension” was found only in group C (41. 2 %), and “multidirectional extension” was not detected in this group (0 %). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the most powerful determining factors were the high frequencies of <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and lack of extrasellar and multidirectional extensions. Conclusion: Rapid volume expansion of a hematoma and lack of extension or unidirectional extension might lead to significant compression of the sellar and surrounding structures.

The {{effectiveness}} of As 2 O 3 treatment was studied in 3 carcinoma cell lines, LoVo, OVCAR- 3, and PA- 1, and in cancer cells obtained from ascites fluids of 8 patients with carcinomatosis peritonei. LoVo, OVCAR- 3, and PA- 1 cell lines, and cancer {{cells from the}} patients were cultured in As 2 O 3 gradient media; As 2 O 3 sensitivity was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and by morphologic examination after Wright staining. PA- 1 was the most sensitive cell line to As 2 O 3; OVCAR- 3 and LoVo were resistant to As 2 O 3. Cancer cells from 2 of 8 patients were sensitive to As 2 O 3. The in vivo tumoricidal effect of As 2 O 3 (100 µg/ day, ip) was studied in 30 BALB/c nude mice following ip implantation of PA- 1 tumor cells. The 17 As 2 O 3 -injected mice died of extensive <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> necrosis, and hemorrhagic ascites within 48 hr after initial treatment. In 10 As 2 O 3 -untreated tumor-bearing control mice, only focal <b>intratumoral</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and necrosis were noted. In summary, solid tumor cell lines and cancer cells from patients showed various As 2 O 3 sensitivities in vitro, and As 2 O 3 had a marked tumoricidal effect on PA- 1 cells in vivo. These results suggest that As 2 O 3 treatment might possibly be beneficial in patients with carcinomatosis peritonei who are resistant to conventional therapy and whose tumors show in vitro sensitivity to As 2 O 3. However, to minimize the life-threatening tumor lysis effect, {{it would be better}} to administer As 2 O 3 after removal of the peritoneal tumor masses.
