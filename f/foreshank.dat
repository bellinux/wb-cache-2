40|$|Individual muscles, {{individual}} {{bones and}} fat depots from the non-carcass parts (head, <b>foreshanks</b> and tail) of 40 steers (chilled carcass weight 142 – 174 kg) were studied {{in an attempt}} to predict carcass composition more accurately than in an earlier study where the crude non-carcass parts, head, tongue, <b>foreshanks</b> and hindshanks were used. The technique did not improve the accuracy of prediction of muscle or bone. Carcass fat, which was calculated by difference in the earlier study, was predicted more accurately using intermandibular fat weight (requiring 3 – 4 min to obtain) plus fat thickness at the 12 th rib. However, the accuracy of this prediction (carcass fatness range 14. 0 - 33. 6 %, residual standard deviation 1. 98 %) was no greater than that using chilled side weight plus fat thickness at the 12 th rib. Careful dissection and trimming of anatomical entities from the non-carcass parts therefore offered a slight advantage only in the prediction of carcass components over existing techniques. Substitution of hot side weight for chilled side weight, and sacral crest fat thickness for fat thickness at the 12 th rib did not lead to a loss in the accuracy of prediction of muscle, bone or fat.

40|$|Ninety-five steers {{were used}} to develop a method of {{estimating}} the weights or percentages of the four carcass tissues-muscle, bone, fat and connective tissue-while the carcasses {{were still on the}} slaughter floor. From an investigation of a number of non-carcass parts it was found that three measurements could be used to estimate all four carcass components. The measurements were (a) short-cut tongue weight; (b) <b>foreshanks</b> weight; (c) hot side weight. Simple and multiple regression equations were developed to estimate the weights of muscle, bone and connective tissue in the chilled side, and the accuracy of the estimates was compared with that of recorded prediction methods. The most useful equations employed short-cut tongue weight and hot side weight to estimate total side muscle weight, and <b>foreshanks</b> weight to estimate both total side bone weight and total side connective tissue weight. Fat weight was estimated from hot side weight and the estimates of the weights of the other three carcass components. This technique was more accurate than the Australian Beef Carcase Appraisal System and Butterfield’s equation, both of which use fat thickness measurement at the 10 th rib. When fat thickness measurement was included in regression equations, the estimates of muscle weight and fat weight were slightly improved. Advantages of using the ŉon-carcass parts’ technique are as follows. All four major carcass components are predicted; the carcass components can be recorded as absolute weights or percentages of chilled side weight; chilled side components are predicted whilst the hot side is still on the slaughter floor no commercial loss occurs in carcass, offals or by-products; all measurements used in prediction are weights; and fat thickness measurements may be included in the prediction. The additional information enables producers to make a more critical assessment of the nutritive performance and genetic progress of their herds...|$|R
40|$|Yield of {{saleable}} beef {{was predicted}} in 4 genotypes of bullocks (Hereford, Brahman, Brahman x Hereford and Simmental x Hereford). Simple and multiple regression equations {{were used to}} determine how well 4 fat thickness measurements (12 th rib and rump measurements SC 3 SC 5 and SC 7) individually, with or without the inclusion of hot side weight, <b>foreshanks</b> weight and short cut tongue weight predicted the yields of saleable beef. Each of the 4 fat thickness measurements (alone) predicted percentage yield of saleable beef with low r. s. d. 2 ̆ 7 s at the means. The regression coefficients for the 4 fat thickness measuring sites were negative and significant in the Hereford, Brahman and Brahman x Hereford groups. In the Simmental x Hereford cattle, the regression coefficients for the rump sites (SC 3, SC 5 and SC 7) were positive but significant only in SC 5 which had the lowest r. s. d. (1. 56...|$|R
50|$|Finely chunked cow's trotters and/or other cuts {{with high}} {{collagen}} content, such as cow's head, leather cuts, tail, and pig's head are {{boiled in water}} {{for a long time}}.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in high-throughput genotyping technologies {{have provided the}} opportunity to map genes using associations between complex traits and markers. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on either a single marker or haplotype have identified genetic variants and underlying genetic mechanisms of quantitative traits. Prompted by the achievements of studies examining economic traits in cattle and to verify the consistency of these two methods using real data, {{the current study was}} conducted to construct the haplotype structure in the bovine genome and to detect relevant genes genuinely affecting a carcass trait and a meat quality trait. Using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip, 942 young bulls with genotyping data were introduced as a reference population to identify the genes in the beef cattle genome significantly associated with <b>foreshank</b> weight and triglyceride levels. In total, 92, 553 haplotype blocks were detected in the genome. The regions of high linkage disequilibrium extended up to approximately 200 kb, and the size of haplotype blocks ranged from 22 bp to 199, 266 bp. Additionally, the individual SNP analysis and the haplotype-based analysis detected similar regions and common SNPs for these two representative traits. A total of 12 and 7 SNPs in the bovine genome were significantly associated with <b>foreshank</b> weight and triglyceride levels, respectively. By comparison, 4 and 5 haplotype blocks containing the majority of significant SNPs were strongly associated with <b>foreshank</b> weight and triglyceride levels, respectively. In addition, 36 SNPs with high linkage disequilibrium were detected in the GNAQ gene, a potential hotspo...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} use of {{electromagnetic}} scanning in prediction of lean content in beef carcasses and cuts, 100 beef cattle (60 steers and 40 heifers), representing a broad range in external fat thickness (. 1 to 2. 9 cm) and live weight (414 to 742 kg), were selected. Chilled right sides were divided into streamlined (<b>foreshank,</b> brisket, and ventral plate removed) forequarters (FQ) and full hindquarters (HQ) and scanned. Primal rounds, loins, ribs, and chucks were fabricated from the right side, scanned, and physically separated into lean, fat, and bone. Prediction equations for dissected lean content and percentage of lean included {{the peak of the}} electromagnetic scan response curve (obtained from scanning the HQ or FQ), length, temperature and weight of the scanned cut, and fat thickness at the 12 th rib. Using the coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and Mallows 2 ̆ 7 Cp statistic, the best model for each dependent variable (weight and percentage of lean) that included up to five independent variables was selected.

Later {{at the end of the}} study all males from each group will be slaughter to identify the quality and distribution of carcass components. Results showed that there was no significant difference between the treatment in body weight gain (ADG), as well as the production of carcass and non-carcass. Meanwhile distribution of carcass component (lean, fat and bone) on the forequarter (Neck, Shoulder, Breast, Rack and <b>Foreshank)</b> did not differ among treatments. However, the distribution of the forequarter component on ration D group tended to be higher than those of other rations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of substitution of Cynodon hay with banana plantation residue hay on the carcass characteristics and tissue composition of commercial cuts of feedlot Santa Inês lambs. Twenty-five whole lambs were used, with an average age of five months and an initial live weight of 26. 95 kg (± 1. 5), distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments (1 = 40 % Cynodon spp. hay + 60 % concentrate; 2 = 20 % banana leaf hay + 20 % Cynodon spp. hay + 60 % concentrate; 3 = 40 % banana leaf hay + 60 % concentrate; 4 = 20 % banana pseudostem hay + 20 % Cynodon spp. hay + 60 % concentrate; 5 = 40 % banana pseudostem hay + 60 % concentrate) and five repetitions. The lambs were slaughtered on day 69 of the experiment. The variables evaluated were: live weight without fasting (LWWF), live weight post-fasting (LWPF), morphometric measurements in vivo and postmortem, hot and cold carcass weights (HCW, CCW), hot and cold carcass yield (HCY, CCY), biological performance and weight loss by chilling. The carcasses were divided into eight commercial cuts: neck, shoulder, <b>foreshank</b> and hindshank, breast and flank, loin, leg and rack. The leg, shoulder and loin were dissected into muscle, fat and bone. The animals fed on pseudostem hay showed higher LWWF, LWPF, body length, HCW and CCW; however, the HCY, CCY, morphometric measurements and commercial cut weights and yields were not altered by the treatments. The use of pseudostem hay allows for heavier carcasses; however, the use of coproducts changed the characteristics and carcass yield of the assessed commercial cuts. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Growth performance, carcass {{measurements}} and carcass characteristics of three fat-tailed Turkish breeds (Awassi = A, Morkaraman = M and Tushin = T) weaned at 2. 5 {{months of age}} and subjected to semi-intensive feeding during a grazing period on pasture for 70 days were evaluated. At {{the end of the}} 70 -day grazing period, M lambs showed the highest performance for daily weight gain and the amount of concentrate consumed per bodyweight gain in addition to grazing on pasture. The effects of the breed and sex of lambs on daily weight gain on pasture were significant (P < 0. 05) and highly significant (P < 0. 01), respectively. Male lambs were superior to female lambs with respect to daily weight gain on pasture. The slaughter traits, carcass {{measurements and}} carcass characteristics of 14 male lambs representing three fat-tailed breeds were compared {{at the end of the}} grazing period of the year in which they were born. After slaughter, carcasses were chilled at + 4 ßC for 24 h and measurements were taken on the intact cold carcasses. The carcasses were then dissected into wholesale cuts. The hot carcass weight and hindshank weight of M lambs were heavier than those of A and T lambs. M had a higher hot dressing percentage and larger M. longissimus dorsi (LD) area than those of A and T lambs. Most of the weights of wholesale cuts such as <b>foreshank</b> and breast, sirloin, leg, rib and hindshank were significantly (P < 0. 05; P < 0. 01) affected by sheep breed. It is recommended either that A, M or T male and female lambs weaned at 2. 5 months of age in eastern Turkey should be fed with 450 g concentrate per head per day on pasture for 3 to 3. 5 months of grazing season, or lambs should be supplemented with more than 450 g concentrate feed on pasture because native fat-tailed Turkish breeds supplemented with 450 g concentrate on pastur...|$|E
