Captain Lang possesses an exemplary concept of service, has initiative and talent for improvisation to a large degree, well rooted in the National Socialist ideas.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> Mandarin, {{though he could}} use some help {{speaking}} it; he can also read and write a little. He took a few Mandarin classes while attending Harvard to try to improve. After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a couch in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he slept on the couch of teammate Landry Fields. He relocated to a luxury condo in White Plains, New York, after his Knicks contract became guaranteed.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{sort out}} what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> she must go back home as there is much to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E
60|$|Suleiman-bin-Daoud was wise. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> {{what the}} beasts said, what the birds said, what the fishes said, {{and what the}} insects said. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> what the rocks said deep under the earth when they bowed in towards each other and groaned; and <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> what the trees said when they rustled {{in the middle of}} the morning. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> everything, from the bishop on the bench to the hyssop on the wall, and Balkis, his Head Queen, the Most Beautiful Queen Balkis, was nearly as wise as he was.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't do any good," [...] {{said his}} wife, {{in a tone}} which <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> as well as <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> her words. <b>He</b> turned the mare up to the curbstone.|$|R
60|$|His brother's advice <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> plainly, {{and that}} of his aunt he thought that <b>he</b> <b>understood.</b> But <b>he</b> shook his head again as he told himself that he could not now be guided by either of them.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} and third acts, Ruth seduces a young man named Larry Winston and steals him away from his fiancée. She takes Larry to New York's Chinatown, where she gets him hooked on cocaine and steals an emerald from an idol. She meets another young man, Ned Maddox, whom she seduces and kills for {{insurance}} money, framing another man for the murder. In the final act, Ruth's death and revival is revealed to be a dream John was having. Upon waking <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the importance of the soul; he embraces religion and destroys his life-restoration device.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns later visits Lisa {{and tells}} {{her that he}} sold the {{recycling}} plant for US$120 million to a fish stick company, {{and that he has}} decided to give her, being his advisor, a 10% share of the profits. Lisa refuses the money and rips up the cheque. This causes Homer to have four simultaneous heart attacks. While in the hospital, Lisa apologizes to Homer for not accepting the money. He tells her that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> what she did, but says that the $12,000 would have been a big financial help. Lisa replies that 10% of $120 million is actually $12 million. The hospital's public address system announces a code blue, signifying that Homer has entered cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Rex {{learns that}} he will have to undergo surgery {{following}} his heart attack. Before the operation, Rex's doctor suggests that Bree may have been poisoning him, citing their marital issues as a possible motive. Rex writes a note informing Bree that <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> and forgives her and dies soon after. During Carlos's trial, John informs Carlos that he had been having an affair with Gabrielle, sending Carlos into a violent outburst in the courthouse. Elsewhere, Lynette learns that Tom has quit his job as a result of Lynette's betrayal. He then decides that she will go back to work and he will be a stay-at-home father.|$|E
6000|$|... "God help me!" [...] he said. For the thorns {{were similar}} to those the Dyaks poison and use in their blowing-tubes. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> now what Chang-hi's {{assurance}} of the safety of his treasure meant. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> that grin now.|$|R
50|$|But {{after meeting}} Dixit, that all changed {{and she says}} she learned to love again. “But in Alok, I couldn't have found anyone better. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> the kind of pain I was in. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> what I had been going through".|$|R
60|$|Spike {{was only}} great in a crisis, and then {{merely as a}} seaman. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> his calling to its minuti, and <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the Molly Swash better than <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> any other craft that floated. For {{more than twenty years}} had he sailed her, and the careful parent does not better {{understand}} the humours of the child, than <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> exactly what might be expected from his brig. His satisfaction sensibly increased, therefore, as she stole along the land, toward the angle mentioned, without a sound audible but the gentle gurgling of the water, stirred by the stem, and which sounded like the ripple of the gentlest wave, as it washes the shingle of some placid beach.|$|R
5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> as a way political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E
5|$|As a {{teenager}} John proves his worth and is gradually granted positions of authority, first as Master of the Falcons, then as Lord Warden of the East Marches and Constable of England. He takes all three positions seriously, devoting {{himself to the}} acquirement of knowledge necessary for effective administration. He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and wisely gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> that his administrative skill is more useful than acting as a soldier, and earns the respect of the people under his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{wants to}} spend time with his girlfriend, Elisa (Salma Hayek), but her job as a nurse does not allow it. While taking care of an elderly man named Mr. Templeton (George Bartenieff), who suffers from dementia, Jack persuades her {{to spend time with}} him, to which Elisa gives in to, and results in the two {{bringing}} Mr. Templeton along on their dates. One day, as they prepare to go out again, Jack and Elisa are shocked when Mr. Templeton's son, Michael (Scott Bryce), visits unexpectedly. The elderly man tells his son about the late night escapades, though Elisa tells the son that his story is not true. As Elisa distracts the son, Jack tries to leave the apartment, until Mr. Templeton sees him. Jack explains his situation with Elisa to Mr. Templeton, which <b>he</b> <b>understands,</b> and promises Jack he will not tell his son anything more of the late nights.|$|E
60|$|Even good Mr. Brinsmade {{smiled at}} the slip she had nearly made. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> the girl, and admired her. <b>He</b> also <b>understood</b> Mrs. Colfax.|$|R
60|$|A vast relief {{rolled over}} Bill. Despite his instinct, {{he had been}} wavering. But now <b>he</b> <b>understood.</b> <b>He</b> had found the clue.|$|R

5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
25|$|Sam is the protagonist, {{suggests}} Carl Rollyson, because <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> {{more than}} those around him how he is flawed and inauthentic.|$|E
25|$|Verb meaning: when a pre-school child {{hears the}} verb 'fill', <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> {{it as the}} action 'pour' rather than the result, which is 'make full'.|$|E

60|$|The Irish {{volunteer}} {{nodded to}} show that <b>he</b> <b>understood.</b> <b>He</b> was holding his gun before him, ready to shoot whenever it appeared necessary.|$|R
60|$|He {{was seldom}} so undecided, but Osborne thought <b>he</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|R
25|$|The seeress then reveals to Odin {{that she}} knows {{some of his own}} secrets, and that he sacrificed an eye in pursuit of knowledge. She tells him she knows where his eye is hidden and how he gave it up in {{exchange}} for knowledge. She asks him in several refrains if <b>he</b> <b>understands,</b> or if he would like to hear more.|$|E
25|$|After Leo's arrest, Kira finds Andrei {{preparing}} for a speech to a Communist Party meeting. She declares she is proud that she did what was necessary to save Leo's life, and she expresses contempt for the Communist ideology that would have let him die. Andrei says <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> and accepts responsibility for making her suffer. When she leaves, Andrei confronts Syerov and insists that he use his influence to secure Leo's release. When Andrei gives his speech, he deviates from his prepared remarks to speak in favor of freedom and individualism.|$|E
25|$|Kishore dwells {{into the}} {{character}} of Sivadas a sorry father for not sparing time to his family, when it mattered most and tries to understand his son's problem step by step. <b>He</b> <b>understands</b> the fact that Autism is not a disease to brood over, it just needs the extra affection and care rather than feeling sympathetic. Over {{a period of time}} the bonding between the teacher and the student blossoms like a bright sunflower. Does the father succeed in lodging a room in his son's imagination, what happens forms the rest of the play.|$|E
60|$|He {{had little}} {{curiosity about the}} young stranger. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> <b>he</b> was to teach the school, {{and he did not}} go further in inquiry.|$|R
60|$|Professor Binstead clicked {{his tongue}} sympathetically. <b>He</b> <b>understood</b> his friend's warmth.|$|R

25|$|At {{least in}} regards to the One, Michael Erler concludes from a {{statement}} in the Republic that Plato held it was only intuitively knowable. In contrast, Peter Stemmer, Kurt von Fritz, Jürgen Villers, and others oppose any independent role for non-verbal intuition. Jens Halfwassen believes that knowledge of the realm of the Forms rests centrally upon direct intuition, which <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> as unmediated comprehension by some non-sensory, 'inner perception' (Ger., Anschauung). He also, however, holds that Plato's highest principle transcended knowledge and was thus inaccessible to such intuition. For Plato, the One would therefore make knowledge possible and give it the power of knowing things, but would itself remain unknowable and ineffable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} book, Voldemort seeks the wand {{in order to}} defeat Harry – his {{previous}} wands having failed – and breaks into Dumbledore's tomb to claim the wand as his own. During the Battle of Hogwarts, <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> that the wand is not performing for him as legend says it should, and mistakenly concludes this is because it had become loyal to Snape when Snape killed Dumbledore, and would only become loyal to him upon his killing of Snape. He therefore kills Snape, and believes the wand will thereafter serve him and be unbeatable, but during his final duel with Harry his Killing Curse rebounds and he dies – as Harry had warned him – since the Elder Wand will not allow itself {{to be used by}} him against its true master.|$|E
25|$|After World War II ended, and the Republic of China {{took over}} Taiwan, Lee {{enrolled}} in the National Taiwan University, where in 1948 he earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural science. Lee joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) for two stints, in September 1946 and October or November 1947, both times briefly. Lee began the New Democracy Association with four others. This group was absorbed by the CPC, and Lee officially left the party in September 1948. In a 2002 interview Lee himself {{admitted that he had}} been a Communist. In that same interview Lee said that he has strongly opposed Communism for a long time because <b>he</b> <b>understands</b> the theory well and knows that it is doomed to fail. Lee stated that he joined the Communists out of hatred for the KMT.|$|E
