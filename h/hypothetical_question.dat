[...] He also described the “back-of-the-envelope” estimate by Bush Economic Advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey that it would cost $100 to $200 billion as much too high. Two days later, after the New Years Holiday, an OMB spokesperson clarified Daniels’ remarks, adding that the $50 to $60 billion figure was not a hard White House estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost.

However, post-test respondents indicated that their behavior will not change based on responding to <b>hypothetical</b> <b>questions,</b> suggesting that the contaminative effects of such questions are probably unconscious and uncontrollable. We explore several moderating influences on this effect, including both processing capacity and the importance of the attributes that are the focus of <b>hypothetical</b> <b>questions.</b> Interestingly, we find that an increase in cognitive elaboration essentially increases the contam [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Eternal return" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "eternal recurrence") is a {{hypothetical}} concept that posits {{that the universe}} has been recurring, {{and will continue to}} recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely physical concept, involving no supernatural reincarnation, but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of The Gay Science, and also in the chapter [...] "Of the Vision and the Riddle" [...] in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, among other places. Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially [...] "horrifying and paralyzing," [...] and says that its burden is the [...] "heaviest weight" [...] imaginable ("das schwerste Gewicht"). The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to Schopenhauer's praise of denying the will‐to‐live. To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires amor fati, [...] "love of fate". As Heidegger points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>question</b> rather than postulating it as a fact. [...] According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the question of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: [...] "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [...] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' {{is at the same time}} 'the most burdensome thought.'" ...|$|E

[...] Were it not for this sacred attention to separate jurisdictions, he might have been a tolerable judge of the fact,--just as good a judge as Mr. Hastings: for neither of them knew it any other way, as it appears afterwards, but by rumor and reports,--reports, I believe, of Mr. Hastings's own raising; for I do not know that Sir Elijah Impey {{had anything to do with}} them.|$|E

60|$|Here biology {{next steps}} in, with its splendid {{explanation}} of organic life, as due essentially to the secondary action of radiated solar energy {{on the outer}} crust of such a cooling and evolving planet. Falling on {{the cells of the}} simplest green plants, the potent sunlight dissociates the carbon from the oxygen in the carbonic acid floating in the atmosphere, and builds it up with the hydrogen of water in the tissues of the organism into starches and other organic products, which differ from the inert substances around them, mainly by the possession of locked-up solar energy. On the energy-yielding food-stuffs thus stored up the animal in turn feeds and battens, reducing what was before potential into actual motion, just as the steam-engine reduces the latent solar energy of coal into visible heat and visible movement in its furnace and its machinery. How the first organism came to exist biology has not yet been able fully to explain for us; but aided by chemical science it has been able to show us in part how some of the simpler organic bodies may have been originally built up, and it does not despair of showing us in the end how the earliest organism may actually have been produced from the prime elements of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon. Into this most fundamental of biological problems, however, Darwin himself, with his constitutional caution and dread of speculative theorising, was not careful or curious to enter. Even upon the far less abstruse and <b>hypothetical</b> <b>question,</b> whether all life took its prime origin from a single starting-point or from several distinct and separate tribal ancestors, he hardly cared so much as to hazard a passing speculation. With splendid self-restraint he confined his attention almost entirely to the more manageable and practical problem of the origin of species by natural selection, which lay then and there open for solution before him. Taking for granted the existence of the original organism or group of organisms, the fact of reproduction, and the tendency of such reproduction to beget increase in a geometrical ratio, he deduced from these elementary given factors the necessary corollary of survival of the fittest, with all its marvellous and far-reaching implications of adaptation to the environment and specific distinctions. By doing so, he rendered conceivable the mechanism of evolution in the organic world, thus bringing another great aspect of external nature within the range of the developmental as opposed to the miraculous philosophy of the cosmos.|$|E
