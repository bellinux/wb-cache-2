Double-stranded breakages are especially damaging {{and hard to}} repair, producing translocation and deletion of part of a chromosome. Alkylating agents like mustard gas may also cause breakages in the DNA backbone. Oxidative stress may also generate <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> oxygen species that can damage DNA.

40|$|Late-metal nitrido {{complexes}} are <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> {{structures that}} participate in important synthetic reactions, such as C?H amination. The intrinsic reactivity of these complexes renders them challenging to directly characterize. 1 With {{the goal of}} utilizing late-metal nitrido complexes to oxidize small hydrocarbons, such as methane, characterization of related, <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> metal?ligand multiply bonded complexes is essential. We are interested in using photocrystallography to characterize reactive structures. In this experiment, the <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> complex of interest is generated from a stable metal azide precursor solid-state photolysis. With the use of solid-state photolysis, the <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> nitrido complex will essentially be stuck in its crystalline state and allow for characterization. We anticipate that this technique may allow for the direct characterization of these late-metal nitridos...|$|R
40|$|<b>Highly</b> <b>reactive</b> calcium was {{prepared}} by the lithium biphenylide reduction of calcium(II) halides, especially calcium(II) iodide in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. This <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> calcium oxidatively adds {{to a variety of}} halogen-containing cross-linked polystyrene resins such as p-bromopolystyrene, p-chloropolystyrene, p-fluoropolystyrene, and chloromethylated polystyrene to prepare the corresponding polymeric organocalcium reagents. These organocalcium reagents react with a variety of electrophiles to yield functionalized polystyrene resins. Transmetallation with CuCN· 2 LiBr yields calcium cuprate reagents which react with acid chlorides to form ketones, undergo cross-coupling reactions with halides containing functionality, and add via 1, 4 -conjugate addition to 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one. Bifunctionalization of the polymer can be achieved by the addition of <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> calcium to a functionalized polymer containing a halogen. ^ <b>Highly</b> <b>reactive</b> copper {{was prepared}} by the lithium naphthalenide reductions of various copper(I) salt/ligand complexes in tetrahydrofuran. A majority of the research involved the reduction of a CuI·PBu 3 complex to prepare the <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> copper and its subsequent addition to cross-linked p-bromopolystyrene of varying degrees of functionalization (DF = 0. 31 and DF = 0. 98). These insoluble, polymeric oragnocopper reagents reacted with a variety of electrophiles including substituted benzyl chlorides to prepare functionalized polymers. Bifunctionalization of the polymer can be achieved by the addition of <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> copper to a functionalized polymer containing a halogen. Other forms of <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> copper were reacted with p-bromopolystyrene as well as other halogenated polystyrene resins in an attempt to functionalize polystyrene resins. ^ A polymer-supported triphenylphosphine copper(I) iodide complex was prepared and reduced with lithium naphthalenide in tetrahydrofuran to produce <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> copper contained in a polymer. This <b>highly</b> <b>reactive</b> copper contained in a polymer oxidatively adds to a variety of organic halides containing functionality to prepare polymer-supported organocopper reagents. These functionalized organocopper reagents can undergo cross-coupling reactions with acid chlorides to form ketones, react with other organic substrates, and intramolecularly open epoxides. In addition, the reaction pathway can be followed by solid-state 31 P NMR of the phosphorus-containing polymers. ...|$|R
