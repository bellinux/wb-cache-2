40|$|The paper {{reports a}} basic {{experiment}} on the option pricing approach. Each trader with an increasing utility for money values the option with its arbitrage <b>free</b> <b>price,</b> which {{is independent of}} the probability of the stock movement. The experimental data show that the traders learn to exploit more arbitrage as they gain experience, however, they value the option by a probability dependent price. This price {{can best be described}} by the discounted expected payoff of the option, damped for high probability values. Nevertheless, there are hints for a learning towards the arbitrage <b>free</b> <b>price,</b> driven by the expected payoff maximization. (orig.)

This paper examines the adjustment mechanisms of administered prices and the main factors behind their behavior. We stress the structural changes in tariffs occurred in privatized sectors, the backward-looking behavior of administered prices, the exchange rate pass-through to these prices, the trajectory of international oil prices and {{the differences between the}} general price indexes and the consumer price indexes. Using a simple regression, we identify the general price index known as IGP-DI as the most important factor to explain the different behavior of <b>free</b> <b>prices</b> and administered prices. We also estimate a Taylor Rule for the Central Bank and simulate a trajectory for the Selic interest rate, and conclude that monetary policy, aiming at fighting the secondary effects of administered prices shocks, has been negatively affected by the behavior of these prices. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} pricing {{derivatives}} securities such as stock options in incomplete financial markets. The {{goal is to}} determine arbitrage <b>free</b> <b>prices</b> for these securities. For this we consider a finite state, discrete time stochastic model of a financial market known as the finite market model. We restrict our attention to derivatives securities known as European contingent claims, those {{that can only be}} exercised on the expiration date. In the early chapters, we define the model precisely and also summarize the pricing theory for complete markets. In this case, it turns out that there is a unique way to price arbitrage freely. This unique price can be computed as a certain conditional expected value under the associated equivalent martingale measure. The larger goal of this thesis is to give a thorough exposition of the pricing theory for incomplete markets. We will show that in these markets, arbitrage <b>free</b> <b>prices</b> exist, but unique pricing cannot always be obtained. When a particular price is not unique, there is an open interval over which the price can vary freely. The left (resp. right) end points of this interval can be characterized as an infimum (resp. a supremum) of a certain conditional expected value over the set of associated equivalent martingale measures.

We derive the corresponding Equiv-alent European Payoff and use it to price a simple lease contract of fixed maturity. The solution can be expressed as a portfolio of simple power binaries. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the coexistence of <b>free</b> <b>prices</b> and shortages {{for a range}} of consumer goods in Ukraine during 1992. Enterprises making consumer goods were substantially free to set market-clearing prices. Yet, Ukraine’s official consumer market experienced continued shortages, while the same goods traded at higher prices in parallel markets. The paper advances a model of enterprise behavior in an environment of central allocation of inputs at preferential prices. We show that central allocation of key inputs according to perceived “need” creates incentives for excess demand to be perpetuated despite formal price liberalization. The analysis brings forth the importance of abolishing allocation mechanisms for price liberalization to bring its full efficiency effects. ...|$|E
