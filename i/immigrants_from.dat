5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E

5|$|Youngstown's {{industrial}} development {{changed the face}} of the Mahoning Valley. The community's burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Wales, Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Eastern Europe, Italy, and Greece. In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> non-European countries including what is modern day Lebanon, Palestine/Israel, and Syria. By the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of Ku Klux Klan activity. The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and Italian and Irish Americans in neighboring Niles led Ohio Governor A. Victor Donahey to declare martial law. By 1928 the Klan was in steep decline; and three years later, the organization sold its Canfield, Ohio, meeting area, Kountry Klub Field.|$|E
5|$|As Philadelphia became industrialized, <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> England, Ireland, and Germany {{settled in}} the city and the {{surrounding}} districts. The potato famine was just underway causing emigration from Ireland. In the areas the immigrants settled, tensions that resulted from religious, economic and cultural differences grew between residents. The majority of immigrants coming to Philadelphia were Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of European colonists and explorers, First Nations {{followed}} {{a wide array of}} mostly animistic religions. During the colonial period, the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically Latin Rite Roman Catholics, including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting indigenous peoples; an effort that eventually proved successful. The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after the British conquest of New France, followed by American Protestant settlers displaced by the American Revolution. The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of a substantive shift in Canadian immigration patterns. Large numbers of Irish and southern European immigrants were creating new Roman Catholic communities in English Canada. The settlement of the west brought significant Eastern Orthodox <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> the United States.|$|E

Although traditionally a Salvadoran and Mexican neighborhood, many immigrants have began coming from different Latin-American countries, particularly from Venezuela, Honduras, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guatemala and Colombia.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{have been}} {{discovered}} in several European countries, {{as well as in}} North America and Australia.

5|$|In 1921, the Hashemite emir {{and later}} king, Abdullah I, {{designated}} Amman instead of al-Salt {{to be the}} capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as {{the capital of the}} country attracted <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{growth of}} the city began in 1991, with the massive arrival of <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union and Ethiopia and {{infrastructure}} development.

5|$|The caste {{structure}} of the majority Sinhalese has also accommodated Hindu <b>immigrants</b> <b>from</b> South India since the 13th century CE.
