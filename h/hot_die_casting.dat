40|$|Pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is an {{important}} production process. In pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> the ® rst setting of process parameters is established through guess work. Experts use their previous experience and knowledge to develop a solution for a new application. Due to rapid expansion in the <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process to produce better quality products {{in a short period}} of time, there is ever increasing demand to replace the time-consuming and expert-reliant traditional trial and error methods of establishing process parameters. A neural network system is developed to generate the process parameters for the pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process. The system aims to replace the existing high-cost, time-consuming and expertdependent trial and error approach for determining the process parameters. The scope of this work includes analysing a physical model of the pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> ® lling stage based on governing equations of die cavity ® lling and the collection of feasible casting data for the training of the network. The training data were generated by using ZN-DA 3 material on a <b>hot</b> chamber <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> machine with a plunger diameter of 60 mm. The present network was developed using the MATLAB application toolbox. In this work, the neural network was developed by comparing three di€ erent training algorithms: i. e. error backpropagation algorithm; momentum and adaptive learning algorithm; and Levenberg± Marquardt approximation algorithm. It was found that the Levenberg± Marquardt approximation algorithm was the preferred method for this application as it reduced the sum-squared error to a small value. The accuracy of the developed network was tested by comparing the data generated fromthe network with those of an expert froma local <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> industry. It was established that by using this network the selection of process parameters becomes much easier, so that it can be used by a novice user without prior knowledge of the <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process or optimization techniques. 1. Introduction Pressure <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is {{an important}} production process that is extensively used to produce castings for the electrical, electronic and automobile industries. The process has its origins in type casting machines developed in 1822.

In 1894, the ® rst <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> machine was developed, in which molten metal was forced through an inclined port and out of the nozzle into the die by the central ram actuated by a lever.

5000|$|Johnny Lightning is a {{brand of}} model cars {{originally}} produced by Topper Toys, similar to the hugely successful Mattel <b>Hot</b> Wheels <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> racing cars.

Topper closed in 1971 and production of Johnny Lightning cars ceased for 23 years. In 2003 Thomas Lowe secured the trademark rights to the Johnny Lightning name for his Playing Mantis company. Playing Mantis produced toy cars under the Johnny Lightning brand name from 1994 to June 2004.

Thermal fatigue is believed {{to be one of the}} most common failure mechanisms in hot forming tools. In this thesis tools used in <b>hot</b> forging and <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> were examined to determine damage, material response, thermal fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Different chromium martensitic hot-work tool steels, heat treated at four different austenitizing temperatures were experimentally tested in thermal fatigue and isothermal fatigue. The materials were then evaluated using X-ray line broadening analysis and transmission electron microscopy to explore the relation between fatigue softening and the change in microstructure. The high temperature fatigue softening was also simulated using an elasto-plastic, non-linear kinematic and isotropic model. The model was implemented in a numerical simulation to support the integration of die design, tool steel properties and its use. It was found that the dominant damage mechanisms in the investigated tools were thermal fatigue and that tool material experiences a three stage softening at high temperature loading. The primary stage was concluded to be influenced by the dislocation density and the second stage by the temper resistance i. e. carbide morphology. The microstructural changes during the softening stages were also connected to the non-linear kinematic and isotropic model.
