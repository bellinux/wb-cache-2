5|$|In Western Europe, some of {{the older}} Roman elite {{families}} died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs. Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) <b>dreamed</b> <b>that</b> God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.|$|E

He has an older sister, Mary, born in Scotland in 1939 and an older brother, Robert junior, born in 1951.

25|$|In 1783 Virginia {{organized}} {{the government of}} Kentucky and Floyd was appointed {{to be one of}} the first two judges of Kentucky.

This proved true as a month later Floyd was wounded on April 8, 1783 by Indians while on his way to Bullitt's Lick while wearing the scarlet coat he had brought from Paris. He died of his injuries on April 10, 1783. His widow Jane preserved the scarlet coat until 1812 when the coat was buried with her, as she had requested. Floyd is buried near Floyd's Station at Breckinridge Cemetery.|$|E

500|$|Several legends {{surround}} Alexander's {{birth and}} childhood. According {{to the ancient}} Greek biographer Plutarch, {{on the eve of}} the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias <b>dreamed</b> <b>that</b> her womb was struck by a thunder bolt that caused a flame to spread [...] "far and wide" [...] before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image. Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.|$|E

For the Series, Doby hit [...]372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering {{a career in the}} MLB, Doby said, [...] "I never <b>dreamed</b> <b>that</b> far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have thought that that was the way it was going to be. There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in '46." ...|$|E

500|$|Ron {{became more}} heavily {{involved}} in Parks and Recreation storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur {{with the development of}} the character. Schur has described Offerman as a [...] "once-in-a-generation comedic performer," [...] and [...] "our cast MVP, and in many ways our cast leader." [...] He compared Ron to a [...] "19th-century rugged individualist," [...] and said of creating the character, [...] "A lot of the credit has to go to Nick Offerman. In real life, he's an incredibly interesting guy, and at the very least, it's much easier to play an interesting guy when you're an interesting guy." [...] Offerman said his own sense of humor fuels much of the character, along with those of Schur, Greg Daniels, and the writing staff; he added: [...] "I never <b>dreamed</b> <b>that</b> I could prosper with my perverse sense of humor on a network show." [...] Schur said the staff liked writing for Ron because [...] "he's a great mix of a superhero, and also a deeply flawed, and very human and vulnerable person." ...|$|E

He went back to sleep and <b>dreamed</b> <b>that</b> seven good ears of corn came up on one stalk, and then seven thin ears sprung up after them and {{swallowed}} the good ears, and Pharaoh again awoke. In the morning, Pharaoh was troubled and sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt and told them his dream, but none could interpret it. Then the chief butler spoke up, confessing his faults and relating how Pharaoh had put him in prison with the baker, and a Hebrew there had interpreted their dreams, correctly predicting the future. Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who shaved, changed clothes, and came to Pharaoh. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
