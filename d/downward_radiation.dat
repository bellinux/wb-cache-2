This paper presents a machine learning approach in the form of a random forest (RF) model for estimating daily <b>downward</b> solar <b>radiation</b> flux at the land surface over complex terrain using MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing data. The model-building technique makes use of a unique network of 16 solar flux measurements in the semi-arid Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and Critical Zone Observatory, in southwest Idaho, USA. Based on a composite RF model built on daily observations from all 16 sites in the watershed, the model simulation of <b>downward</b> solar <b>radiation</b> matches well with the observation data (r 2 = 0. 96). To evaluate model performance, RF models were built from 12 of 16 sites selected at random and validated against the observations at the remaining four sites. Overall root mean square errors (RMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) are small (range: 37. 17 W/m 2 - 81. 27 W/m 2, - 48. 31 W/m 2 - 15. 67 W/m 2, and 26. 56 W/m 2 - 63. 77 W/m 2, respectively). When extrapolated to the entire watershed, spatiotemporal patterns of solar flux are largely consistent with expected trends in this watershed. We also explored significant predictors of downward solar flux in order to reveal important properties and processes controlling <b>downward</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> Based on the composite RF model built on all 16 sites, the three most important predictors to estimate <b>downward</b> solar <b>radiation</b> include the black sky albedo (BSA) near infrared band (0. 858 μm), BSA visible band (0. 3 - 0. 7 μm), and clear day coverage.

We have studied the effect of clouds on the surface radiation budget and {{have found that the}} long wave (LW) greenhouse effect of clouds exceeded the short wave (SW) albedo effect of clouds, so that net (SW+LW) cloud-radiative forcing {{on the snow}} surface was heating. The heating mechanism is explained as follows : (1) Short wave : The downward short wave radiation on a cloudy day is only slightly less than on a clear day due to the multi-reflection effect between cloud and snow surface. On the other hand, there is no significant difference of snow albedo between clear and cloudy days. Therefore, the net radiation on a cloudy day does not largely decrease from that on a clear day. That is, SW cloud-radiative forcing is only weak cooling. (2) Long wave : The downward long wave radiation on a cloudy day increases from that on a clear day, because of additional emission from the cloud. In addition, since the air temperature is very low and the water vapor contained in the atmosphere is very little on a clear day, the equivalent black body temperature of the <b>downward</b> <b>radiation</b> is very low so that the difference of <b>downward</b> <b>radiation</b> between clear and cloudy days is large.

Impacts of future greening of the Arctic region are tested using altered surface boundary conditions for hypothetical vegetation distributions: (1) grasslands poleward of 60 °N replaced by boreal forests and (2) both grasslands and shrubs replaced by boreal forests. Surface energy budget analysis reveals that future greening induces a considerable surface warming effect locally and warming is largely driven {{by an increase in}} short wave radiation. Both upward and <b>downward</b> shortwave <b>radiation</b> contribute to positive surface warming: upward shortwave radiation decreases mainly due to the decreased surface albedo (a darker surface) and <b>downward</b> shortwave <b>radiation</b> increases due to reduced cloud cover. The contribution of <b>downward</b> shortwave <b>radiation</b> at surface due to cloud cover reduction is larger than the contribution from surface albedo alone. The increased roughness length also transported surface fluxes to upper layer more efficiently and induce more heating and dry lower atmosphere. A relatively smaller increase in water vapor compared to the large increase in low-level air temperature in the simulation reduces relative humidity and results in reduced cloud cover. Therefore, vegetation-cloud feedbacks induced from land cover change significantly amplify Arctic warming. In addition to previously suggested feedback mechanisms, we propose that the vegetation-cloud feedback should be considered as one of major components that will give rise to an additional positive feedback to Arctic amplification...|$|R

The primary effect of the collapse is to redistribute heat over the two hemispheres. However, Northern Hemisphere sea ice increase {{in response to the}} AMOC collapse induces a hemisphere-wide cooling, amplified by atmospheric feedbacks, in particular water vapour. The Southern Hemisphere warming is governed by slower processes. After 25 years the global cooling peaks. Thereafter, the response is characterised by a gradual readjustment of global mean temperature. During the AMOC collapse a <b>downward</b> <b>radiation</b> anomaly arises {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA), heating the earth’s surface. The net <b>downward</b> <b>radiation</b> anomaly at TOA arises from reduced longwave emission by the atmosphere, overcompensating the increased net upward anomalies in shortwave and longwave radiation at the surface. This radiation anomaly is associated with net ocean heat uptake: cooling of the overlying atmosphere results from reduced ocean heat release through the increase of sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic. The change in energy flow arises from the reduction in latent and sensible heat flux, which dominate the surface radiation budget. Similar experiments with a climate model of intermediate complexity reveal a stronger shortwave response that acts to reduce the net <b>downward</b> <b>radiation</b> anomaly at TOA. The net shortwave and longwave radiation anomalies at TOA always decrease during the first 100 years after the AMOC collapse, but in the intermediate complexity model this is associated with a sign change after 90 years when the net radiation anomaly at TOA becomes upward, accompanied by net ocean heat loss. After several hundred years the longwave and shortwave anomalies increase again, while the net residual at TOA remains small.

Long-term datasets of cloudiness and sea surface teperature (SST) from surface observations from 1952 to 1981 are used to examine interannual variations in MSC and SST. Linear correlations of anomalies in seasonal MSC amount with seasonal SST anomalies are negative and significant in midlatitude and eastern subtropical oceans, especially during summer. Significant negative correlations between SST and nimbostratus and nonprecipitating midlevel cloudiness are also observed at midlatitudes during summer, suggesting that summer storm tracks shift {{from year to year}} following year-to-year meridional shifts in the SST gradient. Over the 30 -yr period, there are significant upward trends in MSC amount over the northern midlatitude oceans and a significant downward trend off the coast of California. The highest correlations and trends occur where gradients in MSC and SST are strongest. During summer, correlations between SST and MSC anomalies peak at zero lag in midlatitudes where warm advection prevails, but SST lags MSC in subtropical regions where cold advection predominates.
