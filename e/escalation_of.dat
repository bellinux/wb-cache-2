40|$|This {{research}} explores whether {{conceptualization of}} client difficulties using escalation cycles {{is associated with}} a reduction in counselor pathologizing of clients. This research also explores whether the use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> in conceptualization interacts with counselor experience level to affect the amount of counselor pathologizing of clients. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles, this research explores whether use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> in conceptualization increases counselors 2 ̆ 7 abilities to generate solutions for clients. Participants in this study were divided into four groups based on their counseling experience and their use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles to conceptualize client difficulties. Each group watched a family counseling video and then wrote descriptions of the family and listed interventions for the family. ^ Participants 2 ̆ 7 responses were content-analyzed for number of pathologizing words, the equality in the number of times family members were mentioned, and number of interventions. It was hypothesized that users <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles would use fewer pathologizing words, mention family members a more equal number of times, and generate more interventions. It was also hypothesized that use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles would modify the effect of counselor experience on amount of pathologizing of clients. Findings indicated that users <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles used more pathologizing words to describe clients than did nonusers <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles. In addition, use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles did not impact the equality with which family members were mentioned. Experience level had no impact on either the number of pathologizing words or the equality with which family members were mentioned. Users <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> theory did, however, increase their number of interventions more as experience level rose than did nonusers. This last finding suggests that use <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> cycles allows for continued growth in developing interventions as counselors gain clinical experience. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of the study of pathologizing of clients and the strength <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> theory in general. ...|$|R

5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E

5|$|The clash at the Plitvice Lakes worsened {{the overall}} {{situation}} in Croatia {{and led to}} an <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> the conflict. Even though the Croatian and Serb forces were separated by the JNA at the Plitvice Lakes, {{the situation in the}} area continued to deteriorate following the clash. In nearby Plaški, Croatian police personnel left the local police station and were replaced by Serb officers. Both SAO Krajina and Croatian forces set up several roadblocks on the Saborsko–Lička Jasenica–Ogulin road. By summer, the blockades were extended to the north of Plaški and south of Saborsko, where Croatian authorities established another 30-strong police station on 2 April. Only JNA vehicles were permitted to pass the roadblocks, and that brought about a shortage of food, medicine and electricity in the area.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical investigation <b>of</b> the <b>escalation</b> process that results when states are in dispute over some issue(s) in the international system. Escalation {{is viewed as a}} cost-imposing bargaining strategy enacted by states for the purpose of eliciting concessions from the adversary. Each state has a cost tolerance which identifies the maximum costs a state is willing to suffer to achieve their demand on the issue at stake. A player determines the likelihood that escalation will produce the adversary's concession by comparing the cost tolerances of both players. Once a player decides that the opponent has a greater willingness to bear the costs <b>of</b> <b>escalation,</b> that player concedes and quits the escalation game. A formal theory <b>of</b> the <b>escalation</b> process is developed which produces several hypotheses identifying the conditions under which states are expected to escalate in conflict and, once the decision to escalate is made, the level <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> that that state is likely to achieve. One advantage in developing a general theory <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> is that the interrelationships among the variables are expected to hold across a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> contexts. These hypotheses are then tested empirically in order to assess the utility of the general theory <b>of</b> <b>escalation.</b> In one <b>of</b> these contexts, the extended deterrence crisis, potential attackers are expected to refrain from pursuing higher levels <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> when the attacker can perceive the value that the defender attaches to its ally and when the defender has the capacity to impose serious escalation costs on its opponent. Another of the hypotheses tested produced the expectation that lower cost tolerant actors were more likely to achieve their highest level <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> on their first move in the conflict given that they were unable to prevail in a long, drawn-out game <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> with their stronger opponent. The results of the empirical tests indicate that the general theory <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> developed in the thesis is useful in identifying the conditions that motivate states to escalate, the level <b>of</b> <b>escalation</b> that is likely to be achieved and the conditions under which states concede...|$|R

5|$|The {{dynamics}} of the air war changed in June 1941. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. The <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> the fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. The operations of the Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make hit-and-run attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E

5|$|An already tense {{situation}} in the Lika region, following 1 April Plitvice Lakes incident when the first fatalities of the Croatian War of Independence occurred, deteriorated further in June when Croatia reaffirmed its sovereignty through a parliamentary declaration. This {{was reflected in the}} rise of violent incidents, setting up of unauthorized road checkpoints and occasional exchanges of small arms fire. On 22 June, three policemen were abducted on the road between Gospić and SAO Krajina-controlled Gračac, and a series of attacks on the Croatian police occurred in various parts of Lika, including Gospić, on 27–28 June. In July 1991, the JNA started to openly confront the Croatian police and the ZNG in Lika. On 1 July, Plitvice police station was surrounded by the JNA, and on 6 July, two ZNG troops were killed and another two wounded in a JNA ambush near Gospić. Further <b>escalation</b> <b>of</b> the fighting was seen at the Ljubovo pass on the Gospić–Korenica road, where the JNA and SAO Krajina troops fought and pushed the ZNG back on 28–29 July.|$|E
