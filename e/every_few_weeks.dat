It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E

But as she anticipates the upcoming annual class excursion to the amusement park, she begins to wonder: what is her real height?

Because she is a really thoughtful child, she begins to speculate about whether the differences are in the thing being measured (i. e., maybe her height really doesn’t increase monotonically from day to day) or the way it was measured (different people may use different techniques and measurement instruments when determining her height...|$|R
40|$|<b>Every</b> year, a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> {{after new}} freshmen {{students}} started on their {{course of studies}} in Computer Science, many lecturers complain {{that some of their}} students are ill-equipped with those competences that are necessary to study successfully. Hence, these students struggle. This situation can be observed universally, at different universities and in various countries. On the other hand, {{at the same time there}} usually are some students around which meet study requirements rather easily. To effectively deal with this heterogeneity, lecturers need to gain a quick overview of initial competences in their student cohorts. This paper describes the development of a test that assesses first-year students' initial cognitive competences as well as basic knowledge in maths and computer usage. On this basis, lecturers can adapt their lectures to address the students’ current level, in order to quickly develop those skills that are still missing. We have been using this test for four years, for a pilot study as well as three regular runs. So far, we have collected test results of over 750 students. First insights into the results confirm our assumption that important competences are lacking in many freshmen students. As a consequence, we adapt our teaching in introductory courses, to enable students to close the gap and quickly meet study requirements...|$|R

He tested the game on close friends once <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> and they would ask him when they could play it again. Thorson brought the game to the 2013 Evolution Championship Series fighting games tournament, where he unexpectedly received more praise than criticism. The game mechanics were inspired by games from Thorson's youth. Upon reflection, {{he felt that the}} game had the item-catching mechanics of Super Smash Bros., the one-hit kills and tension of Bushido Blade, the playfulness of Goldeneye 007, the shooting mechanics of , and the positioning strategy of Team Fortress 2. He described his development process as tweaking Super Smash Bros. Melee to his tastes. The limited arrow design was intended to slow the gameplay and encourage player strategy. He considered adding online multiplayer, a popular request, but lacked the programming skills himself. The game's medieval scenery came from his contemporary interest in the Game of Thrones book series and his pairing of the arrow mechanic with [...] "stone-walled castles and lava-filled dungeons".

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the use of {{rotationally}} grazed pastures by wild bird species, particularly in Midwestern landscapes. What is known is that continuously grazed pastures tend to have low bird production and use {{due to the lack of}} sufficient vegetative structure and to trampling of ground nests by cattle. Long-term rotational grazing (where livestock are shifted between several pastures <b>every</b> <b>few</b> days or <b>weeks,</b> as opposed to intensive rotational grazing where they are shifted every day) has the potential to produce high-quality cattle grazing and grasslands for wildlife. Early in the grazing season, farmers could use cool-season grass and forb (CSG) pastures for rotational grazing, leaving warm-season grass and forb (WSG) pastures to produce wildlife, especially birds. At the end of June or early July, cattle could be shifted to the WSG pastures for rotational grazing. Not only does this allow the WSG to grow to excellent grazing height, it also allows ground-nesting birds to potentially complete a nesting cycle. Further, as CSG are left to grow (although slowly) until fall, late-nesting birds and re-nesters may utilize the CSG, as well. Depending on the length of time between rotations, early nesters may also use the CSG early in the nesting season...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Juvenile {{laryngeal}} papillomatosis {{is a rare}} {{benign neoplasm}} of the larynx in children; incidence is estimated about 4. 3 / 100. 000 children and extralaryngeal spread to the lower airway is relatively uncommon. Although it has a clear viral origin factors that characterize the onset and progress are still uncertain. Materials and methods. We report a 7 year old boy with chronic dysphonia, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and anemia who was admitted in our Clinic. The patient was submitted to left cord vocal biopsy for hoarseness. At 2 years it was diagnosed squamous papilloma and it was managed with microdebrider in another country. A laryngo-tracheo-bronchoscopy was performed with biopsies for viral identification and histology, treatment with laser CO 2, tracheotomy for diffuse papillomatosis and intralaryngeal antiviral injection. The papillomatosis was extended in glottic and subglottic. Histological report is laryngeal papillomatosis due to HPV types 11. Identification of HPV genotypes was based on PCR. Results. He had 3 procedures of laser CO 2 and the mean time between two consecutive surgeries was 20 days. A third laryngoscopy, after 5 week, found no lesion, no scar formation, no bleeding. The patient was discharged after 3 mounth. Conclusion. The natural history of laryngeal papillomatosis is highly variable and unpredictable. The disease may undergo spontaneous remission, persist in a stable state requiring only periodic surgical treatment, or may be aggressive, requiring surgical treatment <b>every</b> <b>few</b> days to <b>weeks</b> and consideration of adjuvant medical therapy...|$|R
