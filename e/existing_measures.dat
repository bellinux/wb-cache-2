25|$|Recall {{that the}} R-square {{statistic}} in multiple regression reflects {{the percent of}} variance accounted for in the Y variable using all X variables. Thus, the change in R-square will reflect the percent of variance explained by the variable added to the model. The change in R-square is more appropriate than simply looking at the raw correlations because the raw correlations {{do not reflect the}} overlap of the newly introduced measure and the <b>existing</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{performance}} appraisal measures are run down, they typically {{need to be}} replaced by new measures. In the sciences, overlapping data is useful, in that it they can be used to confirm or disprove a given hypothesis. In management, however, overlapping measurements are considered redundant, rather than a useful indication of reliability. By the same token, new measures that lie in direct opposition to <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> of performance are not helpful. For instance, if a retail company uses units of shoes sold in a month as a metric, adding units of shoes remaining unsold after a month as a new metric is not helpful. Since the company can derive the same information and draw the same conclusions from both metrics, it is more efficient to use only one of the two measures. In the interest of generating useful data, new performance measures should be orthogonal to existing metrics.|$|E

500|$|John {{treated the}} interdict as [...] "the {{equivalent}} of a papal declaration of war". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to {{drive a wedge between}} those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to greatly worry the king. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply tightened his <b>existing</b> <b>measures</b> and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks (equivalent to Â£66,666 at the time) to John. Official figures suggest that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} General Electric {{provides}} a clear example of developing orthogonal performance measures. When GE dismantled its conglomerate in the 1950s, its existing performance measures, which relied on centralized budgetary targets, needed to evolve {{to suit the}} newly decentralized company. The 1951 GE Measurement Project provided a template for the new performance measures, which were orthogonal to the old performance measures, {{as well as to}} each other. The new measures were [...] "profitability, market position, productivity, product leadership, personnel development, employee attitudes, public responsibility", and balance between short-term and long-term goals. Thirty years later, when the company was in dire straits, the performance measurements were functionally consolidated into ranked profitability and growth. With this strategy, GE annually swept away the bottom 10% of its performers in profitability and growth. Once GE regained financial and market stability, the performance evaluation metrics changed in response, allegedly expanding and taking on more humanistic values. GE illustrates two important notes about changing performance metrics. First, new performance measures are most useful when they are unrelated {{to each other and to}} <b>existing</b> <b>measures.</b> Second, performance measures tend towards elaboration during times of security and profitability, and likewise tend towards consolidation during times of urgency and strain.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to develop and {{validate}} the Work Addiction Inventory (WAI). The WAI is designed to assess individual's addiction to work via self-report. Data were collected from 127 working professional employed on at least a part-time (20 hours per week) basis. Results of an exploratory factor analysis retained 24 items and indicated that the WAI consists of three underlying factors. The WAI subscale and total scores showed adequate internal consistency reliabilities. Convergent and discriminant validity was initially supported by the relationship between WAI scores, an <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> of workaholism, and social desirability. Also, WAI scores correlated highly with several criterion variables. Finally, evidence was found to suggest that the WAI accounts for unique variance beyond an <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> of workaholism. In conclusion, psychometric properties of the WAI were initially supported by findings of the study...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a new measure for discriminatory related party {{transactions}} (DRPTs). There are currently measures for such discriminatory transactions but the new measure has a strong theoretical basis and is less susceptible to measurement error. Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops and tests a new measure for these discriminatory transactions. Type I and Type II error rates and the power of the new measure are compared with an <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> using computer-simulated and real data. Findings: The capital market sensitivity of the new measure is also tested and compared with the <b>existing</b> <b>measure.</b> The new measure is found to be superior. Practical implications: The new measure of DRPTs has the potential to contribute to both further research on the impact of related party transactions and policy-making in relation to DRPTs. Originality/value: This paper has developed and tested a new measure for DRPTs...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{validate}} the Work Addiction Inventory (WAI). The WAI is designed to assess individuals' addiction to work via self-report. Data were collected from 244 working professionals employed on at least a part-time (20 hours per week) basis. Results failed to replicate the three factor model found in the initial validation study (Bryan, 2009). A follow up exploratory factor analysis on {{the first half of the}} sample retained 15 items and suggested that the WAI consists of two underlying factors. This two-factor structure was found to cross-validate in a confirmatory factor analysis on the second half of the sample. The WAI subscale and total scores showed adequate internal consistency reliabilities. Convergent and discriminant validity was initially supported by relationships of the WAI scores to an <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> of workaholism, a work engagement scale, and average hours worked per week.
