2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Gay Monkey Magazine in 2006, after he launched his own production company, he {{claimed to be the}} youngest producer in the history of gay porn. He went on to say [...] "Porn can be a bad business; but not my company. Since I know what it's like, <b>I</b> <b>treat</b> models right. <b>I</b> <b>treat</b> my models with the utmost respect from beginning to end." [...] The article states his company only makes films with the actors using condoms. He was still working for the major gay pornographic studios at the time, and his own first film using condoms was Summit (2008). In previous films, he was known for not using them. The film won the GayVN Awards Best Pro/Am Film 2009.|$|E

I'm not a new Salman Rushdie, and don't want to be welcomed and treated as such. I'm a researcher. I'm critical of old and modern Islamic thought. <b>I</b> <b>treat</b> the Qur'an as a naṣṣ (text) given by God to the Prophet Muhammad. That text is put into a human language, which is the Arabic language. When I said so, I was accused of saying that the Prophet Muhammad wrote the Qur’an.

[...] " [...] While making allowance for exaggeration intended to placate the jury, {{there is no reason}} to doubt the sincerity of this proclamation. This is a view shared by most of liturgists, a view reflecting the social position and prestige in proportion conferred by the financial effort made, [...] as illustrated by the Lysias quote above.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new year}} {{brought about a}} number of changes in Karam's career lives. Najwa's new album was set to be {{released}} in the summer, and her personal changes were showing in her new album Rouh Rouhi. It was similar to the Maghroumeh album, but had a number of tweaks in the vocal and musical styles. The musical arrangements were heavily detailed and technical, and the lyrics were more poetic than all other Karam albums. The tracks [...] "Ariftu Albi La Meen" [...] ("Do you know who my heart belongs to?"), [...] "Atchana" [...] ("Thirsty"), and the title track, [...] "Rouh Rouhi" [...] ("Soul of my Soul") were the major hits off the album, the latter two being shot as music videos. Many other songs succeeded like [...] "Kif Bdawik" [...] ("How Do <b>I</b> <b>Treat</b> You?)", and [...] "Ma Berda Ghayrak" [...] ("I Don't Accept Anyone Beside You").|$|E
2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. <b>I</b> <b>treat</b> people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E

She also said: [...] "When I was at the hospital (in Dhaka), <b>I</b> <b>treated</b> so many seven- or eight-year-old girls who were raped by their male relatives, some 50 or 60 years old. <b>I</b> <b>treated</b> them, and <b>I</b> remembered when I was raped." ...|$|R

2500|$|In July 1187, Saladin {{captured}} {{most of the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem. On 4 July 1187, at the Battle of Hattin, {{he faced}} the combined forces of Guy of Lusignan, King Consort of Jerusalem, and Raymond III of Tripoli. In this battle alone the Crusader force was largely annihilated by Saladin's determined army. It was a major disaster for the Crusaders and {{a turning point in}} the history of the Crusades. Saladin captured Raynald and was personally responsible for his execution in retaliation for his attacks against Muslim caravans. The members of these caravans had, in vain, besought his mercy by reciting the truce between the Muslims and the Crusaders, but Raynald ignored this and insulted the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, before murdering and torturing a number of them. Upon hearing this, Saladin swore an oath to personally execute Raynald. Guy of Lusignan was also captured. Seeing the execution of Raynald, he feared he would be next. However, his life was spared by Saladin, who said of Raynald, [...] "t is not the wont of kings, to kill kings; but that man had transgressed all bounds, and therefore did <b>I</b> <b>treat</b> him thus." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Sun Ce sent Taishi Ci {{to persuade}} Liu Yao's {{followers}} to surrender, many of Sun Ce's aides felt that Taishi Ci {{could not be}} trusted. They believed that Taishi Ci would defect to either Hua Xin or Huang Zu. However, Sun Ce said, [...] "All of you are wrong. I trust my judgment. Taishi Ci may be brave and headstrong, {{but he is not}} an impulsive person. He is a man of exemplary character and a man who keeps his word. <b>I</b> <b>treat</b> him like a close friend and will not betray him. All of you don't need to worry." [...] Sun Ce's aides only trusted Taishi Ci after he kept his promise and returned from Yuzhang Commandery. When Taishi Ci met Sun Ce again, he said, [...] "Hua Ziyu is a man of virtue, but not a talented leader. He has no grand plan; he only wants to preserve the status quo. Tong Zhi (僮芝) from Danyang lied that he has been appointed as the Administrator of Luling and has taken control of the commandery. The local clans in Poyang have formed their own ruling body and driven away the officials sent by Hua Ziyu to govern the area. Hua Ziyu is unable to control Luling and Poyang. Moreover, about 5,000 to 6,000 local clans in Haihun (海昏) have formed their own ruling body too and rejected control by the commandery administration. Hua Ziyu can do nothing about this." [...] Sun Ce clapped his hands and laughed. Later on, he pacified Yuzhang Commandery and successfully induced Hua Xin to surrender to him.|$|E
