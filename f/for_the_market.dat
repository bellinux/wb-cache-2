5|$|The farm {{seizures}} {{were often}} violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, {{with many of}} their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> because of their {{lack of access to}} fertiliser.|$|E
5|$|Low-cost {{loans for}} farmers and {{replaced}} the labor service {{with a tax}} instead, hoping this would ultimately help {{the workings of the}} entire economy and state (as he directly linked state income to the level of prosperity of rural peasants who owned farms, produced goods <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> and paid the land tax). These government loans replaced the system of landlords offering their tenants private loans, which was prohibited under the new laws of Wang's reforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} during a {{growth in the}} Italian film industry which allowed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> to expand beyond a local Italian audience, and would allow Italian film makers to explore new genres of filmmaking. Freda {{made a deal with}} producers at the Italian film studio Titanus to create a low budget horror film by writing a story in one day and filming it in two weeks. The producers agreed and Freda began filming. On the final day of shooting, Freda left the set which led to the cinematographer Mario Bava to direct the rest of the film, which changed various plot points and added the inclusion of stock footage.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} was causing problems <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. Redevelopment was considered, but protests from the Covent Garden Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, Robert Carr, to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market relocated to its new site, New Covent Garden Market, about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980, with cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market. Among the first shops to relocate here was Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop. Another market, the Jubilee Market, is held in the Jubilee Hall {{on the south side of}} the square. The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden have been owned by the property company Capital & Counties Properties (CapCo) since 2006.|$|E
5|$|Empire: Total War {{ships with}} nine {{different}} versions of box art, eight of which represent the major faction <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> the game is sold in, and one general international version. For instance, German customers are presented artwork displaying colours with the Prussian eagle and Prussian army uniforms, whilst the American artwork shows the American revolutionaries and the Betsy Ross flag. A special edition version of Empire: Total War entitled Special Forces incorporates six elite faction-specific units: HMS Victory, the French Irish Brigade, Spanish guerillas, Gurkha infantry, Rogers' Rangers and the Ottoman Ribauldequin. Additionally, three retailers were provided with a special unit for customers to receive; Amazon.com customers were given the Dahomey Amazons, buyers from Best Buy were able to receive the USS Constitution and customers buying from Game received the Death's Head Hussars. A further 14 units were added {{with the objective of}} increasing graphical and unit variety among the factions. These 14 units were released as part of the game's 1.3 patch in June 2009; accompanying the update was a second set of 14 units, released as downloadable content for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Pleydell's initial {{entrance}} to the Parliament of England in March 1553 as a member <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> town of Wootton Bassett was, at least in part, made possible by {{his status as a}} wealthy landholder. Although he had not yet inherited the lease on the family estate of Midgehall, his purchases of land and property surrounding the manor (one mile from the constituency) in 1561 and 1562 suggest that his assets facilitated a seat in the House of Commons. The constituency was eventually abolished by the Reform Act 1832. Surviving records note Pleydell's returning to Parliament solely by his Christian name, deemed sufficiently unusual to identify him outright. Succeeding members John Seymour and Robert Huick from the 1547–52 session, Pleydell served with William Garrard for just 30 days in March until a dissolution of Parliament. They were replaced in October by Henry Poole and John Throckmorton.|$|E

5|$|The Commander Keen series {{began in}} 1990 when John Carmack, then a game {{programmer}} at Softdisk, {{came up with}} a method to produce scrolling graphics for a 2D platform video game on IBM-compatible general-purpose computers. After a demo port of Super Mario Bros. 3 failed to entice Nintendo, he and a group of his coworkers from Softdisk—including programmer John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack—used the technique to make an original trilogy of shareware episodes for publisher Apogee Software. The game, Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, was a large success <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> and led the group to quit their jobs and found id Software. The game was followed by four more episodes during 1991: Keen Dreams, a pair titled Goodbye, Galaxy, and Aliens Ate My Babysitter. Further plans were made for another trilogy to be produced in 1992 under the name The Universe is Toast, but before any work began it was cancelled due to the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. Id did not return to the series afterwards, instead continuing to focus on 3D first-person shooters.|$|E
5|$|The Duchy {{land was}} farmed under the open field system until 1874 {{when it was}} {{enclosed}} – or consolidated – into three large farms by the landowners and residents.

Salisbury Field was retained for public use in 1892 and land was purchased in 1895 for the formal Borough Gardens, between West Walks and Cornwall Road.

By the summer of 1929, there were eight trains from Gaerwen to Amlwch, and seven in the other direction. One train to and from Amlwch no longer ran Thursdays, replaced with a second two return trip to Llangefni, operated by the railmotor. The loop at Llangwyllog now saw three pairs of passenger trains passing on weekdays, while the daily freight train would be shunted into sidings at Llangefni and Llanerchymedd to make way. Motor train services were back up to 24 single trips a day, including the Red Wharf Bay services.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
