5|$|Artanis {{decided to}} launch an {{expedition}} to rescue the preserver, but didn't know where to start. Mohandar, however, believed he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Zamara was going – Ehlna, a Nerazim sanctuary moon. There, the Nerazim, who had no preservers, used modified khaydarin crystals to store memories.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> the locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers {{to allow them}} a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> the gunman would be.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{after all}} seven books had been published, Graeme Davis {{regarded}} Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and {{agreed that the}} plot structure {{is much the same}} as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.|$|E
5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> his carriers were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 1, 1824, Desha {{attended}} a celebration at a neighbor's house. He later stayed the night at Doggate's Tavern in Fairview, just over the county line in Fleming County. The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. Over breakfast, Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area. Desha remarked that he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Bickley lived and, intending to ride in that direction, asked if Baker wanted to join him. Baker accepted, and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville. Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare, a fine horse that had already attracted much attention during his travel through Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} command problems, especially in its early operations in southwestern Germany. After the defeat at Stockach, the army withdrew into the Black Forest. Jourdan relinquished command provisionally to Ernouf, who was a capable staff officer but had insufficient experience to hold together a varied and demoralized force. Jourdan retired to Strasbourg, where he was, or claimed he was, indisposed. By the time Masséna arrived to take command, organization and discipline was in shambles. Only four divisional generals had remained at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was under arrest in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-martial, as was d'Hautpoul, for his failure to organize a timely cavalry attack at Stockach. The others had disappeared to {{different parts of the}} southwest or had gone to France. No one <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had retired to Mannheim. The latter was at least reachable. Lecourbe, who had been injured at Stockach, had withdrawn to Paris to recover; in a strategically astute move, he remained there until late November, when he was able to offer Napoleon direct assistance in his coup, and thus acquired Bonaparte's attention and gratitude.|$|E

25|$|At about 3:00p.m., {{shortly after}} forcing {{a group of}} police {{officers}} to take cover in a ditch, Bryant rang the local police station. The wife {{of one of the}} police officers answered the phone. Bryant asked who she was and if she <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> her husband was. He again called himself Jamie. He asked if she knew whether or not her husband was okay, and when she did not answer, Bryant then told her he was okay and that he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> her husband was.|$|E
25|$|During an {{emergency}} meeting {{in which the}} response to the government offensive was being discussed, Willy Ligorría called to say that he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Hugo Gramajo and Aaron Ochoa were hidden and that he could bring the still free student leaders to them. In September other members of the student movement, Carlos Chutá Carney, Carlos Humberto Cabrera and Carlos Palencia were kidnapped and found dead shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The Hawaiian {{style of}} {{ranching}} originally included capturing wild cattle by driving them into pits dug {{in the forest}} floor. Once tamed somewhat by hunger and thirst, they were hauled out up a steep ramp, and tied by their horns to the horns of a tame, older steer (or ox) that <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> the paddock with food and water was located. The industry grew slowly under the reign of Kamehameha's son Liholiho (Kamehameha II).|$|E

25|$|It {{is presumed}} {{that he was}} {{disposing}} of his belongings throughout the town of Sligo and then folding the bag and putting it in his pocket. Authorities were unable to identify what he was throwing away in the public rubbish bins as the man used the blind spots of the surveillance cameras to his advantage. His movements were very meticulous and methodical as if he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> to hide his personal belongings that could have identified him.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this {{productive}} period of research, {{in the summer of}} 1934, prior to the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared. He did not come into work, and no one <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he was. He was found in a small psychiatric clinic, Pinel Clinic, near the famous Phipps Clinic associated with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Apparently, he had become so depressed that he drove to Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.|$|E
25|$|A common myth {{surrounding}} the bombing (due {{in part to}} such books as Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret) is that Coventry was deliberately undefended to prevent the Germans realising that Enigma cipher machine traffic (information from which was termed Ultra) was being read by British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park. This claim is untrue – Winston Churchill was aware that a major bombing raid was to take place, but no-one <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> the raid was meant to strike {{before it was too}} late to evacuate.|$|E

25|$|All {{passengers}} and medical staff were saved, {{but there was}} one fatality among the crew, a stoker was accidentally left on the ship and he drowned when he tried to swim to shore. At the subsequent inquiry, Captain McNeil testified that he had fully trusted that the pilot <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> the buoys were, particularly because the pilots were in charge of moving the buoys to protect the harbour during wartime. The pilot was found guilty of a gross error of judgment and demoted.|$|E
25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> {{they were going to}} put their penalty in order to get in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 2011, {{it became}} public that an {{encrypted}} version of WikiLeaks' huge archive of unredacted U.S. State Department cables had been available via BitTorrent {{for months and}} that the decryption key (similar to a password) was available to those who <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> to find it. Guardian newspaper editor David Leigh had just published the decryption key in his book, so the files were now publicly available to anyone. Rather than let malicious actors publish selected data, WikiLeaks decided to publish the entire, unredacted archive in searchable form on its website.|$|E
