5000|$|<b>Jaggies</b> occur {{due to the}} [...] "staircase effect". This {{is because}} a line {{represented}} in raster mode is approximated by a sequence of pixels. <b>Jaggies</b> can occur {{for a variety of}} reasons, the most common being that the output device (display monitor or printer) does not have enough resolution to portray a smooth line. In addition, <b>jaggies</b> often occur when a bit-mapped image is converted to a different resolution. This is one of the advantages that vector graphics has over bit-mapped graphics - the output looks the same regardless of the resolution of the output device.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} image {{systems have}} been developed {{in order to enhance}} the quality of the image representation. <b>Jaggy</b> appearing {{at the edge of a}} slant line are, however, easily perceived by human eyes, which often severely defect the perceived image quality, because of the spatial perceive characteristics of our eye system. Although the size of the <b>jaggy</b> can be reduced by reducing the pixel size, it is hard to completely eliminate the perceived <b>jaggy</b> by using the conventional lattice pixel placement, since our eye system is sensitive enough to perceive such <b>jaggy.</b> In this paper, we describe the basic concept of the pseudorandom pixel placement to reduce the <b>jaggy</b> effect, and discuss the relation of <b>jaggy</b> reduction effect and the pixel structure characteristics, in terms of the fill factor and the number of pixel types. © 2015 by ITE Transactions on Media Technology and Applications (MTA) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} <b>jaggies</b> {{can be reduced}} {{somewhat}} by a graphics technique known as spatial anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing smooths out jagged lines by surrounding the <b>jaggies</b> with transparent pixels to simulate the appearance of fractionally-filled pixels. The downside of anti-aliasing is that it reduces contrast - rather than sharp black/white transitions, there are shades of gray - and the resulting image is fuzzy. This is an inescapable trade-off: if the resolution is insufficient to display the desired detail, the output will either be jagged or fuzzy, or some combination thereof.|$|E

50|$|During Partick Thistle's {{time in the}} Scottish 1st Division {{the person}} in the <b>Jaggy</b> MacBee costume was the Under-20s player who had been the worst {{performer}} in training that week. When Partick Thistle joined the Scottish Premiership a decision was made between them and sponsors MacB Water that a dedicated person should be <b>Jaggy</b> rather than have it as a punishment. As a result MacB launched the MacBecome competition to find their new <b>Jaggy.</b> The eventual winner was James McGhee, who has held the role since and won plaudits for what he brings to it.|$|R

50|$|<b>Jaggies</b> are stairlike {{lines that}} appear where {{there should be}} smooth {{straight}} lines or curves. For example, when a nominally straight, un-aliased line steps across one pixel, a dogleg occurs halfway through the line, where it crosses the threshold from one pixel to the other.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} problems, however, with these displays. First, the <b>jaggies</b> {{would create a}} [...] "staircase effect." [...] Second, random noise {{superimposed}} on the signal makes the lines appear to flicker and {{move up and down}} or from side to side (which is called [...] "aliasing").|$|E

50|$|In realtime {{computer}} graphics, especially gaming, anti-aliasing is used {{to remove}} <b>jaggies</b> created by the edges of polygons and other lines entirely. Some video game consoles, such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, have publishing policies which mandated the use of anti-aliasing in some games released for them. Some computer graphics on newer video games are not anti-aliased on video game consoles (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3), because their hardware can not run graphics smoothly (30 frames per second) if they are anti-aliased. On eighth generation video game consoles, such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, anti-aliasing and frame rate has been heavily improved. <b>Jaggies</b> in bitmaps, such as sprites and surface materials, are most often dealt with by separate texture filtering routines, which are far easier to perform than anti-aliasing filtering. Texture filtering became ubiquitous on PCs after the introduction of 3Dfx's Voodoo GPU.|$|E

50|$|Resampling causes aliasing, both {{blurring}} low-frequency {{components and}} adding high-frequency noise, causing <b>jaggies,</b> while rounding off computations {{to fit in}} finite precision introduces quantization, causing banding; if fixed by dither, this instead becomes noise. In both cases, these at best degrading the signal's S/N ratio, and may cause artifacts. Quantization can be reduced by using high precision while editing (notably floating point numbers), only reducing back to fixed precision at the end.|$|E
50|$|If a naive {{rendering}} {{algorithm is}} used without any filtering, high frequencies {{in the image}} function will cause ugly aliasing {{to be present in}} the final image. Aliasing typically manifests itself as <b>jaggies,</b> or jagged edges on objects where the pixel grid is visible. In order to remove aliasing, all rendering algorithms (if they are to produce good-looking images) must use some kind of low-pass filter on the image function to remove high frequencies, a process called antialiasing.|$|E
50|$|The {{way that}} samples (e.g. when viewed as pixels on the screen) are {{calculated}} from the texels (texture pixels) is governed by texture filtering. The cheapest method {{is to use the}} nearest-neighbour interpolation, but bilinear interpolation or trilinear interpolation between mipmaps are two commonly used alternatives which reduce aliasing or <b>jaggies.</b> In the event of a texture coordinate being outside the texture, it is either clamped or wrapped. Anisotropic filtering better eliminates directional artefacts when viewing textures from oblique viewing angles.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the texture}} mapping process, a [...] takes {{place to find}} out where on the texture each pixel center falls. Since the {{textured}} surface may be at an arbitrary distance and orientation relative to the viewer, one pixel does not usually correspond directly to one texel. Some form of filtering has to be applied to determine the best color for the pixel. Insufficient or incorrect filtering will show up in the image as artifacts (errors in the image), such as 'blockiness', <b>jaggies,</b> or shimmering.|$|E
5000|$|Alappat devised {{what appears}} to be a novel and {{convenient}} anti-aliasing scheme—an anti-aliasing algorithm. The specification of the patent application disclosed how to provide a smooth-appearing waveform (something appearing to be a straight diagonal line without <b>jaggies</b> or staircase) by determining illumination intensity of each of the pixels in accordance with the new formula I' = c (1 - / Δy i [...] ). In this formula, c is an arbitrary constant, and the Δ values represent vertical pixel-to-pixel distances on the screen. A user of the system then makes the CRT's neck coil current proportional to I', as calculated according to the foregoing formula.|$|E
5000|$|Kuriappan Alappat was an {{employee}} of Tektronix, an oscilloscope manufacturer. He and two other employees (Edward Averill and James Larsen, but for convenience the three will be referred to collectively as Alappat) devised a form of [...] "rasterizer," [...] which is a device used in a digital oscilloscope to smooth waveform data before displaying the waveform on the oscilloscope screen. (The irregularities in the waveform are called [...] "jaggies.") The invention is a system for improving the appearance of digital oscilloscopes' screen displays by connecting data points smoothly without gaps or <b>jaggies.</b> A digital oscilloscope ordinarily represents data points as isolated points on the screen. Each point occupies a small area on the screen termed a [...] "pixel." [...] It is convenient to connect successive data points on the screen by a line, so that the data appears on the screen as a line graph.|$|E
