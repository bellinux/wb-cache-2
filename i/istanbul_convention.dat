The <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Convention</b> recognizes these two rights at Article 38 – Female genital mutilation and Article 39 – Forced abortion and forced sterilisation.|$|E
25|$|Turkey was {{the first}} country in Europe to ratify (on 14 March 2012) the Council of Europe Convention on {{preventing}} and combating violence against women and domestic violence, which {{is known as the}} <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Convention</b> because it was first opened for signature in Turkey's largest city (on 11 May 2011). Three other European countries with a significant (≥c.20%) Muslim population – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro – have also ratified the convention, while Macedonia is a signatory to the document. The aim of the convention is to create a Europe free from violence against women and domestic violence. On 10th December 2014, the Serbian-Turkish pop star Emina Jahović released a video clip entitled Ne plašim se (“I'm not scared”) to help raise awareness of domestic violence in the Balkans. Ne plašim se highlighted the link between alcohol consumption and domestic abuse. The film's release date was timed to coincide with the United Nations' Human Rights Day.|$|E

2500|$|Emotional abuse (or {{psychological}} abuse) is {{a pattern}} of behavior that threatens, intimidates, dehumanizes or systematically undermines self-worth. According to the <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Convention,</b> psychological violence is [...] "the intentional conduct of seriously impairing a person’s psychological integrity through coercion or threats".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Convention</b> states: [...] ""violence against women" [...] is {{understood}} {{as a violation of}} human rights and a form of discrimination against women (...)".

2500|$|In day-to-day {{business}} it happens that containers do appear {{which do not}} follow the ISO 6346 identification at all; however, they are fully CSC safety approved containers. Usually these are [...] "shippers owned" [...] containers, {{which means that they}} are not owned by the carrier but supplied by the cargo owners (shippers). They may have no registered owner code and no category identifier and have no check digit. It is advisable to follow ISO 6346 as the absence of a compliant identification code causes problems for both carriers and container terminals to correctly identify the equipment and properly deliver the cargo, because computer systems require ISO 6346 conformant naming and as such missing prefixes are invented. For example, YYYY at the carrier and XXXX at the terminal causes the equipment to mismatch. Moreover, since ISO 6346 identification has become a requirement in international Customs conventions (Customs Conventions on Containers and <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Convention),</b> many Customs Administrations have begun validating that containers are marked as per the standard.|$|E

2500|$|In recent decades, {{there has}} been a call for the end of legal {{impunity}} for domestic violence, an impunity often {{based on the idea that}} such acts are private. The <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Convention</b> is the first legally binding instrument in Europe dealing with domestic violence and violence against women. The convention seeks to put an end to the toleration, in law or in practice, of violence against women and DV. In its explanatory report it acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, de jure or de facto, these forms of violence. At para 219, it states: [...] "There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator." ...|$|E
2500|$|Women's rights {{movements}} {{focus on}} ending discrimination of women. In this regard, {{the definition of}} discrimination itself is important. According to the jurisprudence of the ECHR, the right to freedom from discrimination includes not only the obligation of states to treat {{in the same way}} persons who are in [...] analogous [...] situations, but [...] also the obligation to treat in a different way [...] persons [...] who are in different situations. In this regard equity, not just [...] "equality" [...] is important. Therefore, states must sometimes differentiate between women and men – through for example offering maternity leave or other legal protections surrounding pregnancy and childbirth (to take into account the biological realities of reproduction), or through acknowledging a specific historical context. For example, acts of violence committed by men against women do not happen in a vacuum, but are part of a social context: in Opuz v Turkey, the ECHR defined violence against women as a form of discrimination against women; this is also the position of the <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Convention</b> which at Article 3 states that [...] "violence against women" [...] is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women [...] ".|$|E

For the international audience of the Istanbul Festival, the BIFO has become a well known and estimeed musical standard for many years.|$|R
