500|$|On June 14, 1832 the six {{men were}} sent from Fort Hamilton {{to work on}} Spafford Farm. The group had just {{commenced}} working when they were attacked by a band of Kickapoo warriors. The warriors had concealed themselves in [...] some trees near the farmstead and opened fire in a surprise attack. The men dropped their tools and broke for the Pecatonica River, reaching the river and making a <b>hasty</b> <b>crossing.</b> Having crossed the river, four {{of the men were}} shot as they clambered up the opposite bank.|$|E
5000|$|The {{soldiers}} {{then began}} a <b>hasty</b> retreat west, <b>crossing</b> the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing and the Passaic River at Acquackanonk BridgeIt was during Washington's retreat (beginning along a road {{which is now}} Main Street) that Thomas Paine composed his pamphlet, [...] "The American Crisis", which began with the recognized phrase, [...] "These are the times that try men's souls".|$|R
50|$|Hasty Bank is a {{hill in the}} Cleveland Hills {{range of}} the North York Moors, in {{north-east}} England. The Cleveland Way National Trail <b>crosses</b> <b>Hasty</b> Bank and is part of Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk. The north face of Hasty Bank has heavily eroded, possessing a vertical rocky face sloping steeply down to Broughton Bank. Roseberry Topping can be clearly seen from the summit which offers great views of the Tees Valley.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the poor}} {{results from the}} <b>hasty</b> earlier <b>crossing</b> attempts, greater effort was made for a coordinated and well-supported assault, with General Eddy {{deciding}} on a concentric advance to encircle the German forces around Nancy. Dieulouard (...) , located about four miles south of Pont-à-Mousson, {{was chosen as the}} new crossing site for the northern thrust of the encircling maneuver. The new plan would have the 317th Infantry Regiment cross first and secure a foothold, then for the 318th Infantry to follow and capture the high ground centered on Mousson Hill to the north. A heavy bridge would then be laid and CCA would be able to strike and capture Château-Salins, an important rail centre in the region. Because the 319th Infantry was still engaged in combat at Toul, they could not be used in this assault.|$|R
60|$|His wanderings {{brought him}} {{at one time}} to the city jail. Instead of hastening from it {{as a place of}} ill omen, and one he had cause to shun, he sat down on some steps hard by, and resting his chin upon his hand, gazed upon its rough and {{frowning}} walls as though even they became a refuge in his jaded eyes. He paced it round and round, came back to the same spot, and sat down again. He did this often, and once, with a <b>hasty</b> movement, <b>crossed</b> to where some men were watching in the prison lodge, and had his foot upon the steps as though determined to accost them. But looking round, he saw that the day began to break, and failing in his purpose, turned and fled.|$|R
2500|$|... 1968: Construction {{started on}} the M56 motorway, and it opened to Manchester Airport in 1972. (Conditions where it <b>crossed</b> <b>Hasty</b> Lane were {{unsuitable}} for a vehicle bridge, so the underbridge there is for pedestrians and bicycles only, and a cart track called Runger Lane from Yewtree Lane near its northwest end to the A538 road {{was made into a}} road to restore the connection. Some time after this, the part of Outwood Lane west of the M56 junction was renamed as part of Thorley Lane.) ...|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after the}} birth of their first son Wulf and his wife {{received}} a <b>hasty</b> summons to <b>cross</b> the sea, and arrived in time to stand by the death-bed of Guy. Wulf had been greatly moved by the storm of war that had swept over the North of England, and the terrible vengeance taken by William there. He had no pity for the traitor earls, but he grieved for the men who, but for their treachery, would have fought at Hastings. He regretted deeply the isolated risings {{in various parts of the}} country, whose only effect was to bring ruin upon whole districts and to increase the sternness and rigour of William's rule.|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} again asked herself whether {{there might not}} be some escape. That women had {{separated}} themselves from their husbands, she well knew. That pleas of ill-usage, of neglect, of harshness of temper, had been put forward and accepted by the world, to the partial enfranchisement of the unhappy wife, she had often heard. But she had also heard that in such cases cruelty must be proved. A <b>hasty</b> word, a <b>cross</b> look, a black brow would not suffice. Nor could she plead that she hated the man, that she had never loved him, that she had married him in wounded pique, because her lover--he whom she did love--had thrown her off. There was no ground, none as yet, on which she could claim her freedom. She had sold herself as a slave, and she must abide her slavery. She had given herself to this beast with the face of brass and the feet of clay, and she must endure the cold misery of his den. Separation--solitude--silence! He--that he whom her heart worshipped--he might enjoy such things; but for her--there was no such relief within her reach.|$|R
5000|$|The 82nd did not drop men on {{both sides}} of the Nijmegen bridge: all troops were dropped on the south side of the Waal river. Gavin's plan had no means to seize the Nijmegen bridge other than by frontal assault from the south. Gavin took no boats: there was no option of a river {{crossing}} until XXX Corps came up from the south. Boats requested by the 82nd Airborne from XXX Corps arrived in the afternoon, not the morning. A <b>hasty</b> daylight assault <b>crossing</b> was ordered. At about 15:00, the 3rd Battalion, 504th PIR, commanded by Major Julian Cook, began the river assault across the Waal. The American paratroopers were rowed across the Waal by members of C/307th Engineer Battalion in 26 canvas assault boats. A shortage of paddles required some troopers to paddle the craft with rifle butts. About half the boats survived the crossing under heavy fire and eleven survived the first two crossings. Before the day was over, C/307th crossed the Waal five times while ferrying across two battalions of the 504th. The surviving paratroopers then proceeded to the village of Lent on the far bank to the north end of the bridge. The costly attack was nicknamed [...] "Little Omaha" [...] in reference to Omaha Beach. 200 paratroopers were killed, while German losses exceeded 267. [...] German forces withdrew from both ends of the bridge after the XXX Corps Guards tanks secured the bridge at 18:30, D+4.|$|R
