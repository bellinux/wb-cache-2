The energy production from coal, natural gas, and <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>sources,</b> combined with the fact that Charleston serves as the center for the state's political and economic powers led us to the name of the team. We felt it was extremely important that the name reflect the entire region and are excited about the tremendous marketing opportunities that will go along with the name." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{there was a}} survey of the Koyna River as a {{potential}} <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>source.</b> After the First World War, a hydro-electric project on the Koyna river was investigated by the Tata Group. The 1928 financial crisis caused the project to be shelved. After the independence of India, it was taken over by the Government of Maharashtra. In 1951 Koyna Dam division started to look into the project. The project was approved in 1953 and work commenced in early 1954.|$|R

Amandaraga and Ban-awan Falls {{are the main}} source of the municipality's water system. Meanwhile, Amanjuray Falls is the alternate <b>hydro-electric</b> power <b>source</b> of Lawaan wherein a mini-hydro power plant is existent nearby.|$|R

In 2014, energy sources were: oil (35.0%); coal, including lignite (24.6%); natural gas (20.5%); nuclear (8.1%); <b>hydro-electric</b> and renewable <b>sources</b> (11.1%). The {{government and the}} nuclear power industry agreed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2021. It also enforces energy conservation, green technologies, emission reduction activities, and aims to meet the country's electricity demands using 40% renewable sources by 2020.|$|R

The country's household recycling rate is {{among the highest in the}} world—at around 65%. Nevertheless, the country's total greenhouse gas emissions were the highest in the EU [...] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy.|$|R
40|$|Development {{and energy}} demand are synonymous. The rapid {{industrialisation}} of Latin America {{and the high}} ranking accorded to electrification projects by the region’s development planners in the post-war period have combined to ensure a growing demand for energy in the region. This has led, at times, to various supply constraints resulting in excess demand. The response to {{the problem has been}} varied. Some countries, such as Mexico and Colombia, have addressed the problem by developing domestic extraction capacity. Others, such as Brazil, have experimented with alternative energy sources, most notably, ethanol. In Central America, the absence of known depletable energy resources allied to a shortage of foreign exchange has ensured an almost exclusive dependency upon <b>hydro-electric</b> power <b>sources</b> for electricity generation. In the case of Honduras, the reliance on hydro-electricity proved costly. Environmental degradation allied to a lack of maintenance of the country’s principal plant resulted in serious energy shortages in 1994 / 5 with electricity being rationed for up to 12 hours each day. As a direct consequence, GDP growth declined, the import bill rose due to the switch to alternative fossil fuel sources and air pollution rose due to increased generator usage. This paper traces the evolution of energy supply and demand in Honduras, showing why the crisis of the 1990 s emerged. It then forecasts future energy demand and examines the way this demand might be met. A concluding section spells out the difficult decisions small developing countries have to face in their desire to achieve economic growth without sacrificing environmental capital. ...|$|R
