40|$|The paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis on the}} role played by urbanisation and localisation economies on factor productivity of firms. A vast literature exists on this issue, conceptually presenting reasons supporting either industry size or city size as sources of external advantages. In general, the empirical analyses are based on the estimates of aggregate city or industry production functions; the limited hypotheses characterising these studies have suggested to test another methodology, based on the estimate of a production function at the firm level, and calculate how factor productivity changes according to different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and localisation economies. The methodology is applied to firms chosen in the high-tech sector, which demonstrates a high spatial concentration in particular areas of the Metropolitan Area of Milan. The result is that factor productivity is influenced by both urbanisation and localisation economies, but the latter show an increasing positive effect on factor productivity. Moreover, the size of firms {{plays an important role in}} defining the impact <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and localisation economies on firms' outcome. ...|$|R

40|$|The drivers (social) and {{pressures}} (physical) of marine debris have typically been examined separately. We redress this by using social and beach surveys at nine Tasmanian beaches, across three coastlines and within three categories <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation,</b> {{to examine whether}} people acknowledge that their actions contribute {{to the issue of}} marine debris, and whether these social drivers are reflected in the amount of marine debris detected on beaches. A large proportion (75 %) of survey participants do not litter at beaches; with age, gender, income and residency influencing littering behaviour. Thus, participants recognise that littering at beaches is a problem. This social trend was reflected in the small amounts of debris that were detected. Furthermore, the amount of debris was not statistically influenced by the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> beach <b>urbanisation,</b> the coastline sampled, or the proximity to beach access points.

40|$|Marine debris {{directly}} threatens {{and indirectly}} impacts upon marine wildlife and humans throughout the world. Proper management requires information on debris abundance, distribution and sources for specific regions. This data was previously unavailable for the Greater Sydney Region, Australia. Thus, a marine debris {{survey was conducted}} on six selected beaches from the Greater Sydney Region. Two beaches from each of three areas with differing <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> were sampled once a month for five months. Sampling was conducted from within a series of transects, zones and strata to obtain information on the abundance, distribution, composition and sources of debris. On average sampled beaches had 33. 3 items per 250 m 2 transect equating to 2, 664 items per kilometre of beach with a 20 m wide cross-shore sub-aerial zone. The vast majority (89. 8 %) of debris found was plastic, particularly hard plastic (52. 3 %) predominantly originating from storm water or beachgoers. The beaches with the highest debris density were those within the least urbanised area, possibly due to the relatively small distance « 50 km) between sample areas {{and the ability of}} debris to disperse quickly from its source and travel long distances. Significant differences in debris abundance were found between sample areas, beaches, beach strata and over time. The abundance of marine debris within the Greater Sydney Region was comparable {{to some of the most}} polluted beaches around the world, and is thus a problem that requires immediate attention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a major}} but neglected public health problem. Currently 1. 4 % of the England population has a clinical diagnosis of COPD, but the true burden of the disease has not been known with certainty, as many cases remain undiagnosed. Methods A mathematical model based on cross sectional data from {{a representative sample of}} the population in England (the Heath Survey for England 2001, n = 10, 750) was developed allowing estimates on the prevalence of COPD (defined based on the presence of airflow obstruction) to be obtained. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate and choose risk factors for inclusion in the model and to derive the prevalence estimates based on the strength of association between selected risk factors and the outcome COPD. The model allows the prevalence to be estimated in populations at national level and also at regional and large local areas, based on their compositions according to age, sex, smoking and ethnicity, and on area <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and deprivation. We applied the model to measure the prevalence of COPD in England and in some sub-groups of the population within the country. Results The prevalence of COPD in England is estimated as 3. 1 % (3. 9 % in men and 2. 4 % in women) in the population over 15 years of age, and 5. 3 % (6. 8 % in men and 3. 9 % in women) in 45 year-olds and over. There was a 7 -fold variation in the prevalence across subgroups of the population, with lowest values in Asian women from wealthy rural areas (1. 7 %), and highest in black men from deprived urban areas (12. 5 %). Conclusion The model can be used to estimate population prevalence of COPD from large general practices to national level, and as a tool to identify areas of high levels of unmet needs for COPD priority health actions. The results from the model highlight the importance of including variables other than age, sex and smoking, i. e. levels <b>of</b> deprivation, <b>urbanisation</b> and ethnicity, when estimating population prevalence of COPD. The model should be validated at local level and incorporated into case-finding strategies. </p...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: {{pregnancy}} {{care for}} vulnerable women is often {{perceived as a}} burden by caregivers as vulnerable clients require complex case management, additional time, and more often show adverse perinatal outcomes. Vulnerable clients bring about additional work strain for the caregiver, especially when the workload is high. We define client vulnerability as coexistence of psychopathology, psychosocial problems or substance use, together with features of deprivation. We investigated, {{as part of a}} national programme, whether the subjective caregiver's perception of workload and the objective registry-based caseload of vulnerable clients are in agreement, and whether a structured organisation of antenatal risk management reduces the burden associated with the perceived workload, in particular if the objective caseload is high. METHODS: we combined three data sources: (1) at the unit level (i. e. midwifery practice, obstetric unit) interview data from caregivers, from which we derived a) the (subjective) caregiver's perception of workload, b) the associated burden and c) organisational structure of antenatal risk management, (2) at the unit level perinatal registry data, from which we derived a) unit characteristics and b) (objective) unit specific caseload, and (3) at the individual client level survey data collected during the first antenatal visit, from which the prevalence of vulnerable clients was derived. The study area was the South-West Netherlands (2. 5 million inhabitants), containing areas with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and deprivation. FINDINGS: sixteen units had complete data on all measures. Generally, subjective workload and objective caseload were only weakly related, the relation being modified by the organisation of antenatal risk management. If the organisational structure of antenatal risk management was low, the experienced burden was high, even if the objective caseload was low. Highly structured antenatal risk management was associated with a medium to low burden. DISCUSSION: our observational study suggests that even a high caseload can be dealt with by structured antenatal risk management. A change from the current individual case-finding policies towards a more universal screen-like approach may thus benefit both the client and the caregiver...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Among herbal plants, {{most cases}} of {{allergic}} reactions, like seasonal inflammation of nasal mucosa, conjunctivitis and pollen asthma, {{are related to}} the allergens from grass pollen. As the blossoming and pollination of rye is known to start the pollen season of grasses, information about the airborne rye pollen count permits alerting the people allergic to certain allergens contained in rye pollen. An important cause of allergy is also the pollen from wormwood, blossoming in late summer, as its two main allergens produce cross-reactions with many other plant allergens. Objective The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the risk of allergic reactions in persons with pollinosis on the basis of the pollen calendar, analysis of concentrations of pollen grains of grass and rye, and comparison of diurnal pattern of airborne pollen grain concentrations at two sites with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> (Gudowo in the country and the city of Szczecin) in 2012 – 2014. Material and Methods The concentration of pollen was measured by the volume method. Length of the pollination season was determined by the method of 98 %, assuming that the beginning and the end of the pollen season are the days on which 1 % and 99 % of the annual sum of pollen appeared. Results The first pollen grains to appear in the air are those produced by rye, followed by those produced by grass and wormwood. The pollen seasons of grasses and wormwood started about one week earlier in Gudowo than in Szczecin, while the pollen season of rye started at almost the same time in the country and in the city. Airborne pollen counts of grasses, rye and wormwood were much higher in the country than in the city. The differences most probably result from the different floristic composition at these two sites and reflect the local contribution of the taxa studied in the country. Conclusions The risk of allergy caused by the pollen of the taxa analysed was much higher in Gudowo (in the country), than in Szczecin cit...|$|R

40|$|Urbanisation has the {{potential}} to increase the risk of parasitism on wildlife. Although some ectoparasite groups appear unaffected, different responses are hypothesised for parasites with simpler life histories such as gastrointestinal parasites. Red-browed finches (RBF) and the superb fairywrens (SFW), two native passerine birds affected by urbanisation, were examined for Coccidian parasites along an urbanisation gradient in New South Wales, Australia, in order to detect if prevalence might be directly related to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation.</b> Influence of urbanisation on Coccidian infection was differential. In RBF, the prevalence of Isospora increased significantly in more urbanised areas but prevalence did not change between breeding and non-breeding seasons. In contrast, in SFW, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> did not significantly change with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation,</b> and season exhibited no significant effects on the prevalence of coccidians. Diet, behaviour and habits are suspected to be the most influential factors on the variation seen between both species where granivorous and gregarious species are significantly infected. Since the dynamics of urban wildlife-pathogen interactions is largely unexplored, more studies are needed to corroborate if this pattern of Isospora infections can be extended to other passerine birds in cities from Australia and overseas...|$|E

40|$|Wildfires {{are by far}} {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to global biomass burning and constitute a large global source of atmospheric traces gases and aerosols. Such emissions have a considerable impact on air quality and constitute a major health hazard. Biomass burning also influences the radiative balance of the atmosphere and is thus not only of societal, but also of significant scientific interest. There is a common perception that climate change will lead to an increase in emissions as hot and dry weather events that promote wildfire will become more common. However, even though a few studies have found that the inclusion of CO 2 fertilisation of photosynthesis and changes in human population patterns will tend to somewhat lower predictions of future wildfire emissions, no such study has included full ensemble ranges of both climate predictions and population projections, including the effect <b>of</b> different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation.</b> Here, we present a series of 124 simulations with the LPJ–GUESS–SIMFIRE global dynamic vegetation–wildfire model, including a semi-empirical formulation for the prediction of burned area based on fire weather, fuel continuity and human population density. The simulations use Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP 5) climate predictions from eight Earth system models. These were combined with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and five scenarios of future human population density based on the series of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to assess the sensitivity of emissions to the effect of climate, CO 2 and humans. In addition, two alternative parameterisations of the semi-empirical burned-area model were applied. Contrary to previous work, we find no clear future trend of global wildfire emissions for the moderate emissions and climate change scenario based on the RCP 4. 5. Only historical population change introduces a decline by around 15  % since 1900. Future emissions could either increase for low population growth and fast urbanisation, or continue to decline for high population growth and slow urbanisation. Only for high future climate change (RCP 8. 5), wildfire emissions start to rise again after ca. 2020 but are unlikely to reach the levels of 1900 {{by the end of the}} 21 st century. We find that climate warming will generally increase the risk of fire, but that this is only one of several equally important factors driving future levels of wildfire emissions, which include population change, CO 2 fertilisation causing woody thickening, increased productivity and fuel load and faster litter turnover in a warmer climate...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of wetlands in urban environments is primarily {{carried out to}} assist in the removal of contaminants from wastewaters; however, these wetlands have the added benefit of providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates, fish and waterbirds. Stormwater quantity and quality is directly related to impervious area (roads, sealed areas, roofs) in the catchment. As a consequence, it would be expected that impervious area would be related to contaminant load and biodiversity in receiving waters such as urban wetlands. This study aimed to establish whether the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and its associated changes to stormwater runoff affected macroinvertebrate richness and abundance within constructed wetlands. Urban wetlands in Melbourne 2 ̆ 7 s west and south east were sampled along a gradient of urbanisation. There was a significant negative relationship between total imperviousness (TI) and the abundance of aquatic invertebrates detected for sites in the west, but not in the south east. However macroinvertebrate communities were relatively homogenous both within and between all study wetlands. Chironomidae (non-biting midges) was the most abundant family recorded at the majority of sites. Chironomids are able to tolerate a wide array of environmental conditions, including eutrophic and anoxic conditions. Their prevalence suggests that water quality is impaired in these systems, regardless of <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation,</b> although the causal mechanism is unclear. These results show some dependency between receiving wetland condition and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> of the catchment, but suggest that other factors may be as important in determining the value of urban wetlands as habitat for wildlife...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Thailand, {{since the}} first {{epidemics}} in 1958, {{there has been a}} global upward trend in incidence of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), an acute and severe form of dengue virus infection, which remains a major public health concern. The dengue is due to an arbovirus mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a mosquito living close to human communities. The intensity of the transmission (i. e. number of cases and speed of the spread of the disease) is dependant on the number of vectors, the serotype of the virus, the herd immunity and the environment. In the Central Plain of Thailand despite an apparent very homogenous environment (altitude, climate, type of agriculture) the incidence of DHF exhibits strong variations at the province and sub-province levels. A Geographical Information System using epidemiological data, as well as information about the Land-use, demography, geography, climate has been built to identify indicators likely to help to describe areas and periods at risk for dengue transmission. A particular approach is focusing on the structure of the urban environment, the main field for dengue transmission.

40|$|Toxocara canis is a {{roundworm}} that {{is common}} worldwide {{and also in}} Dutch household dogs. Adult stages of T. canis can {{be present in the}} small intestines of dogs where they produce large numbers of eggs that are shed in the environment (patent infection). Because very young dogs and humans can develop symptoms after infection with infective eggs, the current advice is to deworm all dogs four times a year. However, the vast majority of dogs older than six months will not develop a patent infection although they probably will be re-infected on a regular base. In those dogs infection will not lead to adult worms in the intestines, but the larvae will migrate to the somatic tissues and become arrested in their development, waiting to be reactivated. Reactivation of these larvae is known to occur during pregnancy in dogs. This thesis focused on a more evidence-based control policy of roundworm infections in household dogs older than six months, their contribution to the overall environmental contamination with Toxocara eggs compared with that of cats and foxes, and the owner’s attitude towards deworming, including simulating the effect of different scenario’s using different compliance of owners concerning deworming and cleaning up their dog’s faeces. A total of 570 dog owners, owning 938 dogs, participated in this study. They provided faecal samples of their dogs on a monthly basis and answered accompanying monthly questionnaires. Owners did not deworm their dogs without knowledge and consent of the project team. Coprophagy among dogs proved to be a disturbing factor for interpreting results of coproscopical examination for parasitic infections. All analyses, therefore, took coprophagy into account as a variable. The relative contribution of dogs, cats and foxes to the environmental contamination with Toxocara was estimated using a stochastic model. Household dogs accounted for 39 % of the overall egg output. However, the relative contribution of dogs, compared to household cats, stray cats and foxes, can differ significantly with the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation,</b> due to a difference in preferred habitat for these final hosts. Household cats and stray cats, when considered as one group, would transcend the relative contribution of household dogs. Simulation of different deworming compliances of owners indicated that a higher compliance than is to be expected on a voluntary basis is needed to have a meaningful effect. Risk factors were assessed in several analyses, one of which included a prospective study on recurrent Toxocara infection. A major finding was that a minority of ‘wormy animals’ was found to be responsible {{for the majority of the}} positive samples containing Toxocara eggs. Therefore, targeted treatment of these ‘wormy dogs’ might be more efficient in reducing the household dogs’ contribution to the environmental contamination with roundworm eggs than blind deworming of all household dogs...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown the impact of individual characteristics on intergenerational proximity but has largely ignored the regional dimension of such proximity. In this paper, we examine the regional variation in intergenerational proximity in the Netherlands. We address this issue by incorporating indicators of urbanisation and regional culture {{in an analysis of}} the likelihood that adult children live within daily reach (within a distance of 5 or 20 km) of their older parents. We also depict the spatial variation in intergenerational proximity in maps. Employing logistic regression on nearly 5 million parent-child dyads extracted from register data, we find that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> of the residential municipality of the two generations shows contrasting effects: a positive association for the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> of the parents' municipality, a negative association for the children's. Older parents living in areas in which more conservative and collectivist attitudes prevail {{are more likely to have}} their adult children living close to them. After accounting for the municipality dummies, the explanatory power of the model improves considerably. However, substantial spatial variation in intergenerational proximity remains largely unexplained after controlling for the regional characteristics.

40|$|Quality of life (QOL) is a {{comprehensive}} concept used to assess a society’s standard of living {{in all aspects of}} life. A significant part of the QOL assessment involves subjective measures about feelings of satisfaction and happiness, as well as related attitudes which can be easily affected by personal views and cultural differences. The increasingly globalised economy has made it necessary to have objective QOL measures that can be applied consistently to make comparisons among different geographic space. QOL is multi-dimensional in nature and often involves social, economic and environmental measures. The social and economic aspects have been examined widely by objective and subjective means. This research aims at exploring the environmental aspect of QOL, particularly in reference to geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technologies, to derive objective indicators suitable for Asian cities where the world’s most rapid economic growth and urbanisation are happening. The research was conducted in Hong Kong and 89 well-spread neighbourhoods representing different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> were delineated as the study areas. The spatial unit of a neighbourhood was fixed at 800 m x 800 m cell for consistent and meaningful comparison. GIS and RS were used to extract (from digital maps, aerial photographs, and satellite images) urban morphological characteristics at the neighbourhood level. Four domains of built environment at the neighbourhood level were identified: (i) education-health-recreation facilities, (ii) local street network, (iii) compatible land use diversity, and (iv) building footprint intensity. Their respective indicators were obtained either from official resources or derived using GIS and RS methods. The methodology employed Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of each domain into a single score. These domain scores were instrumental in grouping neighbourhoods with similar characteristics using the hierarchical clustering method. An environmental quality sub-index (EQ-I) can be computed by aggregating domain scores that have been adjusted by standardisation procedures and weighted, if desired. Regional variation of neighbourhood environmental quality can be examined visually using radar charts. The potential utility of the EQ-I was compared against the well-established social deprivation index (SDI) of Hong Kong and its ability to accommodate additional domains was also tested. It was found that the EQ-I did not yield ratings similar to those of SDI which indicate that the two indices do not measure the same metric. Although the additional domains did alter the rank order of neighbourhoods, the shifts were made in accordance with the contributing power showing the stability of the approach. Despite the environmental domains selected in this research were not all inclusive, the study did illustrate a methodological approach to collapse and combine multiple variables into a single sub-index. Indeed, the statistical approaches including factor and cluster analyses provide useful means to address the multi-dimensional and complex nature of environmental quality. The resultant scores provide simple, direct and objective measures that are replicable to other settings or cities to render international comparison. published_or_final_versionGeographyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The {{current level}} <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> in Pakistan, {{approximately}} 33 percent in 1998, is not high by global standards. But {{it is commonly}} linked with unemployment, underemployment, shortage of housing, transport and other infrastructure like water supply and sewerage. Compared {{to other areas of}} population dynamics, such as fertility and mortality, studies in the field <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and internal migration in Pakistan are rather limited. During the last three decades hardly half a dozen studies could be added in the field <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation.</b> These studies are primarily based on data generated by the different censuses. After the 1979 Population Labour Force and Migration (PLM) Survey, no nationally representative survey addressing the issue <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and internal migration could be carried out. Even regional studies could not be conducted during the last two decades. The present study is designed to utilise the 1998 census data to investigate urban population growth, pace (or tempo) <b>of</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and components <b>of</b> urban growth for the period of 1981 – 98. ...|$|R
