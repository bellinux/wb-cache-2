The term biometric data means any personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics, which allow or confirm the unique identification, such as facial images or <b>dactyloscopic</b> <b>data.</b> Genetic data are all personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of an individual, which give unique information about their physiology or health, resulting in particular from an analysis of a biological sample (Article 4).|$|E
40|$|Policing and {{judicial}} cooperation across international borders {{is now an}} expectation, with strategies to combat terrorism, organized and serious crime, as well as domestic crime problems, increasingly incorporate the exchange of forensic information and intelligence between nations. While networks of policing cooperation are not novel, their powers and capabilities have been growing {{in recent years and}} bilateral and multi-lateral agreements to exchange data between countries continue apace. With increasing demand for, and mechanisms enabling the extra-territorial exchange of evidence under mutual legal assistance, as well as direct law enforcement exchange of data there are increasing numbers of criminal investigations where evidence may have been collected, examined, or interpreted in a different country. Since the Prum Treaty of 2005, the exchange of DNA profiles, <b>dactyloscopic</b> <b>data</b> (fingerprints) and vehicle registration data has become both automated, and mandatory across the EU. This exchange of evidence, highlights some of the wider issues raised by the exchange of scientific evidence for use in criminal proceedings undertaken in a different jurisdiction from that where the evidence emanated. Such exchange mechanisms raise not just technical issues, but questions of principle that need consideration as the international exchange of forensic information and intelligence is set to increase exponentially...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of {{systems for the}} transnational exchange of information raises multiple {{issues related to the}} establishment of common infrastructures, protocols and regulation. The development and adaptation of standards is paramount in reaching operational levels of harmonization. This paper focuses on the case of a system for the improvement of crossborder cooperation in the European Union through the exchange information among databases of Member States. The Prüm Treaty and the subsequent Prüm Decisions have established a framework for the exchange of DNA profiles, <b>dactyloscopic</b> <b>data,</b> and vehicle registration data, for the purpose of combating cross-border crime and terrorism. The historical specificity of DNA profiling data in terms of the development of international standards and the sensitivity it represents for data protection regulation constitutes it as a relevant object in order to analyze the challenges raised in the context of transnational cooperation. First, this paper provides an overview of the trajectory and characteristics of DNA as an object of standardization. Second, through interviews with local actors involved in the implementation and operationalization of the network for the exchange of DNA data, the global standards are compared with practices at the local level. The adoption of minimal standards allows flexibility and autonomy at a local level, thus allowing interoperability to exist in a scenario of national differentiation. However, a relatively wide margin of discretion in terms of the routine local operation of the system can create frictions and lead to isolated solutions that can be seen as sub-optimal...|$|E
40|$|On 27 May 2005 in Prum {{was signed}} a {{convention}} between the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Austria on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration (hereinafter the Prum Treaty) improving {{the exchange of}} information and data resulting by DNA, <b>dactyloscopic</b> and vehicle <b>data</b> to regulate forms of closer cooperation between law enforcement and judicial authorities. On 23 June 2008 the Council of the European Union adopted the Prum Treaty under the Treaty on European Union with the Decisions 2008 / 615 /JHA and 2008 / 616 /JHA. On 14 July 2009 the Italian Parliament has passed the act n. 85 / 2009 published on the Ofﬁcial Journal (G. U.) n. 160 Supp. Ord. n. 108 /L G. U. General series with the title: ‘‘Adhesion of the Italian Republic to the Prum Treaty. Establishment of national DNA database (NDNADB) and the central laboratory for the NDNADB’’ {{in order to facilitate}} the identiﬁcation the perpetrators of crimes.

40|$|The key {{functional}} operability in the pre-Lisbon PJCCM {{pillar of}} the EU is the exchange of intelligence and information amongst the law enforcement bodies of the EU. The twin issues of data protection and data security within what was the EU’s third pillar legal framework therefore come to the fore. With the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU, and the increased role of the Commission in PJCCM policy areas, and {{the integration of the}} PJCCM provisions with what have traditionally been the pillar I activities of Frontex, the opportunity for streamlining the data protection and data security provisions of the law enforcement bodies of the post-Lisbon EU arises. This is recognised by the Commission in their drafting of an amending regulation for Frontex, when they say that they would prefer “to return to the question of personal data {{in the context of the}} overall strategy for information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflection to be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and home affairs field as requested by the Stockholm programme. ” The focus of the literature published on this topic, has for the most part, been on the data protection provisions in Pillar I, EC. While the focus of research has recently sifted to the previously Pillar III PJCCM provisions on data protection, a more focused analysis of the interlocking issues of data protection and data security needs to be made in the context of the law enforcement bodies, particularly with regard to those which were based in the pre-Lisbon third pillar. This paper will make a contribution to that debate, arguing that a review of both the data protection and security provision post-Lisbon is required, not only in order to reinforce individual rights, but also inter-agency operability in combating cross-border EU crime. The EC’s provisions on data protection, as enshrined by Directive 95 / 46 /EC, do not apply to the legal frameworks covering developments within the third {{pillar of the}} EU. Even Council Framework Decision 2008 / 977 /JHA, which is supposed to cover data protection provisions within PJCCM expressly states that its provisions do not apply to “Europol, Eurojust, the Schengen Information System (SIS) ” or to the Customs Information System (CIS). In addition, the post Treaty of Prüm provisions covering the sharing of DNA profiles, <b>dactyloscopic</b> <b>data</b> and vehicle registration data pursuant to Council Decision 2008 / 615 /JHA, are not to be covered by the provisions of the 2008 Framework Decision. As stated by Hijmans and Scirocco, the regime is “best defined as a patchwork of data protection regimes”, with “no legal framework which is stable and unequivocal, like Directive 95 / 46 /EC in the First pillar”. Data security issues are also key to the sharing of data in organised crime or counterterrorism situations. This article will critically analyse the current legal framework for data protection and security within the third pillar of the EU...|$|E
