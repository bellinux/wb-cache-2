40|$|In {{this work}} torque {{vectoring}} methods {{are used to}} compensate for a low performance steer-by-wire system. Currently a number of vehicle manufacturers are considering introducing steer-by-wire into their range of vehicles. Some of the key concerns for the manufacturers are safety and cost. The safety can be subdivided in {{the integrity of the}} steering system and the effect on handling. The focus of this study is the use of low cost steering actuators on a vehicle and identify its effects on the vehicle's handling response. The test vehicle is dune buggy modified to accommodate the low performance steer-by-wire system without a direct mechanical link between the steering wheel and the wheels and equipped with various sensors to data recording. In order to investigate the influence of torque vectoring system on the steer-by-wire, an <b>eight</b> degrees of <b>freedom</b> vehicle model in Matlab/Simulink has been developed. The <b>eight</b> degrees of <b>freedom</b> are longitudinal and lateral translations, yaw and roll motion and rotation of each wheel. The Matlab/Simulink model also includes the dynamics of the actuators, which is validated against the experimental data. The actuator was shown to have a bandwidth of less than 0. 3 Hz. The <b>eight</b> degrees of <b>freedom</b> model's response was validated against experimental data for both steady state and transient response up to 0. 5 g. The tyre forces and moments are implemented by using the Dugoff tyre model, which has been validated against experimentally measured data. The torque vectoring system uses the cascade approach based on a reference model, which uses a two degrees of freedom (bicycle model) to generate the reference signal for control purposes. The upper level yaw controller is based on the optimal control theory and uses the LQR (Linear-quadratic regulator) approach. The lower level wheel slip controller is based on a slidingmode structure and prevents tyre force saturation. The simulation results show that the vehicle augmented with the torque vectoring system outperforms the low performance steer-by-wire vehicle and also the vehicle with conventional steering arrangement...|$|R

40|$|An {{advanced}} design of sandwich structures does not only require {{the knowledge of}} the global stress- and deformation behaviour, but also {{the knowledge of the}} local effects, such as load singularities and the loss of stability caused by the short wave wrinkling of one (bending) or both (pressure) sandwich skins. Based on the nonlinear theory for sandwich shells with seven kinematic degrees of freedom, introduced from KÜHHORN and SCHOOP [5, 6, 7] an improved theory for plane sandwich shells with <b>eight</b> degrees of <b>freedom</b> will be presented, enabling a much better representation of the sandwich core behaviour. Due to consideration of quadratic core thickness and linear core shear strain as well as longitudinal core deformation an improved prediction of the wrinkling behaviour is succeeded even for thick cores [3] and thin skins. The kinematic quantities as well as the nonlinear-differential equations and the simplified equations of first order theory resulting from them are given. Finally applying the well known classical problems of stability loaded by pressure and bending, the efficiency of this 8 DOF-theory is demonstrated. A comparison with a detailed finite element (plain strain) calculation shows the high quality of these results. The presented sandwich theory characterized by <b>eight</b> degrees of <b>freedom</b> enables the calculation of nearly all essential sandwich phenomena even for thick cores. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that, {{in the absence}} of matter fields, the {{coupling}} of a scalar field to the non-chiral Plebanski action can be obtained by relaxing the trace component of the simplicity constraints.

Generically such theories propagate <b>eight</b> degrees of <b>freedom,</b> but here the (singular) subclass with the potential only depending on the trace of the Lagrange multiplier is displayed as the Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class of scalar-tensor theories.

In each case, the closed-loop system exhibits almost-global properties. Stability proofs for the controller design, as well as simulations of the proposed controller are presented. I...|$|R
