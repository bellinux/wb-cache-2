5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the novel}} as a {{legitimate}} literary form emerged throughout the 18th century, sensationalist and theatrical elements of fiction were being explored as grossly popular characteristics of the gothic. A common trope of the gothic novel was an excess of sentimentality, and Parsons’ The Castle of Wolfenbach is no exception. This excessive sentimentality presented itself in the <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> its heroines {{to take control of}} their worldly bodies in the face of supernatural terror, villainous deeds, or romantic gestures. Heroines swooned, wept, and “acted as if enraptured, delirious, or frenzied,” [...] whenever confronted with something out of the ordinary.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E
5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview {{wondered}} how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Haydock also {{considered}} a {{theme in the}} film to be the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the church to fulfill individual spiritual needs.

Since the student government could neither trump the University President, nor the Board of Regents, nor any Trustees, the inaction by the organization beyond minor accomplishments spoke volumes to the degree of how Marks acted as a social commentary for the campus mood.|$|R

One {{of the most important}} aspects of modern security concerns is to deal with users that are computer programs or bots. These programs pretend to be human users and exploit servers by submitting data automatically, thereby, hindering the services of the server. Security mechanism dealing with such attacks is called Completely Automated Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). This paper discusses and analyzes broad CAPTCHA mechanisms and recent researches that have either reformed or flunked, previous techniques and methods.

5|$|The 27th Regiment became {{locked in}} fierce {{fighting}} with the Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east. Other Partisan forces withdrew {{in the direction of}} Goražde.|$|E
40|$|Frequently, the {{response}} of housing markets to a large negative demand shock is a period during which the liquidity of housing declines, but the price at which transactions take place changes little. In this paper we show that a decline in liquidity can result from the <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> sellers and buyers to insure against post-shock price uncertainty. We conclude, that {{the introduction of a}} risk-sharing contingent price contract may increase the post-shock liquidity of housing by providing insurance against post-shock price uncertainty. Finally, we show that a mutually agreeable contingent price contract will always exist, even when sellers are excessively optimistic.

40|$|Ricoeur’s phenomenological hermeneutics can be {{understood}} as an anthropological hermeneutics of l’homme capable: As the human person I can speak, I can narrate, I can act, and I can feel responsible. The fundamental capabilities/incapabilities of the human person are linked to their corresponding vulnerabilities. As existing and inhabiting the world, the human person is also l’homme faillible by virtue of the very nature of being a human being. The fallibility, weakness, and suffering describe the <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> the capable person. Ricoeur’s anthropology develops as the transition from is the phenomenology of a suffering human being toward the phenomenological hermeneutics of the capable person. Any account of the human person will be always provisional, partial, and incomplete because we are finite human beings...|$|R
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E

5|$|Crypsis, or the <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> {{humans to}} {{visually}} distinguish between {{two or more}} distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (Lepilemur) and mouse lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the discussions}} on the {{doctrine}} of the Messiah continued, Astruc HaLevi emphasized that the word [...] "messiah" [...] in its Jewish and Christian meanings is completely different. Thus, he said, there is no difference of opinion between Jews and Christians over the question of his coming, rather the debate is over what a messiah really is. Afterwards, he nullified the significance of the debate. A failure in the debate cannot prove the failure of the faith, but only the <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> the arguer. The Jewish religious leaders are far from their homes and are losing their properties because of this, and their families are being harmed.

5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E
