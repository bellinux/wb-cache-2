40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>determining</b> <b>tempo</b> and timing data {{from a list of}} beat annotations. Whilst an approximation to the tempo can be calculated from the inter-beat interval, the annotations also include timing variations due to expressively timed events, phase shifts and errors in the annotation times. These deviations tend to propagate into the tempo graph and so tempo analysis methods tend to average over recent inter-beat intervals. However, whilst this minimises the effect such timing deviations have on the local tempo estimate, it also obscures the expressive timing devices used by the performer. Here we propose a more formal method for calculation of the optimal tempo path through use of an appropriate cost function that incorporates tempo change, phase shift and expressive timing. 1...|$|E
40|$|Baroque {{music is}} an area largely {{neglected}} in the music education of young horn students and wind players in general. Baroque horn repertoire is very demanding primarily due to the range. Baroque composers wrote for horn using the uppermost register of the instrument. In this range the partials are closer together, allowing for more melodic writing. This music requires an advanced level of technique, endurance, and ability. Often this repertoire is not suitable for students until they are well into their collegiate years of study. Frequently this music is performed on descant horns. Since {{only a small number}} of middle school and high school horn students continue to play after they leave their school band programs, they many never get first hand experience performing Baroque music. Vocal students are often introduced to Baroque arias early in their training. Purcell’s songs and arias are an excellent example of the literature that young voice students use. These arias and songs can be the perfect portal to Baroque music for horn students as well. Here I have created an edition of Henry Purcell’s songs and arias for young horn students. Each aria used the text as a guide for the “affect” and its impact on tone, articulation, and phrasing. The bass line is also used as a guide for <b>determining</b> <b>tempo</b> and style. Each piece is transcribed as a solo with piano accompaniment and as a duet. The goal of this edition is to use Baroque vocal music to introduce horn students to the musical concepts of expression, articulation, phrasing, and tempo...|$|E

This paper presents HERMES, an energy-efficient work-stealing language runtime.

The centerpiece of HERMES is two complementary algorithms to coordinate thread tempo: the workpath-sensitive algorithm <b>determines</b> <b>tempo</b> for each thread based on thief-victim relationships on the execution path, whereas the workload-sensitive algorithm selects appropriate tempo based {{on the size of}} work-stealing deques. We construct HERMES on top of Intel Cilk Plus’s runtime, and implement tempo adjustment through standard Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS).

40|$|Clonal interference, the {{competition}} between lineages arising from different beneficial mutations in an asexually reproducing population, {{is an important factor}} <b>determining</b> the <b>tempo</b> and mode of microbial adaptation. The standard theory of this phenomenon neglects the occurrence of multiple mutations as well as the correlation between loss by genetic drift and clonal competition, which is questionable in large populations. Working within the Wright–Fisher model with multiplicative fitness (no epistasis), we determine the rate of adaptation asymptotically for very large population sizes and show that the standard theory fails in this regime. Our study also explains the success of the standard theory in predicting the rate of adaptation for moderately large populations. Furthermore, we show that the nature of the substitution process changes qualitatively when multiple mutations are allowed for, because several mutations can be fixed in a single fixation event. As a consequence, the index of dispersion for counts of the fixation process displays a minimum as a function of population size, whereas the origination process of fixed mutations becomes completely regular for very large populations. We find that the number of mutations fixed in a single event is geometrically distributed as in the neutral case. These conclusions are based on extensive simulations combined with analytic results for the limit of infinite population size...|$|R
30|$|A <b>tempo</b> {{analysis}} <b>determines</b> the <b>tempo</b> of {{the piece}} of music. Often, as a student masters a task, the tempo of the student’s performance increases. This is especially true when learning keyboard music. Thus, the tempo can be a valuable metric for progress. To find the tempo, the inter-offset-interval (IOI) of every note is calculated. This is the duration between a note and its predecessor. Notes played simultaneously have an IOI time of zero. These zero IOIs are ignored, and the rest are clustered to find the largest cluster of IOIs using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm (Dixon 2001). This method of finding the tempo does not reliably find the tempo as per the written score {{of a piece of}} music but rather a multiple of the written tempo; but the tempo remains accurate relative to other performances of the same piece of music, making it suitable as a metric. For example, if a piece of music contains predominantly quarter notes, then the tempo algorithm will use quarter notes as the basis of the tempo. A second performance {{of the piece}} may be significantly faster, but the tempo metric will reflect this change because, since quarter notes are still predominant, it will continue to use them {{as the basis for the}} tempo.|$|R

We propose to use existing rhythm patterns and reformulate the tempo extraction problem in terms of a nearest neighbor classification problem.

30|$|The beat level tempo, {{which is}} what we are {{interested}} in at this point, {{can be viewed as a}} periodicity in the envelope function. A commonly used method to detect periodicities in a function is autocorrelation [8, 27]. The periodic autocorrelation is computed over a small window (10 seconds) of the envelope function. The index of the highest peak in the autocorrelation function (ACF) indicates the strongest periodicity. However, as findings in [28] suggest, the strongest periodicity in the signal may not always be the dominant periodicity perceived. The findings suggest an interval of preferred tapping linked to a supposed resonance between our perceptual and motor system. Still, as a first guess, which will work fairly well on music with strong beats in the preferred tapping range, the highest peak can be assumed to indicate the beat level tempo. We also have to combine the results from all bands. The simplest way is to add up the ACF of all bands and pick the highest peak in the summary ACF (SACF). <b>Determining</b> the <b>tempo</b> for each band and choosing the tempo that was detected in the majority of bands as the final tempo is an alternative method.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{division}} of reproductive labor among group members in insect societies is regulated by "queen pheromones". However, it remains controversial whether these are manipulative, i. e., actively suppress worker reproduction, or honestly signal the fertility {{status of the}} queen to which workers react in their own interest by refraining from laying eggs. Manipulative queen control is thought to lead to an evolutionary arms race between queens and workers, resulting in complex queen bouquets that diverge strongly among different populations and species. In contrast, honest signals would evolve more slowly and might therefore differ less strongly within and among species. Results We aimed at <b>determining</b> the <b>tempo</b> {{of the evolution of}} queen signals in two ways. First, we investigated whether queens of Temnothorax ants are capable of controlling egg laying by workers of their own, closely, and distantly related species. Second, we compared the species- and caste-specific patterns of cuticular hydrocarbons, which are assumed to convey information on reproductive status. In mixed-species colonies, queens were not able to fully suppress egg-laying and male production by workers of unrelated species, while workers did not reproduce under the influence of a queen from their own species. Furthermore, the chemical profiles differed more strongly among queens of different species than among the respective workers. Conclusions Our results suggest that cuticular hydrocarbons associated with fecundity are not fully conserved in evolution and evolve slightly faster than worker-specific components in the blend of cuticular hydrocarbons. While this higher rate of evolution might reflect an arms race between queens and workers, the observation that workers still respond to the presence of a queen from another species support the honest signal hypothesis. Future studies need to examine alternative explanations for a higher rate of evolution of queen-specific substances, such as an involvement of such compounds in mating. </p...|$|R

The aim of the work is the application of a cellular model {{for the study of the}} dynamics of the monochromatic urban colourists, the main principle of which is the replication of the same colour in the design of as many architectural facades of a locality as possible. The study used a ready–made cellular automaton model created in the NetLogo multi–agent programmable modelling environment. In the settings, the parameters corresponding to the statistical data of the city of Neustadt (Germany) were set. The model made it possible to control the dimensions of the matrix and time horizon, the rate of change, the initial ratio of houses of a certain colour. The evolution of the system was considered for matrices measuring 44 by 44, 20 by 20 and 10 by 10, at a time horizon of 100 cycles. The application of the cellular model allowed to significantly expand the boundaries of the analysis of urban colourists.

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 61 : 16 in length. The vocal recital {{discussed in this}} abstract presents works by six different composers and demonstrates varied styles and techniques. These works have been selected to show the singers language skills, his creative interests and technical abilities. The recital {{is divided into two}} halves containing a total of five sections. Primarily selected from 19 th and early 20 th century literature these works share underlying expressions of love; whether familial, filial or erotic in nature. Robert Schumann's (1810 - 1850) Liederkreis Op. 24 represents his first opus with words. Set to poetry by Heinrich Heine (1797 - 1856), this cycle is a melancholic reflection of youthful love. Carrying the programmatic title "Young Suffering,'' Heine's poetry is a break from the classical era and a turn toward the Romantic expressions of subjectivity, nature and erotic love, combined with an optimistic realism which seemed to appeal to the newly married Schumann. The cycle begins with the youthful optimism of Morgen steh' ich auf und frage, which becomes gradually more disturbed. The song is primarily in major but ends with a somber three note ornament in the postlude, giving a hint to the hopelessness which looms in the future for the young lover. Written in the "black key" of b-minor, no. 2, Es treipt mich hin, begins to express the restlessness of the young lover. Schumann demonstrates this restlessness in the passionate rhythmic pulse he maintains throughout the piece. There is a drastic change as restlessness gives way to a grievous wandering and questioning in no. 3, Ich vvandelte unter den Baumen. Set in the key of b-major, the piece opens with a highly polyphonic prelude which anticipates the vocal line. This anticipation is a common trait of Schumann throughout this and other cycles. The young lover's questioning goes unanswered and likewise the song seems to be left unfinished, ending without a real cadenza on a four-six chord. The young lover turns to thoughts of death in Lieb' liebchen, leg's Handchen. In this song syncopation is used with programmatic effect to represent the beating of the young lover's heart, as well as for dramatic effect {{at the end of each}} quatrain. Both no. 5, Schone Wiege meiner Leiden and no. 6, Warte, warte wilder Schiffsmann speak of the young man's decision to leave Europe. In no. 5, Schumann uses a gentle sighing accompaniment to convey melancholy resignation to the departure. Eventually, this gives way to more aggressive accusations expressed through synchopatioris and lengthy running figures in the piano. The thought of leaving is further examined through sudden modulations and tritonic leaps in no. 6. A more tranquil sense seems to settle over the young lover in the strophic and hymn-like song, Berg' und Burg en schau 'n henmter. A unique mannerism in the cycle can be clearly identified in this song. This is Schumann's tendency, for purely musical effect, to repeat the final line or phrase of Heine's poems. No. 8, Anfangs woll't ich fast verzagen is the shortest of the nine songs. Here the young lover seems to have reached the culmination of his melancholy. In this subtle and resigned piece Schumann establishes a solid rhythmic pattern which he maintains until the pianissimo retardation of the final words. In the true spirit of the romanticist, Heine's poem brings a new angle to the young lover in the final song of Schumann's cycle, Mit Myrten und Rosen. This song expresses a belief in the eternal, the unending; the belief that the young man's love, and likewise Schumann's music, will live again when eyes gaze upon his words. Schumann captures this element with a <b>determined</b> <b>tempo</b> which maintains a sense of the world-weary lover. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Understanding {{evolutionary}} {{processes that}} drive genome reduction requires <b>determining</b> the <b>tempo</b> (rate) and the mode (size {{and types of}} deletions) of gene losses. In this study, we analysed five endosymbiotic genome sequences of the gamma-proteobacteria (three different Buchnera aphidicola strains, Wigglesworthia glossinidia, Blochmannia floridanus) to test if gene loss could be driven by the selective importance of genes. We used a parsimony method to reconstruct a minimal ancestral genome of insect endosymbionts and quantified gene loss along {{the branches of the}} phylogenetic tree. To evaluate the selective or functional importance of genes, we used a parameter that measures the level of adaptive codon bias in E. coli (i. e. codon adaptive index, or CAI), and also estimates of evolutionary rates (Ka) between pairs of orthologs either in free-living bacteria or in pairs of symbionts. Results Our results demonstrate that genes lost {{in the early stages of}} symbiosis were on average less selectively constrained than genes conserved in any of the extant symbiotic strains studied. These results also extend to more recent events of gene losses (i. e. among Buchnera strains) that still tend to concentrate on genes with low adaptive bias in E. coli and high evolutionary rates both in free-living and in symbiotic lineages. In addition, we analyzed the physical organization of gene losses for early steps of symbiosis acquisition under the hypothesis of a common origin of different symbioses. In contrast with previous findings we show that gene losses mostly occurred through loss of rather small blocks and mostly in syntenic regions between at least one of the symbionts and present-day E. coli. Conclusion At both ancient and recent stages of symbiosis evolution, gene loss was at least partially influenced by selection, highly conserved genes being retained more readily than lowly conserved genes: although losses might result from drift due to the bottlenecking of endosymbiontic populations, we demonstrated that purifying selection also acted by retaining genes of greater selective importance. </p...|$|R

Two traverses across the coastal lowlands, escarpment and plateau top are used to <b>determine</b> the <b>tempo</b> and styles of response of the landscape to the continental breakup and sea-floor spreading of the Tasman Sea (85 Ma). The three prevailing models of escarpment evolution namely retreat into a downwarped rift shoulder, escarpment retreat and excavation in place on a high elevation rift shoulder with flexural rebound are described and tested using a previously untested combination of apatite fission track and (U/Th) /He data. The thermochronological data indicate that the coast was affected by a denudational pulse that peaked around 120 - 100 Ma and that was extinguished by the time of sea-floor spreading. The rapid denudational event caused the removal of 3 - 4. 5 km (depending on the geothermal gradient) of crust at the coast and of approximately 2 km at the present base of the escarpment. The thermochronological data are inconsistent with the downwarped rift shoulder model and the apatite (U-Th) /He data indicate that, while the coast was denuded very rapidly, the coastal lowlands were excavated in place at a much lower pace, and the escarpment reached its present position no later than 60 Ma. This suggests that during continental extension and breakup, rates of denudation at the coast were approximately 80 - 30 m/Myr (depending on the geothermal gradient), whereas {{at the base of the}} present escarpment they were about 10 - 5 m/Myr. The period after sea-floor spreading was characterised by stability and low rates of erosion. The pre-breakup topography, reconstructed using the backstacking technique, is characterised by a considerable relief in the area of the present escarpment. This result confirms the hypothesis that the escarpment evolved pinned to its present position. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{balance of}} {{selection}} acting through different fitness components (e. g. fecundity, mating success, survival) <b>determines</b> the potential <b>tempo</b> and trajectory of adaptive evolution. Yet {{the extent to}} which the temporal dynamics of phenotypic selection may vary among fitness components is poorly understood. Here, we compiled a database of 3978 linear selection coefficients from temporally replicated studies of selection in wild populations to address this question. Across studies, we find that multi-year selection through mating success and fecundity is stronger than selection through survival, but varies less in direction. We also report that selection through mating success varies more in long-term average strength than selection through either survival or fecundity. The consistency in direction and stronger long-term average strength of selection through mating success and fecundity suggests that selection through these fitness components should cause more persistent directional evolution relative to selection through survival. Similar patterns were apparent for the subset of studies that evaluated the temporal dynamics of selection on traits simultaneously using several different fitness components, but few such studies exist. Taken together, these results reveal key differences in the temporal dynamics of selection acting through different fitness components, but they also reveal important limitations in our understanding of how selection drives adaptive evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{contemporary}} issues of informatization of educational process in higher education {{through the use of}} electronic classbooks. The article deals with the concept and content of the electronic textbook examples of foreign experience in the use of such training facilities. Also, there is question of didactic features of the use of electronic classbooks in the framework of students‟ personal work. Support for the full cycle of didactic electronic textbook means having built into it a pedagogical goal - to achieve acceptable results all students mastering topics - and the means to achieve this by laying individual trajectory of each student based on interactivity. Additionally, the article says that the work of the electronic textbook has all the features of distance learning, the learning process using the electronic textbook should be organized as a process of blended learning. At the same time the student himself <b>determines</b> the duration, <b>tempo,</b> and time of the work. The article also highlighted the benefits that electronic textbook gives the participants of the educational process that leads {{to the conclusion that the}} electronic textbook, being modern means of education significantly improves the quality and effectiveness of training, the motivation of students and optimizes the work of the teacher...|$|R
