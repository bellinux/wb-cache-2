Our experimental results show that our approach can find good composite operators to effectively extract useful features.

40|$|Formal {{modelling}} {{techniques that}} employ principles of finite state automata have been increasingly used for shop-floor control. These approaches have {{focused primarily on}} unmanned systems where the self-contained logic {{for control of the}} systems is embedded within the model(s). To <b>date,</b> human <b>operators</b> are seldom configured within the modelling detail required for these systems. The result has been that the interface of humans within automatic systems has been limited. In general, humans performing physical activities in an automatic system must mimic the detailed responses normally transmitted via control computers and equipment, making the human interaction painful and prone to error. This paper discusses (1) the formal modelling specifics required for the control of such an automated shop floor system; and (2) the role and interactions of the human primarily in automatic systems. The human in the automatic manufacturing system addressed here serves primarily as a material handler and material transporter, providing almost unlimited possibilities regarding the accessibility of product flow from any system resource to any other system resource—a major constraint in many operational systems. The impact on the complexity of the accessibility graph, issues related to automatically controlling such a system and the human interactions within such a system are also developed.

Their {{study has been}} revolutionized lately, due to the systematic use of the Fitzpatrick function. Pioneered by Penot and Svaiter, a topic of recent interest has been the representation of maxi-mal monotone operators by so-called autoconjugate functions. Two explicit constructions were proposed, the first by Penot and Zălinescu in 2005, and another by Bauschke and Wang in 2007. The former requires a mild con-straint qualification while the latter {{is based on the}} proximal average. We show that these two autoconjugate representers must coincide for continuous linear monotone operators on reflexive spaces. The continuity and the linearity assumption are both essential as examples of discontinuous linear operators and of subdifferential operators illustrate. Furthermore, we also construct an infinite family of autoconjugate representers for the identity operator on the real line...|$|R

Combined {{with the emergence of}} a wide spectrum of threats -sabotage, terrorism, disease, natural disasters- one faces a whole new arena of large-scale emerging risks and crises involving critical networks in which failure to operate can have debilitating impacts on an entire country and even abroad. Strategic and operational answers have to be developed to deal with such events and improve collective preparation through the creation of specific partnerships. In the aftermath of 2001 Anthrax crisis we suggested launching an ambitious debriefing process on the Anthrax episode: a large pilot study, with a clear strategic view consisting on bringing some hallmarks to help postal operators at the highest executive level. This led to the "Paris Initiative", with senior executives of postal sectors from 30 countries meeting in Paris one year after the international crisis to share their experience gained throughout this "out of the box" episode and suggest new avenues of international partnerships. An innovative international platform for immediate cross-organizational response capacity resulted from that initiative too; a partnership enabling the necessary common learning process. To <b>date</b> postal <b>operators</b> have been among the very few to launch such an innovative process to understand and meet the collective challenge of an increasingly interdependent world.

Beyond this specific pilot initiative, some strategic clues are suggested for successfully applying the developed framework to other critical sectors.

40|$|Objective Levator ani muscle {{avulsion}} {{is found}} in 15 - 30 % of parturients and is associated with recurrence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) following surgery, although most published evidence on recurrence relates to postoperative diagnosis. We performed a study {{to determine whether a}} diagnosis of avulsion after pelvic floor surgery {{can be used as a}} proxy for preoperative diagnosis. Methods This was a retrospective study of 207 patients who were seen before and after surgery for POP between February 2007 and May 2013. All assessments included a three/four-dimensional transperineal tomographic ultrasound examination. Volume data were stored and analyzed at a later <b>date</b> by an <b>operator</b> who was blinded against all clinical data. The primary outcome measure was agreement between preoperative and postoperative diagnoses of avulsion, as evaluated by Cohen's kappa. Secondary outcome measures were the associations of pre-and postoperative diagnoses of levator avulsion with prolapse recurrence, defined as International Continence Society POP-Q Stage >= 2 in any compartment. Results Mean follow-up after surgery was 1. 3 (range, 0. 3 - 5. 5) years. Levator avulsion was found preoperatively in 111 (53. 6 %) patients and postoperatively in 109 (52. 7 %). The kappa value for the association between pre-and postoperative avulsion was 0. 864 (95 % CI, 0. 796 - 0. 933), signifying high agreement. The odds ratio of prolapse recurrence in women with a preoperative diagnosis of avulsion was 2. 5 (95 % CI, 1. 3 - 4. 5) and in those with a postoperative diagnosis it was 2. 3 (95 % CI, 1. 3 - 4. 2). Conclusions The diagnosis of levator avulsion by tomographic pelvic floor ultrasound is equally valid before and after pelvic reconstructive surgery for POP, and both diagnoses show excellent agreement. This implies that a postoperative diagnosis of avulsion can be used as a proxy for preoperative diagnosis. Hence, avulsion can be identified postoperatively and used for subgroup analysis in prospective surgical intervention trials to define high-risk patientsGE Medical System...|$|R
40|$|Canadian {{hard rock}} mine {{extraction}} practices have commonly created shallow stopes, 12 % {{of which have}} caved to surface, from instabilities originating from stope hangingwalls, crowns or footwalls. To <b>date,</b> however, mine <b>operators</b> have applied few of the available data gathering and design tools {{to strike a balance}} between maximum economic excavation dimension and stope viability. The preference has been to use personal mining experience. Several common rock mass environments are surveyed as well as the various ways in which shallow stopes have failed. It has been found that these rock masses develop gravity-induced movement in the form of plug failures, ravelling of rock blocks, strata failures, chimneying disintegration, and rock mass block caving. New failure-specific analytical equations are developed here for these common failure mechanisms. They address the mechanics of the failure process and incorporate the capability to arrive at the ultimate failure outline, for comparison to the location of the bedrock surface. This research has shown that: plug failures occur along steep, uninterrupted discontinuities bounding large blocks. Plug failure potential reduces substantially with confining compressive stress, discontinuity inclination, the absence of low friction surfaces and shearing of intact rock interrupting the discontinuity. Ravelling requires little peripheral confining stress for stabilization and prevention of block falls or slides. However, inherent conditions such as shallow dipping or vertically dipping joints can cause block falls to develop to surface. Low confining stresses, resulting from multiple stope extraction in orthogonal horizontal directions, would offer conditions suitable for plug and ravelling failures. Strata failures are caused by excessive stope spans, but the limited loading received from above strata is such, that the failure cavity created is of limited vertical extent, some 25 % of the stope width. Chimneying disintegration occurs in weak rock masses with low cohesion, over narrow openings that can be as deep as 275 m. The onset of chimneying disintegration can be created by compressive stresses, but develops as a result of mobilization of the rock mass by gravity in active shear. Block caving requires large spans to develop, and stabilizing could be overcome from arching stresses overcoming bulk arching strength. Controlling instability elements are tabulated for these failure mechanisms. A limit equilibrium correlation between span and cohesion for chimneying disintegration is presented, and the controlling limits between the occurrence of chimneying disintegration and block caving is discussed. Ravelling and chimneying disintegration are the most expected failure mechanisms for shallow stopes of hard rock mines. Although failure of the shallow stope may start around its periphery, stope failure to surface would likely occur in or close to the surface crown pillar. Although the analytical equations developed require input of in situ stresses defined by numerical modelling in order to yield a precise answer, conventional numerical modelling or empirical methods are shown to be unable to predict stope failures as the analytical equations have. A step-by-step stability analysis procedure is presented, incorporating rockmass environment, expected failure mechanism(s), and applicable data gathering and anlytical methods.
