2500|$|Ford {{gave the}} Escort‐based Orion saloon a similar makeover. Carried {{over from the}} {{previous}} range was the 3-speed automatic which was ultimately replaced late in the production run with {{a variant of the}} CTX stepless gearbox as first used in the Fiesta a couple of years earlier. A luxurious Orion 1600E with leather seats, fuel <b>injection,</b> alloy <b>wheels,</b> and a Ghia trim was produced during 1989 and 1990. A total of 1,600 were made, with 1,000 of these having leather trim. The Orion range was also broadened to include a more basic [...] "L" [...] trim for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Though the {{previous}} generation Ninja 250 had a peak power advantage of , the new version's 20 or 30 percent increase in mid-range power allows the bike to pull from 3,000 rpm where previously {{it had to be}} revved to 4,000 rpm.The U.S. -J model uses dual carburetors like the -F model, but the European, Brazilian and Thai models have fuel <b>injection.</b> The <b>wheels</b> were increased in size to 17 inches, the front suspension was improved, and the brake rotors were replaced with a larger petal shape. On the carbureted version, a fuel gauge was added in place of the temperature gauge. With the additional and redesigned equipment, the EX250-J suffered a 10 kg increase in wet weight over its predecessors.|$|R
50|$|Cosmetic tuning {{may include}} {{changing}} the interior (such as changing the shift knob and steering wheel as an example) and exterior decoration, {{installation of a}} DVD combined with a powerful sound system, adding neon headlights and other aftermarket lighting systems to name but a few. Performance tuning can include the modification of the car's aerodynamics, adding a nitrous oxide <b>injection</b> system, changing <b>wheels</b> and tires, chip tuning, installation of a weighted gear knob and a short shifter, changing filters and so on.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on design of {{adjustable}} in-line skates. Using this design, users can set its length to their shoes. Adjustable length can cover up to three shoe length sizes. Traditional wood and steel designs are now almost fully replaced by plastic. Plastics are modern materials that {{have a lot of}} useful features. They have lower density than steel, while maintaining acceptable stiffness. Major part of the design can be manufactured using plastic <b>injection</b> molding and <b>wheels</b> are made by casting technology. Remaining parts include standardized stainless steel bolts with threaded inserts and aluminum rivets. Major features, setting this design apart include stable 3 -wheel platform, fast Velcro fixing and built-in hex driver...|$|R
5000|$|The CA16DE is a 1.6 L (1598 cc) engine {{produced}} from 1987 through 1989. It produces [...] @6400 rpm and 137 Nm @5200 rpm. Bore and stroke is 78.0 mm and 83.6 mm. It was a 16-valve DOHC engine with multiport fuel <b>injection,</b> for front <b>wheel</b> drive use. North American versions used Nissan's NICS (Nissan Induction Control System), which {{opened up the}} secondary intake ports to each cylinder via a butterfly valve in each port. Activated at 3,900 rpm, this improved flow and performance resultingly. Additionally, on activation of the secondaries under a heavy load the fuel injection also went from sequential mode to simultaneous-pulse mode. These features were also found on North American CA18DE engines.|$|R
40|$|The {{martensitic}} {{transformation and}} the solidification structures of Mn 49. 3 Ni 43. 7 Sn 7. 0 alloy ribbons prepared by melt-spinning were investigated {{by means of}} scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. In those experiments special attention was given to melt spinning processing parameters such as the linear surface speed of the copper <b>wheel</b> rotating, the <b>injection</b> overpressure and the distance between <b>wheel</b> and <b>injection</b> quartz tube. Transformation entropy was found higher when increasing linear surface speed or the distance from <b>injection</b> point to <b>wheel.</b> The resulting samples showed chemical compositions close to the nominal ones and, at room temperature, crystallized in a monoclinic single-phase martensite with 14 M modulation (without a significant variation in the cell parameters). Strong dependence of ribbon thickness on processing parameters was found. The average grain size varied between 1. 6 and 6. 6 mu m, while the start temperature of the martensitic temperature varied from 394 to 430 KThis {{research was supported by}} the projects AP/ 039058 / 11.

40|$|Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is {{characterized}} by a self-imposed starvation and is often accompanied by excessive exercise that results in severe malnutrition and sometimes death. Behavioural and pharmacological treatments of AN need to be improved. In rats, acute 3 h daytime wheel access suppresses ad lib feeding over the subsequent night relative to no wheel controls, a phenomenon that has been suggested as an animal model of AN. This acute wheel induced feeding suppression (WIFS), can be induced reliably when rats are given limited wheel access exposure during the light cycle (Lattanzio 2 ̆ 6 Eikelboom, 2003). The acute WIFS is useful because {{it can be used to}} test the effects of pharmacological agents, in a paradigm where the duration of wheel running and its effects are tightly defined. Chronic chlorpromazine injections can minimize the severity of activity anorexia (AA) procedure (Routtenberg, 1968), a related rat model of AN (Epling, Pierce 2 ̆ 6 Stephan, 1983), by attenuating wheel running. Experiment 1 tested the acute effects of a one-time chlorpromazine injection (2 mg/kg IP) on the acute WIFS in 40 adult male rats. Animals were divided into five treatment groups (n= 8) : drug before wheel access (DW); drug after wheel access (WD); drug with locked wheel access (DNW); saline with locked wheel access (SNW); and saline with wheel access (SW). Half of each of the three control groups (DNW, SNW and SW) received <b>injections</b> before <b>wheel</b> access and half were injected after the wheel access period. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure except a broader range of chlorpromazine doses was tested (0. 25, 0. 50, 1 and 2 mg/kg). Both studies show that while chlorpromazine (at 1 and 2 mg/kg) did not attenuate feeding or wheel running, it blocked the acute WIFS. At doses of 0. 25 and 0. 50 mg/kg chlorpromazine had no effect. Because the pharmacological profile of chlorpromazine implicates the serotonin, histamine and dopamine systems in the acute WIFS (and potentially AN), future work should look at drugs with more specific modes of action to identify which neurotransmitter systems may be involved. The acute WIFS procedure may be useful for screening potential drug treatments for AN, where exercise is often elevated and feeding is suppressed...|$|R
