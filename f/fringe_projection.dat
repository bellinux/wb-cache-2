40|$|Non-contact {{surface profilometry}} techniques, {{especially}} the phase-measuring profilometry, have been evolved dramatically over recent years. Besides the simple triangulation configuration with a <b>fringe</b> pattern <b>projection</b> system and digital imaging system, efficient computational surface profilometry techniques have also drawn tremendous attention from both academia {{and a wide}} range of applications. In the semiconductor industry, high-precision and high-speed, automated optical inspection systems are urgently needed to ensure high quality of semiconductor devices and yield improvement on the production and assembly line. However, by assuming the measured object to be stationary, conventional approaches are not suitable for surface profilometry of moving objects. Moreover, different sources of error such as the low contrast fringe patterns on the measured object, the unevenness in the illumination and the perspective projection effect from the optics will decrease the performance of surface profilometry. To meet these challenges, we have built <b>fringe</b> pattern <b>projection</b> prototypes with projector and camera arrays for surface profilometry of moving objects along the conveyor belt. This design helps to enlarge the field of view with parallel processing. In addition, we have presented an optimization framework to investigate the sources of the error for surface profilometry and generalize various computational surface profilometry approaches under different scenarios. Under this framework, first, we investigate two important factors determining the precision of surface profilometry, namely, the condition number of the phaseshift matrix and the fringe contrast within the images of the projected fringe patterns. Then, a regularized phase-shift algorithm has been proposed to improve the reconstruction results at the low contrast regions such as on the substrate of the semiconductor devices. Second, we study the intensity fluctuation caused by the uneven illumination for surface profilometry of moving objects. After that, an illumination-reflectivity-focus model has been suggested to describe the unevenness and an illumination-invariant phase-shift algorithm has been developed to handle this uneven illumination effect. Third, the perspective projection effect from the optics also affects the accurate phase-shift estimation for a moving object. Therefore, we propose a general polynomial phase-measuring profilometry model to establish the relationship between the phase-shift and height variation for each measured point. Accordingly, a polynomial phase-shift algorithm with error compensation technique has been put forward to improve the performance of the surface profilometry for moving objects. Both simulation and real experiments from the prototype have been conducted to verify the improvement on the performance of the proposed methodologies. Furthermore, these research results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented optimization framework for investigating the sources of error for surface profilometry. Moreover, the proposed computational surface profilometry techniques and the corresponding <b>fringe</b> pattern <b>projection</b> systems have been used in automated optical inspection systems for yield improvement on the production line in the semiconductor industry. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

In combination with deviation analysis algorithms, errors in fabrication lines can be found promptly to minimize rejections. However, some fields cannot be covered by the classical <b>fringe</b> <b>projection</b> approach. Due to shadowing, filigree form elements on narrow or internal carrier geometries cannot be captured. To overcome this limitation, a fiberscopic micro <b>fringe</b> <b>projection</b> sensor was developed [1]. The new device is capable of resolutions of less than 15 m with uncertainties of about 35 m in a workspace of 3 x 3 x 3 mm.

This is why cosmetic care and makeup products are of great importance. But how to evaluate their activity?Many methods of in vivo measurements exist to evaluate its color or shine, but the evaluation of a product activity on skin surface is much more complicated [...] The relief of the skin and even more its microrelief, are largely responsible for its optical properties and therefore the image it refers. Many products have a filling or a tensor effect, modifying the depth and width of the microfolds that compose the microrelief. It is consequently necessary to measure and characterize the skin surface before and after the application of a cosmetic product with great precision. More precise than 3 D scanners, or the <b>fringe</b> <b>projections</b> in vivo, light interferometry allows making a topographical survey of the skin surface with an accuracy of a few tens of nanometers. The topography by light interferometry is developed by the Polytec company whose experience in measuring equipment is no longer to be proved. This technology used in particular in the control of mechanical parts of aeronautics, offers a lateral resolution of approximately 10 μm and a vertical resolution of less than 20 nm. Depending on the light interference reflected {{from the surface of the}} skin, this technology is sensitive to vibrations which avoids its in vivo use. To benefit from this technology usually reserved for the world of precision micromechanics, we have developed a support to put under tension a human living skin explant and to maintain it in survival ex vivo. This support specially designed and printed in 3 D allows stretching the skin on a reservoir of culture medium while respecting a tension similar to the in vivo conditions. The tension of the skin was measured and verified by cutometry. This measurement can also be performed during the study which can last up to 10 days. The skin thus stretched can be topographed and treated by different products. So it will be very simple to measure the roughness of the surface of the skin, the depth of its folds or their width. We applied on the surface of the skin three products, two with smoothing and filling activity. We showed a decrease in the average depth of the cutaneous microfolds as well as a decrease of the roughness of the skin. If an immediate effect can be observed in a few minutes, the ex vivo character of this model also allows evaluating a biological activity which reinforces in depth this surface-visible effect.

However the technologies aforementioned are limited to narrow fringe stripes, because wide fringe stripes decrease the quality of sinusoidal curve generated by defocusing technology [10]. In order to solve this problem, Recently more improved methods has been researched. Wang Y [11] brings dithering technique into profilometry, and shows its ability to improve the fringe quality, especially for wide fringes. However the dithering techniques are originally developed for global similarity. Jiang H [12] proposes to use a kind of triangle pattern to get the sinusoidal curve. It {{has the potential to}} be used as the wide stripes pattern, but the boundary of triangle is a straight line which will affect the quality of defocusing stripes. Xiao Y [13] proposes to combine intensity and phase to solve wide stripes. Besides the accuracy of the narrow stripes and wide stripes are compared. In order to reduce the errors caused by wide stripes, Fu Y, et al. [14] propose a non-uniform periodical binary <b>fringe</b> defocusing <b>projection.</b> Xian and Su [15] develop the area modulation grating technique.

The process of shifting is based on the two trapezoid with phase shift T/ 2 where T is the period of every trapezoid. Because it only need two patterns, it is more applicable to be used as wide stripes. But this pattern should be combined into at least eight RGB color images. Su [17] uses the area method to generate wide stripes. The advantage of this method can get high quality sinusoidal, but the process is time-costing.|$|R

Among others, structured light <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> approaches have proven {{to be one of the}} most promising techniques. Traditionally, the typical approach to <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> 3 D sensing involves generating fringe images via interferometric procedures, however, more recent developments in the area of digital display have seen researchers adopting Digital Video Projection (DVP) technology for the task of fringe manufacture. The ongoing and extensive exploitation of DVP for <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> 3 D sensing is derived from a number of key incentives the projection technology presents relative to the more traditional forms of projection. More specifically, DVP allows for the ability to accurately control various attributes of the projected fringe image at high speed in software, along with the capabilities to develop multi-channel techniques via colour projection. Furthermore, considering the typical DVP source is capable of projecting a standard 24 bit bitmap computer generated image, when interfaced to a personal computer, DVP makes for a very affordable projection source. However, despite the aforementioned incentives, in contrast to the more traditional methods of generating fringe images, the digitally projected fringe signal presents a number of shortcomings which ultimately hinder the effective application of the technology for <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> 3 D sensing. This thesis aims to improve the effectiveness of the deployment of DVP technology for <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> 3 D sensing approaches. The proposed initiative is facilitated through extensive analysis of the application of DVP technology for fringe processing, and furthermore by the proposal of new digital fringe calibration procedures. Firstly, this work demonstrates a comprehensive survey of current <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> 3 D sensing approaches including an introductory review of the rudimentary notion of projecting fringes for 3 D data acquisition. The survey also provides a thorough description of the evolution of the three major forms of fringe processing i. e. Fringe Phase Stepping Fourier Fringe analysis and Direct Detection. The limitations of DVP for <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> are demonstrated through the development of a novel fringe phase emulation approach. The phase emulation approach is subsequently employed to establish empirical insight into the application of DVP technology for <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection.</b> More specifically, the preliminary empirical analysis is used to test the veracity of the application of the two chief DVP technologies (Liquid Crystal Display, LCD and Digital Light Processing, DLP, Texas Instruments) for <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection.</b> Through this study the camera / projector non-linear intensity response is shown to be the single most significant shortcoming inherent to DVP based <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> implementations. Following the findings of the preliminary empirical analysis the influence of the Display Gamma attributes of the projection system is extensively investigated. The harmonic structure of a typical digitally projected fringe signal is examined and an approximate analysis framework proposed. The framework is subsequently utilised to form a set of equations defining the true sensitivity of a range of highly exploited fringe processing techniques. The approximate analysis is later verified and the practical significance of the findings demonstrated. Through this study the true nature of the Display Gamma related phase measuring residual error is revealed. With the aid of a verified framework, investigations into additional Display Gamma related <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> phenomena is undertaken. More specifically, the optimisation of digitally projected fringes by fringe parameter manipulation is demonstrated. The temporal nature of digitally projected fringe images is studied for the well exploited single shot Fourier Transform Profilometry technique and the digital fringe harmonic dependence on the projector optical modulation transfer function is revealed. Subsequently, the elimination of Display Gamma related <b>Fringe</b> <b>Projection</b> phase measuring residual error for phase stepping techniques by projector defocus optimisation is shown. Finally, a novel digital fringe calibration approach ideal for minimum shot fringe processing techniques is proposed. The calibration procedure is centered on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to correct the non-linear intensity distortion associated with the camera / projector system. Unlike previously proposed gamma correction techniques, the neural fringe calibration technique requires no additional data acquisition with effective calibration requiring no more than a single cross-section of a reference fringe. The neural network fringe calibration approach is also shown to significantly outperform simple filter based techniques of similar computational complexity. Given the reduced data requirements for the neural approach its application for multi-channel fringe calibration is also considered...|$|E

It has wide applications in the automotive, aerospace, semiconduc-tor, and other industries. In particular, the application of this technology to product-quality inspection and process control can yield tremendous cost savings and reduce lead times. <b>Fringe</b> <b>projection</b> profilometry {{is based on the}} principle that periodic fringe patterns can be projected onto an object’s surface, and the distorted patterns caused by its depth variation recorded from different directions. The phase distributions of these pat-terns are often recovered by phase-shifting techniques 1, 2 or methods based on Fourier-transformation analysis. To recon...|$|E
40|$|Phase-shifting <b>fringe</b> <b>projection</b> is an {{effective}} method for 3 D-shape measurements. Conventional <b>fringe</b> <b>projection</b> systems utilize a digital projector that images fringes into the measurement plane. The performance of such systems {{is limited to the}} visible spectral range, as most projectors experience technical limitations in UV or IR spectral ranges. However, for certain applications these spectral ranges are of special interest. A novel fringe projector was developed {{on the basis of a}} single tailored free-form mirror. The freeform mirror generates a sinusoidal fringe pattern by redistribution of light. Phase-shifting can be realized by a slight rotation of the free-form mirror. In this system, the fringe pattern is generated by illuminating the free-form surface and not by the classical technique. As the system is based on a single mirror, it is wavelength independent in a wide spectral range and therefore applicable in UV and IR spectral ranges. Additionally it does not feature any chromatic aberrations. We present the design and realization of this novel <b>fringe</b> <b>projection</b> system. The tailored freeform mirror is realized using ultra-precision turning. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the novel measurement system in VIS and UV spectral range...|$|E
