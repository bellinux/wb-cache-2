5|$|<b>How</b> <b>great</b> <b>the</b> {{glory of}} Origen was, appears {{from the fact}} that Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also {{from the fact that}} he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E

On 7 September 1932, a commemorative service {{was held in}} Baghdad in his memory. Prime Minister Yasin Pasha Al-Hashimi published a eulogy in an Arabic daily newspaper in which he praised the late Sir Sassoon’s character, culture, his outstanding personality, his vast knowledge, sense of duty and the proper fulfilment of that duty no matter <b>how</b> <b>great</b> <b>the</b> sacrifice was in time or in life. He said that the stupendous efforts which had been exerted by the deceased in regulating and establishing on a solid footing, {{the affairs of the}} Kingdom of Iraq during the mandatory regime, will be remembered by future generations. All leading Arabic daily newspapers similarly eulogised the late Sir Sassoon’s character and achievements, saying that the services which had been rendered by the deceased for the welfare of his country will immortalise his great name, adding that his death was an irreparable loss to the nation.|$|E

I {{wanted it to be}} a whole thing that people would listen to all the way through with everything related and balanced, the tempos and moods offsetting each other, and I hope that's what it sounds like." [...] In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing <b>how</b> <b>great</b> <b>the</b> album was.|$|E

He graded [...] "Believe it Or Not, Joe's Walking On Air" [...] 9.3 out of 10. Brad Trechak of TV Squad also praised the episode, stating [...] "Family Guy is starting to stick to what it does best", though he called the ending [...] "somewhat predictable".

500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{believe the}} film forecast the 1994 Republican Revolution {{and used the}} image of Forrest Gump to promote movement leader Newt Gingrich's traditional, conservative values. Jennifer Hyland Wang observes the film idealizes the 1950s, as made evident {{by the lack of}} [...] "whites only" [...] signs in Gump's southern childhood, and [...] "revisions" [...] the 1960s as a period of social conflict and confusion. She argues this sharp contrast between the decades criticizes the counterculture values and reaffirms conservatism. As viewed by political scientist Joe Paskett, this film is [...] "one of the best films of all time". Wang argued the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a [...] "traditional version of recent history" [...] to gear voters towards their ideology for the congressional elections. In addition, presidential candidate Bob Dole cited the film's message in influencing his campaign due to its [...] "...message that has made [...] one of Hollywood's all-time greatest box office hits: no matter <b>how</b> <b>great</b> <b>the</b> adversity, the American Dream is within everybody's reach." ...|$|E
500|$|The Model 1897 {{was popular}} before World War I, {{but it was}} after the war broke out that sales of the Model 1897 picked up. This was because many were {{produced}} {{to meet the demands of}} the military. When the United States entered World War I, there was a need for more service weapons to be issued to the troops. It became clear to the United States just how brutal trench warfare was, and <b>how</b> <b>great</b> <b>the</b> need was for a large amount of close-range firepower while fighting in a trench, after they had observed the war for the first three years. The Model 1897 Trench grade was an evolution of this idea. The pre-existing Winchester Model 1897 was modified by adding a perforated steel heat shield over the barrel which protected the hand of the user from the barrel when it became over-heated, and an adapter with bayonet lug for affixing an M1917 bayonet. [...] This model was ideal for close combat and was efficient in trench warfare due to its 20-inch cylinder bore barrel. Buckshot ammunition was issued with the trench grade during the war. Each round of this ammunition contained nine 00 (.33-caliber) buckshot pellets. This gave considerable firepower to the individual soldier by each round that was fired. [...] This shorter barrel and large amount of firepower is what made this grade ideal for trench warfare.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Jose the Galilean {{taught that}} great is peace, since {{even in a}} time of war, one should begin with peace, as [...] says, [...] "When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then {{proclaim}} peace to it."

Thus the Sages taught that we must inquire about the welfare of other nations {{in order to keep the}} peace.|$|E

The Rabbis said that four angels visited her, as the word [...] "angel" [...] occurs 4 times. Rabbi Hiyya taught that Hagar's encounter with the angels showed <b>how</b> <b>great</b> <b>the</b> difference was between the generations of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs and later generations. Rabbi Hiyya noted that after [...] reports that Manoah and his wife, the parents of Samson, saw an angel, Manoah exclaimed to his wife in fear (in [...] ), [...] "We shall surely die, because we have seen God." [...] Yet Hagar, a bondmaid, saw five angels and was not afraid. Rabbi Aha taught that a fingernail of the Patriarchs was more valuable than the abdomen of their descendants. Rabbi Isaac interpreted [...] "She sees the ways of her household," [...] to apply homiletically to teach that all who lived in Abraham's household were seers, so Hagar was accustomed to seeing angels.|$|E

2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that {{he was staring at}} the space between the upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of <b>how</b> <b>great</b> <b>the</b> distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E
