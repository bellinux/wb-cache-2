5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed {{to show off}} the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parlor,</b> ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo decided to make the demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E

25|$|Hollybush was {{originally}} {{the home of}} the Whitney family, {{and it was the first}} of its kind in South Jersey.

Two of these significantly unique features of the house are the trompe de l'oeil ceilings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> as well as the Summit Room, and the painted glass archway above and around the front door. The stone that was used in construction of Hollybush was New Jersey Ironstone, a sedimentary type stone that is found in the low hills and ridges of South Jersey.|$|E

50|$|Locust Hill, {{also known}} as the McGruder Estate, is a {{historic}} home located near Brunswick, Chariton County, Missouri. The original section was built about 1860 and enlarged about 1880. It is a two-story, Second Empire style frame dwelling. It features a mansard roof faced with red, green, grey and black hexagonal slates and a mansarded cupola over the main entrance. The interior features wallpapers imported from France <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> and pine woodwork. Also on the property are three additional contributing buildings.|$|R
25|$|A 600 gallon {{water tank}} was {{filled in the}} non-freezing months {{providing}} running water for bathing, cleaning and a bathroom. Another amenity that was unusual for the time period was master bedroom on the first floor. The original Quezal Art Glass Company brass chandelier remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> with its iridescent shades. A {{lot of the other}} original furnishings were sold by the family or future tenants so other period pieces were used. Tiny fragments of original wallpaper were found in most rooms during reconstruction and a Swedish company hand-made custom replica wallpaper. The three upstairs bedrooms contain donated historical items like the community's first sewing machine, a bed warmer, and a trunk.|$|E
25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

500|$|The {{framing of}} the house is unusual because it has [...] "longitudinal summer beams {{extending}} from the end girts to the chimney girts in both the hall and the parlor. Corner and intermediate posts are flared in gunstock pattern. The walls are sheathed with vertical planking except in the attic gables, where the planks are laid horizontally, alternating the taper. Framing is cased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> and exposed in the hall, where the summers are adzed and roughly chamfered." [...] The attic construction is conventional with equally spaced rafters that have mortise and tenon joints at the ridge. This type of construction indicates that the conventional principal rafter or purlin framing may not have been used in Ledyard during that time.|$|E
500|$|At {{their home}} in Waterloo on Sunday, July 16, the M'Clintocks hosted a smaller {{planning}} session for the convention. Mary Ann M'Clintock and her eldest daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, Jr., discussed with Stanton {{the makeup of the}} resolutions that would be presented to the convention for approval. Each woman made certain her concerns were appropriately represented among the ten resolutions that they composed. Taken together, the resolutions demanded that women should have equality in the family, education, jobs, religion, and morals. One of the M'Clintock women selected the Declaration of Independence from 1776 {{as a model for the}} declaration they wanted to make at their convention. The Declaration of Sentiments was then drafted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> on a round, three-legged, mahogany tea table. Stanton changed a few words of the Declaration of Independence to make it appropriate for a statement by women, replacing [...] "The history of the present King of Great Britain" [...] with [...] "The history of mankind" [...] as the basis for [...] "usurpations on the part of man toward woman." [...] The women added the phrase [...] "and women" [...] to make [...] "...all men and women are created equal..." [...] A list of grievances was composed to form the second part of the Declaration.|$|E
500|$|Hunger {{and desperation}} {{eventually}} forced Sitting Bull, and 186 {{of his family}} and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, [...] "I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." [...] To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, [...] "to surrender my rifle" [...] in this context meant [...] "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back to you, for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a different way to help us overcome the white man." [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.|$|E

40|$|Oxytocin can {{attenuate}} {{the physiological}} and behavioral response to stress in animals. In {{this study we}} investigated the relationship between plasma oxytocin concentrations and the behavioral and physiological response of dairy cows to a repeated psychological stressor (novel environment). Twenty lactating multi-parous dairy cows were milked in a familiar milking parlor and in a novel environment. Blood samples were collected before and after milking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> familiar <b>parlor</b> (baseline) and on the second and fifth day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel <b>parlor</b> to measure plasma cortisol and oxytocin concentrations. Heart rate was recorded on all cows during milking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> familiar and novel environment. On all test days, the behavioral response of cows to milk cluster attachment was scored. On day 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel <b>parlor,</b> <b>the</b> oxytocin response, cortisol concentrations and heart rate were greater, and heart rate variability was lower than baseline values recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> familiar <b>parlor.</b> <b>The</b> {{results from this study}} suggest that oxytocin release is increased in response to exposure to a psychological stressor (novel environment) and that cows adapt to this stressor over time. After initial suppression, oxytocin levels increased over days of milking in a novel environment, whereas indicators of stress simultaneously decreased. Furthermore, the oxytocin increase was associated with habituation of <b>the</b> cortisol response <b>in</b> anticipation of milking in a novel environment, suggesting that oxytocin may be involved in habituation to a novel environment in dairy cows. This mechanism of habituation to novel environments may reflect an association between oxytocin and a "familiarization-habituation response" to repeated exposure to an initially novel environment that has previously been reported in humans...|$|R
