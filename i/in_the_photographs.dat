5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E

5000|$|On March 27, 1945, the 28th Marines {{departed}} Iwo Jima for Hawaii. On March 30, President Franklin Roosevelt (died on April 12, 1945) {{ordered the}} Marine Corps to send <b>the</b> flag-raisers <b>in</b> Rosenthal's <b>photograph</b> to Washington, D.C. {{where it was}} determined that Hansen was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> On April 7, Rene Gagnon (Easy Company's runner (messenger)), mistakenly identified <b>the</b> person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> as Sergeant Hank Hansen of Boston (Hansen was a member of Third Platoon of Company E, who had participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first flag-raising on Mount Suribachi earlier that morning). On April 8, the Marine Corps released publicly the names of <b>the</b> six flag-raisers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> which were identified by Gagnon (he also incorrectly identified Bradley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph).</b> When Navy corpsman John Bradley (Third Platoon corpsman, Easy Company, who was involved with the first flag-raising on Suribachi) arrived in Washington, D.C. a few days later, Bradley (he incorrectly identified himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph)</b> concurred with Gagnon that Hansen was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> However, on April 19, when Ira Hayes (Second Platoon) arrived in Washington, D.C., he told the lieutenant colonel interviewing him (also interviewed Gagnon and Bradley) about who the flag-raisers were, that an [...] "error" [...] was made, Block (Second Platoon) and not Hansen was at the base of <b>the</b> flagstaff <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photo. Hayes (who incorrectly identified Bradley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph)</b> was then told the six names (Hansen...) were already released and since Block and Hansen were both deceased, to not say a word about it again(the lt. colonel later claimed Hayes never mentioned Block's name to him).|$|R
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E

McCauley said he first met Corby at her court hearing in May 2005. He said Corby's mother invited him to visit Corby at Kerobokan Prison the following day.

25|$|The {{identity}} of the sailor as George Mendonsa has been challenged by physicists Donald W. Olson and Russell Doescher of Texas State University and Steve Kawaler of Iowa State University based on astronomical conditions recorded by the photographs of the incident. According to Mendonsa's account {{of the events of}} the day, the kiss would have occurred at approximately 2 p.m. However, Olson and Doescher argue that the positions of shadows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> suggest that it was taken after 5 p.m. They further point to a clock seen in the picture, its minute hand near the 10 and its hour hand pointing virtually vertically downward, indicating a time of approximately 5:50; and to Victor Jorgensen's account of the circumstances of his own picture; concluding that Mendonsa's version of events is untenable.|$|E
25|$|While {{on holiday}} in Las Vegas in August 2012, Harry and an unknown young woman were photographed naked in a Wynn Las Vegas hotel room, {{reportedly}} {{during a game}} of strip billiards. The pictures were leaked by American celebrity website TMZ on 21 August 2012, and reported worldwide by mainstream media on 22 August 2012. The photographs were shown by the American media but British media were reluctant to publish them – royal aides suggested that Clarence House would contact the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) if the pictures were used by British publications. St James's Palace confirmed that Harry was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs,</b> {{saying that he was}} essentially a victim whose privacy had been invaded, and contacted the Press Complaints Commission upon hearing that a number of British newspapers were considering publishing the photographs.

25|$|Assistant Commissioner Wong {{said the}} source of the {{pictures}} had been traced, but he would not confirm reports stating that they had been taken from Chen's computer. He added that the authenticity of the photographs was no longer in question. Wong also said of the six women found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs,</b> four were local celebrities and two were unknown to the police. None of the women were named. Wong was certain that no overseas artists were involved. He said that whilst it was not a crime to transfer the pictures to friends, those who had posted the images to Internet web pages could be in breach of the law. On 5 February, as another of the suspects was released on HK$50,000 bail, six more related photographs surfaced on the Internet. In the early hours on Chinese New Year's Eve, several hundred more photographs appeared on the Internet; there were two new faces.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} {{of the young man}} with whom Beineman had last been seen alive was heard by a patrolman named Larry Mathewson, who believed the person described by Mrs. Goshe and others may be one John Norman Collins: a former fraternity member of his who had previously been interviewed but eliminated from police inquiries, and who he had himself seen riding his motorcycle around the Eastern Michigan University campus on the afternoon of July 23. When Mathewson questioned Collins on July 25 as to his movements two days earlier, he admitted that on the date in question he had been riding his Triumph Bonneville in the vicinity, and that he had stopped to converse with a former girlfriend of his while doing so (the point at which Mathewson had observed him). This former girlfriend was able to provide Mathewson with two recent photographs of Collins. When Mathewson showed these photographs to both Mrs. Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding, both women were adamant the man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> was the same individual with whom Beineman had last been seen alive.|$|E
25|$|Copyright in a {{photograph}} lasts for 70 years {{from the end of}} the year in which the photographer dies. A consequence of this lengthy period of existence of the copyright is that many family photographs which have no market value, but significant emotional value, remain subject to copyright, even when the original photographer cannot be traced (a problem known as copyright orphan), has given up photography, or died. In the absence of a licence, it will be an infringement of copyright <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> to copy them. When someone dies the rights will have transferred to someone else, perhaps through testamentary deposition (a will) or by inheritance. If there was no will, or if the photographer has not specified where the rights in the material should go, then the normal rules of inheritance will apply (although these rules are not specific to copyright and legal advice should be sought). Scanning old family photographs, without permission, to a digital file for personal use is prima facie an infringement of copyright.|$|E

25|$|Adolf Miethe {{designed}} a high-quality, sequential-exposure color camera, which was manufactured by Bermpohl and became available commercially in 1903. Prokudin-Gorsky published {{an illustration of}} it in Fotograf-Liubitel in 1906. The most common model used a single oblong plate 9cm wide by 24cm high, the same format as Prokudin-Gorsky's surviving negatives, and it photographed the images in unconventional blue-green-red sequence, {{which is also a}} characteristic of Prokudin-Gorsky's negatives if the usual upside-down image in a camera and gravity-compliant downward shiftings of his plates are assumed. An inventor as well as a photographer, Prokudin-Gorsky patented an optical system for cameras of the simultaneous-exposure type, and it is often claimed or implied that he invented, or at least built, the camera used for his Russian Empire project. No definite written or photographic documentation of his field equipment is known to exist, only the evidence inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> themselves, and no rationale has been suggested for going to the trouble and expense of building a functionally identical copy of a Miethe-Bermpohl camera instead of simply buying one.|$|E
