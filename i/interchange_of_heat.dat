40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} paper proposes {{to estimate the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> inertia <b>of</b> the water <b>heating</b> system, in transient operation modes, on the temperature condition in the passenger car, {{as well as to}} offer technical solutions intended to reduce the heating system inertia effect and to maintain a stable temperature condition in the passenger car premises in transitional modes <b>of</b> the <b>heating</b> system. Methodology. The author developed the method for controlling the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> system pipes with the help of regulating casing. To control the heating system and the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> pipes, two types of temperature control sensors were used in the passenger car: certain sensors interacted with regulatory casings, while the others interacted with high-voltage tubular heating element control devices. To assess the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>interchange</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> pipes and the heating system control, with installed regulating casings, the operation <b>of</b> the <b>heating</b> system with regulating casings and two types of sensors was mathematically modelled. Mathematical modelling used the experimental test data. The results of experimental tests and mathematical modelling were compared. Findings. Currently in operated passenger cars, control <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> appliances is not constructively provided. Automatic maintenance of the set temperature in a passenger car is limited to switching on and off <b>of</b> high-voltage tubular <b>heating</b> elements. The use of regulating casings on heating pipes allows reducing the effects <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> inertia and maintaining stable thermal conditions in a passenger car, using the heating system as a heat accumulator, and also provides the opportunity to realize an individual control of air temperature in the compartment. Originality. For the first time, the paper studied the alternative ways of regulating the temperature condition in a passenger car. Using <b>of</b> the <b>heating</b> system as a heat accumulator. Practical value. The regulation <b>of</b> the <b>heat</b> transfers <b>of</b> the <b>heating</b> pipes by regulating casings allows reducing the effect of thermal inertia <b>of</b> the <b>heating</b> system on the temperature condition in a passenger car, implementing individual adjustment of air temperature in a compartment within 40 % of the power <b>of</b> the <b>heating</b> pipe section, using the heating system as a heat accumulator...|$|R
40|$|T HE <b>INTERCHANGE</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> between {{arteries and}} {{adjacent}} veins was described first by Claude Bernard (I), who made many measurements of arterial temperatures in animals and described moderate cooling of arterial blood in large vessels {{such as the}} femoral artery in the dog. The existence of this factor in the economy of heat exchange {{has long been known}} (2 - 4). However, only recently has it been realized that cooling of blood in the arteries can be great enough to be of considerable practical importance. In order to meet war problems methods of measurements of the heat exchange of the hand and foot were devised (5). These were later modified and extended by Forster et aZ. (6), who combined estimates of heat exchange with measurements of blood flow. The latter data showed that considerable precooling of arterial blood in passage to the hand or foot had to be assumed in order to explain the observed heat exchanges. The same hypothesis was essential also to explain bizarre temperature changes, which were sometimes observed in the data of Mendelson et aZ. Some of these data will be dis...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} of the {{adiabatic expansion}} of {{a mixture of}} two phases capable <b>of</b> <b>interchanging</b> <b>heat</b> and matter across the phase boundary is presented. The law of conservation of energy is applied to each phase considered as an open system and to the mixture of phases considered as a closed system. Expressions for the entropy production resulting from internal irreversible processes demonstrate the difference between adiabatic and isentropic changes and specify conditions under which the expansion of a closed two-phase system is isentropic. Three such possible isentropic processes are defined, and expressions are derived for the temperature-pressure-volume states achieved in them. The thermodynamic treatment is useful in studies of the adiabatic release of a shock-induced mixture of phases...|$|R
