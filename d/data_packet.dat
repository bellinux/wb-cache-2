5|$|USB2.0 {{added two}} {{additional}} handshake packets: NYET and ERR. NYET {{indicates that a}} split transaction is not yet complete, while ERR handshake indicates that a split transaction failed. A second use for a NYET packet is to tell the host that the device has accepted a <b>data</b> <b>packet,</b> but cannot accept any more due to full buffers. This allows a host to switch to sending small PING tokens to inquire about the device's readiness, rather than sending an entire unwanted <b>DATA</b> <b>packet</b> just to elicit a NAK.|$|E
5|$|A <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> {{consists}} of the PID followed by 0–1,024bytes of data payload (up to 1,024bytes for high-speed devices, up to 64bytes for full-speed devices, and at most eightbytes for low-speed devices), and a 16-bit CRC.|$|E
40|$|In this {{approach}} we are proposing an extension to our previous work {{which deals with}} Trust Based Routing in the peer to peer network. This peer to peer network is carried out without using a caching mechanism to store the <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> while routing. To achieve this caching mechanism we have proposed methods for caching the <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> in the peers and also to replace these <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> with the new <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> in the next routing process. The method proposed to store the <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> is the Cache Mechanism approach, where this mechanism considers the throughput and the aggregated delay. To get this aggregated delay it considers the latency to return the current reply (L c) and the latency to reply future data requests (L f). Then an approach has been proposed to replace this stored <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> with the new <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> for the next routing process where the old <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> are removed from the peerâs cache and the new <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> will be moved to the cache...|$|R
30|$|Packet {{delivery}} ratio: PDR calculates {{the number}} of <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> sent by the source node and how much <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> (in %) the destination node successfully received.

5|$|There are {{two basic}} forms of <b>data</b> <b>packet,</b> DATA0 and DATA1. A <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> must always be preceded by an address token, and is usually {{followed}} by a handshake token from the receiver back to the transmitter. The two packet types provide the 1-bit sequence number required by stop-and-wait ARQ. If a USB host does not receive a response (such as an ACK) for data it has transmitted, it does not know if the data was received or not; the data might have been lost in transit or {{it might have been}} received but the handshake response was lost.|$|E
5|$|PING asks {{a device}} {{if it is}} ready to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. PING is usually sent by a host when polling a device that most {{recently}} responded with NAK or NYET. This avoids the need to send a large <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> to a device that the host suspects to be unwilling to accept it. The device responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The final <b>DATA</b> <b>packet</b> {{must contain}} {{less than a}} {{full-sized}} block of data to signal {{that it is the}} last. If the size of the transferred file is an exact multiple of the block-size, the source sends a final <b>DATA</b> <b>packet</b> containing 0 bytes of data.|$|E

The <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> would be downloaded to the 8M memory pak inserted into the BS-X cartridge and when the download had finished, the player would shut the system down. The BS-X cartridge would then be removed and swapped {{for one of the}} special application cartridges. Finally the 8M memory pak would be detached from the BS-X cartridge and inserted into the application cartridge's memory slot. A list of slotted application cartridges compatible with the Satellaview can be seen here.|$|E

The player's crew intercepts a <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction from hostile ships or by the pursuing rebel fleet.

50|$|The Lamport {{signature}} {{scheme is}} a digital signature system {{that relies on}} maintaining two sets of secret <b>data</b> <b>packets,</b> publishing verifiable hashes of the <b>data</b> <b>packets,</b> and then selectively revealing partial secret <b>data</b> <b>packets</b> {{in a manner that}} conforms specifically to the data to be signed. In this way, the prior public commitment to the secret values becomes a critical part of the functioning of the system.|$|R
25|$|Sequence number: (16 bits) The {{sequence}} number is incremented by {{one for each}} RTP <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> sent and {{is to be used}} by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence. The RTP does not specify any action on packet loss; it is left to the application to take appropriate action. For example, video applications may play the last known frame in place of the missing frame. According to , the initial value of the {{sequence number}} should be random to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult. RTP provides no guarantee of delivery, but the presence of sequence numbers makes it possible to detect missing packets.|$|E
25|$|In TFTP, a {{transfer}} is {{initiated by the}} client issuing a request to read or write a particular file on the server. The request can optionally include a set of negotiated transfer parameters proposed by the client under the terms specified by RFC 2347. If the server grants the request, the file is sent in fixed length blocks of 512 bytes by default or the number specified in the blocksize negotiated option defined by RFC 2348. Each block of transferred data which is usually carried within a single IP packet {{in order to avoid}} IP fragmentation, must be acknowledged by an acknowledgment packet before the next block can be sent. A <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> of less than 512 bytes or the agreed blocksize option signals termination of {{a transfer}}. If a packet gets lost in the network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit their last packet (which may be data or an acknowledgment), thus causing the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet. The sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have been correctly received. Notice that both devices involved in a transfer are considered senders and receivers. One sends data and receives acknowledgments, the other sends acknowledgments and receives data.|$|E

They also discover that the <b>data</b> <b>packet</b> they retrieved from the Citadel contains codes {{that can be used to}} close the portal, and so traverse the countryside to deliver the packet to the resistance headquarters at White Forest. As they progress, it becomes evident that the Combine Advisors escaped the Citadel's destruction, and that remaining Combine forces are regrouping, albeit under occasional attacks by Vortigaunts. Aware of the resistance's plans to close the super portal, the Combine attack White Forest in force, but are repelled. The super portal is destroyed after the resistance launch a satellite containing the appropriate data. However, in the game's closing scenes, two Advisors attack Freeman, Alyx and Eli Vance, and kill Eli before being driven off by Dog.|$|E
