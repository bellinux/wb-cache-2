25|$|Vallée also {{proposes that}} a {{secondary}} {{aspect of the}} UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that {{it is highly unlikely}} that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely that that <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> manipulators want us to believe. Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate. Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} S2 is negative, {{indicating}} that the image is formed {{on the opposite side}} of the lens from where those rays are being considered. Since the diverging light rays emanating from the lens never come into focus, and those rays are not physically present at the point where they appear to form an image, this is called a virtual image. Unlike real images, a virtual image cannot be projected on a screen, but appears to an observer looking through the lens as if it were a real object at the location of that virtual image. Likewise, it appears to a subsequent lens as if it were an object at that location, so that second lens could again focus that light into a real image, S1 then being measured from the virtual image location behind the first lens to the second lens. This <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> eye does when looking through a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass creates a (magnified) virtual image behind the magnifying glass, but those rays are then re-imaged by the lens of the eye to create a real image on the retina.|$|E

[...] Globo also reacted negatively to {{the use of}} [...] "foreigners" [...] to represent Brazilians, [...] "speaking Portuguese with laughable accents".

Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story.

The judge sentenced Shaik to the minimum prescribed sentence of 15 years on each of the corruption counts. Shaik was sentenced to three years for fraud; however, Judge Squires said he found mitigating circumstances for not imposing the same minimum penalty for the fraud charge, as Shaik had not been the instigator and the crime had no adverse effect on any other party.|$|E

[...] He also advocates investigating why the various intelligence agencies could not collaborate on information to prevent the attacks while spending $40 billion per year.

2500|$|Testing the {{hypothesis}} that 'conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun' required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There {{would also be a}} point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during {{a certain period of time}} during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action – they have passed the action's [...] "point of no return". That <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).|$|E

2500|$|It is {{inappropriate}} {{to distinguish between}} two well-ordered sets if they only differ in the [...] "labeling of their elements", or more formally: if {{the elements of the}} first set can be paired off with the elements of the second set such that if one element is smaller than another in the first set, then the partner of the first element is smaller than the partner of the second element in the second set, and vice versa. [...] Such a one-to-one correspondence is called an order isomorphism and the two well-ordered sets are said to be order-isomorphic, or similar (obviously this is an equivalence relation). [...] Provided there exists an order isomorphism between two well-ordered sets, the order isomorphism is unique: this makes it quite justifiable to consider the two sets as essentially identical, and to seek a [...] "canonical" [...] representative of the isomorphism type (class). [...] This <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ordinals provide, and it also provides a canonical labeling of the elements of any well-ordered set. [...] Formally, if a partial order < is defined on the set S, and a partial order <' is defined on the set S' , then the posets (S,<) and (S' ,<') are order isomorphic if there is a bijection f that preserves the ordering. That is, f(a) <' f(b) if and only if a < b. Every well-ordered set (S,<) is order isomorphic to the set of ordinals less than one specific ordinal number [...] under their natural ordering.|$|E

At {{the front of}} the {{building}} one can see the Russian inscription [...] "Marianskaya women's hospice" [...] and the symbol of the [...] "Imperial Russian Orthodox Palestine Society" [...] above the entrance. With long hallways leading to separate rooms, it was an ideal layout for a hostel, or a prison, which <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> British turned the place into during the British Mandate period. In each cell, one prisoner was made supervisor over the others, and given an actual bed. Over the course of the British occupation, hundreds of prisoners, both simple criminals and political, passed through its gates. Jews and Arabs were incarcerated together. Executions for capital crimes were commonplace, but only for Arabs. While the facility housed many death-row inmates captured from the Jewish underground organizations, Jews sentenced to death were sent to Acre prison for the actual executions. The British, fearful of the Jewish reaction to executions in the Holy City, never used the gallows of the prison for Jews. Prisoners from the Jewish underground organizations were often put to work making coffins and gravestones for the very same British policemen and soldiers they had killed. As the guards used to tell them, [...] "What you start on the outside, you finish on the inside." [...] The building houses now the Underground Prisoners Museum. The barbed wire fence, bars and inscription [...] "Central Prison Jerusalem" [...] on the door are from the British Mandatory period.|$|E

One Japanese town, in the southern provinces at least, is very like another to look at--a grey-black sea of house roofs, speckled with the white walls of the fire-proof godowns where merchants and rich men keep their chief treasures. The general level is broken by the temple roofs, which are turned up at the edges, and remotely resemble so many terai-hats. Kioto fills a plain almost entirely surrounded by wooded hills, very familiar in their aspect to those who have seen the Siwaliks. Once upon a time it was the capital of Japan, and to-day numbers two hundred and fifty thousand people. It is laid out like an American town. All the streets run at right angles to each other.
