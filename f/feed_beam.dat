40|$|GRAVITY is an {{adaptive}} optics assisted Beam Combiner {{for the second}} generation VLTI instrumentation. The instrument will provide high-precision narrow-angle astrometry and phase-referenced interferometric imaging in the astronomical K-band for faint objects. We describe {{the wide range of}} science that will be tackled with this instrument, highlighting the unique capabilities of the VLTI in combination with GRAVITY. The most prominent goal is to observe highly relativistic motions of matter close to the event horizon of Sgr A*, the massive black hole at center of the Milky Way. We present the preliminary design that fulfils the requirements that follow from the key science drivers: It includes an integrated optics, 4 -telescope, dual <b>feed</b> <b>beam</b> combiner operated in a cryogenic vessel; near-infrared wavefrontsensing adaptive optics; fringe-tracking on secondary sources within the field of view of the VLTI and a novel metrology concept.

40|$|Gamma Ray Burst {{sources are}} {{apparently}} evolving around us in a harder and brighter samples at far and far redshift. The average output may {{range from a}} near Supernova (nearest events) output to a billion time that power for most distant events. Such a tuned evolution around us is not an anti-copernican signature. It is a clear imprint of a off-axis (nearest sources) beaming versus a rarest in-axis blazing (far redshift sources) by a thin relativistic beam (Lorentz factor up ten thousand or above, corresponding to micro-nano steradian solid angle). The main consequence is the rarer and rarer presences of hardest gamma events (hundreds MeV, GeVs, tens GeVs), nearly one over a twenty, partially opaque by IR-gamma cut-off, observed with difficulty at largest redshift inside their thinner beamed jets. For this reason these rarest tens GeV beamed events, even observed by EGRET and Fermi, are hardly seen at hundred GeV by Cherenkov telescope (Magic,Hess,Veritas) on Earth. For the same reason and because tens GeV neutrino energy is below Icecube thresholds (threshold above hundreds GeV) {{we have not been}} observed yet a neutrino GRB. However if the GRBs primaries contains tens GeV neutrino traces (at comparable GRB gamma rate) their presence may rise in few years at Deep Core (a more dense array inside ICECUBE) detector whose lower threshold, ranges just one or few tens GeV energy.

40|$|To image {{satellites}} at geosynchronous altitude {{requires a}} telescope aperture of 50 to 200 meters, {{depending on the}} choice of wavelength and required resolution. Building such a facility is an expensive, lengthy undertaking and is probably {{a couple of decades}} away.

In the astronomical community, aperture masking – an interferometric imaging techniques – consistently produces higher-quality images than a camera with adaptive-optics. Sadly, separated-aperture interferometry lags further behind but their image quality is improving as the number of apertures increases. A bigger problem is poor sensitivity. We understand the light loss-issues and can increase the sensitivity by mitigating these problems and by using larger telescopes with adaptive optics.
