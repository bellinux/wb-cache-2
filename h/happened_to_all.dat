25|$|However, {{following}} {{the formation of}} the Premier League, it became increasingly difficult for newly promoted clubs to establish themselves in the top flight. Whereas newly promoted teams had once normally survived for at least a few seasons in the old First Division, it was now the norm for at least one newly promoted club to be relegated straight back from the Premier League to Division One. In the nine seasons that followed {{the formation of the}} Premier League, at least one newly promoted club suffered this fate – and in the 1997–98 season it <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> three newly promoted teams. There were exceptions, however; including Blackburn Rovers, who were promoted to the Premier League on its formation and were champions three years later, and Newcastle United, who were promoted in 1993 and finished in the top six for the next four seasons, finishing Premier League runners-up twice.|$|E

Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had [...] "no idea what [...] {{has to do with}} the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Malaya's {{independence}} from the British in 1957, the population included many first or second-generation immigrants {{who had come to}} fill colonial manpower needs as indentured labourers. Chinese legal immigrants, who typically settled in urban areas, {{played a significant role in}} the commercial sector after the Indians left the country to return to India, many of the commercial sectors were sold to the Chinese immigrants. The Communities Liaison Committee (CLC), comprising leading politicians from different racial backgrounds, supported the promotion of economic equality for the Malays, conditional on political equality for the non-Malays. CLC member E.E.C. Thuraisingham later said, [...] "I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal. Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non-Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals." [...] The massive demographic change <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> British colonised countries of which these countries become multi religion and multiracial while Britain itself remain homogenous. The natives of British colonised countries such as Malaysia, South Africa, Fiji, Singapore, Uganda, Guyana, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago become minorities and discriminated against employment and education for 200 years. British workers (Chinese and Indians) on the other hand not only were encouraged to migrate to the colonised countries, they were also given business opportunities instead of to the natives. Thus affirmative action was implemented in British colonised countries using models of affirmative actions for the natives in Canada, USA, New Zealand and Australia. Trinidad and Tobago, Singapore and Guyana today are still ruled by British migrants (Chinese and Indians) and there are accusations that the natives of the countries are [...] still discriminated against in employment and education.|$|E

6000|$|The {{selection}} of [...] "Thoughts from Maeterlinck" [...] {{is a very}} creditable and also a very useful compilation. Many modern critics object to the hacking and hewing of a consistent writer which is necessary {{for this kind of}} work, but upon more serious consideration, the view is not altogether adequate. Maeterlinck is a very great man; and in the long run this process of mutilation has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> great men. It was the mark of a great patriot to be drawn and quartered and his head set on one spike in one city and his left leg on another spike in another city. It was the mark of a saint that even these fragments began to work miracles. So it has been with all the very great men of the world. However careless, however botchy, may be the version of Maeterlinck or of anyone else given in such a selection as this, it is assuredly far less careless and far less botchy than the version, the parody, the wild misrepresentation of Maeterlinck which future ages will hear and distant critics be called upon to consider.|$|E

6000|$|This type of tale, indeed, may {{be pretty}} fairly paralleled with the {{ordinary}} anecdote terminating in a repartee or an Irish bull. Such a retort as the famous [...] "je ne vois pas la necessite" [...] {{we have all}} seen attributed to Talleyrand, to Voltaire, to Henri Quatre, to an anonymous judge, and so on. But this variety does {{not in any way}} make it more likely that the thing was never said at all. It is highly likely that it was really said by somebody unknown. It is highly likely that it was really said by Talleyrand. In any case, it is not any more difficult to believe that the mot might have occurred to a man in conversation than to a man writing memoirs. It might have occurred to any of the men I have mentioned. But there is this point of distinction about it, that it is not likely to have occurred to all of them. And this is where the first class of so-called myth differs from the second to which I have previously referred. For there is a second class of incident found to be common to the stories of five or six heroes, say to Sigurd, to Hercules, to Rustem, to the Cid, and so on. And the peculiarity of this myth is that not only is it highly reasonable to imagine that it really happened to one hero, but it is highly reasonable to imagine that it really <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> of them. Such a story, for instance, is that of a great man having his strength swayed or thwarted by the mysterious weakness of a woman. The anecdotal story, the story of William Tell, is as I have said, popular, because it is peculiar. But this kind of story, the story of Samson and Delilah of Arthur and Guinevere, is obviously popular because it is not peculiar. It is popular as good, quiet fiction is popular, because it tells the truth about people. If the ruin of Samson by a woman, and the ruin of Hercules by a woman, have a common legendary origin, it is gratifying to know that we can also explain, as a fable, the ruin of Nelson by a woman and the ruin of Parnell by a woman. And, indeed, I have no doubt whatever that, some centuries hence, the students of folk-lore will refuse altogether to believe that Elizabeth Barrett eloped with Robert Browning, and will prove their point up to the hilt by the unquestionable fact that the whole fiction of the period was full of such elopements from end to end.|$|E
