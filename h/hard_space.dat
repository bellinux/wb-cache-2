5000|$|In word {{processing}} and digital typesetting, a non-breaking space (" [...] ") (also called no-break space, non-breakable space (NBSP), <b>hard</b> <b>space,</b> or fixed space) is a space character that prevents an automatic line break at its position. In some formats, including HTML, it also prevents consecutive whitespace characters from collapsing {{into a single}} space.|$|E

50|$|In computing, {{the middle}} dot is usually used to {{indicate}} white space in various software {{applications such as}} word processing, graphic design, web layout, desktop publishing or software development programs. In some word processors, interpuncts are used to denote not only <b>hard</b> <b>space</b> or space characters, but also sometimes used to indicate a space when put in paragraph format to show indentations and spaces. This allows the user to see where white space {{is located in the}} document and what sizes of white space are used, since normally white space is invisible so tabs, spaces, non-breaking spaces and such are indistinguishable from one another.|$|E

Samples of 6061 aluminum have been coated with one of 10 selected metal coatings, and subjected to corrosion, abrasion, and thermal testing. Changes in reflectance after exposure are documented. Plated gold exhibited minimal degradation of optical properties. A computer model is used in evaluating coating thermal performance in the EVA environment. The model is verified with an experiment designed to measure the heat transfer characteristics of coated space suit parts in a thermal vacuum chamber. Details of this experiment are presented...|$|E
40|$|An elbow or {{knee joint}} for a <b>hard</b> <b>space</b> suit or similar usage is formed of three {{serially}} connected rigid sections which have truncated spherical configurations. The ends of each section form solid geometric angles, and the sections are interconnected by hermetically sealed ball bearings. The outer two sections are fixed together for rotation {{in a direction}} opposite to rotation of the center section. A preferred means to make the outer sections track each other in rotation comprises a rotatable continuous bead chain which engages sockets circumferentially spaced on the facing sides of the outer races of the bearings. The joint has a single pivot point and the bearing axes are always contained in a single plane for any articulation of the joint. Thus flexure of the joint simulates the coplanar flexure of the knee or elbow and is not susceptible to lockup...|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{capabilities of}} the Spacelab manned pallet are reviewed, together with the implications of {{an expansion of the}} research effectiveness with a free-flying platform. The premier Spacelab flight will carry out earth observations with a metric camera and SAR, atmospheric studies will be performed with imaging spectrometers, and space plasma physics will be examined by injecting particle beams or VLF waves into the near-Shuttle environment. Radiance and spectrum data will be gathered of the sun and UV and X ray information will be recorded from the stars. Experimentation will also be carried out for on-board crystal growth, metallurgy, and glassy material production, as well as the response of biological systems to zero-g conditions and <b>hard</b> <b>space</b> radiation. The telemetry, time, crewmember participation, and on-board controls required for Spacelab operations are outlined. Missions for a space platform for studying the atmosphere/space interface are described...|$|E
40|$|Shoulder and hip joints for <b>hard</b> <b>space</b> {{suits are}} {{disclosed}} which are comprised of three serially connected truncated spherical sections, {{the ends of}} which converge. Ball bearings between the sections permit relative rotation. The proximal {{end of the first}} section is connected to the torso covering by a ball bearing and the distal end of the outermost section is connected to the elbow or thigh covering by a ball bearing. The sections are equi-angular and this alleviates lockup, the condition where the distal end of the joint leaves the plane in which the user is attempting to flex. The axes of rotation of the bearings and the bearing mid planes are arranged to intersect in a particular manner that provides the joint with a minimum envelope. In one embodiment, the races of the bearing between the innermost section and the second section is partially within the inner race of the bearing between the torso and the innermost spherical section further to reduce bulk...|$|E
40|$|The most {{studied and}} academically debated laws {{regarding}} outer space consist {{of the five}} United Nations treaties, which were entered into force from 1967 to 1984. After this condensed period of treaty activity, United Nations resolutions and principles took the place of treaties on which consensus otherwise needed to be achieved. <b>Hard</b> <b>space</b> law developed primarily {{at the national level}} in the form of various acts or regulations adopted by individual nation states. Even though formal laws can typically be promulgated more quickly at the national level, such hard laws still {{may not be the most}} efficient method for governmental legal oversight. Formulation of laws can no longer keep pace with the technological innovations that drive the aerospace industry. Often informal laws, through industry self-regulation or contract, prove more effective in protecting the rights of those engaged in such activities and public safety. The informal regulation of space activities will likely supplant the role that formal laws once held except where targeted, formal laws are needed to fill gaps left through informal regulation...|$|E

40|$|The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard Solar Orbiter {{consists}} of a suite of two high-resolution imagers (HRI) and one dual-band full Sun imager (FSI) that will provide EUV and Lyman-α images of the solar atmospheric layers above the photosphere. The EUI instrument {{is based on a}} set of challenging new technologies allowing to reach the scientific objectives and to cope with the <b>hard</b> <b>space</b> environment of the Solar Orbiter mission. The mechanical concept of the EUI instrument is based on a common structure supporting the HRI and FSI channels, and a separated electronic box. A heat rejection baffle system is used to reduce the Sun heat load and provide a first protection level against the solar disk straylight. The spectral bands are selected by thin filters and multilayer mirror coatings. The detectors are 10 μm pitch back illuminated CMOS Active Pixel Sensors (APS), best suited for the EUI science requirements and radiation hardness. This paper presents the EUI instrument concept and its major sub-systems. The current developments of the instrument technologies are also summarized...|$|E
40|$|The {{study in}} hand {{is an attempt}} to {{delineate}} and define the CBD of Karachi in terms of definitive parameters, firstly, as a geographical region and secondly, as functional complex or location with distinctive functional spatial organization. Using a multi-factor approach the spatial patterns have been unfolded by discernible concentration levels or the degrees of concentration achieved by six variables, the measure of spatial distribution. The CBD space has been viewed as a composite pattern determined by spatial correspondence or association of the major variables which yielded as many as 23 pattern categories characterizing the CBD <b>hard</b> <b>space.</b> The traditional approach in by discrimination of the CBD hard core has been substituted by discrimination of the CBD region into hard core and non-core areas {{on the basis of the}} composition patterns. Within the CBD complex, its functional spatial organization has been brought out by functional intensity distribution, functional dominance, identification of significant functions that represented the functional combination pattern in the CBD, and the degree of spatial nucleation and dispersion of the significant CBD functions...|$|E
40|$|For use in <b>hard</b> <b>space</b> {{suits and}} the like, a joint between the torso {{covering}} {{and the upper}} arm covering (i. e., shoulder) or between the torso covering and upper leg covering (i. e., hip) is disclosed. Each joint has an outer covering and a inner covering. The outer covering has plural perferably truncated toroidal sections decreasing in size proceeding outwardly. In one embodiment at each joint there are two bearings, the first larger than the second. The outer race of the larger bearing {{is attached to the}} outer edge of the smaller end of each section and the inner race of the larger bearing is attached to the end wall. The inner race of the smaller bearing is attached to the end wall. The outer race of the smaller bearing is attached to the larger end of the next section. Each bearing hask appropriate seals. Between each section is a rubber ring for the comfort of the wearer. Such rubber rings have radial flanges attached to the inner races of two adjacent bearings. Matching semicircular grooves are formed in the abutting overlapping surfaces. Bellows-like inner walls are also provided for each section fixed at one end to an inner cylindrical flange and, at the opposite end, to an end wall. Each outer section may rotate 360 deg relative to the next outer section, whereas the bellows sections do not rotate, but rather expand or contract locally as the rigid sections rotate relative to each other...|$|E
