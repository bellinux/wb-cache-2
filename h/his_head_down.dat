5|$|The {{other two}} stories, those of David and Judith, were often linked in Renaissance art, {{particularly}} by Florentine artists as they demonstrated {{the overthrow of}} tyrants, a popular subject in the Republic.

5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius {{may be able to}} use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|When the two {{opposing}} forces reached {{the place of}} the ambush, Bardas ordered the trumpets blown and the two concealed Byzantine divisions attacked the Pechenegs from the flanks and the rear. Cut off from aid and surrounded, the Pechenegs began to panic and flee. One of their leaders tried to rally his men, but he was attacked by Bardas Skleros himself, who killed him with a single sword-blow that reportedly cut him in two from <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> to the waist, through the Pecheneg's helmet and cuirass. The loss of the Pecheneg commander turned the battle into a complete rout, and panic spread to the Bulgarian contingent following behind the Pechenegs, which also suffered heavy casualties in the general chaos. The Byzantine casualties in the battle were low (Skylitzes speaks of 25 dead and Leo of 55) although they lost many horses to the Pecheneg arrows, while the losses of the Rus' force, although certainly lower than Leo's claimed 20,000, were still significant, probably running into several thousands.|$|E

25|$|Hedberg {{suffered}} from stage fright throughout his career; he often performed in sunglasses, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> {{and his hair}} in his face or his eyes closed, and sometimes stood upstage or {{with his back to}} the audience, constantly moving in place. At times, he nervously shook his microphone unconsciously.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than a month}} {{into the}} 2009–10 season, Toews was sidelined with concussion-like {{symptoms}} after receiving an open-ice hit from defenceman Willie Mitchell in a 3–2 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on October 21, 2009. Toews had <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> while receiving a pass in the neutral zone when Mitchell left the penalty box and checked him with his shoulder. Toews was sidelined for several games {{before returning to the}} line-up.|$|E
25|$|Butt {{started in}} the Under-17s and quickly progressed through Under-19 level, {{although}} at that time he was much younger than the age limits suggest, making his senior debut for Lahore Whites in 2000 aged only 15. His talent was noticed immediately, which led to him being given {{a place in the}} Pakistan A team against England soon after. However, instead of rushing straight for the limelight of international cricket, he got <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and consolidated by playing consistently for his region and the youth teams, until the Pakistan selectors finally drafted him in 2003.|$|E

25|$|The fight {{took place}} in October 2013, Klitschko's third undefeated {{consecutive}} opponent. The bout was marred with over 160 clinches, most initiated by Klitschko, followed by several repeated roughhouse tactics throughout the match against Povetkin. This included leaning on his opponent and pushing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and throwing Povetkin to the canvas, {{which resulted in the}} referee scoring some as knockdowns. Klitschko won by unanimous decision scoring a knockdown in round 2 from a flush jab, and 3 knockdowns in round 7 including one prompted from a big right uppercut. All 3 judges scored it 119–104 on the scorecards. Klitschko landed 139 of 417 punches (33%) and Povetkin connected on 59 of 283 (21%).|$|E
25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{interest}} in a bout with Khan, Floyd Mayweather {{announced that he would}} fight 30 year old Marcos Maidana (35–3, 31 KOs) on 3 May 2014. On 24 March, Khan decided to fight 32 year old former champion Luis Collazo (35-5, 18 KOs) on the undercard at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. Prior to the fight, Collazo han't lost since October 2011. The fight was for the vacant WBA International welterweight title and WBA title eliminator as well as Vacant WBC Silver title. Khan was too fast and too disciplined for Collazo, flooring him in the fourth round and twice in the 10th. The judges scored the fight 117-106, 119-104, 119-104 in Khan's favour. Khan and Collazo both incurred point deductions in round 8. Collazo hit Khan with a low blow while Khan was holding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down.</b> Collazo's failed approach resulted in a mismatch on the scorecards. Collazo fought with his hands down most of the night, unafraid of Khan, believing Khan had no power and he would eventually knock him out. In the post fight interview in the ring after the bout, Khan credited his 12 months of boxing training with Virgil Hunter for his success. Khan's purse for the fight was $1.5m while Collazo earned $350,000.|$|E

25|$|The 1999–2000 season {{would be}} Lindros' last as a Flyer. Having {{suffered}} his second concussion {{of the season}} (fourth overall) in March, Lindros criticized the team's trainers for failing to diagnose a concussion as he played with symptoms following a hit he suffered {{in a game against}} the Boston Bruins two weeks prior. Clarke then stripped Lindros of the captaincy for his actions. Lindros sat out the remainder of the regular season and suffered another concussion while rehabilitating for a return to the lineup. Lindros ultimately returned for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New Jersey Devils; he scored the lone goal in a 2–1 Flyers loss. In Game 7 of the series, Lindros was coming over the blue line with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> when Devils defenseman Scott Stevens lowered his shoulder into Lindros knocking him unconscious and suffering yet another concussion. He was able to get off the ice with help from teammates. The Flyers lost Game 7, 2–1 and the series despite leading three games to one, and Lindros became a restricted free agent during the off-season. He refused to accept a two-way qualifying offer with a minor league provision from the Flyers, who still owned his rights. After Lindros was cleared to play in December, the Flyers refused to deal his rights to the Toronto Maple Leafs, as he preferred, and Lindros sat out the entire 2000–01 season.|$|E
500|$|The Associated Press {{has noted}} that {{contrary}} to expectations, Franken has not sought out the media spotlight: [...] "He rarely talks to the Washington press corps, has shed his comedic persona and focused on policy, working to be taken seriously."

500|$|The Devils then {{met their}} bitter rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, in the Eastern Conference Finals.

During the first period, Flyers star centre Eric Lindros was skating alone through the neutral zone with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> when Stevens hit him with a {{shoulder}} knocking him unconscious and giving him another concussion. It was only Lindros' second game since returning from a concussion suffered in March against the Boston Bruins. Stevens had previously taken Flyers centre Daymond Langkow out with a concussion after game 2.|$|E

500|$|Fighting {{tactics are}} governed by several actual rules and enforcers will also adopt {{informal}} tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as [...] "going for it", in which the player puts <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and just throws as many punches as he can, {{as fast as he}} can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent's jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.|$|E
500|$|Early {{on in the}} 2009–10 season, Mitchell {{delivered}} an open-ice {{hit that}} concussed Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews in the two teams' first game against each other since the 2009 playoffs. Mitchell had just exited the penalty box when he caught Toews with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> receiving a pass in the neutral zone; the hit was deemed legal as Mitchell checked Toews with his shoulder. Toews was sidelined for six games as a result. [...] Later on in the season, Mitchell suffered a concussion himself, receiving a hit from opposing forward Evgeni Malkin, causing his head to hit the end boards, during {{a game against the}} Pittsburgh Penguins on January 16. [...] He was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season with post-concussion syndrome, finishing with 12 points and a +13 rating in 48 games.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{announced}} [...] "You and I" [...] as {{the fourth}} single from Born This Way on July 22, 2011. Its cover, released on August 5, 2011, via TwitPic, {{was accompanied by}} the line: [...] "You will never find what {{you are looking for}} in love, if you don't love yourself." [...] It features two black-and-white images of Gaga's male alter ego Jo Calderone smoking a cigarette and sporting sideburns. The Calderone character made a previous appearance in June 2011, when Gaga posed as him in London for a series of photos by photographer Nick Knight, arranged by stylist Nicola Formichetti. One shot features him wearing a blazer and white T-shirt with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> smoking a cigarette. The other image is of Jo Calderone in silhouette exhaling a cloud of smoke.|$|E

500|$|During the season, Geelong coach Chris Scott praised Selwood as [...] "probably {{the toughest}} player I've ever seen...he gets {{hit in the}} head a lot...he just sees the ball and he puts <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and he goes as hard as anyone {{possibly}} could". Despite Selwood's individual efforts, the Cats finished with a 15-7 win-loss record {{at the conclusion of the}} season to finish sixth on the ladder. This represented the first time in Selwood's career that the club had not qualified with a double chance for the finals series, setting them up for an Elimination Final match against Fremantle. Despite Selwood's contribution of a game-high 28 disposals and team-high six inside-50s, the Cats were defeated by 16points and exited the finals series—the first time that the club had failed to progress beyond the first week since Selwood had begun his career.|$|E
500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down.</b> He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E
500|$|Six runs {{after the}} fall of Washbrook, the {{diminutive}} Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Sid Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Surprised by Lindwall's bouncer, Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to Emmett during the match, and O'Reilly thought the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O'Reilly concluded that Australia's pace duo [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E
