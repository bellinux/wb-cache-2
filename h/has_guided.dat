5|$|Chief makes {{contact with}} Infinity and helps repel the Didact's attack. Chief and Cortana {{recommend}} attacking the Didact {{while he is}} vulnerable, but Infinity captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so their ship can escape. In the process, Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian—the wife of the Didact, as well as ancient humanity's protector. She explains that the Forerunners were divided {{on how best to}} combat the Flood. After failing to discover a way to immunize biological beings from the parasite, the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into mechanical Promethean Knights immune to infection. Requiring more soldiers, the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into Prometheans, before being stopped and imprisoned by the Librarian. The Librarian, who <b>has</b> <b>guided</b> humanity's development, accelerates the Chief's evolution; this grants him immunity to the Composer.|$|E
