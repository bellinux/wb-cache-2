30|$|Even {{though there}} are {{differences}} between the structures of variables, the variables do not possess a chaotic behavior in high levels. The results of this paper for oil price are <b>dissimilar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of some papers which determined the presence of chaos in the oil market. Panas and Ninni (2000), Adrangi et al. (2001), Lahmiri (2017) and Bildirici and Sonustun (2018) showed the presence of chaotic behavior for oil prices. The BDS, Lyapunov and Kolmogorov entropy results determine that the variables are nonlinear. The general investigation of the results shows that VIX is generated by a complex nonlinear and stochastic process.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work high energy {{resolution}} off-resonant X-ray spectroscopy (HEROS) was employed at a synchrotron {{to study a}} silica supported Ta(V) bisalkyl catalyst activated in hydrogen. The Ta Lα 1 HEROS spectra were measured during oxidation of the starting complex and the relative species’ concentration was successfully retrieved {{as a function of}} time using the fingerprint HEROS spectra measured for the unoxidized and the oxidized catalyst. Based on the experimental data and theory- based calculations, it was shown that oxidation of the active Ta catalyst leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of mono- and di-meric species on the SiO 2 surface. <b>The</b> obtained <b>results</b> were compared <b>to</b> those of <b>the</b> previously reported time-resolved HEROS study on an inactive silica supported Ta(V) bisalkyl catalyst’s concentration evolution during its oxidation Błachucki et al. (2015). The study allowed observation of an immediate transition of the active Ta catalyst from its unoxidized form <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oxidized one. This finding is <b>dissimilar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>the</b> study on the inactive Ta catalyst, where the oxidation led through an intermediate step...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the time course of}} oculomotor competition between bottom-up and top-down selection processes using saccade trajectory deviations as a dependent measure. We used a paradigm {{in which we}} manipulated saccade latency by offsetting the fixation point at different time points relative to target onset. In experiment 1, observers made a saccade to a filled colored circle while another irrelevant distractor circle was presented. The distractor was either similar (i. e., identical) or <b>dissimilar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target. <b>Results</b> showed that <b>the</b> strength of saccade deviation was modulated by target distractor similarity for short saccade latencies. <b>To</b> rule out <b>the</b> possibility that the similar distractor affected the saccade trajectory merely because it was identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target, the distractor in experiment 2 was a square shape of which only the color was similar or <b>dissimilar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> showed that deviations for both short and long latencies were modulated by target distractor similarity. When saccade latencies were short, we found less saccade deviation away from a similar than from a dissimilar distractor. When saccade latencies were long, the opposite pattern was found: more saccade deviation away from a similar than from a dissimilar distractor. In contrast to previous findings, our study shows that task-relevant information can already influence the early processes of oculomotor control. We conclude that competition between saccadic goals is subject to two different processes with different time courses: one fast activating process signaling the saliency and task relevance of a location and one slower inhibitory process suppressing that location.

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of lowland rivers subjected to channelization and artificial levee construction {{should attempt to}} improve habitat heterogeneity and diversity of floodplain hydrological connectivity. However, rehabilitation efforts rarely consider the importance of variable lateral hydrological connectivity between floodplain waterbodies and main river channels (ranging from those permanently connected to those temporarily connected during river level rises), instead focusing on increasing individual floodplain waterbody connectivity. This study investigated the young-of-the-year (YoY) fish communities in 10 artificial floodplain waterbodies of variable hydrological connectivity with the river Trent, England, between May and November 2006, inclusive. Floodplain waterbody connectivity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main river {{was positively correlated with}} the number of species captured (alpha diversity), Shannon–Wiener diversity, Margalef's species richness index and the relative abundance of rheophilic species and negatively correlated with species turnover (beta diversity).

40|$|Auditory {{and visual}} signals {{generated}} by a single source tend to be temporally correlated, such as the synchronous sounds of footsteps and the limb movements of a walker. Continuous tracking and comparison {{of the dynamics of}} auditory-visual streams is thus useful for the perceptual binding of information arising from a common source. Although language-related mechanisms have been implicated in the tracking of speech-related auditory-visual signals (e. g., speech sounds and lip movements), it is not well known what sensory mechanisms generally track ongoing auditory-visual synchrony for non-speech signals in a complex auditory-visual environment. To begin to address this question, we used music and visual displays that varied in the dynamics of multiple features (e. g., auditory loudness and pitch; visual luminance, color, size, motion, and organization) across multiple time scales. Auditory activity (monitored using auditory steady-state responses, ASSR) was selectively reduced in the left hemisphere when the music and dynamic visual displays were temporally misaligned. Importantly, ASSR was not affected when attentional engagement with the music was reduced, or when visual displays presented dynamics clearly <b>dissimilar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music. These <b>results</b> appear to suggest that left-lateralized auditory mechanisms are sensitive to auditory-visual temporal alignment, but perhaps only when the dynamics of auditory an...|$|R

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) diagnostic interview {{information from a}} representative, stratified sample of 85 (selected from 2, 212) Hong Kong and 1, 706 age- and sex-matched U. S. adolescents. Current prevalence rates (Hong Kong: 2. 2 %, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] = 1. 3 % to 3. 1 %; United States: 2. 2 %, 95 % CI = 1. 6 % to 3. 0 %) were similar in the two cultures. More Hong Kong compared to U. S. adolescents reported fatigue/loss of energy and fewer reported irritability. All Hong Kong participants with MDD reported fatigue, sleep, and concentration difficulties. Hong Kong adolescents who did not meet criteria for MDD but reported high levels of depressive symptoms showed social function and cognitions similar to youth with MDD and <b>dissimilar</b> <b>to</b> nondepressed youth. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> suggest that adolescent MDD is as prevalent in Hong Kong as in the West and that "subthreshold" depression is not a benign condition.
