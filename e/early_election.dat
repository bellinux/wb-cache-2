5|$|According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl {{organised}} {{a meeting}} between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning. They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the <b>early</b> <b>election</b> results in March dented this confidence.|$|E
5|$|In opposition, Weaver {{witnessed}} {{the end of}} the Nationalist Party and was elected Deputy Leader of the new United Australia Party (UAP) in New South Wales in 1931. When Lang's Government was dismissed on 13 May 1932 by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game, an <b>early</b> <b>election</b> was called by caretaker-Premier and UAP Leader, Bertram Stevens. At the 11 June 1932 election, in which Weaver was returned with 80.70%, Stevens' UAP/Country Coalition gained 31 seats and won government. Stevens had already appointed Weaver as the Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Health on 16 May 1932.|$|E
5|$|Strom also {{resisted}} calling an <b>early</b> <b>election</b> to {{give his}} government a fresh mandate, despite Hamilton's impassioned advocacy for this course of action. He was no more positive towards Anderson's proposals for a radical overhaul of the party, including the computerization of political data (such as voting trends, demographic shifts, and polling results) and the purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising. The ideas that Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved.|$|E

5|$|Upon his ascension, Playford {{headed a}} {{minority}} government; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 {{seats in the}} lower house. The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. Many had gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives. He also used the threat of an <b>early</b> <b>election</b> to deter the independents from stalling his initiatives—with their lack of party infrastructure and funding, {{they would be the}} most vulnerable to election campaigns.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{prerogative}} of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session {{begins with the}} monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and {{is followed by a}} general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds {{of the members of the}} House of Commons vote to hold an <b>early</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany in March 1939 convinced Huggins that war was imminent. Seeking to renew his government's mandate to pass emergency measures, he called an <b>early</b> <b>election</b> {{in which his}} United Party won an increased majority. Huggins rearranged his Cabinet on a war footing, making the Minister of Justice Robert Tredgold Minister of Defence as well. The territory proposed forces not only for internal security {{but also for the}} defence of British interests overseas. Self-contained Rhodesian formations were planned, including a mechanised reconnaissance unit, but Tredgold opposed this. Remembering the catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade on the Western Front in World War I, he argued that one or two heavy defeats for a white Southern Rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have irrevocable effects on the country as a whole. He proposed to instead concentrate on training white Rhodesians for leadership roles and specialist units, and to disperse the colony's men across the forces in small groups. These ideas met with approval in both Salisbury and London and were adopted.|$|E
40|$|This note {{presents}} some of {{the consequences}} due {{to the possibility of}} having <b>early</b> <b>elections.</b> First of all, elections, whether exogenously or endogenously determined, are relevant to challenge the well known neutrality principle of economic policies under rational expectations. Furthermore, in the particular case of being possible to admit <b>early</b> <b>elections,</b> the electoral advantages of right-wing parties in relation to left-wing parties suffer a diminishment. <b>Early</b> <b>Elections,</b> Median Voter, Partisan Policies...|$|R

Maine would continue to hold <b>elections</b> <b>early,</b> in September, until 1958.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} widely {{reported}} during the coalition negotiations that the AKP heavily favours going into an <b>early</b> <b>election,</b> with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also being reported to have been heavily sceptical of a coalition government.

25|$|Elections were, however, never held. Already in December 2006, Abbas {{announced}} {{a plan for}} <b>early</b> <b>elections</b> not be held until mid-2007, provoking high tensions and some clashes between Hamas and Fatah supporters. In July 2007, he again called for <b>early</b> <b>elections.</b> Other calls were in October 2009 and in February 2011.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} welfare {{analysis}} of <b>early</b> <b>elections</b> in a dynamic model of political competi-tion with endogenous political blockades. Blockades arise if a party wins an election {{due to the}} support of voters with extreme policy preferences. We show that flexible election timing has the advantage that political blockades are overcome and political decisions are taken more frequently, but also the disadvantage that these decisions are of a lower quality. We argue that the disadvantage of <b>early</b> <b>elections</b> is likely to dominate, but that time-consistency problems make a constitutional ban on <b>early</b> <b>elections</b> difficult to maintain in a parliamentary democracy...|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} ČSSD in the 1996 {{legislative}} election {{allowed him to}} prevent his rival Václav Klaus and his Civic Democratic Party (ODS) from forming a majority government.

Political opponents claimed that Clark could have continued to govern, and that a snap election was called {{to take advantage of}} Labour's strong position in opinion polls.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the bailout {{required}} following Lenihan's renewed bank guarantee, the government's coalition partner, the Green Party, called for an <b>early</b> <b>election</b> and withdrew from government on 23 January 2011.

25|$|The {{breakdown}} of coalition {{negotiations between the}} AKP and the CHP, {{as well as the}} MHP's scepticism of forming a coalition government resulted in Davutoğlu stating that an <b>early</b> <b>election</b> was the only option, though he requested a final meeting with MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli. With a spate of terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) on Turkish soil in response to the government's Operation Martyr Yalçın, Bahçeli ended his support for an <b>early</b> <b>election</b> claiming that it was not possible during such circumstances. He set out four new unconditional terms for a coalition, which were the complete end to discussions over changing the first four articles of the Turkish Constitution, the ending of the Solution process, a limit on Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's powers within a parliamentary system with checks and balances restored as well as the re-opening of the suppressed corruption investigations into four former AKP government ministers. The negotiations, held on 17 August, broke down, effectively ending all prospects for a coalition government. Davutoğlu stated that he would subsequently relinquish the task of forming a new government.|$|E
