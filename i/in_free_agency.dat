5|$|Due to {{the trading}} of wide {{receiver}} Anquan Boldin <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> Smith started the 2013 {{season as the}} Ravens starting receiver.|$|E
5|$|Several players left <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> {{including}} Terry Porter (1995), Buck Williams (1996), and Cliff Robinson (1997), {{which left}} Jerome Kersey unprotected in the 1995 expansion draft.|$|E
5|$|While the Penguins would {{successfully}} {{defend their}} Stanley Cup championship the following year, the HBK Line was broken up when Kessel {{was moved to}} the 2nd line with Evgeni Malkin, and would be broken up for good when Bonino left the team <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b>|$|E

5|$|Davis was the 18th player {{taken in}} the first round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft, chosen by the New York Mets in his junior year as {{compensation}} for the Mets' loss of Tom Glavine to the Atlanta Braves <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b> He was drafted for his power bat. Baseball America ranked him the third-best college power hitter in the draft, and The New York Times indicated that he projects to hit 25–30 home runs. He signed for $1.575 million.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving his}} sentence, Vick {{signed with the}} Eagles in 2009. As {{a member of the}} Eagles for five years, he enjoyed the {{greatest}} statistical season of his career and was named to a fourth Pro Bowl in 2010, but left the team after being unable to match his prior success. In his final two seasons, Vick played for the New York Jets and Pittsburgh Steelers for one year each, primarily as a backup. He officially retired from professional football in 2017 after spending the entirety of the 2016 season <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{a season}} of ups-and-downs with injury and form, Jeremy Lin {{was traded to the}} Lakers on July 13, 2014. That same day, the Rockets {{declined}} to match the three-year, $46 million offer sheet that Chandler Parsons received from the Mavericks, and to compensate for his departure, the Rockets agreed to bring back Trevor Ariza on a four-year, $32 million deal <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b> The deal was officially completed as a three-team trade, in which the Rockets received Ariza in a sign and trade from the Washington Wizards and traded Ömer Aşık to the New Orleans Pelicans.|$|E
5000|$|The Packers {{were awarded}} a 5th round pick (5-169) for their loss of DT Colin Cole <b>in</b> the 2009 <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> period.|$|R
50|$|On March 13, 1992, {{he signed}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> with the New York Jets. He was waived on October 20, 1992.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, he {{was signed}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> by the Denver Broncos and was cut on August 18, {{before the start}} of the season.|$|R
5|$|He {{finished}} {{the season with}} 33 starts and averages of 12.5 points and 4.1 assists a game along with career highs in field goal percentage (44.6%), three-point percentage (35.8%), and free throw percentage (82.3%). He shot 57.8 percent off of drives during the season, exceeded only by LeBron James (63.8 percent) in the league. In the playoffs, Lin averaged 11.3 points off the bench as Houston lost in six games to the Portland Trail Blazers. He scored 21 points in a Game 5 win that extended the Rockets season. During the offseason, the Rockets pursued Lin's former Knicks teammate Anthony <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> and showed images outside of its arena of Anthony in a Houston jersey bearing Lin's No. 7.|$|E
5|$|As Dallas {{celebrated their}} title, the NBA {{was in a}} lockout. It ended on December 8, 2011. The {{defending}} champions lost core players, such as DeShawn Stevenson, J. J. Barea, Peja Stojaković, and Tyson Chandler, while adding veteran all-star Vince Carter, Lamar Odom, and Delonte West <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b> The Mavericks played only two preseason games, {{which led to a}} slow start for Nowitzki. Soon, Nowitzki became the 98th player in NBA history to play in 1,000 games. Nowitzki received his championship ring on January 25, 2012. After scoring his 23,335th point, Nowitzki passed Robert Parish on the all-time scoring list at #20. He then passed Charles Barkley for 19th, and scored his 24,000th point on April 15, 2012 against the Lakers. Nowitzki blocked a shot by the Celtics' Avery Bradley, which was his 1,000th block. He became one of only 3 players in NBA history with at least 1,000 3-pointers and blocks, joining Clifford Robinson and Rasheed Wallace. Nowitzki made his 11th straight All-Star game appearance in Orlando. Nowitzki scored 31 points in the second half against Houston on April 18, 2012, including 21 in the fourth quarter. It marked the third-highest scoring half by a Dallas player in franchise history. The 21 points in the fourth quarter also represented Nowitzki's third-highest scoring quarter of his career. Carrying the load of the Mavericks, Nowitzki led his team in scoring 45 times. On March 30, he led the Mavs down from 15 points, including a game winner, against the Magic. Nowitzki's streak of 11 seasons with 1,500 points came to an end after scoring 1,342 in the shortened NBA season. The Mavs clinched the seventh spot in the West, and were matched against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2012 NBA Playoffs. The Thunder swept the Mavs in 4 games.|$|E
5|$|During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Jeter {{broke his}} right ankle while {{attempting}} to field a ball. He {{was one of many}} Yankees to miss playing time during the club's 2013 campaign; 20 players were placed on the disabled list at least once. The team had an opportunity to win a wild-card playoff spot, but faded late in the season. It was only the second time since 1995 that New York did not qualify for postseason play. In the offseason, second baseman Robinson Canó departed New York for the Mariners <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> but the Yankees signed starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who was coming off a 24–0 year with Japan's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, to a seven-year contract. Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season by MLB for using performance-enhancing drugs. The 2014 Yankees, the last with Jeter in their lineup, fell four games short of a postseason berth with an 84–78 record. Despite signing several new hitters prior to the season, the team finished third from last in the AL in runs scored. The offense improved in 2015, ending the regular season with the second-most runs in MLB. New York gained a wild card berth with a second-place finish, but was defeated by the Houston Astros in a one-game playoff. The Yankees traded several veteran players during their 2016 season, and Rodriguez was released from his contract. The club had 84 wins, but missed the playoffs {{for the third time in}} four years. As the Yankees' on-field performance declined after 2009, their attendance and television ratings fell; revenue from ticket and luxury suite sales at Yankee Stadium decreased by more than 40percent from 2009 to 2016.|$|E
50|$|Robertson v. National Basketball Association, 556 F.2d 682 (2d Cir. 1977), was an {{antitrust}} {{lawsuit filed}} by American basketball player Oscar Robertson against the National Basketball Association. Filed in 1970, the lawsuit was settled in 1976 and resulted <b>in</b> the <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> rules now used in the NBA.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the Cincinnati Bengals {{signed him}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b> Even though {{he led the}} team in kickoff return yardage during the preseason, he didn't make the team.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1991 season, he {{was left}} {{unprotected}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> and signed with the San Francisco 49ers, but was cut during training camp in 1992.|$|R
25|$|Brady and the Patriots {{began the}} season with much {{upheaval}} on the offensive side of the ball. Tight end Rob Gronkowski was injured and Aaron Hernandez was arrested. Wes Welker departed to the Denver Broncos, Danny Woodhead left <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> for the San Diego Chargers, and Brandon Lloyd {{was released from the}} team. In order to replace the five players, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> from the Rams, drafted rookie wide receivers Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins. In the first two games of the season, Brady completed 52% of his passes and had three touchdowns and one interception.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} move <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> however, was {{the signing of}} former Pro Bowl wide {{receiver}} T. J. Houshmandzadeh from the Cincinnati Bengals to a 5-year, $40 million deal with $15 million guaranteed two days after signing Cole. Houshmandzadeh was rated {{as one of the}} top free agents available.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots {{entered the}} season without their two {{starting}} wide receivers from 2005; David Givens left <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> while Deion Branch {{held out for}} a new contract before being traded in early September. Eventually replacing them were Reche Caldwell and Jabar Gaffney, who was signed as a street free agent in October. Back-to-back losses in November ended the team's streak of 57 games without consecutive losses, three games shy of the NFL record.|$|E
50|$|In September 2015, Xpecial {{released}} a vlog confirming {{that he would}} be leaving Team Liquid. His replacement Smoothie was announced a few weeks later, and shortly after Xpecial became a <b>free</b> agent. <b>In</b> his <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> announcement, he stated that he had played briefly with Cloud9's new Challenger team but that it hadn't worked out.|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} Seattle Mariners <b>in</b> 2004 via <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> Cameron played {{his first game}} back in Seattle during interleague play in May 2006. Mariners fans greeted his return with a {{standing}} ovation.|$|R
50|$|On April 1, 1992, {{he signed}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> with the Denver Broncos. He was waived on August 31, after falling behind in {{training}} camp to Clarence Kay, Reggie Johnson and Shannon Sharpe.|$|R
25|$|After the disappointing 2006 season, the Buccaneers for {{the first}} time in several seasons had money to spend <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b> They brought in quarterback Jeff Garcia, {{offensive}} tackle Luke Petitgout, defensive end Kevin Carter, and linebacker Cato June. On April 28, 2007, the Buccaneers drafted Clemson defensive end Gaines Adams with the 4th overall pick in the NFL Draft. After the draft the Buccaneers picked up tight end Jerramy Stevens and defensive tackle Ryan Sims.|$|E
25|$|The Lightning {{entered the}} 2014–15 season with major re-signings during the {{off-season}} including centre Tyler Johnson, wingers Ryan Callahan and Ondrej Palat, and goalie Ben Bishop. <b>In</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> Tampa Bay picked up centre Brian Boyle and defenceman Anton Stralman from the New York Rangers and Brenden Morrow from the St. Louis Blues. The team made two trades to bolster the defence, picking up Jason Garrison at the 2014 draft and Braydon Coburn just before the 2015 trade deadline.|$|E
25|$|On {{the heels}} of their first playoff series win in nearly a decade, the Bulls entered the 2007–08 season with high expectations. Prior to the season, Gordon and Deng both turned down offers for {{contract}} extensions, believing they could earn more <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b> Following a 9-16 start, Scott Skiles was fired and the Bulls did not recover. The Bulls drafted Derrick Rose with their first overall pick in 2008, raising questions about how Gordon and Rose could coexist in Chicago's backcourt (both were score-first guards).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{a drop in}} production, Smith {{was seen}} still as a hot {{commodity}} <b>in</b> the <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> blitz that followed the strike in late 1998. In what seemed at the time like a bizarre move, Smith signed for very little money with the Minnesota Timberwolves. For the next two years, Smith played very productively at small forward alongside All-Star Kevin Garnett.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{he signed}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> with the Kansas City Chiefs. He {{spent the first}} six {{weeks of the season}} on the injured reserve list, after {{injuring}} ligaments in his finger during the third preseason game.|$|R
50|$|After the Brand signing, {{the first}} weeks of July were quiet <b>in</b> terms of <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b> Rumors spread that key {{restricted}} free agents Andre Iguodala and Louis Williams were being pursued by the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors respectively.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> {{they signed}} Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24million deal. That was {{to counter the}} {{defection}} of Vladimir Radmanović to the Lakers in a similar deal, except Radmanovic signed for an extra year, but both players would make {{the same amount of}} money annually, which would be $6million. Sam Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13million deal. Cassell stated that once he retired he would like to join the Clippers' coaching staff under Mike Dunleavy, Sr. The team also signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal.|$|E
25|$|Ellsbury {{was first}} {{drafted by the}} Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 23rd round of the 2002 MLB draft, but did not sign. He was drafted next as 23rd overall by the Red Sox in the 2005, after playing college {{baseball}} for three years at Oregon State University. Ellsbury is the only Red Sox player in history {{to be a member}} of the 30–30 club. In 2011, Ellsbury also won the Gold Glove Award, the Silver Slugger Award, and was the American League MVP runner-up to Justin Verlander. After the 2013 season, Ellsbury signed a 7-year, $153 million contract with the Yankees <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following the Holiday trade, {{many of the}} team's {{returning}} {{players were}} either waived or left the team <b>in</b> <b>free</b> <b>agency,</b> most notably Andrew Bynum; of the 15 players on the team's roster during their {{final game of the}} 2012–13 season, only six remained with the team by January 1, 2014. In their place were a number of young prospects, many coming from the NBA Development League or signing with the Sixers after playing limited roles on other teams. Further moves at the trade deadline on February 20, 2014, saw the exits of veterans Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, and Lavoy Allen, all of whom were key rotational players.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, he {{was signed}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> by the San Diego Chargers and was {{switched}} to center. He {{was assigned to}} the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football, before being released on August 31.|$|R
2500|$|Ker signed <b>in</b> plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> {{with the}} Denver Broncos on March 27, [...] He {{was placed on}} the injured reserve list during the [...] {{pre-season}} and eventually started 10 games after being reactivated. He was waived on July 9, [...]|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, he {{was signed}} <b>in</b> Plan B <b>free</b> <b>agency</b> by the Dallas Cowboys, reuniting {{with his former}} University of Miami head coach Jimmy Johnson. He {{was used as a}} {{blocking}} tight end and was a part of two Super Bowl championship teams.|$|R
