5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E

Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It {{can also be}} grown in a pot, with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.|$|E

5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E

He may ride a man or an elephant. He {{is related to the}} Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.|$|E
