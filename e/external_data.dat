40|$|Around the world, higher {{education}} institutions are facing {{a growing number of}} challenges. In recent decades, considerable interest has emerged on identifying those challenges and proposing efficient ways to address them. This thesis reviews a wide range of literature on {{higher education}} challenges and identifies related intuitional data, <b>data</b> repositories and <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> sources to address these challenges. It subsequently explores whether certain higher education challenges and in particular student retention, progression and completion can be better addressed using data from various data sources and the recent development of technologies such as, data analytics and linked data. Traditionally, research in this area is survey-based and survey-based studies have some drawbacks such as, low participation rate and the high cost associated with it. This research sought to overcome these problems. To this end, two experiments were conducted. The first experiment examined the sufficiency of linked <b>data</b> and <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> sources to develop blended prediction models to predict at-risk students in their first year of study. The result based on 149 undergraduate students’ data, established that prediction models based on institutional repositories and <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> perform better than survey-based one. The second experiment examined the capabilities of institutional repositories and <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> sources in predicting students’ first year marks and established that models using institutional repositories and <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> sources can perform better than models based on only institutional repositories. In order to examine the capabilities of linked <b>data,</b> <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> and data analytics, a data integration and analytics environment was deployed. The four key contributions of this thesis are: (1) it presents a comprehensive list of higher education challenges and required data and data repositories to address these challenges; (2) it demonstrates how <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> sources can be used to accurately predict students at-risk and students’ first year marks; (3) it shows how including <b>external</b> open <b>data</b> sources in prediction models can increase the overall model accuracy and (4) it establishes {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} linked data to support in employing data analytics for predictive models in student retention, progression and completion...|$|R

We {{review a}} {{recently}} introduced computation model for streaming and <b>external</b> memory <b>data.</b> An {{important feature of}} this model is that it distinguishes between sequentially reading (streaming) <b>data</b> from <b>external</b> memory (through main memory) and randomly accessing <b>external</b> memory <b>data</b> at specific memory locations; it is well-known that the latter is much more expensive in practice. We explain how a number of lower bound results are obtained in this model {{and how they can}} be applied for proving lower bounds for XML query processing. ...|$|R

25|$|Although {{it had a}} 32-bit {{internal}} bus, the V60 {{had only}} a 16-bit <b>external</b> <b>data</b> bus and a 24-bit address bus.

25|$|The {{three top}} layers in the OSI model, i.e. the {{application}} layer, the presentation layer and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, {{there is no}} requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the <b>eXternal</b> <b>Data</b> Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.|$|E

2500|$|To {{achieve the}} high {{performance}} needed for mathematically intensive tasks, such as decoding/encoding MPEG streams, generating or transforming three-dimensional data, or undertaking Fourier analysis of data, the Cell processor marries the SPEs and the PPE via EIB to give access, via fully cache coherent DMA (direct memory access), to both main memory {{and to other}} <b>external</b> <b>data</b> storage. To {{make the best of}} EIB, and to overlap computation and data transfer, each of the nine processing elements (PPE and SPEs) is equipped with a DMA engine. [...] Since the SPE's load/store instructions can only access its own local scratchpad memory, each SPE entirely depends on DMAs to transfer data to and from the main memory and other SPEs' local memories. A DMA operation can transfer either a single block area of size up to 16KB, or a list of 2 to 2048 such blocks. One of the major design decisions in the architecture of Cell is the use of DMAs as a central means of intra-chip data transfer, with a view to enabling maximal asynchrony and concurrency in data processing inside a chip.|$|E
