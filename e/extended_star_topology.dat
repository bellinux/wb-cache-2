30|$|Our second {{proposal}} {{in this work}} targets {{the expansion of the}} coverage area by relay nodes. The network topology in the LLDN mode is limited to a star topology by definition and the covered area is restricted to a maximum diameter of two times the communication range. To expand the area of the WSN, data must be forwarded from devices outside the communication range of the base station via a relay node. We propose a way to extend the star topology to an <b>extended</b> <b>star</b> <b>topology,</b> so that the coordinator can collect data from so-called two-hop devices in a deterministic way, within the same superframe. A typical way of connecting two-hop nodes to a coordinator are relay strategies [13] or routing techniques in a tree, clustered tree [14] or mesh network topology, which usually uses more time and energy due to the required organization of the network [15].|$|E

No patch cord should be longer than 5m. Optional consolidation points are allowable in horizontal cables, often appropriate for open-plan office layouts where consolidation points or media converters may connect cables to several desks or via partitions.|$|R

50|$|In {{local area}} {{networks}} with a <b>star</b> <b>topology,</b> each network host {{is connected to}} a central hub with a point-to-point connection. So {{it can be said}} that every computer is indirectly connected to every other node with the help of the hub. In <b>Star</b> <b>topology,</b> every node (computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to a central node called hub, router or switch. The switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients. The network does not necessarily have to resemble a star to be classified as a star network, but all of the nodes on the network must be connected to one central device. All traffic that traverses the network passes through the central hub. The hub acts as a signal repeater. The <b>star</b> <b>topology</b> is considered the easiest topology to design and implement. An advantage of the <b>star</b> <b>topology</b> is the simplicity of adding additional nodes. The primary disadvantage of the <b>star</b> <b>topology</b> is that the hub represents a single point of failure. Since all peripheral communication must flow through the central hub, the aggregate central bandwidth forms a network bottleneck for large clusters.|$|R

40|$|Distributed average {{consensus}} {{is the main}} mechanism in algorithms for decentralized computation. In distributed average consensus algorithm each node has an initial state, and {{the goal is to}} compute the average of these initial states in every node. To accomplish this task, each node updates its state by a weighted average of its own and neighbors' states, by using local communication between neighboring nodes. In the networks with fixed topology, convergence rate of distributed average consensus algorithm depends on the choice of weights. This paper studies the weight optimization problem in distributed average consensus algorithm. The network topology considered here is a star network where the branches have different lengths. Closed-form formulas of optimal weights and convergence rate of algorithm are determined in terms of the network's topological parameters. Furthermore generic K-cored <b>star</b> <b>topology</b> has been introduced as an alternative to <b>star</b> <b>topology.</b> The introduced topology benefits from faster convergence rate compared to <b>star</b> <b>topology.</b> By simulation better performance of optimal weights compared to other common weighting methods has been proved.
