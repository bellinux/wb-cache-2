50|$|Jural Relationship {{is a type}} {{of legal}} {{relationship}} existing between the landlord and tenant as long as the valid tenancy shall continue between them with regard to the <b>demised</b> <b>premises.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{owners of}} the apartments can be {{at the same time}} {{occupiers}} but in some cases they will be investors. They are responsible for the maintenance of their apartments (known as <b>demised</b> <b>premises)</b> and they pay an annual service charge, inclusive of a fee, to the managing agent for managing the communal parts.|$|E
50|$|Intervening {{between these}} two noble patronages, we are also aware of an apparently-anonymous endowment, {{referred}} to only as 'Money's Charity'...which, (we learn from Cross Fleury's 1891 history of Lancaster), had emerged under an indenture dated the 13th of December, 1760, (in recitation of an earlier indenture of mortgage, dating from the 2nd of November, 1750), whereby 'two messuages and a garden situate in Skerton', (see Messuage) had been mortgaged to James Rigmaiden and Peter Cook, (referred to in contemporary documentation as 'Sidesmen' of the parish), as trustees {{on behalf of the}} residents of Skerton in the interests of securing support for those poor inhabitants of the same, requiring relief...as per agreement between the aforesaid trustees and John Money, who undertook to <b>demise</b> same <b>premises</b> in pursuance thereof, for a period of one thousand years.|$|R
50|$|The Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd {{owned the}} {{freehold}} of a shopping centre {{and they let}} the anchor unit to Argyll as a supermarket, for 35 years, starting 1979, with a covenant to ‘keep open the <b>demised</b> <b>premises</b> for retail trade’. In 1995, the store was making a loss and Argyll closed, despite The Co-operative Insurance's protests.|$|E
40|$|Problems of {{interpretation}} arise {{frequently in the}} context of a repairing covenant in a lease where the parties have sought to define their respective obligations in regard to the maintenance and upkeep of the <b>demised</b> <b>premises.</b> This article attempts to set out the general principles adopted by the courts in construing repairing covenants in leases and outline the legal meaning of particular words and phrases commonly used in such covenants...|$|E
40|$|Discusses by {{reference}} to case law, including Commonwealth authorities, the rights and duties of landlords where <b>demised</b> <b>premises</b> are abandoned by a tenant who has defaulted on the rent, including the remedies available to the landlord, the limitations on his right to sue for loss of rent due between abandonment and expiration of the term, and {{the applicability of the}} contractual doctrine of mitigation of damages in leasehold law. Examines the Court of Appeal decision in Reichman v Beveridge on the duty of mitigate loss in an action merely seeking recovery of rent as it accrues due...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} bring about an {{effective}} forfeiture of a lease, the landlord must take some positive and unequivocal step to signify to the tenant his intention of treating the lease as at an end {{as a consequence of}} the tenant's default. This may be done, under a forfeiture cluae, either by the landlord suing the tenant for possession or physically re-entering the <b>demised</b> <b>premises.</b> If the landlord opts for the latter mode of forfeiture, how does the landlord effect a physical re-entry and what are the restrictions on him doing so, given that the tenant may be opposed to a physical re-possession...|$|E
40|$|Discusses {{whether the}} {{doctrine}} under which a tenant a tenant is deemed to have forfeited his lease if he denies his landlord's {{title to the}} <b>demised</b> <b>premises,</b> entitling the landlord to re-enter the property without recourse to his right of re-entry under the forfeiture clause in the lease, should be abandoned by reason of amounting to a feudal relic. Considers the the two forms a denial of title can take: (1) denial by matter of record, where the denial {{is made in the}} course of court proceedings; and (2) denial by act in pais, where the tenant seeks to establish a title for himself or a third part adverse to that of the landlord. Considers whether the Law of Property Act 1925 s. 146 applies...|$|E
40|$|Normally a lessee {{encounters}} few if {{any legal}} difficulties in gaining possession of the leased premises on the date his term begins. If, however, a prior tenant or other person in possession prevents the lessee from taking possession, the latter must bring an action against either the lessor or the occupier to obtain relief. The {{purpose of this article}} is to examine the remedies available in Nebraska to the lessee who seeks (1) to obtain possession of the <b>demised</b> <b>premises</b> and (2) to obtain damages for the time he was denied possession.

40|$|At {{least since}} the {{decision}} in Poole 2 ̆ 7 s Case, 1 Salk. 368 (1703), it has been considered as settled that a tenant {{has the right to}} remove trade fixtures placed, upon the <b>demised</b> <b>premises</b> for the purpose of furthering his trade. There is a well-marked tendency in some jurisdictions to greatly extend this right of removal so as to include anything added by the tenant to the leased property 2 ̆ 2 in furtherance of the purpose for which the premises were leased. 2 ̆ 2 Hayward v. School District, 139 Mich. 541, 102 N. W. 999; Bircher v. Parker, 40 Mo. 118; Heddrick v. Smith, 103 Ind. 203; Wittenmeyer v. Board of Education, 10. C. C. 119. The right of removal, in the cases where it exists, must of course be exercised within the time settled by the law of the jurisdiction, and the rules in the various states are not entirely harmonious in that regard. For example compare Kerr v. Kingsbury, 39 Irich. 150, with Loughrad v. Ross, 45 N. Y. 792...|$|E
