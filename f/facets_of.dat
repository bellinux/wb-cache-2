5|$|I Am... Sasha Fierce is {{the third}} studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was {{released}} on November 12, 2008 through Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment. In its initial release, the album was formatted as a double album, intending to market Beyoncé's contrasting <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> artistry. The first disc, I Am..., contains slow and midtempo pop and R ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce (named after Beyoncé's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop genres. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyoncé worked with writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration.|$|E

40|$|In {{polyhedral}} combinatorics one {{often has}} {{to analyze the}} facial structure of less than full dimensional polyhedra. The presence of implicit or explicit equations in the linear system defining such a polyhedron leads to technical difficulties when analyzing its facial structure. It is therefore customary to approach the study of such a polytope P through the study {{of one of its}} (full dimensional) relaxations (monotonizations) known as the submissive and the dominant of P. Finding sufficient conditions for an inequality that induces a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> the submissive or the dominant of a polyhedron to also induce a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> the polyhedron itself has been posed in the literature as an important research problem. Our paper goes a long way towards solving this problem. We address the problem in the framework of a generalized monotonization of a polyhedron P, g-mon (P), that subsumes both the submissive and the dominant, and give a sufficient condition for an inequality that defines a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> g-mon(P) to define a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> P. For the important cases of the traveling salesman (TS) polytope in both its symmetric and asymmetric variants, and of the linear ordering polytope, we give sufficient conditions trivially easy to verify, for a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> the monotone completion to define a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> the original polytope itself. ...|$|R

5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> reality.|$|E
5|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E

Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp {{is used in the}} production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
