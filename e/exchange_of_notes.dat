From 1964 onwards the United States and United Kingdom had been in talks about leasing Diego Garcia to the US for military purposes, and by an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>notes</b> dated 30 December 1966, the UK government transferred Diego Garcia to the US for the purpose of hosting a defensive communications base. This agreement was to last for 50 years, with an additional 20-year extension if neither party wished to withdraw.|$|E

This <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>notes</b> degenerated into a major diplomatic incident {{when some of the}} contraband books were confiscated by Russian officials, and discovered to contain firearms. Arbore was singled out for extradition, but saved through the intercession of Take Ionescu, the Interior Minister, who even managed to have the weapons dispatched back to Romania. This was the beginning of an unusually close relationship with Romania's conservative environment and King Carol I (to whom he dedicated a volume of his memoirs). Reportedly as a favor to the Bessarabian activist, Carol was to allow safe passage into Romania to the wanted Russian Eser assassin Boris Savinkov. According to Arbore's own account, Carol, [...] "the founder of modern Romania", privately resented Russia's national policy on Bessarabia.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, Nehru {{signed with}} China the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known in India as the Panchsheel (from the Sanskrit words, panch: five, sheel: virtues), {{a set of}} {{principles}} to govern {{relations between the two}} states. Their first formal codification in treaty form was in an agreement between China and India in 1954. They were enunciated in the preamble to the [...] "Agreement (with <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>notes)</b> on trade and intercourse between Tibet Region of China and India", which was signed at Peking on 29 April 1954. Negotiations took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the PRC Government and the Delegation of the Indian Government on the {{relations between the two countries}} with respect to the disputed territories of Aksai Chin and South Tibet. By 1957, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai had also succeeded in persuading Nehru to accept the Chinese position on Tibet, thus [...] depriving Tibet of a possible ally, and of the possibility of receiving military aid from India. The treaty was disregarded in the 1960s, but in the 1970s, the Five Principles again came to be seen as important in China–India relations, and more generally as norms of relations between states. They became widely recognised and accepted throughout the region during the premiership of Indira Gandhi and the 3-year rule of the Janata Party (1977–1980). Although the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were the basis of the 1954 Sino-Indian border treaty, in later years, Nehru's foreign policy suffered from increasing Chinese assertiveness over border disputes and Nehru's decision to grant asylum to the 14th Dalai Lama.|$|E
2500|$|In the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty {{signed in}} 1952, Article 4 {{stipulates}} that “all treaties, conventions and agreements concluded before December 9, 1941 between Japan and China have become {{null and void}} {{as a consequence of}} the war.” While Peace Treaty of Shimonoseki is certainly a treaty nullified by this provision, however, in terms of international law, a territory once ceded by a legal and effective treaty remains a ceded territory even if the treaty is nullified afterwords. Article 3 stipulates that the disposition of property and claims of Japan and its nationals in Taiwan and Penghu shall be the subject of special arrangements between the governments of the ROC and Japan. And Article 10 stipulates that “nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).” From legal point of view, this provision confirmed that all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) are not nationals of ROC, but merely [...] "deemed as" [...] and to be treated as nationals of ROC for the purpose of the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty. Moreover, Note No. 1 in the <b>Exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>Notes</b> accompanying the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty stipulates that “the terms of the present Treaty shall, in respect of the Republic of China, be applicable to all the territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government.” Consequently, at that time Japan agreed that Taiwan is a territory under the control of the ROC. However, although Japan recognized ROC's administration over Taiwan, she refrained from recognizing Taiwan as sovereign territory of ROC due to the legal fact that Japan had renounced all right, title and claim to Taiwan in San Francisco Peach Treaty and could not make further disposition of Taiwan sovereignty.|$|E
