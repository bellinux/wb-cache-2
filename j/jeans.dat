5|$|Traditional attire in Faisalabad is Punjabi {{clothing}} {{such as the}} dhoti, kurta and pagri. Faisalabadi men wear white shalwar kameez as {{do women}} but also with a dupatta (scarf). The more conservative women wear burqas {{that may or may}} not cover the face. Combinations of Pakistani and Western attire are worn by women, such as an embroidered kurta worn with <b>jeans</b> or trousers, and half sleeve or sleeveless shirts with Capri pants. Men have adopted some of the modern Western styles for both casual and formal business dress such as dress pants, trousers, T-shirts and <b>jeans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by the <b>Jeans</b> length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|The artwork {{became one}} of the most imitated album covers in music. The image of a band in front of a brick wall dressed in ripped <b>jeans</b> and leather jackets was copied by Alvin and the Chipmunks in Chipmunk Punk. Ramoness artwork was ranked number 58 on Rolling Stones 1991 list of 100 Greatest Album Covers.|$|E

5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise <b>jeans,</b> shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise <b>jeans</b> and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather <b>jeans,</b> spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided {{with the rise of}} the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E
5|$|Also {{featured}} are Jason Stevens and Chloe Maxwell.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of his film <b>Jeans</b> (1998), S. Shankar wrote a script for his next film titled Mudhalvan (1999) having Rajinikanth in mind for the lead role. However, Rajinikanth could not act in the film due to {{schedule}} conflicts with Padayappa (1999). Hence the role went to Arjun Sarja. Post Anniyan (2005), Shankar decided to take a break before preparing for his next project.|$|E
5|$|Fungi {{are used}} {{extensively}} to produce industrial chemicals like citric, gluconic, lactic, and malic acids, and industrial enzymes, such as lipases used in biological detergents, cellulases used in making cellulosic ethanol and stonewashed <b>jeans,</b> and amylases, invertases, proteases and xylanases. Several species, most notably Psilocybin mushrooms (colloquially known as magic mushrooms), are ingested for their psychedelic properties, both recreationally and religiously.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, an Indian {{family court}} in Mumbai {{ruled that a}} husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and <b>jeans</b> and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.|$|E
5|$|In {{early to}} mid 20th century, Deshastha men {{used to wear}} a black cap to cover their head, with a turban or a pagadi being popular before that. For {{religious}} ceremonies males wore a coloured silk dhoti called a sovale. In modern times, dhotis are only worn by older men in rural areas. In urban areas, just like women, a range of styles are preferred. For example, the Deshastha politician Manohar Joshi prefers white fine khadi kurtas, while younger men prefer modern western clothes such as <b>jeans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lina Leandersson {{was born}} in Falun, Sweden. She took an {{interest}} in performing from an early age, acting in amateur theatre performances, attending drama courses, and performing street- and jazz dance. One of her first roles was in amateur theatre performance, playing the mother of a spoiled girl wanting new <b>jeans.</b> In 2006 she appeared as a jury member in the Swedish song competition Lilla Melodifestivalen. The same year, she was selected as one out of five, from a total of five hundred applicants, to participate in Nickelodeon's programledarskola, which was televised in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Liukin has {{expressed}} interest in the fashion world; she {{has served as a}} Longines Sports Ambassador of Elegance since 2006 and, along with her teammates Shawn Johnson and Alicia Sacramone, {{was one of the first}} female athletes ever to be signed as CoverGirl spokesmodels. She also collaborated with Vanilla Star <b>Jeans</b> to create a junior girls' clothing line and has modeled for Max Azria. In June 2010, she launched a line of girls' wear called Supergirl by Nastia for department store chain JC Penney.|$|E
5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed in <b>jeans</b> and a T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded <b>jeans</b> and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn <b>jeans</b> (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
5|$|The Frontiersmen - {{initially}} {{exclusive to}} members of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, but later opened membership to the entire student body - is a group of students who participate in university events to drive school spirit. At football games, the Frontiersmen—donning cowboy hats, Wrangler <b>Jeans,</b> and dusters for attire—run across the field with the university's flag and the Flag of Texas after each score.|$|E
5|$|The Hardy Boys {{have also}} been used to sell a variety of {{merchandise}} over the years, much of it tied to television adaptations. They have appeared in several board games, comic books, coloring books, and activity books, jigsaw puzzles, and lunch boxes; two LP albums, Here Come the Hardy Boys and Wheels; a Viewmaster set, a toy truck, charm bracelets, rings, wristwatches, greeting cards, <b>jeans,</b> and guitars.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} {{numerous awards}} and nominations. Although Vikram {{had hoped that}} the film would get him his second National Award, the film won its only National Award in the Special Effects category. Anniyan became the fourth film directed by Shankar to receive that award; the other three are Kadhalan (1994), Indian (1996) and <b>Jeans</b> (1998). It also won eight out of the total 15 awards awarded by Filmfare for the best of Tamil cinema.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density – often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for <b>Jeans</b> instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins as}} Rihanna, scantily dressed and wearing fishnet stockings, stands against a {{convertible}} {{car in a}} desert. Timberlake, wearing a leather jacket and black <b>jeans,</b> arrives on a motorcycle. He unbuttons his jacket to cool down and bathes in pink-colored water before greeting Rihanna at her Airstream trailer. The pair then climb onto {{the hood of the}} vintage car. In the next scene, Timberlake plays a guitar while lying on a large rocket. Throughout the video, Timberlake and Rihanna vary their poses from sultry to defensive.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, fungi {{have been used}} {{for a wide variety of}} {{industrial}} fermentations, whether working directly for their effects on materials such as processing paper pulp or bioremediating industrial waste, or serving as the source of enzymes for many purposes, such as fading and softening denim for fashionable blue <b>jeans.</b> Fungi yield a wide variety of industrial enzymes including amylases, invertases, cellulases and hemicellulases, pectinases, proteases, laccases, phytases, alpha-glucuronidases, mannanases, and lipases.|$|E
5|$|A 2001 {{article in}} the Star Tribune noted that Plato's Closet in 2001 stocked up on brand names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc., Silver <b>Jeans</b> Co., Sean John, Express, Inc., and Dr. Martens that they sold at a {{markdown}} of between 50% and 75%. Unlike consignment shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used clothes are purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises because people {{were more likely to}} sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise <b>jeans</b> and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight <b>jeans,</b> thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped <b>jeans</b> and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had {{then tried to}} conceal the crime by disposing of her body. The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees of her <b>jeans</b> indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Unlocked in 2014, Stan {{commenced}} working on Alesta the subsequent year at a Romanian music camp organized by Romanian composer Marius Moga; there she collaborated with three recording studios simultaneously. The title of the record is an abbreviation of Stan's stage name, also meaning 'ready' in Turkish. The accompanying artwork for the Japanese and other versions of the album show Stan posing {{in front of a}} black backdrop, with lettering displayed in white or red above her head. Editions of Alesta released by Ego Records and Warner Bros. Records featured a photograph with her laying over a motorcycle sporting a blonde wig, white underwear and a distorted pair of blue <b>jeans.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, Ratajkowski {{prominently}} {{defended the}} First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump, after overhearing Jacob Bernstein (son of Nora Ephron and Carl Bernstein) of The New York Times make what she considered was a derogatory remark about the president's wife {{at a party}} for Diane von Furstenberg. The following month, she became the face of DKNY intimates. She noted that by July 2017, her sex appeal, especially her cleavage, has caused her to lose jobs. The following month she became the face of DL1961 <b>jeans.</b> In August 2017, she also became {{the face of the}} entire DKNY brand for its fall 2017 campaign.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 global {{industry}} {{survey by}} ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, {{was found to}} be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide. Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

Rai then starred as a singer in her second successful film of 1999the musical drama Taal.|$|E
5|$|The National Repertory Orchestra (NRO) is an American summer symphony {{orchestra}} and academy that offers full fellowships to train young musicians for professional careers in music through performances, master classes and workshops. Based in Breckenridge, Colorado since 1993, its members, who {{range in age}} from 18 to 29, are selected from auditions held each year throughout the United States. NRO presents an eight-week series including two orchestral programs per week conducted by its Music Director Carl Topilow (conductor and director of the orchestral program at the Cleveland Institute of Music) as well as guest conductors. The orchestra was founded in 1960 by cellist and conductor Walter Charles. The orchestra was formerly known as the Blue <b>Jeans</b> Symphony based in Estes Park, Colorado, and later as the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra based in Evergreen, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and <b>jeans,</b> black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} {{deficiencies of}} the Laplacian model stimulated scientists {{to find a}} replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories addressed the issue, including the planetesimal theory of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Moulton (1901), the tidal model of <b>Jeans</b> (1917), the accretion model of Otto Schmidt (1944), the protoplanet theory of William McCrea (1960) and finally the capture theory of Michael Woolfson. In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the modern Laplacian theory. None of these attempts proved completely successful, {{and many of the}} proposed theories were descriptive.|$|E
