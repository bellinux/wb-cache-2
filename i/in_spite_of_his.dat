5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Roman Catholic leanings, {{evidenced}} {{by the use of}} pre-Reformation Latin texts for his motets and his 1606 conviction for recusancy, Peerson's position {{at the heart of the}} Anglican establishment confirms the overall esteem in which he was held.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{relatively}} small stature, , he excelled in the air, {{due to his}} heading accuracy and elevation. Renowned for his bending shots, {{he was also an}} accurate free-kick taker, and penalty taker, although he often refrained from taking penalties, stating that he believed it to be a cowardly way to score.|$|E
5|$|California Chrome was {{the top-ranked}} three-year-old {{in the nation}} by the NTRA in its post-race poll of June 9, 2014, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Belmont loss, and was fifth-ranked among American horses of all ages. In the June 12 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, {{published}} by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, he was ranked fifth in the world, one point behind the only American-based horse rated higher, Santa Anita Handicap winner Game On Dude, who was tied for third.|$|E

5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} {{large sums}} of money in the hobby. Murphy had a gambling habit that left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was {{published}} by Random House. The tale's rhyming verse accompanies illustrations by the author, and follows a disagreeable character called the Grinch and his attempts to thwart the arrival of Christmas by stealing the gifts, trims, and other trappings of the holiday from the happy Whos of Whoville. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attempts, Christmas arrives all the same.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lack of {{experience}} in dramatic roles, Bana was approached by director Andrew Dominik {{to appear in the}} film Chopper (2000), a biographical film based on the life of infamous Australian criminal Chopper Read. Dominik had been working on the project for five years, but was unable to find an actor to portray Read. Only after Read himself suggested Bana, having seen him perform a skit on television, did Dominik consider him for the part.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{athletic}} {{record and}} remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as}} a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his return}} to Schalke, Holtby was named in the {{starting}} line-up for the 2011 Supercup on 23 July and scored the first penalty in a penalty shoot-out victory over Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club the following month, netting Schalke's third in a 5–1 league win over Köln. Having previously played as an attacking fielder and winger, Holtby was converted to a deeper role under new manager Ralf Rangnick due to Spanish legend Raúl occupying the more advanced attacking position in the team. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more defensive role, Holtby managed to record a career best tally of nine goals for the season across 41 appearances, helping Schalke finish the campaign in fifth position {{in the league and}} as semi-finalists in the Champions League.|$|E

It was not that he saw or felt any hope connected with the circumstance; but it was grateful to the jealous covetousness of unlimited love thus to learn that no other ears had heard the sweet confessions that were denied its own.|$|R

5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> conservative militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of}} his ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E

5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} {{proved too}} much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he waved to. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old.|$|E
5|$|In 85, Agricola was {{recalled}} to Rome by Domitian, {{having served}} {{for more than}} six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era. Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania. The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{opted to}} remain in Madrid for the 2015–16 season as he sought {{to break into the}} first team under new club manager Rafa Benítez.

5|$|Kiprusoff {{was offered}} {{a spot on the}} Finnish team for the 2002 Winter Olympics, but {{declined}} citing a desire to focus on his professional career in North America. Kiprusoff was named the starting goaltender for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and earned a shutout against the Czech Republic. He posted four wins and a tie, including a second shutout, and a 1.18 GAA to lead the upstart Finns into the championship game against Canada. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 30 saves, the Finns were defeated by Canada 3–2. Kiprusoff did not play his best game in the final, according to Finland Head Coach Raimo Summanen, though he expressed pride in his team's effort.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff's {{friendliness}} {{toward other}} characters varies. She sympathizes with the short-tempered Squidward Tentacles, and considers {{him to be}} the prime example of an outstandingly good driver. Patrick, who has attended Mrs. Puff's class multiple times, is treated with respect by her <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> slow-wittedness (Patrick is an expert driver and has passed every time he appears, usually re-appearing in the school after losing his license in some way). Of all the residents of Bikini Bottom, she is closest to SpongeBob. While she normally dreads having to drive with SpongeBob, she often acts as a motherly figure towards him.|$|E

Eight state delegations – {{with a total of}} 55 votes – voted for Breckinridge <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> refusal of the nomination, making him the second-highest vote getter. Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes.
