" Statements such as these are <b>highly</b> subjective and <b>unlikely</b> to lead to any in-depth investigations of Aboriginal plant uses and management styles. This paper will show that his position was and is preposterous.

40|$|When a {{landslide}} or a debris-flow falls {{in a water}} body, a big wave, known as impulse wave or landslide tsunami wave, can be generated.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that only 5 % of musicians in Italy are regularly employed. In an attempt at understanding such a peculiar situation, we build a theoretical model of the musicians' labour market in which we embed the main institutional features of the Italian system. We notice how the presence of taxation incentivates {{the formation of a}} black market for musicians and discourages talented agents from becoming full-time musicians in all second-best economies. In Italy both tendencies are particularly strong, and further exacerbated by the presence of an actuarially unfair pension system for musicians. These inefficiencies might be corrected by a two-fold policy: the reform of the pension system, and the introduction of a sufficiently large unemployment benefit for musicians. We notice that the first step, while <b>highly</b> desirable, is <b>unlikely</b> to be politically feasible in the current Italian institutional setting. The second step, which has a general interest for any second-best economy, is instead viable under certain circumstances...|$|R
30|$|Research on {{preparing}} {{and supporting}} facilitators of mathematics PD {{is still at}} a very early stage, but there are meaningful insights to be gained from the more extensive literature on classroom teaching. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that facilitating a PD program is, in many respects, different from using curricular resources in the classroom. Even PD programs that are <b>highly</b> specified are <b>unlikely</b> to contain as many tools, artifacts, and resources compared to curricula intended for school-aged students. Also, PD programs generally place fewer constraints on facilitators, for example by assuming that adults will play a more central role in shaping their own learning. As such, facilitators are afforded the space to make interpretive moves, {{which may or may not}} affect their fidelity of implementation. It is likely that issues involving identity, knowledge, and beliefs will emerge as critical influences on PD facilitators (Gresalfi and Cobb 2011; Le Fevre and Richardson 2002; Stein et al. 1999) and thus should be incorporated in future studies of facilitation.|$|R

Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
40|$|I am {{grateful}} to Daniele Coen-Pirani and Finn Kydland for several helpful conversations. The volatility of US GDP suddenly declined during the early 1980 ’s and has remained low since. I develop a matching model with aggregate shocks and idiosyncratic productivity to explain how {{an increase in the}} supply of high-skill workers {{may have contributed to the}} ‘great moderation’. In the model, firms react to changes in the distribution of skills by creating jobs designed specifically for high-skill workers. The new worker-firm matches are <b>highly</b> productive and <b>unlikely</b> to be disintegrated by the aggregate shock. Thus, aggregate output volatility falls because the labor market stabilizes on the extensive margin. The model also features increases in both wage inequality and firm-level risk. GDP volatility sharply declined during the 1980 ’s and has remained low since (Kim and Nelson 1999, McConnell and Perez-Quiros 2000). The gradual influx of high-skill workers may have contributed to this sudden stabilization because firms react to changes in the distribution of skills by creating new jobs and modifying their hiring strategies.

40|$|It is ascertained {{that the}} theorem of proportionality, which {{maintains}} that replacement investment {{is a constant}} proportion of the outstanding capital stock, has several fundamental shortcomings. It derives from a model founded on assumptions that are <b>highly</b> restrictive and <b>unlikely</b> to hold in reality. It is alien to the thinking of researchers in industrial organization and other neighboring fields to economics that treat the durability of capital goods as a choice variable. It ignores several thorny conceptual and methodological issues and, perhaps most important, it may have restrained seriously the progress towards developing models based on more realistic approaches of production. However, despite its shortcomings, the theorem continues to dominate mainstream capital theory, most probably because of: a) its simplicity, and b) {{the lack of a}} model that might yield a better theorem in terms of standard criteria, like explanatory and predictive power, simplicity, fruitfulness, etc. For this reason attention is drawn to recent research which shows that a model centered on the heterogeneous structure of capital and the useful lives of its components is both feasible and exceedingly rich in theoretical and empirical implications. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of employer flexibility to work-life issues and negative spillover from work to non-work life on the attitudes of software developers.

Despite this general perception of the work-life boundary, our results show that intrusion of work into private life for this group of workers still has a substantial impact on work-related attitudes. Work-life boundary variables affect trust in the organisation which plays a mediational role in these variables' relationship to job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Our results suggest that even within this industry, where employees are relatively individualistic in orientation, <b>highly</b> marketable and <b>unlikely</b> to show attachment to a single organisation, mutual gains for employee and employer can be attained by an accommodating approach to non-work commitments which may lead to greater organisational attachment...|$|R

40|$|The {{manner in}} which doctors serve their athlete {{patients}} is guided by legal and professional governance. These refer to both {{the welfare of the}} patient and the obligations owed to them. Among these duties is the maintenance of confidentiality, which {{is at the heart of}} trustworthy doctor–patient relationships. The 2009 version of the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC) obliges all health-care professionals not to assist athletes who are known to be engaged in doping behaviours lest they commit a doping offence themselves under the auspices of the WADC.
