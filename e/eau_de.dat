25|$|The {{conventional}} {{application of}} pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, {{the nape of}} the neck, and the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer Sophia Grojsman behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise. The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance {{so that it is}} released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening. Cologne fragrance is released rapidly, lasting around 2 hours. <b>Eau</b> <b>de</b> toilette lasts from 2 to 4 hours, while perfume may last up to six hours.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, {{the term}} {{took on a}} second meaning.
