40|$|Abstract. Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{networks}} have become immensely popular in recent years. Despite many other advantages, what attracts users most is their anonymity feature. However, anonymity also opens doors to various security threats and malicious behaviors that could severely harm and annoy the users. In this paper, major {{weaknesses of the}} present P 2 P file sharing systems are identified to prove the significance of improving the authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity of the resources to be downloaded. Several approaches are proposed to enhance the security of P 2 P file sharing: 1) Encrypting respondent messages to queries; 2) Authenticating servents and messages with digital signature; 3) Verifying integrity of resources with secure-hash digest; and 4) Filtering malicious resources before <b>downloading</b> by <b>means</b> of majority-rule-polling. The approaches are demonstrated, without losing universality, using the most popular P 2 P protocol Gnutella 0. 4.

A few of the recent studies look at non-persistent TCP connections but with many limiting assumptions.

Our analysis is able to handle a large number (100 s) of TCP connections and still provides the <b>mean</b> file <b>download</b> times {{of each of these}} connections when all of them have different packet sizes, round trip times and max window size.

We demostrate the effectiveness of RED for congestion control in realistic Internet scenarios both theoretically and via simulations.

The article also examines the extent to which an ISP should be held liable for the infringing activities of its subscribers, concluding that this is a complex issue best dealt with by the legislature. If ISPs are to be given greater responsibility for the infringing activities of their subscribers, there may be a need for procedural safeguards to protect against unjust suspensions or terminations of subscriber accounts.

Can a P 2 P system {{be used for}} the distribution of files with time-critical data such as relevant software patches or virus footprints updates? We examine and compare different distribution architectures based on linear and tree topologies built on top of the P 2 P overlay, including in the analysis the presence of heterogeneous bandwidths, both symmetric and asymmetric access links. We propose an analytical solution of the distribution process that not only yields the <b>mean</b> <b>download</b> time but also the distribution of the download times. We validate the analytical model against a Monte Carlo based numerical solution, which {{can also be used to}} analyze scenarios where correlation and dynamic behavior make the theoretical analysis too approximate. The insights we gain are used to devise modifications of the distribution strategies that achieve good performance even when slow access links and incomplete knowledge jeopardize the fast delivery of the content. Indeed, with proper (yet simple) mechanisms the average completion times achieved are close to the minimal (lowest possible) ones, which indicates that the P 2 P paradigm can be used for delivering time-critical data. Finally the presence of non-cooperative peers is analyzed, assessing their impact for different scenarios. I...|$|R

40|$|Incentives play an {{important}} role in BitTorrent-like P 2 P networks, motivating users to contribute to others to achieve faster average download time for all peers. Recent related studies reveal that two problems remain unresolved in most popular incentive mechanisms for BitTorrent-like systems: 1) incompleteness: contributions are not entirely considered, and 2) unfairness: accumulated contributions are not considered. To solve these two problems, a budget-based incentive mechanism is here proposed. First, the lifetime of a peer is divided into three phases, and a peer's workload model is defined by analyzing the peer's behavior in different phases. Second, based on the entire contributions derived from workload, the peer's profit model is defined. Third, a method is proposed which enables users to create profit budgets empirically. Finally, a new budget-based priority unchoking algorithm is presented which considers the entirety of peers' past, current, and future contributions. It is demonstrated here that the budget-based incentive mechanism leads the system to market equilibrium. To test the effectiveness of the mechanism, a BitTorrent client coupled with TCP protocol analysis tools was run to collect real data and empirically parameterize the profit model. Then a modification to the BitTorrent protocol was implemented and evaluated, in which peers reward one another with profits from contributions. Simulations demonstrate that this incentive mechanism yields faster average download times and higher <b>mean</b> <b>download</b> rates compared with the tit-for-tat mechanism. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Participants {{may respond}} to phases of a {{workplace}} walking program at different rates. This study evaluated {{the factors that}} contribute to the number of steps through phases of the program. The intervention was automated through a web-based program designed to increase workday walking. Methods: The study reviewed independent variable influences throughout phases I–III. A convenience sample of university workers (n= 56; 43. 6 ± 1. 7 years; BMI 27. 44 ±. 2. 15 kg/m 2; 48 female) were recruited at worksites in Australia. These workers were given a pedometer (Yamax SW 200) and access to the website program. For analyses, step counts entered by workers into the website were <b>downloaded</b> and <b>mean</b> workday steps were compared using a seemingly unrelated regression. This model was employed to capture the contemporaneous correlation within individuals in the study across observed time periods. Results: The model predicts that the 36 subjects with complete information took an average 7460 steps in the baseline two week period. After phase I, statistically significance increases in steps (from baseline) were explained by age, working status (full or part time), occupation (academic or professional), and self reported public transport (PT) use (marginally significant). Full time workers walked more than part time workers by about 440 steps, professionals walked about 300 steps more than academics, and PT users walked about 400 steps more than non-PT users. The ability to differentiate steps after two weeks among participants suggests a differential affect of the program after only two weeks. On average participants increased steps from week two to four by about 525 steps, but regular auto users had nearly 750 steps less than non-auto users at week four. The effect of age was diminished in the 4 th week of observation and accounted for 34 steps per year of age. In phase III, discriminating between participants became more difficult, with only age effects differentiating their increase over baseline. The marginal effect of age by phase III compared to phase I, increased from 36 to 50, suggesting a 14 step per year increase from the 2 nd to 6 th week. Discussion: The findings suggest that participants responded to the program at different rates, with uniformity of effect achieved by the 6 th week. Participants increased steps, however a tapering off occurred over time. Age played the most consistent role in predicting steps over the program. PT use was associated with increased step counts, while Auto use was associated with decreased step counts...|$|R
40|$|The {{observations}} from the oceans are the backbone {{for any kind}} of operational services, viz. potential fishing zone advisory services, ocean state forecast, storm surges, cyclones, monsoon variability, tsunami, etc. Though it is important to monitor open Ocean, it is equally important to acquire sufficient data in the coastal ocean through coastal ocean observing systems for re-analysis, analysis and forecast of coastal ocean by assimilating different ocean variables, especially sub-surface information; validation of remote sensing data, ocean and atmosphere model/analysis and to understand the processes related to air-sea interaction and ocean physics. Accurate information and forecast {{of the state of the}} coastal ocean at different time scales is vital for the wellbeing of the coastal population as well as for the socio-economic development of the country through shipping, offshore oil and energy etc. Considering the importance of ocean observations in terms of understanding our ocean environment and utilize them for operational oceanography, a large number of platforms were deployed in the Indian Ocean including coastal observatories, to acquire data on ocean variables in and around Indian Seas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to develop an mLearning {{teaching}} model based on the inquiry method for the secondary school history subject. The construction of this model aims to show how mLearning combined with the inquiry method can be used to support the teaching of history. The study adopted the Design and Development Research Approach which was introduced by Ritchey & Klien (2007) to develop the model. Based on this approach, the study was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 involves a needs analysis using survey questionanaire that was conducted among 120 history teachers to investigate the need to adopt mLearning and consequently the development of this model. The data obtained were analyzed through descriptive statistic using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The Interpretation of of the data is based on the values of frequency and percentage. Phase 2 used the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method to develop the model based on views and decisions from panel of nine (9) experts. Data Interpretation was based on the model generated by ISM software and also via the classsification and network of relationships between the model elements (teaching activities). Phase 3 involves the evaluation of the model using a modified Fuzzy Delphi Technique by a panel of 30 people. The evaluation is based on experts responses to the 7 Likert scale questionnaire. Threshold (threshold ‘d’) are calculated to determine the experts consensus on all the items of the questionnaire while the deffuzzification values would be used to determine the decisions from the experts. Threshold value must exceed 75 % or not more than 2. 0 to determine the consensus among experts. While the defuzzyfication must be greater than 0. 5 Theoverall findings of the first phase shows that teachers have at least one mobile device technology (100 %, n = 120) of (74. 2 % = 89) with devices at least at level 2 (voice call capability,(SMS), video calls,receiving emails,surfing the internet,image and video recording and software to <b>download).</b> This <b>means</b> the history teachers have access to necessary technology for mLearning. The results also indicate the level of acceptance and intention ro the mLearning inquiry model. Therefore, studies for the construction of this model is required. Phase 2 results by the panel of experts has produced a model consisting of the teaching activities for the History subject. This activities relate to one another to form a mobile teaching model. The panel of esperts hold the view that the activity in the model can be divided into 3 part and 4 clusters of activities to facilitate the interpretation of the role of such activities. The results of phase 3, indicates that approval by the panel of experts is on (d = 86. 9 %) in the chosen teaching activities while the defuzzyfication values is greater than 0. 5. This model proposes the teaching of history based on the inquiry method to be combined in practice through the mLearning to help history teachers become facilitators and motivators during lessons...|$|R
