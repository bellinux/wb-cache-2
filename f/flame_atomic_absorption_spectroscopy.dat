40|$|A new {{analytical}} method {{has been developed}} for the determination of inorganic species or arsenic (arsenite and arsenate); in addition, a new sample preparation method for the determination of these species in atmospheric particulate matter has also been developed. In this procedure, As(III) and As(V) are efficiently separated in a two-step reduction procedure from a solution of HCl. In the first step, a slurry of Zn metal powder is used to reduce As(III) to arsine (AsH₃). Immediately following, NaBH₄ is used to reduce As(V) to AsH₃. The arsine produced during each reduction is detected in an N₂-H₂ air-entrained <b>flame</b> by <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> In the sample preparation method, sections of quartz or PTFE filters containing atmospheric particulate matter are leached in 10 ⁻⁴ N HCl for up to 1 hour at 90 °C. This procedure quantitatively removes As(III) and As(V) from either filter type. However, small changes in the As(III) /As(V) ratio i. e., oxidation of As(III) were observed when the arsenic species were leached from quartz filters. Therefore, it appears that PTFE would be the preferred filter medium if arsenic speciation is to be performed. When atmospheric particles are present on either filter type, the technique of standard addition is {{necessary in order to}} obtain the most accurate results. The combined sample preparation and analysis procedure has a precision of about 10 %, 8 % and 13 % for As(III), As(V) and the As(III) /As(V) ratio, respectively. Atmospheric particulate matter samples collected in Tucson, Arizona, were analyzed for As(III) and As(V) concentrations using the newly developed method. The results {{of this study indicate that}} both As(III) and As(V) are present in collected samples of atmospheric particulate matter. Arsenic (V) was observed in all 14 of the samples, while As(III) was measurable in half of the samples. The As(III) /As(V) ratio was determined to be in the range from less than 0. 05 to 1.

Because of the high intake of olive oil in our setting, this food can be considered a major source of essential elemental nutrients. En el presente trabajo se ha determinado la presencia de Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, Se y Cr en 64 muestras de aceite de oliva virgen, de oliva y de orujo de oliva producidos en Andalucía.

40|$|The {{reactivity}} and micro-structure {{of three}} coals and two cokes used in {{iron and steel}} manufacture have been studied {{by a variety of}} techniques, including gas sorption analysis, thermal analysis and microscopy. Changes in surface areas and porosities of the coals and cokes during combustion have been determined by a gravimetric nitrogen sorption technique at 77 K. The cokes and coals have been studied by thermal analysis under isothermal and dynamic conditions in different gas atmospheres. Rates of reaction have been correlated with surface area changes. Attempts have been made to calculate activation energies from Kissinger plots of DTA data. Microstructural changes in the cokes and coals during carbon burn-off have been investigated by electron microscopy. Relative porosities have been estimated by image analysis. Mechanical strengths of the cokes have been measured and correlated with porosity data. Selected metals in the carbons have been determined by <b>flame</b> photometry, <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The composition of residual mineral matter (ash) has been investigated by X-ray diffraction. The chemical compositions of the coal distillates have been characterised by ir/uv spectrosopy, NMR spectroscopy and by GC-MS techniques. Calorific values of the carbons have been determined. Results are discussed in relation to previous work and to applications 1 n blast furnace practice. In coal combustion the surface areas increase during the initial stages of carbon burn-off, reaching maximum at about 50 % burn-off before decreasing. The increases are considerably higher at 400 ° and 500 ° C than at 300 ° C for all three coals. Hysteresis data from the sorption isotherms show that the coals develop full ranges of mesa-porosity and some micro-porosity during burn-off at the higher temperatures. However, the coal oxidation is only slightly accelerated, since most of the new surface is located in the micro- and meso- pores where access to atmospheric oxygen is restricted by slow diffusion, so that the earlier stages of oxidation are approximately linear with time. This improves our knowledge of current empirical industrial carbon solution tests. There is comparatively little change in surface during the coking of the Coals at 1000 ° C and only restricted sintering of the coal ashes at 300 - 500 ° C. In the combustion of the cokes in carbon dioxide at 1000 ° C the maxima in surface areas occur within 25 % burn-off. However, one of the cokes shows a second maximum at later stages of burn-off, ascribed to the European component in the parent coal blend. This gives a more uniform rate of burn-off which is advantageous industrially. British Steel Corporation, Teesside Laboratorie...|$|R
