40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>sensor</b> dispatching problem for automatic control systems(ACS). We propose an algorithm which selects one (or a group of) <b>electrical</b> <b>sensor</b> at each time from {{a set of}} electrical sensors. Then, the automatic control prediction algorithm computes the estimates of the continuous state and the discrete state of the ACS based on the observation from the selected electrical sensors. As the <b>electrical</b> <b>sensor</b> dispatching algorithm is designed such that the Bayesian decision risk is minimized, the true discrete state can be better identified. At the same time, the continuous state prediction performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of automatic control prediction algorithms using only predetermined electrical sensors. Finally, our algorithm is validated though an illustrative target tracking example. 1...|$|E

40|$|While several {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} methods {{are available for}} assessing the applied loads, displacements, stresses, and strains in a concrete structure, very few techniques are available to enable condition assessment from a material durability viewpoint. Material health monitoring provides a valuable tool in assessing the current durability condition of a concrete structure (i. e., diagnosis), determining if and what preventative measures {{need to be taken}} to reduce future maintenance (i. e., prescription), and evaluating the remaining life and the future performance of the material (i. e., prognosis). ^ The objective of this research is development of a new material sensing system that is designed to measure several properties and state parameters of concrete necessary for evaluation of the material 2 ̆ 7 s performance. This sensing system is composed of three <b>electrical</b> conductivity-based <b>sensors</b> and a temperature <b>sensor.</b> The <b>electrical</b> <b>sensors</b> include a concrete conductivity (σ t) sensor (that monitors setting and hardening and measures microstructural and transport properties of concrete), a pore solution conductivity (σ o) sensor (that monitors changes in the internal chemistry of the system due to ion penetration or carbonation), and a conductivity-based relative humidity (RH) sensor (to monitor moisture transport and shrinkage of the material). The temperature (T) sensor enables determination of the rate of hydration and strength development of concrete while it provides information needed for temperature calibration of the <b>electrical</b> <b>sensors.</b> It is shown that the combined measurements of the three <b>electrical</b> <b>sensors</b> and the temperature sensor provide sufficient calibration information that enables determination of the desired material properties and state parameters of concrete. ^ This document provides a comprehensive description of several phases of the process used for development of the three conductivity-based sensors. To develop the prototype of these sensors, the mechanism of electrical conduction inside concrete and similar porous materials must be well understood. Several composite conductivity models are studied in this research to describe changes in the electrical conductivity of hydrating cement systems and specimens exposed to drying.
