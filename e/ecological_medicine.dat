50|$|In <b>medicine,</b> <b>ecological</b> {{health has}} been used to refer to {{multiple}} chemical sensitivity, which results from exposure to synthetic chemicals (pesticides, smoke, etc.) in the environment, hence the term ecological.|$|R
50|$|The terms {{traditional}} knowledge (TK), indigenous knowledge (IK), and local knowledge generally refer to knowledge systems {{embedded in the}} cultural traditions of regional, indigenous, or local communities. Traditional knowledge includes types of knowledge about traditional technologies of subsistence (e.g. tools and techniques for hunting or agriculture), midwifery, ethnobotany and <b>ecological</b> knowledge, traditional <b>medicine,</b> celestial navigation, ethnoastronomy, the climate, and others. These kinds of knowledge, crucial for subsistence and survival, are generally based on accumulations of empirical observation and on interaction with the environment.|$|R

She has spoken in public on the issue and has appeared on TEDx and EnviroVideo with Karl Grossman. In 1998, Raffensperger convened and attended the Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle. The first use of the phrase [...] "ecological medicine" [...] is attributed to Raffensperger, in an article entitled [...] "Our Planet, Our Selves" [...] on the UTNE website. <b>Ecological</b> <b>medicine</b> refers {{to the way in}} which people and the environment interact, and how an individual's acts towards the environment can have a negative effect on health.|$|E

He is now also {{the leader of the}} Students Discover project which aims to bring real science {{experiences}} to classrooms around the world. Dunn's work now includes studies of parasites of raccoons, bacteria in houses, ants in backyards, giant crickets that live in homes and the biodiversity of belly buttons. Meanwhile, Dunn's recent writing has considered the quest to find new superheavy elements, why men are bald, how modern chickens evolved, whether a virus can make you fat, the beauty of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the biology of insect eggs, the secret lives of cats, the theory of <b>ecological</b> <b>medicine,</b> why {{the way we think about}} calories is wrong, and why monkeys (and once upon a time, human women) tend to give birth at night.|$|E
5000|$|Incinerators {{have been}} under debate because they emit toxic by-products, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and dioxins. This has created a sense {{of concern for the}} health of people in the local communities. GreenAction has listened to this concern, and has been active in protesting against incinerators. They have been {{critical}} of the policy that surrounds incinerators, stating that there is an issue with the lack of monitoring.  Current policy states that incinerators do not have to report bypass emissions during startup and shutdown, when pollutants are likely to leak into environment. [...] Stericycle {{has been one of the}} main companies that Greenaction has been critical of. In Utah, citizens gathered to protest an incinerator owned by Stericycle because of a report from the Utah Division of Air Quality accusing Stericycle of manipulating emission tests and pumping excessive pollution into the air. According to a study conducted by British Society for <b>Ecological</b> <b>Medicine,</b> there are correlations between negative health effects and close proximity to incinerators. One example of many effects is that fine particulates in the air have been associated with a higher prevalence of asthma, and COPD. A factsheet published by Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA), and GreenAction has shown that many toxins released by incinerators are toxic even in low-amounts. GreenAction’s battlegrounds for incinerators focuses in the areas of Stanislaus County, CA, Parker, AZ, North Salt Lake City, UT, Phoenix, AZ, New Orleans, LA, Salinas Valley, CA, and Green Bay, WI.  But, advocate for clean air for everybody.|$|E
50|$|Integrated {{approaches}} {{to health and}} ecology re-emerged in the 1990s, and included one health, conservation <b>medicine,</b> <b>ecological</b> resilience, ecological integrity, health communities, {{and a variety of}} other approaches. These new movements were able to draw on a tradition that stretches from Hippocrates, to Rudolf Virchow and Louis Pasteur, who did not recognize the boundaries between human and animal medicine, and environmental and social change; to William Osler, who was a member of both the McGill medical faculty and the Montreal Veterinary College; Calvin Schwabe, whose 1984 book, Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, is a classic in the field; and James Steele, who founded the first veterinary public health unit in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} cats, rats of Vistar line and breed-free rats. The {{aim is to}} analyse the {{mechanisms}} of influencing amygdaloid complex as an emotional-genic regulatory system member on the efficiency of adaptation processes. The new knowledges about efficiency of the adaptation to the medium factors {{as a function of}} the central emotional-genic mechanism activity have been obtained. The mechanisms of the time connection formation process modulation by a amygdaloid complex and also the mechanism of signal selection according to the significance have been represented. It has been determined that the influence of amygdloid complex on the cold adaptation is realized at participation of the dofaminergic hypothalamus system. The results provide a base to develop the new training methods and also methods of the pharmacological protection in the extreme medium conditions. The hardware designs and methodical solutions in the field of determining catecholamines have been used in the industrial chromatographic plants. The results are used in the Tbilisi State University at lection course "Neurotharmacology". The designs have been introduced in the Kirghiz Research Institute of Cardiology and in the Production Association "Nauchpribor" (c. Oryel).

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence {{that humans are}} alter-ing the climate of the Earth (Watson and others 1997; Kerr 2000). Among the challenges to scien-tists concerned with climate change are predicting the consequences {{of global climate change}} and evaluating strategies for mitigating the negative ef-fects of these changes. To date, biodiversity has not been well integrated into global change studies. Biodiversity refers to the “species, genetic and ecosystem diversity in an area ” (Swingland 2000). We believe that biodiversity is highly relevant to both understanding global change and valuing its consequences. The diversity of organisms on the Earth provide a plethora of goods and services to humans, including foods, <b>medicines,</b> <b>ecological</b> ser-vices, and spiritual well-being (Pimental and others 1997). Biodiversity also influences how ecological systems respond to climate change. The responses of individual organisms to climate begins the cas-cade of ecological processes that are manifest as changes across landscapes, biomes, and the globe. The dynamics initiated by organisms often provide feedbacks to the atmosphere and oceans and fur-ther modify climate. Thus, the consideration of biodiversity is important for understanding ecolog-ical response to global change, predicting future responses, valuing these changes for humans, and designing strategies to mitigate negative effects. The following four papers project the potential responses of species, communities, and biomes to the changes in climate predicted under an anthro-pogenic doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) by general circulation models (GCM). They focus on the forest vegetation in the conterminous United States as reflected by changes in the distri-bution of biomes, community types, and tree spe-cies. Species richness of trees and terrestrial verte-brates is also analyzed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: to {{determine}} the peculiarities of the psychophysiological self-regulation of the persons of the type A behavior from {{the positions of the}} systemic approach under the conditions of the psychoemotional stress, to reveal the possibilities of the self-regulation processes correction by the method of the transcranial electrostimulation of the brain. It has been determined, that the components of the type A behaviour are not closely connected. In all psychoemotional situations, the persons with the type A behaviour are inclined to the larger mobilization of the psychophysiological effort. The transcranial electrostimulation reduces the hyper-reactivity of the persons with the type A behaviour and decreases the psychophysiological "price" of the activity. For the first time, the investigation of the phenomena of self-regulation of the persons with the type A behaviour has been performed and the possibility of the self-regulation correction, using the transcranial electrostimulation method, has been determined. The three rational proposals have been developed.
