50|$|Third Officer Charles Groves of the Californian {{testified to}} the British inquiry that at 23:10 ships time, {{he had seen the}} lights of another ship come into view 10 or 12 miles away, 3.5 points above Californians {{starboard}} beam. At about 23:30, Groves went below to inform Lord. The latter suggested that the ship be contacted by Morse lamp, which was tried, but no reply was seen. To Groves, she was clearly a large liner, as she had multiple decks brightly lit. The ship finally seemed to stop and extinguish her <b>deck</b> <b>lights</b> at 23:40, the same time Titanic stopped her engines. At the British inquiry, Groves agreed that if the ship he saw had turned two points to port, it would have concealed her <b>deck</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
50|$|With no {{radio or}} other {{electronic}} communications, we were adrift in the Northern Pacific. But we had power, lights, food and cooks, so things were reasonably good, {{as long as}} the exposed bulkheads held. Our Engineering staff trimmed the ballast in the tanks to lift the bow and lessen the strain there. Weather was not good; low ceiling, squalls, with snow flurries and strong wind. It was also poor visibility if anyone was looking for us. To help locate us at night, we focused our <b>deck</b> <b>lights</b> upwards in the clouds to extend our visibility. I don't know if that helped or not, but we were located about five days later at night. By daybreak, we had a Russian ship (loaded with railroad engines) and a British cargo ship alongside.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next day}} while making breakfast, Janet sees on TV the news {{coverage}} on the killings and confronts her brother about not telling her his true reasons for visiting her and invites him to stay permanently. While Brett is watching Werewolf of London (mistakenly confused for The Wolfman), he and Ted discuss werewolves and their existence, with Ted stating that it doesn't take a full moon to start the transformation {{and that he has}} [...] "been acquainted with a few in his time" [...] and Brett states that werewolves don't exist. While Brett throws out the trash, Ted tries to warn his sister and advises her to start listening to Thor and his sudden change in behavior and drops hints that the murders had been done by a wolf. She ignores his pleas and he retreats into his trailer where Thor follows him, waiting for him until the sun starts to set. Ted encounters a suspicious Thor but eventually leaves the trailer with the hopes of chaining himself again. With the sun setting Ted screams for Janet to take Thor away and when she does he rushes into the woods. Thor is afraid of Ted hurting his family and begins to bark until Brett lets him out of the house. He makes his way to the woods to find that Ted was too late and wasn't able to handcuff himself and has made his way into the backyard. Werewolf Ted attacks Thor but the dog fights back which wakes up Janet. Werewolf Ted is scared away when she turns on the bright <b>deck</b> <b>lights.</b> Janet sees Thor's injuries and, fearful of Ted's advice, calls the Sheriff and goes into Ted's trailer to notify him. She does not find Ted but instead finds his werewolf book, gruesome pictures of Marjorie's body and some of Ted's victims. She also finds a journal in which Ted details his pain and his turmoil with not finding a cure for his [...] "disease" [...] and his hopes of finding peace by his family's side. Werewolf Ted seems to lurk outside the trailer but Janet leaves safely, shaken but adamant about straightening things out with her brother. Later that night a [...] "flopsy" [...] who had previously tried to frame Thor for a false bite goes into Janet and Brett's yard with the intent of killing Thor but is instead attacked and killed by Werewolf Ted.|$|E

40|$|Longlining {{operations}} for Dissostichus eleginoides off South Georgia were assessed for interactions with seabirds {{and the effectiveness}} of measures employed by CCAMLR to mitigate seabird mortality. Following an agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Chile, a UK observer was placed aboard a Chilean longliner, the BF Cisne Verde, fishing in CCAMLR Subarea 48. 3 during the 1996 / 97 season. In this study 61 lines were laid from March to May 1997 using the Spanish double-line method. In accordance with CCAMLR conservation measures, lines were set at night, weights (6 - 7 kg) were set at 50 m intervals along the line, all <b>deck</b> <b>lights</b> were extinguished and no offal was discarded during setting. A streamer line made to CCAMLR specifications was also used, except during an experiment that attempted to assess the effectiveness of the streamer line in mitigating incidental mortality of seabirds during night-time setting. Data were recorded during hauling using a randomised cluster sampling method, developed to allow representative data to be collected when 100 % observer coverage could not be achieved: A total of 12 dead seabirds were recorded, giving an average mortality rate/night of 0. 099 birds/l 000 observed hooks, substantially lower than other vessels fishing around South Georgia during the same period. Mortalities consisted of nine white-chinned petrels, two black-browed albatrosses and one unidentifiable bird caught on hooks. One giant petrel was also killed as a result of flying {{into the side of the}} vessel. Generally, few birds were seen following the vessel during setting operations. During April, however, large numbers of white-chinned petrels were seen occasionally, and large numbers of black-browed albatrosses were seen when the moon was full. Live birds were observed to become caught on hooks during hauling on 23 occasions; all birds were released alive. Black-browed albatrosses concentrated on taking returning bait off the line and accounted for 18 birds caught; giant petrels concentrated on taking discarded offal, and accounted for five birds caught...|$|E

The consortium has rarely commented upon the profitability of the bridge, but during the structure's 10th anniversary, {{it was revealed that}} there had been a 30% cost overrun in construction ($330 million), The consortium is forced to cover this out of toll revenue since the federal government ferry subsidy is used to pay for the original tendered price ($1 billion). Operating costs for the bridge have also proven expensive, with warranty repairs for asphalt adherence and the complete replacement of all bridge <b>deck</b> <b>lighting</b> cutting into profits. Toll revenues have fallen over 30% since the bridge opened, largely because of declining tourism traffic and domestic travel and currently range from $25 to $30 million annually.

5000|$|The Lexington was {{commissioned}} by Cornelius Vanderbilt in early 1834. The ship's keel was laid down at the Bishop and Simonson Shipyards in New York in September 1834. Unlike later steamboats, no detailed plans of the ship were made. Instead, a wooden model of the hull was carved and altered according to Vanderbilt's satisfaction. Using the model as a guide, full-sized outlines were then drawn in chalk on the timber {{to be used for}} the hull, which was then cut and assembled by carpenters. The engine of the Lexington was constructed at the West Point Foundry.
