5|$|The {{late onset}} of Huntington's disease means {{it does not}} usually affect reproduction. The {{worldwide}} prevalence of HD is 5â€“10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically {{as a result of}} ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns. Prevalence is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower {{in the rest of the}} world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 <b>epidemiological</b> <b>study</b> of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} ways to reduce random error in an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>study.</b> The first is to {{increase}} the sample size of the study.

40|$|The {{identification}} and quantification {{of risk factors}} that are characterized by low exposure levels, moderately increased risks, and unspecific exposure-disease relations is a major challenge facing risk assessment today. Occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> {{can play a role}} in addressing this challenge. The main advantage of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> over other potential sources of information for risk assessment (primarily animal bioassays) is that in these studies humans are being investigated, rendering the extrapolation of study results from animals to humans unnecessary. However this advantage is also a disadvantage because occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> are mostly observational by nature which makes them prone to bias. Although some limitations of the use of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> in risk assessment are inherent to the discipline, improvements in the design, conduct and interpretation of studies will likely enhance their use in risk assessment. Furthermore, recent developments in the field of molecular biology and the related increase in the understanding of carcinogenesis and other adverse health effects have opened opportunities to further advance the contribution of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> to risk assessment. This thesis consists of a set of approaches that {{can be used as a}} framework to advance the use of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> in risk assessment. The approaches focus on the evaluation of the quality of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> for risk assessment, the incorporation of differences in study quality in methods for evidence synthesis, and the incorporation of biomarkers in occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies.</b> Some of the approaches are ready to be applied in risk assessment. Other approaches need further development before their actual value for risk assessment can be assessed. Further progress in the use of occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> in risk assessment should come from tailoring study designs to the needs of risk assessment. A strong focus on high quality quantitative exposure assessment in the design of new occupational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> and transparency of the steps undertaken to develop quantitative exposure estimates would significantly contribute to an increased weight of evidence for risk assessment and would likely improve the overall quality of risk assessment for many exposures...|$|R

25|$|Analyzing {{multiple}} {{epidemiological studies}} on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests {{a small but}} measurable increase in risk for bladder cancer at 10 ppb. According to Peter Ravenscroft of the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge, roughly 80 million people worldwide consume between 10 and 50 ppb arsenic in their drinking water. If they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple <b>epidemiological</b> <b>study</b> analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since {{it does not include}} lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh {{the costs and benefits of}} arsenic remediation.|$|E
25|$|There are now {{sufficient}} data {{to conclude that}} immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to infectious disease and wound healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one <b>epidemiological</b> <b>study,</b> all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor â€“ {{the death of a}} spouse. Theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes, and these ultimately impair immune function. Potential health consequences are broad, but include rates of infection HIV progression cancer incidence and progression, and high rates of infant mortality.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{socioeconomic}} status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, social capital plays {{a significant role}} in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives. The segregation of communities on the basis of income occurs in nations worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of health as a result of a decrease in social capital for those trapped in poor neighborhoods. Social interventions, which seek to improve healthcare by enhancing the social resources of a community, are therefore an effective component of campaigns to improve a community's health. A 1998 <b>epidemiological</b> <b>study</b> showed that community healthcare approaches fared far better than individual approaches in the prevention of heart disease mortality.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2001, 2,265 {{victims have}} been officially {{certified}} (1,784 {{of whom have}} died) and over 10,000 people have received financial compensation from Chisso, although they are not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full <b>epidemiological</b> <b>study</b> has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation. Many victims of Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came {{out into the open}} about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that {{some of the people who}} sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease. More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'. These forms of obfuscation are commonly experienced by 'environmental victims' in many countries.|$|E
