2500|$|Another {{concern is}} that monopolistic {{competition}} fosters advertising {{and the creation of}} brand names. Advertising induces customers into spending more on products because of the name associated with them rather than because of rational factors. Defenders of advertising dispute this, arguing that brand names can represent a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> and that advertising helps reduce the cost to consumers of weighing the tradeoffs of numerous competing brands. [...] There are unique information and information processing costs associated with selecting a brand in a monopolistically competitive environment. In a monopoly market, the consumer is faced with a single brand, making information gathering relatively inexpensive. In a perfectly competitive industry, the consumer is faced with many brands, but because the brands are virtually identical information gathering is also relatively inexpensive. In a monopolistically competitive market, the consumer must collect and process information on a large number of different brands to be able to select the best of them. In many cases, the cost of gathering information necessary to selecting the best brand can exceed the benefit of consuming the best brand instead of a randomly selected brand. The result is that the consumer is confused. Some brands gain prestige value and can extract an additional price for that.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies and}} evaluates the {{scalability}} properties of a resource management subsystem {{as a component}} of a networked media eco-system. The overall system aims to offer multimedia delivery with configurable <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> Services, over multi-domain networks, to large communities of users. The transport infrastructure is based on creation of data plane logical slices named Virtual Content Aware Networks. These slices are realized under control of a management plane, comprising centralized per-network domain “controllers”, cooperating to construct parallel data planes, which span multiple IP network domains independently managed. In this multi-domain context, the management system scalability properties are important, while the problem is similar to the multi-controller inter-communication in emerging multi-controller Software Defined Networking technologies. The management system architecture considered in this paper has been previously defined. This work additionally provides a simulation model and results, concerning the scalability of the multi-controller communications subsystem. It is shown that the proposed control approach is conveniently feasible in a multi-domain network environment...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{established}} that high speed networks {{will be based on}} cell relay technology, an important feature of which is small fixed size packets. However, application data is rarely small or fixed size, and hence it is important to study the impact on message-level performance in a cell based system. This paper presents a simulation study of application level performance and studies various trade-offs in requesting specific cell level QoS parameters to satisfy the application requirements. 1 Introduction and Motivation Broadband networks of the future are expected to carry audio, video, and data traffic from many diverse applications. Further, unlike traditional networks, future high speed networks will provide <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> Service (QoS) to applications, as specified by the applications.
