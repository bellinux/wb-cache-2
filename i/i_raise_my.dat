25|$|When <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hand to {{take the}} oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand. I do not {{subscribe}} to using the Koran in any way. The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don't wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding {{the use of the}} Koran.|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

"In {{the name}} of the {{government}} and of the PCR, <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> voice against border changes [...] Democratic Romania ensures equal rights to coinhabiting nationalities, but the Magyar population needs to understand that its belonging to the Romanian state is definitive. Nobody has the right to debate our borders." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> {{voice and}} shouted. Almost {{immediately}} there came an answer.|$|R
60|$|Her {{tone was}} so very earnest that <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> eyes in surprise.|$|R
60|$|Her {{words came}} steadily, but painfully. And when <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> eyes she met them bravely.|$|R
2500|$|... “I am {{now going}} to leave you, as it were. I hope to meet you again, and <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> pipe above my head and say, Great Spirit, I pray be good to my friend, the Son of the Shadow-Maker. Toward the pine trees, north, cold winds, treat him kindly toward the rising sun, east, great sun shine on his lodge early every morning toward {{the place where the}} Shadow-Maker lives, south, bless your son toward the land of the setting sun, west, waft on the breezes our friend this way. Lowering my pipe of peace, I say, Kind Mother Earth, when you receive my friend into thy {{maternal}} bosom, hold him kindly let the howl of the coyote, the roaring of the bears and mountain lions, the cold blasts of winds swaying the tops of the pine trees be a sweet lullaby to him, that shaketh the hand of your friend.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{new level}} of gravity came to the {{controversy}} when responding to [...] "a flood of e-mails from constituents" [...] about Ellison's oath, fifth term Representative Virgil H. Goode, Jr. (R–VA) issued a letter on the matter. Goode wrote [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hand to take the oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand. I do not subscribe to using the Koran in any way. The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don’t wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding {{the use of the}} Koran...I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America and to prevent our resources from being swamped." ...|$|E
2500|$|During its history, {{the statue}} faced many hazards. It {{miraculously}} survived undamaged the bombardment of Brussels of 1695 by the French army, but the pipes having been affected, {{it could not}} deliver its water for a certain time. A pamphlet published the same year recounts this episode. This text is the oldest attesting that Manneken Pis had become [...] "an object of glory appreciated by all and renowned throughout the world". It is also {{the first time that}} it served as a symbol for the people of Brussels. It is also traditionally said that after the bombardment, it was triumphantly placed again on its pedestal. On that occasion, the following passage from the Bible was inscribed above its head : In petra exaltavit me, et nunc exaltavi caput meum super inimicos meos ("The Lord placed me on a stone base, and now <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> head above my enemies"). As shown by an engraving by Jacques Harrewijn, dating from 1697, the fountain was no longer located on the street, but in a recess {{at the corner of the}} Rue du Chêne and de l'Étuve.|$|E
60|$|Mr Abney {{had turned}} {{to me with a}} look of hopeless bewilderment. <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> eyebrows.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> glass, {{and looked}} thoughtfully at the pale amber wine {{bubbling}} {{up from the}} stem.|$|R
60|$|But {{finally she}} tacked to <b>my</b> right, and <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> {{voice to the}} top of its power.|$|R
6000|$|... "Once, O Ngurn," [...] Bassett repeated, [...] "let the Red One speak so that I may see it {{speak as}} well as hear it. Then strike, thus, when <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hand; for, when <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hand, I shall drop my head forward and make place for the stroke {{at the base of}} my neck. But, O Ngurn, I, who am about to pass out of the light of day for ever, would like to pass with the wonder-voice of the Red One singing greatly in my ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is something, at least," [...] he confided, [...] "to {{be back in}} {{a country}} where one can speak freely. <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> arm. Von Schwerin and gentlemen--'To the Fatherland!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|But, if this {{fleeting}} spirit share [...] With clay the Grave's eternal bed, [...] While Life yet throbs <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> prayer, [...] Though doom'd {{no more to}} {{quit the}} dead.|$|E
60|$|Not {{knowing what}} to say to this, <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> voice, and deplored the Egyptian ignorance of steam.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> eyebrows at this. It {{seemed to}} me that Mr. de Valentin was going a little too far.|$|R
60|$|At {{first she}} did not know me; but <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> veil, and whispered her name softly in her ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "And when <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hand--so--you {{will throw}} {{into the room}} what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Or {{rather to}} behold her when She plies {{for me the}} unresting pen, And when the loud assault of squalls Resounds upon the roof and walls, And the low thunder growls and <b>I</b> <b>Raise</b> <b>my</b> dictating voice on high.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> arms, uncle, pull in at once. If I see I cannot {{reach the}} spar I sha'n't exhaust myself by going on, but shall {{come back and}} take a fresh start. Let me have plenty of rope." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{a natural}} impulse to shoot <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> rifle, but the cub looked so {{attractive}} and so helpless that I hesitated.|$|R
60|$|Thus reasoning, <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> hat, {{uttered a}} crisp 'Good morning', and passed on, the very {{picture of the}} brisk man of affairs.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> trumpet to my lips. At first I {{could make}} no sound, but, {{controlling}} my agitation a little, I shouted: [...] "Yes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] {{he assured}} her. [...] "On the contrary, I {{think that the}} actual {{government}} {{of this country is}} wonderful. I suppose my creed of life would command a halter from any one who heard it, but <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> hat always to your King." ...|$|E
6000|$|But what is this? <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes from}} the paper and I see Beverly-Jones hurriedly {{approaching}} from the house. He is hastily dressed, with flannel trousers and a dressing-gown. His face looks grave. Something has happened. Thank God, something has happened. Some accident! Some tragedy! Something to prevent the charades! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but my dear child," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you do not understand! Listen. <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> voice, I shout--like this--'Maraton, it is I who am here--Selingman!' You see, he {{will come}} if he is within hearing. You know of me, you pale-faced child? You have heard of Selingman, is it not so?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} a single bell broke in upon <b>my</b> thoughts. <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> eyes. My journey was accomplished. Before me was a grim, stern building, and {{attached}} to it a chapel. It was the monastery of St. Bernard.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> gun, {{and looked}} eagerly {{with all my}} eyes, but saw nothing. Never having been {{in the habit of}} firing at nothing, I hesitated.|$|R
60|$|We {{regarded}} {{each other}} for a moment. <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> hat and wished him a good evening. He responded convulsively, and so we went our ways.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may or may}} not be," [...] Bernadine answered. [...] "One {{thing is}} very certain. Even if the nations remain at peace, there are enmities which strike only deeper as the years pass. I am going to take a drink now with my {{disappointed}} friend Kosuth. If <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> glass 'To the Day!' you will understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{again at}} work upon the hill-side, {{and the sun}} is again about to go to bed. I am {{collecting}} my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Blood-dhrawn I may be,' sez I, gettin' {{back to my}} cot an' makin' my line round ut; 'but ye {{know that}} the man who comes acrost this mark will be more blood-dhrawn than me. No man gives me the name in my mouth,' I sez. 'Ondersthand, I will have no part wid you in anythin' ye do, nor will <b>I</b> <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> fist to my shuperior. Is any wan comin' on?' sez I.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trams {{and dusty}} trees. Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew Undid me. By Richmond <b>I</b> <b>raised</b> <b>my</b> knees Supine {{on the floor}} of a narrow canoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was given}} me, sir, by my aunt, Mrs. Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> voice; for <b>I</b> {{was a little}} proud of Castle Hoggarty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Skimpole," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> eyes to his, [...] "I have {{so often}} {{heard you say}} that you are unacquainted with the common affairs of life--" ...|$|R
