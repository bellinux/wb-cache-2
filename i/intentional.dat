5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or <b>intentional.</b> If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been <b>intentional.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Mr. Burns collapses on the sundial, it is {{seen that}} the gun he was {{previously}} carrying has gone missing. This was inserted as an <b>intentional</b> freeze frame clue.|$|E
5|$|Curtis {{says the}} stories are {{selected}} without <b>intentional</b> political bias, but that he tries to run both far-left and far-right articles.|$|E
5|$|Fodor's own position, instead, {{is that to}} {{properly}} account for the nature of <b>intentional</b> attitudes, {{it is necessary to}} employ a three-place relation between individuals, representations and propositional contents.|$|E
5|$|In both The Moving Picture World and The Moving Picture News the {{character}} of Will was named Bill, {{but it is not}} clear if this was <b>intentional,</b> a renaming or error.|$|E

5|$|A 27,500-year old {{burial of}} an 18-month old child, {{complete}} with burial gift decorative artifacts, pendant or necklace elements made of teeth of large ungulates, {{was discovered in}} Borsuk Cave near Kraków (southern Kraków-Częstochowa Upland). It {{is believed to be}} the oldest <b>intentional</b> burial located in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da and his {{organization}} were sued by Beverly O'Mahoney, then {{wife of the}} Adidam president, for fraud, <b>intentional</b> infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, and assault and battery (among other things); the suit sought $5 million in damages.|$|E
5|$|Christine Chism distinguishes racist or racialist {{elements}} in Tolkien's views and works as falling into three categories: <b>intentional</b> racism, unconscious Eurocentric bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien's early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies {{in his late}} work.|$|E
5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} {{is the study}} of the theory and practice of the science that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigensthose plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to <b>intentional</b> human activity. Cultivated plant taxonomists do, however, work with all kinds of plants in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether <b>intentional</b> two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that <b>intentional</b> voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|MF Dnes {{pointed out}} that despite the steady rise of firearm {{ownership}} in the country since abolition of restrictive Communist legislation after the Velvet Revolution, the number of <b>intentional</b> homicide victims has been steadily falling since its peak in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by <b>intentional</b> voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for <b>intentional</b> sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall at the mercy of wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the variety}} of harmful uses of poisons {{continued}} to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel. In the modern world, <b>intentional</b> poisoning is less common than the Middle Ages. Rather, the more common concern is the risk of accidental poisoning from everyday substances and products.|$|E
5|$|Police may order {{temporary}} {{seizure of}} firearm license and firearms in {{case that the}} holder is charged with any <b>intentional</b> crime, or a negligent crime connected with breach of duties relating to possession, carrying or use of firearms or ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} <b>intentional,</b> direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to self-mutilation.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Finnhorse stud book it has been closed and the breed has been bred pure. While accidental and even <b>intentional</b> Finnhorse crossbreds exist, they are not accepted for the Finnhorse registry and have not been used to develop new breeds within Finland. The Finnhorse stud book remains in the control of Suomen Hippos.|$|E
5|$|The general {{principle}} {{is that a}} trespass to the person must be a direct and <b>intentional</b> act, while if it was indirect or unintentional the tort of negligence is more appropriate, as established in Letang v Cooper. The tort of trespass to the person contains three possible types; assault, battery and false imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider {{whether there is a}} reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to <b>intentional</b> and arbitrary discrimination or <b>intentional</b> systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|This {{suggested}} that the single reconstructed arch of the Hurva {{could no longer be}} understood as a satisfactory expression of any commitment to rebuild the lost synagogue nor as an acceptable official response to its <b>intentional</b> destruction in 1948.|$|E
5|$|A two-minute minor {{penalty is}} often called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in <b>intentional</b> injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an <b>intentional</b> act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been <b>intentional</b> - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the <b>intentional</b> selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an <b>intentional</b> act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the <b>intentional,</b> referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E
5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their <b>intentional</b> import into foreign {{countries}} is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared fancy rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.|$|E
5|$|Besides holding Major League career {{records in}} home runs (762), walks (2,558), and <b>intentional</b> walks (688), {{at the time}} of his retirement, Bonds also led all active players in RBI (1,996), on-base {{percentage}} (.444), runs (2,227), games (2,986), extra-base hits (1,440), at-bats per home run (12.92), and total bases (5,976). He is 2nd in doubles (601), slugging percentage (.607), stolen bases (514), at-bats (9,847), and hits (2,935), 6th in triples (77), 8th in sacrifice flies (91), and 9th in strikeouts (1,539), through September 26, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Both Douglas fir and Suillus lakei are {{non-native}} {{introduced species}} in Europe. The fungus {{has been found}} in several central and south European countries following the <b>intentional</b> introduction of Douglas fir. These include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia. It is considered endangered in the Czech Republic. Suillus lakei has also been reported in the South Island of New Zealand, and South America (Argentina and Chile).|$|E
5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not <b>intentional.</b> Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or <b>intentional.</b> The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the <b>intentional</b> discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, <b>intentional</b> and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the <b>intentional</b> discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or <b>intentional</b> ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers because not all cases attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from ethylene glycol are <b>intentional</b> suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
