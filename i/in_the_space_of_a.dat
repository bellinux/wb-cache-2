There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E

His first goal for the club, scored later that year, made him the youngest goalscorer in the club's history. He signed for Championship club Barnsley in 2006, before making a return to Conference Premier football with a loan at Northwich Victoria in 2007. Coulson suffered two cruciate ligament injuries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year before being loaned to Chester City of the Conference Premier in 2009.

5|$|Following {{the sale}} of Jimmy Case, Kennedy began to become disillusioned with Liverpool, and was sent off twice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few weeks early in the 1981–82 season – the first red cards of his career. He made his final league {{appearance}} for the club on 5 December, when he scored in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. His final cup game for the club came eight days later, in a 3–0 defeat to Brazilian side Flamengo in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium. He was replaced in the team by Ronnie Whelan. Liverpool {{went on to win}} the league title after finishing four points ahead of second-place Ipswich Town, and Kennedy's 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal. Sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in January 1982, but were denied by Liverpool, and Kennedy could not agree personal terms with manager Alan Durban so was not signed by Sunderland on a permanent transfer.|$|E
5|$|Joan {{gradually}} strengthened as {{it passed}} over the southern Windward Islands on October 15. It continued heading west {{in response to a}} strong Ridge, and passed over the Guajira Peninsula on October 17. After entering the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea, Joan strengthened into a hurricane. It then slowly executed a small counterclockwise loop, possibly in response to the nearby Tropical Depression Eighteen. Upwelling caused by the quasi-stationary hurricane weakened the system. As the nearby depression dissipated, Joan resumed its westward track. A strong anticyclone over the southwestern Caribbean Sea created an extremely favorable environment, and Joan underwent rapid deepening at a rate of 38millibars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> day. With a minimum pressure of 932millibars, Joan was one of the strongest October hurricanes since 1961.

5|$|President Antanas Smetona's {{unconditional}} {{acceptance of a}} second ultimatum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little over one year became {{a major source of}} dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For {{the first time since the}} 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named Minister of Agriculture. Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E

5|$|In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal again {{participated in}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, after a six-year absence. Having beaten Glentoran of Northern Ireland, Portugal's Sporting Lisbon and Rouen of France, Arsenal played Romanian club Dinamo Bacău in the quarter-finals. A 1–9 victory on {{aggregate}} saw the club progress into the last four, where they faced Ajax of Amsterdam. The pairing of both clubs pleased Arsenal manager Bertie Mee, who wanted to play Ajax in the semi-finals {{to set up a}} possibility of meeting Internazionale in the final. At Highbury in the first leg, Arsenal won 3–0 and restricted Ajax to a 1–0 win at the Olympisch Stadion to reach the final of the Fairs Cup.

Arsenal played Belgian opposition Anderlecht in the 1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> week. Anderlecht won the first leg 3–1, with Arsenal midfielder Ray Kennedy scoring a crucial away goal, seven minutes from the final whistle.
