30|$|However, it {{also needs}} to be {{acknowledged}} that individuals may have other priorities in their life instead of following the healthy lifestyle and the nutrition and exercise recommendations. An <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen</b> may be happy with his unhealthy habits and consider them having positive effects on his wellbeing; offering ways to relax, socialize or enjoy life. If health is considered to consist of mental and social aspects, too, we cannot focus solely on lifestyle choices related to physical health. Focusing too much on the healthy lifestyle may bring about anxiety and worry (Rangel et al. 2011). A balance in physical, mental and social wellbeing is needed.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} tests Beaumont and Dredge’s tourism {{application of}} governance structure theory using recent tourism planning {{efforts in the}} community of Sitka, Alaska. In less than two years, the community of Sitka undertook two separate tourism-planning processes in response to a major tourism event (need for cruise dock to accommodate large cruise ships). The first plan followed a participant-led governance structure, the second plan a council-led governance structure. The participant-led governance structure produced a plan through a collaborative process that <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen</b> participants and sought to limit growth, while the council-led structure produced a more pro-growth plan and downplayed citizen concern for maintaining quality of life. Through this research, tourism governance structures are critically analyzed with a clearer understanding of advantages and disadvantages of planning processes under differing governance structures...|$|E
40|$|Personal Electronic Health Records (EHR) have {{recently}} been published as one means to support patient empowerment and patient control over their personal health record. The functionality of such an EHR may vary from a simple web-based interface for interactive data entry and data review up to a much more powerful system additionally supporting electronic data/document communication between clinical information systems of primary care practitioners or hospitals and even reminder based support for the <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen,</b> to actively {{take care of his}} health, based on relevant disease management programs. Since storage and communication of data in an EHR comprises sensible personal health data, each of those functions need specific security and access management requirements to be considered and implemented. In this article the most critical requirements for these aspects will be classified and respective mechanisms to provide secure data storage and communication as well as flexible access management functions will be presented...|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, {{we discuss}} the role of social work in {{processes}} of democracy. A key question in this discussion concerns the meaning of ‘the social’ in social work. This question has often been answered in a self-referential way, referring to a methodological identity of social work. This defines the educational role of social work as socialisation (be it socialisation into obedience or into an <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen).</b> However, the idea of democracy as ‘ongoing experiment’ and ‘beyond order’ challenges this methodological identity of social work. From the perspective of democracy as an ‘ongoing experiment’, the social is {{to be regarded as}} a platform for dissensus, for ongoing discussions on the relation between private and public issues in the light of human rights and social justice. Hence, the identity of social work cannot be defined in a methodological way; social work is a complex of (institutionalized) welfare practices, to be studied on their underlying views on the ‘social’ as a political and educational concept, and on the way they influence the situation of children, young people and adults in society...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} rise of ‘citizen journalism ’ and {{considers}} its implications for the policing and news media reporting of public protests in the twenty-first century. Our research focuses on the use and impact of multi-media technologies during the 2009 G 20 Summit Protests in London and evaluates their {{role in shaping the}} subsequent representation of ‘protest as news’. The classic concepts of ‘in-ferential structure ’ (Lang and Lang 1955) and ‘hierarchy of credibility ’ (Becker 1967) are re-situated {{within the context of the}} 24 – 7 news mediasphere to analyse the transition in news media focus at G 20 from ‘protester violence ’ to ‘police violence’. This transition is understood in terms of three key issues: the capacity of technologically <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen</b> journalists to produce information that challenges the ‘official ’ version of events; the inclination of professional and citizen journalists to actively seek out and use that information; and the existence of an information-communications marketplace that sustains the commodification and mass consumption of adversarial, anti-establishment news...|$|E
40|$|Around {{the world}} {{concepts}} and constructions of democracy are under contestation. Some analysts see {{the spread of}} democratic institutional designs as evidence of democracy’s triumph. Others – across both north and south – point to growing democratic deficits, and how they threaten democratic legitimacy. Following a review of these debates, this paper focuses on emerging debates within what {{is often referred to}} as the ‘deepening democracy’ field, a school of thinking that focuses on the political project of developing and sustaining more substantive and <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen</b> participation in the democratic process than is often found in representative democracy alone. Within this ‘school’, the paper explores four broad approaches – ‘civil society’ democracy, participatory democracy, deliberative democracy and empowered participatory governance – and how they differ from one another as well as from ‘thinner’ forms of democracy associated with liberal and neoliberal thinking. The paper argues that democracy-building is an ongoing process of struggle and contestation rather than the adoption of a standard institutional design, and poses a series of challenges which future conceptual and practical work on deepening democracy may need to address.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how processes of subjectification constitute the empowered citizen/patient in the discourses on smart cities. Descriptions of smartphone apps which use environmental sensor data are analysed through discourse analytic approach to governmentality. More specifically the thesis investigates the <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen</b> in relation to responsibilisation and relations to knowledge and power. The study finds that the citizen-subject is responsibilised and the relations knowledge are reformulated and redistribute responsibility. Data and the derived knowledge is represented as a form of empowerment. The citizen-subject is constituted as a manager of their own health, and a catalysts for changing the environment. Emphasising the importance of data and putting the user at the heart of data collecting further contributes to the responsibilisation. However, as the information from the data streams is transferable it also redistributes responsibility in the network of individuals who have access to it. The way of knowing the self and the environment is augmented to include a codified interface, which conditions the relationship. A distributed network of sensors allows the citizen-subject is able to simultaneously read the environment in multiple locations. Relations in knowledge production are also found to be altered...|$|E
40|$|Healthcare {{systems in}} Western {{countries}} are undergoing profound {{changes in the}} organisation of services and patient treatment. A growing share of the aging population {{and an increase in}} chronic diseases are accompanied by a decrease of the workforce in the healthcare sector and a steady increase in spending. These challenging tendencies have spawned the need for substantial changes in the organisation of healthcare. Patient involvement and participation in treatment together with new information and communication technologies (ICTs) are considered as having huge potentials in meeting these challenges and provide better healthcare at lower costs. The term “Patient 2. 0 ” has been proposed as the new patient role emerging due to these tendencies. The concept is derived from the “Web 2. 0 ” definition, which covers internet technologies where the content on the web is primarily produced by the users, also known as social media technologies. The notion of Patient 2. 0 seems to embody the envisioned future of re-organised healthcare practices and it is commonly represented as the technologically <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen</b> who engages in new forms of participation, collaboration and self-management practices. Therefore Patient 2. 0 is endowed with many great expectations to meet the above challenges. Consequently, the interests of many different actors such as healthcare systems managers, policy makers, manufacturers and ICT developers, but also patient associations or online social networks seems to converge with the dawning of the Patient 2. 0. However, the Patient 2. 0 {{is by no means a}} settled matter, rather it is accompanied with diverse and someho...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{technologies}} has risen {{dramatically in the}} past century, building excitement among governments and technology experts about applying technology to improve accountability, transparency {{and the effectiveness of}} authorities. All 193 member states of the United Nations now have, for example, national websites. Among these, 101 have enabled citizens to create personal online accounts; 73 to file income taxes; and 60 to register a business. For the most common core government administrative systems, 190 member states have automated financial management, 179 have used such systems for customs processing, and 159 for tax management. This readiness {{is the result of a}} change in the dynamics of citizenship, accountability and rights (CAR), which demands a rethinking of the roles and relationship between governments and citizens. The use of technology in development, and specifically its potential to close the gap between citizen voice and state responsiveness, holds great promise. Emergent conceptions such as e-governance are considered to have the power to inspire new tools and practices for citizenship, as well as to make existing practices more effective. While the use of digital technologies has made communication with citizens much easier, an increased and <b>empowered</b> <b>citizen</b> participation, by which citizens are able to hold governments accountable, remains still a distant dream. This report is an attempt to see the extent to which digital technologies can enable citizens and state agencies to increase the flow of information, challenge powerful interests, increase levels of institutional responsiveness and protect citizens’ rights, therefore making it imperative to examine the connection between the role of citizen participation in monitoring the enforcement of rights and in demanding public scrutiny and transparency. Furthermore, the questions that this report attempts to answer are: (a) What is the contribution of digital technologies to CAR?; (b) How can the use of technology influence the structuring, restructuring, shaping and reshaping of the relationship between citizens and governments?UK Department for International Developmen...|$|E

The theme of control actually includes two issues: whether citizens feel that they have control over their personal data, and whether they feel they can influence the debate on privacy protection. If there are widespread feelings of powerlessness, corrective measures such as increasing awareness are urgently needed.|$|R
