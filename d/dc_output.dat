5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's <b>DC</b> <b>output</b> ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

These circuits are capable of producing a <b>DC</b> <b>output</b> voltage potential up to about ten times the peak AC input voltage, in practice limited by current capacity and voltage regulation issues. Diode voltage multipliers, frequently used as a trailing boost stage or primary high voltage (HV) source, are used in HV laser power supplies, powering devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRT) (like those used in CRT based television, radar and sonar displays), photon amplifying devices found in image intensifying and photo multiplier tubes (PMT), and magnetron based radio frequency (RF) devices used in radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Before the introduction of semiconductor electronics, transformerless vacuum tube receivers powered directly from AC power sometimes used voltage doublers to generate roughly 300VDC from a 100–120V power line.|$|E

This paper describes the design of the spacecraft power subsystem which meets the unique requirements of such a mission. The primary power source consists of four SNAP 19 RTG's. The 4. 2 volt <b>dc</b> <b>outputs</b> of the RTG's are inverted to higher voltage ac by four inverters which are connected in parallel at their outputs. A power control unit (PCU) regulates the ac output of the inverters such that the RTG's are operated at near maximum power voltage throughout the mission. The PCU also contains charge and discharge controls for a silver cadmium battery which supplements the RTG's if load requirements temporarily exceed RTG power output. Battery reliability is enhanced by overcharge and cell reversal protection electronics which are provided for each cell.

2500|$|The basic LCC {{configuration}} for HVDC uses a three-phase Graetz {{bridge rectifier}} or six-pulse bridge, containing six electronic switches, each connecting {{one of the}} three phases to one of the two DC terminals. A complete switching element is usually referred to as a valve, irrespective of its construction. [...] Normally, two valves in the bridge are conducting at any time: one on the top row and one (from a different phase) on the bottom row. The two conducting valves connect two of the three AC phase voltages, in series, to the DC terminals. [...] Thus, the <b>DC</b> <b>output</b> voltage at any given instant is given by the series combination of two AC phase voltages.
