When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term.

5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage.

This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five terraces.|$|E
5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either <b>four</b> <b>or</b> six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

These ran usually in units of three or six (sometimes <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five) cars. Types T5 to T8, 49 in total, delivered with both third-rail and overhead wire equipment, normally ran on the Holmenkollen line (two cars) and Kolsås line (three cars).|$|E

5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first <b>four</b> <b>or</b> eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
