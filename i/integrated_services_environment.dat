Assuming that signalling and information traffic will be multiplexed across a 150 Mbit/s user network interface, it models and analyses the processing and transmission delay encountered by signalling messages. Performance issues are contrapositioned to architectural ones, which call for a specific sublayering within Layer 2.

Unlike most contention-based multiaccess protocols which o er no QoS guarantee and suffer the problems of fairness and low throughput at high load, our algorithm provides fairness and bandwidth reservation in an <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> <b>environment</b> {{and at the same time}} achieves high throughput. Moreover, while most reservation-based multiaccess protocols require a centralized scheduler and a separate channel for arbitration, our algorithm is truly distributed in the sense that network nodes coordinate their transmissions only via headers in the packets. We derive theoretical bounds illustrating how our distributed algorithm approximates the optimal centralized algorithm. Simulation results are also presented to justify our claims...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{strongly}} believe using an efficient pricing scheme {{will help to}} optimise the capacity of future multi-service networks. Network resources should be guided to those users that places the highest value on them. Usage patterns should also be influenced to better utilise the available network capacity.

Further it is the opinion that any management solution of a distributed system should not be made up of monohlitic applications, but rather by a process layer with standardised, distributed components used by the process as and when required.

With the public healthcare sector in the UK facing complex challenges including financial constraint and increasing service demand, it is inevitable that collaborative partnership working and service integration are viewed as a means of addressing such challenges.

40|$|Introduction: Social-structural inequities impede access to, and {{retention}} in, HIV care among structurally vulnerable {{people living with}} HIV (PLHIV) who use drugs. The resulting disparities in HIV-related outcomes among PLHIV who use drugs pose barriers to the optimization of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) initiatives. We undertook this study to examine engagement with, and impacts of, an <b>integrated</b> HIV care <b>services</b> model tailored {{to the needs of}} PLHIV who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada – a setting with a community-wide TasP initiative. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 PLHIV who use drugs recruited from the Dr. Peter Centre, an HIV care facility operating under an <b>integrated</b> <b>services</b> model and harm reduction approach. We employed novel analytical techniques to analyse participants’ service trajectories within this facility to understand how this HIV <b>service</b> <b>environment</b> influences access to, {{and retention}} in, HIV care among structurally vulnerable PLHIV who use drugs. Results: Our findings demonstrate that participants’ structural vulnerability shaped their engagement with the HIV care facility that provided access to resources that facilitated retention in HIV care and antiretroviral treatment adherence. Additionally, the <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> <b>environment</b> helped reduce burdens associated with living in extreme poverty by meeting participants’ subsistence (e. g. food, shelter) needs. Moreover, access to multiple supports created a structured environment in which participants could develop routine service use patterns and have prolonged engagement with supportive care services. Our findings demonstrate that low-barrier service models can mitigate social and structural barriers to HIV care and complement TasP initiatives for PLHIV who use drugs. Conclusions: These findings highlight the critical role of <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> models in promoting access to health and support services for structurally vulnerable PLHIV. Complementing structural interventions with <b>integrated</b> <b>service</b> models that are tailored to the needs of structurally vulnerable PLHIV who use drugs will be pursuant to the goals of TasP...|$|R
