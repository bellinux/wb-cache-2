5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} high risk, {{early detection and}} treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics {{over a long period of}} time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (MDR-TB).|$|E
25|$|The {{inadequate}} {{control of}} tuberculosis {{can be linked}} to a malfunctioning health system. From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of total health expenditure fell from 32% to 16%. This reduction forced many Chinese health-care facilities and providers to focus on the generation of revenue, with little concern for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profit entities. In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public health-care facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as long as they could pay. Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. Such irregular treatment breeds <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "superbugs", may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled. For example, cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide. China and India have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of MDR TB were reported in the United States. Extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (XDR TB) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States.

40|$|Mathematical models {{predict that}} the future of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and {{extensively}} <b>drug-resistant</b> (XDR) <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) epidemic will depend to a large extent on the transmission efficiency or relative fitness of <b>drug-resistant</b> Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> compared to drug-susceptible strains. Molecular epidemiological studies comparing the spread of drug-resistant to that of drug-susceptible strains have yielded conflicting results: MDR strains can be up to 10 times more or 10 times less transmissible than pan-susceptible strains. Experimental work performed with model organisms has highlighted a level of complexity in the biology of bacterial drug resistance that is generally not considered during standard epidemiological studies of TB transmission. Recent experimental studies in M. tuberculosis indicate that drug resistance in this organism could be equally complex. For example, the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis can be influenced by the specific drug resistance-conferring mutation and strain genetic background. Furthermore, compensatory evolution, which has been shown to mitigate the fitness defects associated with drug resistance in other bacteria, could be an important factor in the emergence and spread of <b>drug-resistant</b> M. <b>tuberculosis.</b> However, much more work is needed to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms and evolutionary forces that drive drug resistance in this pathogen.
