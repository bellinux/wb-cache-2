500|$|Within {{a couple}} of hours, Michael Jensen of the gay website AfterElton.com took note of Murphy's statement, and also of the then-current cover article on Criss in Out magazine, in which Murphy was quoted as saying, [...] "Blaine will openly {{question}} whether bisexuality is real. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> people will love that discussion and some will not love it." [...] Jensen pointed out that Murphy does not say that Blaine will not question his own sexuality, but clearly [...] "decides he is, in fact, gay". Ausiello posted at about that time that Blaine was indeed who {{he was referring to}} in his original story, quoted from the same Out article as Jensen, and added a new one-sentence summation from Murphy on the coming episode: [...] "I guess the moral of the story is don’t play spin the bottle while drunk on wine coolers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 8, [...] "It's because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> {{sympathetic}} consideration {{here can}} improve the US-Japan relationship... I sincerely believe that the US-Japan Security Treaty is essential to maintaining Japan's independence and security today. As such, isn't it necessary {{to address the issue}} of burden sharing with an approach based on the importance of having deep sympathy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I have understood, sir, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of {{our city}} merchants cannot be far behind you, judging from what my {{daughter}} has told me of the abode of Sir Robert Gaiton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{told that}} she still lives in Poitou, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> heard <b>that,</b> <b>some</b> years after M. de Lescure's death, she married M. Louis Larochejaquelin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> he guesses; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> already <b>some</b> have {{whispered in}} his ear, {{but he does}} not wish to listen who desires to remain deaf and blind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't say I ever {{keep you}} waiting; and <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>some</b> praise {{for a man}} who has got a good many things on his hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have changed}} my ideas. My one chief object in life is, as you know, to marry your sister; and if I were a Member of Parliament <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> {{difficulties}} would be cleared away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is I," [...] she said, [...] "whom {{you have}} to thank for the {{possession}} of it. Considering that you go in danger every moment, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> one else save yourself should share in the knowledge {{of what you have}} done with it." ...|$|E
60|$|It came {{in my mind}} she {{had been}} more than common {{particular}} that day upon my dress: and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the same care had been bestowed upon Catriona. For so merry and sensible a lady, Miss Grant was certainly wonderful taken up with duds.|$|E
6000|$|... “They have piled {{too many}} ropes {{on it for}} me, sir; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>some</b> others will get on tubs and join me we shall {{be able to move}} the thing.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leonard," [...] {{said his}} brother {{almost in a}} whisper, [...] "will you swear an oath with me? It seems childish, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> under <b>some</b> {{circumstances}} there is wisdom even in childishness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{secret of}} state, no doubt," [...] the officer rejoined. [...] "Well, I will say nothing this time; {{but do not}} let it occur again, or <b>I</b> shall <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> Iberian maiden has {{captured}} that susceptible heart of yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no one. I was afraid, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> {{horrible thing}} {{would happen to}} me--that I would perhaps go mad if I carried out my intention; and I was driven at last, not by conscience, but by servile fear to make a clean breast of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] {{answered}} Sir Geoffrey, [...] "this gathering gloom is ominous and fearful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> awesome tempest must {{be about}} to burst. Also {{it seems to me}} that Cattrina has no stomach for this fray, else he would not raise so many points of martial law and custom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think it}} was true. I {{think there was a}} great flood, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> people did escape, and that they saved their beasts, just as we should try to save Nigger and the Monkstown cocks and hens if we were flooded out. Then they were able to start again when the waters went down, and they were {{naturally}} very grateful to God for their escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--yes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he would, {{upon the}} whole. I'm sure of this: {{he would not}} disapprove, because the new ways are changed from his ways. He never thought himself infallible. And do you know, my dear, I {{am not sure that}} it isn't all for the best. <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of us were very idle when we were young. I was, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your are right, Mrs. Doolan," [...] the Doctor said; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} <b>some</b> who must regret now {{the manner in}} which they have behaved to Bathurst since this siege began." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>some</b> quarters, {{many parts}} of the country, a white male is really disadvantaged… Because we have {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Things {{are very}} different. I {{think that we}} may, without danger, baptize a great many infants and quite young children--so many parents are {{actually}} seeking Christian teaching themselves, or willing to give their children to be taught. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> adults, married men, may possibly be baptized. I should think that not less than forty or fifty are daily being taught twice a day, as a distinct set of Catechumens. Besides this, {{some of the women}} seem to be in earnest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary, [...] "it seems {{you have}} chosen me {{president}}; and I will be president for a time, until <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> {{of the rest of}} you have learned how to preside, and then I shall resign, and leave you to manage your society yourselves. Now you must write the votes for secretary." [...] So Mary took her seat in the chair which she had provided for the president, and which, until this time, had been empty.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. (Captain) Jacobs {{was calm}} and self-possessed. He even behaved excellently. Once, all on deck were washed into the lee scuppers, {{and one man}} washed overboard; but he held a rope, and with it and the recoil was borne in again upon the deck. Lowest barometer, 28° 65'! We were startled {{yesterday}} at about 4 P.M. with {{the news of the}} reappearance of the vessel. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> £30 and the replacing the boats will pay damages, but one doesn't think of that.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{funny thing}} about Hollywood {{is that they are}} {{interested}} in having you do one thing and do it well and do it ever after," [...] said O'Brien. [...] "That's the sad thing about being a leading man - while the rewards may be great in fame and finances, it becomes monotonous for an actor. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> why <b>some</b> {{of the people who are}} continually playing themselves are not happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused disgustedly. We all felt, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> Tom was <b>some</b> {{kind of an}} impostor, {{claiming}} the sympathies of the Club on false pretenses. Nevertheless, the Quartermaster said, [...] "Then you didn't do anything for him--give him any advice, eh?" ...|$|R
3000|$|I {{quite like}} living in London… but I know that, {{in the back of}} my mind, this is not it, and that I can imagine going somewhere else… or going back to Germany… I’m flexible. When I moved here I thought, OK, I’ll do 2 years; now it’s been four, it’ll {{probably}} be five; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> at <b>some</b> point I’ll say… I’ve done it, I want something else now… [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't tell. It's a {{question}} I've grappled with in one shape or other before," [...] he said. [...] "The land {{is full of}} iniquities and horrors, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of them can only be washed out in blood. That law stands as it has always done. The great trade road {{to the south of}} us is paved with the bones of the victims, and they still come down to die, worked out in a few years on the plantations. It is a thing that can't go on." ...|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{was really}} tired, and we {{intended}} to creep {{off to bed}} {{as soon as we}} could. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller. I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how hard they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} hand, of course I do. How strange {{it is there}} should be such a variety of hands--no two alike, just like faces; though for my part <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> faces are quite alike, {{so much so that}} there are one or two people who are always mistaken for each other, so that people don't know which is which. Dear me! What an awful thing it would be if these people were so like that each should forget which was the other! Nobody else being able to put them right, there would be irretrievable confusion. What do you want, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Lincoln," [...] she faltered, [...] "I did {{not know}} you when I came here. I should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice praise you. Oh," [...] she cried, [...] "how I wish that every man and woman and child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you to-day. <b>I</b> think--I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of their {{bitterness}} might be taken away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capitaine Rotherby," [...] she said, as {{we passed}} into her room together, [...] "Louis is a very strange person. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he has <b>some</b> idea in his head about you just now. Will you promise me this,--that you will be careful?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dean Drone, of course, {{and some}} others were quieter about it, and said that one must make {{allowances}} and that naturally there were two sides to everything. But most of them wouldn't listen to reason at all. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> perhaps, <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of them were frightened. You see the last time but one that the steamer had sunk, {{there had been a}} man drowned and it made them nervous.|$|R
60|$|Any one {{of these}} three {{questions}} {{may be used to}} define introspection. I should favour introspection {{in the sense of the}} first question, i.e. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the things we observe cannot, even theoretically, be observed by any one else. The second question, tentatively and for the present, I should answer in favour of introspection; I think that images, in the actual condition of science, cannot be brought under the causal laws of physics, though perhaps ultimately they may be. The third question I should answer adversely to introspection I think that observation shows us nothing that is not composed of sensations and images, and that images differ from sensations in their causal laws, not intrinsically. I shall deal with the three questions successively.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{productions}} of Mr. B. have been stigmatized {{in some quarters}} as unpatriotic; but I can vouch that he loves his native soil with that hearty, though discriminating, attachment which springs from an intimate social intercourse of many years' standing. In the ploughing season, {{no one has a}} deeper share in the well-being of the country than he. If Dean Swift were right in saying that he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before confers a greater benefit on the state than he who taketh a city, Mr. B. might exhibit a fairer claim to the Presidency than General Scott himself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of those disinterested lovers of the hard-handed democracy, whose fingers have never touched anything rougher than the dollars of our common country, would hesitate to compare palms with him. It would do your heart good, respected Sir, to see that young man mow. He cuts a cleaner and wider swath than any in this town.|$|E
60|$|I {{waited a}} long while and still she did not come, till at last I {{believed}} that she was away from the house, or guessing my business, had refused to see me. At length, however, she entered the room, so silently that I who {{was staring at the}} great abbey through a window-place never heard the door open or close. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> sense of her presence must have drawn me, since suddenly I turned to see her standing before me. She was clad all in white, having a round cap or coronet upon her head beneath which her shining fair hair was looped in braids. Her little coat, trimmed with ermine, was fastened with a single jewel, that ruby heart embraced by serpents which I had given her. She wore no other ornament. Thus seen she looked most lovely and most sweet and all my heart went out in yearning for her.|$|E
5000|$|Farrell is a {{supporter}} of regulation of large banks. In an interview with National Public Radio, she stated: [...] "We have created them, and we're sort of past <b>that</b> point, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>some</b> sense, the genie's {{out of the bottle}} {{and what we need to}} do is to manage them and to oversee them, as opposed to hark back to a time that we're unlikely to ever come back to or want to come back to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is," [...] said my grandmother, [...] "Sister Hagar, of the House of Martha. She was Sylvia Raynor, of New Haven. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>some</b> way {{her life}} has been darkened. Mother Anastasia takes a great {{interest}} in her, and favors her a good deal. I know there was opposition to her entering the House, but she was determined to do it. You say {{you are not going to}} engage another sister? Who is to be your amanuensis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] Wrayson assented, doubtfully. [...] "Somehow {{she seemed}} to get the upper hand of us towards the end. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she {{suspected}} <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of us knew more than we cared to tell her about--her husband's death." ...|$|R
