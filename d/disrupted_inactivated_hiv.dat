40|$|Background: Up to 40 % of all mother-to-child {{transmission}} of HIVoccurs {{by means of}} breast-feeding; yet, in developing countries, infant formula {{may not be a}} safe option. The World Health Orga-nization recommends heat-treated breast milk as an infant-feeding alternative. We investigated the ability of a simple method, flash-heat, to <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> in breast milk from HIV-positive mothers. Methods: Ninety-eight breast milk samples, collected from 84 HIV-positive mothers in a periurban settlement in South Africa, were aliquoted to unheated control and flash-heating. Reverse transcriptase (RT) assays (lower detection limit of 400 HIV copies/mL) were per-formed to differentiate active versus <b>inactivated</b> cell-free <b>HIV</b> in unheated and flash-heated samples. Results: We found detectable HIV in breast milk samples from 31 % (26 of 84) of mothers. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate logistic regression showed a statistically significant negative asso-ciation between detectable virus in breast milk and maternal CD 4 + T-lymphocyte count (P = 0. 045) and volume of breast milk expressed (P = 0. 01) and a positive association with use of multivitamins (P = 0. 03). All flash-heated samples showed undetectable levels of cell-free HIV- 1 as detected by the RT assay (P, 0. 00001). Conclusions: Flash-heat can <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> in naturally infected breast milk from HIV-positive women.

40|$|Abstract Background Sexual {{acquisition}} of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through mucosal transmission may be prevented by using topically applied agents that block HIV transmission from one individual to another. Therefore, virucidal agents that <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> virions {{may be used as}} a component in topical microbicides. Results Here, we have identified 2 -methyl- 3 -phenyl- 2 H -[1, 2, 4]thiadiazol- 5 -ylideneamine (WDO- 217) as a low-molecular-weight molecule that <b>inactivates</b> <b>HIV</b> particles. Both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 virions pretreated with this compound were unable to infect permissive cells. Moreover, WDO- 217 was able to inhibit infections of a wide spectrum of wild-type and drug-resistant HIV- 1, including clinical isolates, HIV- 2 and SIV strains. Whereas the capture of virus by DC-SIGN was unaffected by the compound, it efficiently prevented the transmission of DC-SIGN-captured virus to CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. Interestingly, exposure of virions to WDO- 217 reduced the amount of virion-associated genomic RNA as measured by real-time RT-qPCR. Further mechanism-of-action studies demonstrated that WDO- 217 efficiently ejects zinc from the zinc fingers of the retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp 7 and inhibits the cTAR destabilization properties of this protein. Importantly, WDO- 217 was able to eject zinc from both zinc fingers, even when NCp 7 was bound to oligonucleotides, while no covalent interaction between NCp 7 and WDO- 217 could be observed. Conclusion This compound is a new lead structure {{that can be used for}} the development of a new series of NCp 7 zinc ejectors as candidate topical microbicide agents. </p...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection {{has been associated}} with perturbations of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), including diminished frequencies in the peripheral blood and reduced production of type I interferons (IFNs) in response to in vitro stimulation. However, recent data suggest a paradoxical increase in production of type 1 interferons in vivo in HIV-infected patients compared to uninfected controls. Using a flow cytometric assay to detect IFN-α-producing cells within unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we observed that short-term interruptions of antiretroviral therapy are sufficient to result in significantly reduced IFN-α production by PDC in vitro in response to CpG A ligands or <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> particles. The primary cause of diminished IFN-α production was reduced responsiveness of PDC to de novo stimulation, not diminished per cell IFN-α production or migration of cells to lymphoid organs. Real-time PCR analysis of purified PDC from patients prior to and during treatment interruptions revealed that active HIV- 1 replication is associated with upregulation of type I IFN-stimulated gene expression. Treatment of hepatitis C virus-infected patients with IFN-α 2 b and ribavirin for hepatitis C virus infection resulted in a profound suppression of de novo IFN-α production in response to CpG A or <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> particles, similar to the response observed in HIV-infected patients. Together, these results suggest that diminished production of type I interferons in vitro by PDC from HIV- 1 -infected patients may not represent diminished interferon production in vivo. Rather, diminished function in vitro is likely a consequence of prior activation via type I interferons or HIV virions in vivo...|$|R

Microbicides- intravaginal/intrarectal topical formulations of anti-HIV agents have also been proposed to prevent HIV transmission.

40|$|Myeloid {{dendritic}} cells (mDCs) are the antigen-presenting cells best {{capable of}} promoting peripheral induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and {{are among the}} first targets of HIV. It is thus important to understand whether HIV alters their capacity to promote Treg conversion. Monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) from uninfected donors induced a Treg phenotype (CD 25 (+) FOXP 3 (+)) in autologous conventional T cells. These converted FOXP 3 (+) cells suppressed the proliferation of responder T cells similarly to circulating Tregs. In contrast, the capacity of moDCs to induce CD 25 or FOXP 3 was severely impaired by their in vitro infection with CCR 5 -utilizing virus. MoDC exposure to <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> was sufficient to impair FOXP 3 induction. This DC defect was not dependent on IL- 10, TGF-β or other soluble factors, but was due to preferential killing of Tregs by HIV-exposed/infected moDCs, through a caspase-dependent pathway. Importantly, similar results were obtained with circulating primary myeloid DCs. Upon infection in vitro, these mDCs also killed Treg through mechanisms at least partially caspase-dependent, leading to a significantly lower proportion of induced Tregs. Taken together, our data suggest that Treg induction may be defective when DCs are exposed {{to high levels of}} virus, such as during the acute phase of infection or in AIDS patients...|$|R

HCV expression was quantified via HCV core antigen ELISA, Western blot, and strand-specific real-time PCR for positive-sense and negative-sense HCV RNA. After HIVNL 4 - 3 infection of Huh 7. 5 JFH 1 cells, positive-sense and negative-sense HCV RNA levels were elevated compared to HIV uninfected cells. Increased HCV RNA synthesis was also observed after infection of Huh 7. 5 JFH 1 cells with HIVYK-JRCSF.

40|$|AbstractThe rapid {{spread of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) worldwide makes it a high priority to develop an effective vaccine. Since live attenuated or <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> {{is not likely to}} be approved as a vaccine due to safety concerns, HIV virus like particles (VLPs) offer an attractive alternative because they are safe due to the lack of a viral genome. Although HIV VLPs have been shown to induce humoral and cellular immune responses, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which they induce such responses and to improve their immunogenicity. We generated HIV VLPs, and VLPs containing Flt 3 ligand (FL), a dendritic cell growth factor, to target VLPs to dendritic cells, and investigated the roles of these VLPs in the initiation of adaptive immune responses in vitro and in vivo. We found that HIV- 1 VLPs induced maturation of dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophage populations in vitro and in vivo, with enhanced expression of maturation markers and cytokines. Dendritic cells pulsed with VLPs induced activation of splenocytes resulting in increased production of cytokines. VLPs containing FL were found to increase dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophage populations in the spleen when administered to mice. Administration of VLPs induced acute activation of multiple types of cells including T and B cells as indicated by enhanced expression of the early activation marker CD 69 and down-regulation of the homing receptor CD 62 L.

40|$|HIV immune {{pathogenesis}} is postulated {{to involve}} two major mechanisms: 1) chronic innate immune responses that drive T cell activation and apoptosis and 2) induction of immune regulators that suppress T cell function and proliferation. Both arms are elevated chronically in lymphoid tissues of non-natural hosts, which ultimately develop AIDS. However, these mechanisms are not elevated chronically in natural hosts of SIV infection that avert immune pathogenesis despite similarly high viral loads. In {{this study we}} investigated whether minocycline could modulate these pathogenic antiviral responses in non-natural hosts of HIV and SIV. We found that minocycline attenuated in vitro induction of type I interferon (IFN) and the IFN-stimulated genes indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO 1) and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells and PBMCs exposed to aldrithiol- 2 <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> or infectious influenza virus. Activation-induced TRAIL and expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA- 4) in isolated CD 4 + T cells were also reduced by minocycline.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of a fully {{effective}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine, topical microbicides represent an important strategy for preventing the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse, the predominant mode of HIV transmission worldwide. Although a comprehensive understanding of HIV transmission has not yet emerged in the microbicide field, it is likely the result of rapid infection of monocyte-derived cells in the vaginal mucosa by CCR 5 -tropic viruses. Inhibition of HIV transmission requires agents that prevent entry, fusion, reverse transcription, or other preintegrative replication events or agents which directly <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> or modulate the target cells to render them uninfectible. In vitro assays typically used to evaluate the ability of a microbicide to prevent virus transmission use epithelial or human osteosarcoma-derived cells or immune cells more relevant to the development of anti-HIV therapeutic agents and quantify virus production at short time intervals following infection. We have developed a microbicide transmission and sterilization assay (MTSA) to more sensitively and quantitatively evaluate virus transmission in cell culture in the presence of microbicidal compounds. Results obtained with the MTSA demonstrate that the inhibitory capacity of microbicides is often overestimated in short-term transmission inhibition assays, while some compounds yield equivalent inhibitory results, indicating a biological relevance for the MTSA-based evaluations to identify superior potent microbicides.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infects cells after binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp 120 {{to the cell}} surface recognition marker CD 4. gp 120 is noncovalently associated with the HIV transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp 41, and this complex is believed responsible for {{the initial stages of}} HIV infection and cytopathic events in infected cells. Soluble constructs of CD 4 that contain the gp 120 binding site inhibit HIV infection in vitro. This is believed to occur by competitive inhibition of viral binding to cellular CD 4. Here we suggest an alternative mechanism of viral inhibition by soluble CD 4 proteins. We demonstrate biochemically and morphologically that following binding, the soluble CD 4 proteins sT 4, V 1 V 2,DT, and V 1 [106] (amino acids 1 - 369, 1 - 183, and - 2 to 106 of mature CD 4) induced the release of gp 120 from HIV- 1 and HIV- 1 -infected cells. gp 120 release was concentration-, time-, and temperature-dependent. The reaction was biphasic at 37 degrees C and did not take place at 4 degrees C, indicating that binding of soluble CD 4 was not sufficient to release gp 120. The appearance of free gp 120 in the medium after incubation with sT 4 correlated with a decrease in envelope glycoprotein spikes on virions and exposure of a previously cryptic epitope near the amino terminus of gp 41 on virions and infected cells. The concentration of soluble CD 4 proteins needed to induce the release of gp 120 from virally infected cells also correlated with those required to inhibit HIV-mediated syncytium formation. These results suggest that soluble CD 4 constructs may <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> by inducing the release of gp 120.

Results of our studies show that this property is a function of CD 4 + but not CD 8 + T cells.

The presence of a G allele indicated poor response to the therapeutic vaccine (p= 0. 0031; OR= 33. 00; CI= 1. 74 - 624. 66), and the SNP behaved in a dominant model (A/A vs. A/G+G/G p= 0. 0009; OR= 107. 66; 95 % CI= 3. 85 - 3013. 31), being the A/G genotype present only in weak/transient responders, conferring susceptibility to poor response to the immune treatment. DISCUSSION: CNOT 1 is known {{to be involved in the}} control of mRNA deadenylation and mRNA decay. Moreover, CNOT 1 has been recently described as being involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes mediated by tristetraprolin (TTP). The TTP-CCR 4 -NOT complex (CNOT 1 in the CCR 4 -NOT complex is the binding site for TTP) has been reported as interfering with HIV replication, through post-transcriptional control. Therefore, we can hypothesize that genetic variation occurring in the CNOT 1 gene could impair the TTP-CCR 4 -NOT complex, thus interfering with HIV replication and/or host immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Being aware that our findings are exclusive to the 18 patients studied with a need for replication, and that the genetic variant of CNOT 1 gene, localized at intron 3, has no known functional effect, we propose a novel potential candidate locus for the modulation of the response to the immune treatment, and open a discussion on the necessity to consider the host genome as another potential variant to be evaluated when designing an immune therapy stud...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that G protein-coupled receptors can exist {{not only as}} homodimers, but also as heterodimers or higher order oligomers. However, whether and how dimerization of the receptors is regulated is poorly understood. In this issue of The EMBO Journal, the team of Marc Landry provides evidence for an intriguing mechanism by which—under pathological conditions—GABAB receptor heterodimers at the cell surface are <b>disrupted</b> and thereby <b>inactivated.</b> An impressive set of experiments thus reveals a novel mechanism regulating the number of functional GABAB receptors in the plasma membrane and shows that the receptor heterodimer {{may not be as}} stable as we previously thought...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} Clostridium perfringens {{as a safe}} vaccine vector, {{the alpha}} toxin gene (plc) in the bacterial chromosome must be permanently <b>inactivated.</b> <b>Disrupting</b> genes in C. perfringens by traditional mutagenesis methods is very difficult. Therefore, we developed a new strategy using group II intron-based Target-Tron technology to inactivate the plc gene in C. perfringens ATCC 3624. Western blot analysis showed no production of alpha toxin protein in the culture supernatant of the plc mutant. Advantages of this technology, such as site specificity, relatively high frequency of insertion, and introduction of no antibiotic resistance genes into the chromosome, could facilitate construction of other C. perfringens mutants...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{complement}} to inactivate {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) {{in the presence of}} specific antibody was evaluated. HIV was treated with complement and/or antibody, and then its titer was determined on the CD 4 + H 9 cell line. While complement alone had no effect on the HIV titer, complement plus subneutralizing levels of antibody resulted in titer reductions. Complement sources deficient in membrane attack component C 5 or C 8 did not <b>inactivate</b> antibody-treated <b>HIV,</b> suggesting that neutralization occurred via lysis. This possibility was investigated by assessing release of reverse transcriptase (RT) from the virion. Antibody plus complement, but neither reagent alone, released RT from HIV in a dose-dependent manner. Release of RT did not occur with C 5 - or C 8 -deficient sera, also indicating a requirement for membrane attack components. These studies show that complement can neutralize HIV via the classical complement pathway and that this neutralization occurs via C 5 b- 9 -mediated viral lysis. Thus, complement may {{play a major role in}} resistance to disease by lysing HIV and preventing infection of Fc- and complement receptor-positive cells, as well as CD 4 + cells...|$|R
40|$|Infection of CD 4 + {{chemokine}} coreceptor+ targets by HIV is aided and {{abetted by}} the proficiency of HIV in eliminating or neutralizing host cell–derived defensive molecules. Among these innate protective molecules, {{a family of}} intracellular apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) cytidine deaminases, is constitutively expressed but <b>inactivated</b> by <b>HIV</b> viral infectivity factor. The ability of interferon-α (IFN-α) to augment cytidine deaminases offered {{the possibility that the}} balance between virus and target cell might be altered in favor of the host. Further characterization of transcriptional profiles induced by IFN-α using microarrays, with the intention to identify and dissociate retroviral countermaneuvers from associated toxicities, revealed multiple molecules with suspected antiviral activity, including IL- 27. To establish whether IFN-α toxicity might be sidestepped through the use of downstream IL- 27 against HIV, we examined whether IL- 27 directly regulated cytidine deaminases. Although IL- 27 inducesAPOBECs, it does so in a delayed fashion. Dissecting the underlying regulatory events uncovered an initial IL- 27 –dependent induction of IFN-α and/or IFN-β, which in turn, induces APOBEC 3, inhibited by IFN-α/β receptor blockade. In addition to macrophages, the IL- 27 –IFN-α connection is operative in CD 4 + T cells, consistent with an IFN-α–dependent pathway underlying host cell defense to HIV...|$|R
40|$|Background—World Health Organization advocates heat {{treatment}} of expressed breastmilk (EBM) as one method to reduce postnatal transmission of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) in developing countries. Flash-heat is a simple {{heat treatment}} method shown to <b>inactivate</b> cell-free <b>HIV.</b> Objective—To {{determine the effect of}} flash-heat on vitamin content of milk. Methods—Fresh EBM was collected from 50 HIV+ mothers in Durban, South Africa. Mothers washed their hands and then manually expressed 75 – 150 mL EBM into sterile jars. Milk was aliquoted to unheated controls or flash-heat (50 mL EBM in a glass jar heated in a 450 -mL water jacket in an aluminum pan until water boiled, then EBM removed) simulating field conditions with an open flame. Samples were stored at − 70 °C and then analyzed for the effect of flash-heat on vitamins [A, ascorbic acid, riboflavin (B 2), pyridoxal- 5 -phosphate (B 6), folate, and B 12]. Results—Vitamin A was not significantly affected by flash-heat and vitamins B 12 and C and folate increased significantly. Vitamins B 2 and B 6 were decreased to 59 % (95 % confidence interval 44 to 81) and 96 % (95 % confidence interval 92 to 99), respectively, of that found in unheated milk. Conclusions—The percentage remaining after flash-heat suggests that most vitami...|$|R
40|$|HIV- 1 {{survival}} kinetics in {{peritoneal dialysis}} effluent. Viable and potentially infectious HIV- 1 has been {{recovered from the}} peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). No information had previously been available as to how long HIV- 1 could survive in this environment, and no data were available as to how long HIV- 1 could survive on peritoneal dialysis exchange tubing (PDET). Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to answer these questions. HIV- 1 Mn was added to PDE and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 0 to 14 days. Following centrifugation, the cellular component of the PDE mixture was placed in co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV negative donors. Aliquots from the co-cultures were removed after 14 days and assayed for the HIV- 1 -P 24 antigen. High levels of HIV P 24 antigen were recovered up to and including seven days of room temperature incubation. HIV could not be recovered from PDE that had been incubated at room temperature for 10 to 14 days. Ten milliters of HIV-PDE mixture was placed within PDET and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The solution was then removed by gravity drainage. After drying times of 0 to 168 hours, the tubing was flushed with HIV culture medium and placed in co-culture with PBMCs from HIV negative donors. The culture supernatant was assayed for the HIV- 1 P 24 antigen as a marker of viral replication. High levels of HIV- 1 P 24 antigen were recovered from the PDET wash for up to and including 48 hours of drying time. No viable virus could be detected for drying times of between 72 and 168 hours. To determine if common disinfectants found in the dialysis unit could <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV,</b> dilutions of Amukin™ 50 % and household bleach were prepared at final concentrations ranging from 1 : 32 to 1 : 2048. These disinfectant solutions were incubated with PDE containing HIV for 10 minutes. The cellular fraction of the PDE was isolated by centrifugation, washed, and placed in co-cultures with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HIV P 24 antigen levels were assayed every three days for 28 days. Amukin™ 50 % and a 10 % household bleach solution were effective in killing HIV in PDE at dilutions up to and including 1 : 512. These results indicate that HIV can survive in PDE at room temperature for up to seven days. HIV can survive on peritoneal dialysis exchange tubing for up to 48 hours. Final dilutions of 1 : 512 Amukin™ 50 % and 10 % household bleach, after 10 minutes of exposure, are effective viricidal agents in disinfecting PDE...|$|R
