40|$|When an {{atmospheric}} pressure plasma jet is operated by pulsed voltages with a kHz-range repetition frequency, guided streamers — often called plasma bullets — are typically observed. One {{of their most}} notable properties is that these guided streamers follow a predetermined path rather than branch as streamers normally do. This behavior {{is due to a}} memory effect where the remnants of previous discharges provide a <b>guiding</b> <b>channel</b> for the new streamer to follow. However, when the plasma jet is first turned on, such <b>guiding</b> <b>channel</b> cannot be present yet and consequently there must be a development phase during which the <b>guiding</b> <b>channel</b> is formed. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eIn this contribution we present a detailed study of the development from branching to guided streamers in a pulsed plasma jet generated in N 2 and flowing into open air. During the first voltage pulses after the initial ignition a transition from branching to guided streamers is indeed observed. The length of the guided part of the streamer is determined from individual recordings of the emission with an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera to examine the transition. This process is repeated for different applied pulse voltages, repetition frequencies and gas flow rates to establish the relation between the development and these parameters. With a numerical calculation of the gas velocity field we show that the development of the <b>guiding</b> <b>channel</b> is closely related to the transport of remnants of previous discharges in the gas flow. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} realize the {{information}} <b>guided</b> <b>channel</b> hopping, also known as spatial modulation, with more design flexibility, {{in this paper we}} propose a novel scheme that allows operation with an arbitrary number of transmit antennas. Once the number of transmit antennas is not a power of two, the antennas' symbols are mapped by different numbers of bits. Subsequently, constellations with different orders are exploited for the modulation of radiated symbols so as to guarantee that the total number of bits transmitted at each time slot remains the same. Furthermore, we introduce a decoding algorithm with low complexity for this design. Numerical results on bit error rate performance are provided and substantiate that the proposed scheme {{turns out to be a}} promising alternative to the design of information <b>guided</b> <b>channel</b> hopping. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
