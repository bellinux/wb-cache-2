40|$|Industrial Biotechnology and Applied Microbiology is an {{optional}} 128 h-course for Chemistry and Biology {{students at the}} Faculty of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. This course is usually attended by 25 students, working in teams of two. The curriculum, with 8 lab exercises, includes an oil bioremediation practice covering an insight of bioremediation processes: the influence of pollutants on autochthonous microbiota, biodegrader isolation and biosurfactant production for bioavailability understanding. The experimental steps are: (A) evaluation of microbial tolerance to pollutants by constructing pristine soil microcosms contaminated with diesel or xylene and (B) isolation of degraders and biosurfactant production analysis. To check microbial tolerance, microcosms are incubated during one week at 25 - 28 ºC. Samples are collected at 0, 4 and every 48 h for CFU/g soil testing. An initial decrease of total CFU/g related to toxicity is noticed. At {{the end of the}} experiment, a recovery of the CFU number is observed, evidencing enrichment in biodegraders. Some colonies from the CFU counting plates are streaked in M 9 -agar with diesel as sole carbon source. After a week, isolates are inoculated on M 9 -Broth supplemented with diesel to induce biosurfactant production. Surface tension and Emulsification Index are measured in culture supernatants to visualize tensioactive effect of bacterial products. Besides the improvement in the <b>good</b> <b>microbiological</b> <b>practices,</b> the students show enthusiasm in different aspects, depending on their own interests. While biology students explore and learn new concepts on solubility, emulsions and bioavailability, chemistry students show curiosity in bacterial behavior and manipulation of microorganisms for environmental benefits. </span...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Storing sugar {{extracts}} {{as thick}} juice, {{a form of}} sucrose syrup, is common practice in the sugar industry. Even under <b>good</b> storage <b>practices,</b> <b>microbiological</b> problems can sometimes occur. Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires greater understanding of microbial dynamics of thick juice storage. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the microflora associated with thick juice degradation in order to define better process controls. Materials and Methods: Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded thick juice samples. Based on results obtained by these approaches, specific PCR primers were designed for routine detection of the most predominant species. Results and Discussion: Both CLA and T-RFLP revealed that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the presence of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species. Other microorganisms were also detected in both types of samples, but none were present as consistently or nearly as abundantly as T. halophilus. These results report the first association of T. halophilus with a sugar-rich environment. Based on its high density, we believe that this organism potentially plays a role in thick juice degradation. Therefore, PCR primers were designed and verified to specifically detect this species in thick juice matrices to further elucidate its presence and putative role in thick juice degradation. status: publishe...|$|R

Improving control of these microflora-related problems requires {{greater understanding of the}} microbial dynamics of thick juice storage. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} map the population dynamics during storage and identify the microflora associated with thick juice degradation in order to define better process controls. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis (CLA) (both targeting 16 S-rDNA) as well as classical culture-based methods were used to characterize bacterial communities present in non-degraded and heavily degraded thick juice samples. Based on the results obtained by these approaches, a nylon membrane-based DNA array targeting 16 S rDNA sequences was developed for all bacterial species detected. For signal amplification, the target DNA was amplified using universal primers that anneal to conserved sequences flanking diagnostic domains, simultaneously labeled, and subsequently hybridized to the array. Detection was performed using the anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate and CDP-Star substrate. Both CLA and T-RFLP demonstrated that Tetragenococcus halophilus was the most consistent and predominant taxon present in both degraded and non-degraded samples that were examined. Classical plating on rich medium confirmed the dominance of this halophilic Tetragenococcus species, but revealed also other osmophilic bacteria possibly pernicious during sugar production including Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Kocuria spp., Aerococcus viridans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and other Tetragenococcus species. In order to monitor the bacterial population dynamics during thick juice storage, a specific thick juice macro-array was developed covering these bacteria. Using the array, a diverse microbial population was found at the beginning of storage, which evolved to dominance of Tetragenococcus species mostly accompanied by Staphylococci. Based on its high density, we believe that Tetragenococcus halophilus potentially plays a role in thick juice degradation.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the impacts of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) on the microbiological water quality of a river used {{as a source of}} drinking water treatment plants. Escherichia coli concentrations were monitored at various stations of a river segment located in the Greater Montreal Area including two Drinking Water Intakes (DWIs) in different weather conditions (dry weather and wet weather (precipitation and snowmelt period)). Long-term monitoring data (2002 - 2011) at DWIs revealed <b>good</b> <b>microbiological</b> water quality with E. coli median concentrations of 20 and 30 CFU/ 100 mL for DWI- 1 and DWI- 2 respectively. However, E. coli concentration peaks reached up to 510 and 1000 CFU/ 100 mL for both DWIs respectively. Statistical Process Control (SPC) analysis allowed the identification of E. coli concentration peaks in almost a decade of routine monitoring data at DWIs. Almost 80 % of these concentrations were linked to CSO discharges caused by precipitation exceeding 10 mm or spring snowmelt. Dry weather monitoring confirmed <b>good</b> <b>microbiological</b> water quality. Wet weather monitoring showed an increase of approximately 1. 5 log of E. coli concentrations at DWIs. Cumulative impacts of CSO discharges were quantified at the river center with an increase of approximately 0. 5 log of E. coli concentrations. Caffeine (CAF) was tested as a potential chemical indicator of CSO discharges in the river and CAF concentrations fell within the range of previous measurements performed for surface waters in the same area (~ 20 ng/L). However, no significant differences were observed between CAF concentrations in dry and wet weather, as the dilution potential of the river was too high. CSO event based monitoring demonstrated that current bi-monthly or weekly compliance monitoring at DWIs underestimate E. coli concentrations entering DWIs and thus, should not be used to quantify the risk at DWIs. High frequency event-based monitoring is a desirable approach to establish the importance and duration of E. coli peak concentrations entering DWIs.

The obtained mixed product has been analyzed and biochemical evaluated and the results are: 1) as regards date: it is rich especially in sugars (TSS= 60 ± 0, 4 % n= 3) with low proteins content (2, 1 ± 0, 4 %; n= 3) compared to the Spirulinawhich is rich in proteins (61, 745 ± 0, 0353; n= 3), bioactives substances asphycocyanin (1, 7 ± 0, 0015 g/ 100 g ms; n= 3); total chlorophyll (1, 0463 ± 0, 0946 %; n= 3) and ashes (9, 41 ± 0, 03 %; n= 3); 2). The two powders are revealed, under the experimental conditions, have <b>good</b> <b>microbiological</b> qualities. Moreover, the three extracts of xanthophylls, ß carotène and phycocyanin of the Spirulina are characterized by a: 1) bactericidal action against S. aureus and P. aeruginosashowing intermediate zone of inhibition (14, 10, 66 mm); 2...|$|R
