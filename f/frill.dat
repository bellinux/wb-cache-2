5|$|Aside {{from the}} large nasal horn and four long <b>frill</b> spikes, the cranial {{ornamentation}} was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the posterior margin of the <b>frill,</b> similar to but smaller than those in Centrosaurus. Others had less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long <b>frill</b> spikes. Others had much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, Styracosaurus had large fenestrae (skull openings) in its <b>frill.</b> The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.|$|E
5|$|Early on, Lull {{postulated}} that the frills may {{have served as}} anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the <b>frill</b> bones.|$|E
5|$|Feduccia's <b>frill</b> {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a <b>frill</b> {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also raise questions about the current theory of feather origins itself. It calls into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E

5|$|Opinion has varied on the {{validity}} of a separate genus for Nedoceratops. John Scannella and Jack Horner regarded it as an intermediate growth stage between Triceratops and Torosaurus.

Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Fields also did not consider it a transition between Torosaurus and Triceratops, suggesting that the <b>frill</b> holes were pathological.|$|E

2500|$|The large <b>frills</b> and nasal {{horns of}} the ceratopsians {{are among the}} most {{distinctive}} facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function {{has been the subject of}} debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered. Common theories concerning the function of ceratopsian <b>frills</b> and horns include defense from predators, combat within the species, and visual display. A 2009 study of Triceratops and Centrosaurus skull lesions found that bone injuries on the skulls were more likely caused by intraspecific combat (horn-to-horn combat) rather than predatory attacks. The <b>frills</b> of Centrosaurus were too thin to be used for defense against predators, although the thicker, solid <b>frills</b> of Triceratops might have evolved to protect their necks. The <b>frills</b> of Centrosaurus were most likely used [...] "for species recognition and/or other forms of visual display".|$|R

Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear.

5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe {{to the idea that}} they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the <b>frill</b> bones.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 and 1889, Othniel Charles Marsh {{described}} the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, Ceratops and Triceratops. In 1890 Marsh classified {{them together in}} the family Ceratopsidae and the order Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realized that Triceratops, Monoclonius, and Agathaumas all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named Agathaumidae in 1891. Cope redescribed Monoclonius as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes, and a large <b>frill.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat with predators using horns, Triceratops are classically shown engaging {{each other in}} combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, there is disagreement about whether they did so. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on Triceratops skulls (and the skulls of other ceratopsids) are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study finds no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes. A newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions and periosteal reaction in Triceratops and Centrosaurus and showed that these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the <b>frill</b> being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head. The frequency of injury was found to be 14% in Triceratops. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. Histological examination reveals that the <b>frill</b> of Triceratops is composed of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's {{view on the}} position of Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis of}} several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from its one feature of a shortened <b>frill.</b> Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} <b>frill</b> use in sexual display was first {{proposed}} in 1961 by Davitashvili. This theory has gained increasing acceptance. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship {{or in other}} social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.|$|E

5|$|Torosaurus is a ceratopsid genus first {{identified}} {{from a pair}} of skulls in 1891, {{two years}} after the identification of Triceratops. The Torosaurus genus resembles Triceratops in geological age, distribution, anatomy and physical size and it has been recognised as a close relative. Its distinguishing features are an elongated skull and the presence of two fenestrae, or holes, in the <b>frill.</b> Paleontologists investigating dinosaur ontogeny (growth and development of individuals over the life span) in the Hell Creek Formation, Montana, US, have recently presented evidence that the two represent a single genus.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck <b>frill.</b>|$|E
