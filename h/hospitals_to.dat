5|$|Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners {{arrived on}} February 22–23, 1862. Many of the 2,398 Confederates {{in the first}} group were sick, ill fed, and without {{sufficient}} clothing for the cold, northern winters. The citizens of Indianapolis rallied to provide humanitarian aid for the prisoners, which included additional food, clothing, and supplies. Local doctors aided the sick and local women provided nursing care. The Athenaeum, {{at the corner of}} East Michigan Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and another local building were converted into <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> treat the Confederate prisoners. For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{both the}} {{technological}} gap between civilisations and the centuries-long colonial era, Portugal was a driving force {{in the development and}} shaping of all Portuguese Africa since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused these <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> close.

The victims' ages ranged from 18 to 50. Many victims were placed in artificial comas because they were on life support systems. Eight were transported by helicopter to the specialized Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia, about an hour away. Five of those injured later died there while receiving treatment.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town. He opened a private clinic in general surgery for poor people and African Americans, as blacks had very limited access to medical services. In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, {{which was one of the}} city's few <b>{{hospital}}s</b> <b>to</b> serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery. While working as chief of surgery Watts also served as a trainer for the hospital's interns. In the 1970s he played a major role in establishing the Lincoln Community Health Center.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Hospital</b> <b>to</b> Home {{architecture}} aims {{to provide}} a successful transition for patients leaving the <b>hospital</b> in order <b>to</b> improve health outcomes and minimize hospital readmission. This thesis analyzes the current <b>hospital</b> <b>to</b> home system, explores its flows and proposes a better architecture to improve the patient transition from the <b>hospital</b> <b>to</b> home. It makes a significant contribution by proposing a new architecture based on a patient-centric approach {{within the framework of}} the <b>Hospital</b> <b>to</b> Home (H 2 H) initiative called Caregiver Coordination. In this architecture, we propose the creation of a web and mobile based application that allows patients and caregivers to interact easily with each other to help manage the patient's wellbeing. We include a short summary illustrating how this new architecture can address the two main problems: (1) the decentralization of the discharge plan and (2) the dependency on the interactions among diverse stakeholders. We propose to: 1. Analyze and critique the existing <b>hospital</b> <b>to</b> home architecture 2. Follow an existing architecture pattern/framework 3. Recommend a new architecture 4. Create a Caregiver Coordination application using an open source framework to enable a successful transition of patients from <b>hospital</b> <b>to</b> homeby Hassan Mousaid. Thesis: S.

5|$|The internationally {{recognized}} government, which controls most of southern Yemen, announced {{the suspension of}} schools in four governorates: Hadhramaut, Socotra, Al Mahrah and Shabwah. By 1November, evacuations were ordered in Mukalla and Hadhramaut, and the government's meteorological agency recommended residents to stay more than one kilometre from the coastline. About 18,750people left their homes ahead of the storm on the Yemen mainland. Most people sheltered in public buildings like schools or hospitals, or stayed with relatives. There were reports that al-Qaeda evacuated residents near the coast in Mukalla immediately before the storm struck. Ahead of the storm, the World Health Organization distributed gasoline to ambulances and <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> ensure they would continue operating effectively.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> psychoneurological internats.|$|E
