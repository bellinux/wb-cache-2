40|$|This study {{focus on}} noise {{evaluation}} done at LRT Kelana Jaya Line <b>during</b> <b>train</b> operation. The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the level of noise <b>during</b> <b>train</b> operation and evaluate the actual level of noise measurement at selected LRT stations. After that, a concept to reduce noise level <b>during</b> <b>train</b> operation was proposed. In addition, the actual level of noise measurement was compared with the theoretical permissible noise based on existing predetermined guidelines and standards. For train interior noise level, sound level meter was installed at front end and gangway by following noise measurement procedure provided by standards and guidelines. For noise at train stations, noise level recorded at different distance from trackside which is 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 meters. The results show that for train interior noise level, most of the time of train operation was exceeded the limitation provided by Prasarana based on standard ISO 3381, 75 dB. The noise level also exceeded noise limit in tunnel which is 80 dB <b>during</b> <b>train</b> operation. For station noise level data, only at distance 2 meter and 4 meter from track can achieve noise level more than 5 dB than limits provided by DOE, about 80 dB. In conclusion, interior train noise level may need to be decrease and at Setiawangsa station has the highest noise level than other stations...|$|R
