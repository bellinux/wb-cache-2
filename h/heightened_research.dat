The intricacy of microglial biology has also become apparent, leading to a <b>heightened</b> <b>research</b> interest in this particular cell type. Over the years a number of different microglial cell culturing techniques have been developed to study either primary mammalian microglia, or immortalized cell lines.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish, through a national survey, the perceived effectiveness of several strategies for improving homework communication between parents, students, and teachers. Initially, principals were asked to randomly select two teachers from their schools for the survey. These nomi-nated teachers then were mailed a survey on homework recommendations. A total of 639 general ed-ucation teachers (50. 5 %) responded. The results indicated that these general education teachers perceived several common practices, as well as use of technology, to be highly effective for improv-ing home-school communication about homework for students with disabilities. Among the most highly ranked recommendations were release and mutual planning time, assignment books and logs, parent attendance at meetings and daily monitoring of their child’s homework, and use of telephone networks or answering machines to provide remote access to assignments. Several practice recom-mendations are discussed. The increasing commitment of educators to inclusive school settings (e. g., Fuchs & Fuchs, 1994) has resulted in the scru-tiny of general education classroom practices for students with disabilities.

On the other hand, increased migration has led to ethnically diverse and multicultural societies problematising the monochromatic ideas of nation and culture in the process. The two together have the potential of revolutionising the {{information service}} profession, in New Zealand and across the world, in two distinct ways – 1) the need to cater {{to the demands of}} a <b>heightened</b> <b>research</b> interest in migration, migrants {{as well as in the}} related issues of host society-diaspora relationship, and expressions of this relationship in literature, institutional and societal practices, 2) the need to serve information needs of a user populace that reflects the ethnic and cultural diversity of the present day nations and institutions. This is already evident in the demands on archival services, as various migrant communities, as minority communities, seek to find out and assert their role and their place in the host nation’s and society’s history/story. At the same time, in the field of archival studies, there is an enhanced awareness of: 1) the potential role of traditional archival practices in silencing certain voices and in marginalising minorities, and 2) the need to rethink traditional archival theories and practices. As a result, community archives movement and migrant community archives are focus of increased cross-disciplinary academic attention and interest, and a cutting edge area of research.

40|$|Millions {{of tons of}} fungal spores are {{dispersed}} in {{the atmosphere}} every year. These living cells, along with plant spores and pollen grains, may act as nuclei for condensation of water in clouds. Basidiospores released by mushrooms form {{a significant proportion of}} these aerosols, particularly above tropical forests. Mushroom spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface. This droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars. This fluid is carried with the spore during discharge, but evaporates once the spore is airborne. Using environmental electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air. The kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds. Through this mechanism, mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes.

40|$|Growth in industrial, commercial, {{and medical}} {{applications}} for micro-fluidic devices has fueled <b>heightened</b> <b>research</b> and development into micro-fluidic design, materials, and increasingly manufacturing. Polymers (Poly(methyl methacrylate) -PMMA in particular) are the current material of choice given their low cost, {{wide range of}} material properties, and biocompatibility. Given most fabrication processes have focused on hard materials for the semiconductor industry, an alternate set of processes such as hot micro-embossing (HME) have received increased attention as manufacturing processes for high-volume polymer-based micro-fluidic production. An understanding of the equipment, process physics, control strategy, and metrology for part fabrication are required when moving from the lab to production level. An initial statistical analysis of PMMA parts fabricated on the first generation HME system showed the need to: (1) design a new HME system; and (2) establish alternative methods for characterizing micro-fluidic parts. (cont.) A second generation HME system was constructed with fellow Manufacturing and Process Control Laboratory (MPCL) graduate students and a FTS (Functional Testing System) was developed to test whether HME parts from the new HME system were capable of flowing fluid and establish output metrics for process control based on fluid pressure and flow rate. The new characterization method was shown to have re-registration error as low as + 1. 03 % (overall RMS uncertainty of ± 1. 51 %). The experimental data from tests run on the FTS fit a fluid model developed to the expected accuracy of [...] ± 10 % {{for all but the}} lowest aspect ratio micro-channel. Moreover, the FTS results were consistent with optical scans of a series of parts made with varying HME parameters. The FTS was able to detect differences that a few isolated optical scans could not. The FTS provided a bulk quantity to assess the geometry of the channel rather than at a specified location. These results and the deficiencies in existing metrology techniques warrant further exploration into functional-based testing for micro-fluidic devices to parallel well established testing methods in place in the IC industry. Functional testing does not have the capacity to replace traditional metrology; however, it can add an important output metric-a quantitative measure of the output parts fluid flow. by Kunal H.

40|$|International @ CDFA+DLJ:PFOInternational audienceThe {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} has <b>heightened</b> <b>research</b> efforts to find environmentally-friendly alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals, thereby, the production of biodiesel has increased significantly [1]. The manufacture of biodiesel lead to different co-products, among them is glycerol (GLY), which represent 10 wt. % of the final product. For this reason, the transformation of GLY in valuable chemicals (glyceric acid, glycolic acid, formic acid,etc) has gained a great interest [2]. Among the different transformation techniques, the catalytic oxidation, as a non-expensive and environmentally-friendly process, is the most developed. There are many studies which deal the kinetic analysis and modelling of the GLY oxidation. However, it is still necessary to further investigate this reaction to explain some aspects which are not clarified so far. This way, {{the aim of this}} work is to perform a kinetic modelling of the GLY oxidation. A kinetic model will be proposed by using the experimental results reported in a previous work of our groups [3] carried out in kinetic regime and a carbonbalance close to 100 %. FIG 1 shows the reaction pathways selected for the preliminary kinetic analysis, by analysis of experimental results reported previously [3] where C- 1 (formic), C- 2 (glycolic) and C- 3 (glyceric) acids have been found as primary products. Direct C-C cleavage into small acids was already reported in previous studies [4]. The first kinetic model has been proposed on formal approach, by considering first-reaction order of all components. For the parameter estimation, non-linear regression was performed by using Matlab. Finally, a statistical analysis of the estimated parameters was performed by the calculation of the standard deviations and the correlation matrix. Obtained rate constants at different reaction temperatures are listed in FIG 2, along with a comparison of the calculated and experimental concentrations for the Au-catalysed reaction at 100 °C. Results revealed that the Au catalyst was active and selective towards formic and tartronic acids, and the activation energies obtained were similar than those reported elsewhere [5]. In general, the concentrations predicted with the kinetic model fittedadequately with the experimental ones. However, statistical analysis results (not shown) revealed a strong correlation between different rate constants. Therefore, the model will be improved by the incorporation of further parameters that could influence the activity of the process, such as the base concentration, the reaction orders {{and in the case of}} the Au-catalysed reactions, the adsorption constants of the GLY and the obtained products. Moreover, the reaction mechanism will be further analysed by additional experiments of competitive reactions...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} demographic predictors of parental vaccine safety and risk perceptions, {{and assess the}} relationship between the occurrence of children's perceived adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) on parents' opinions. METHODS: Computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) were conducted in 2011 with a cross-sectional, random general population sample of rural and metropolitan residents in South Australia. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses examined associations between parental vaccine safety attitudes and socio-demographic factors, adjusting for whether children had ever experienced a previous suspected AEFI. RESULTS: Of 469 parents interviewed, 95 % were confident in vaccine safety in general, but almost half expressed concern for pre-licensure testing of vaccines. Of all parents, 41 % responded {{that at least one of}} their children had experienced an AEFI. Almost one third of the AEFI parent group indicated they reported their children's symptoms to either a healthcare professional or the Department of Health. Parental acceptability of the risks of febrile convulsion and anaphylaxis were 73 % and 76 % respectively. Ordinal logistic regression analyses showed parents of children who had experienced a suspected AEFI were associated with greater concern for vaccine safety (OR: 0. 53, p≤ 0. 01) and more were likely to expect either a mild or a serious AEFI. After adjusting for demographics, parental confidence in vaccine safety was significantly associated with higher levels of education (OR: 2. 58, p= 0. 01) and being born in Australia OR: 2. 30, p= 0. 004. Mothers, when compared with fathers, were less accepting of the two vaccine risks presented: febrile convulsion (OR: 0. 57, p= 0. 04) and anaphylaxis, (OR: 0. 55, p= 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Parents commonly perceive and report that their child has experienced an AEFI. In this group of parents the subsequent expectation of an AEFI and vaccine safety concerns may be <b>heightened.</b> Further <b>research</b> should investigate parental understandings of differentiating an expected event from an adverse event as this could inform immunization risk communication and consumer AEFI reporting strategies.

METHODS: "Door to needle time" for parenteral antibiotics in children with meningococcal disease was recorded prospectively {{as part of a}} larger study. The time from arrival at hospital until the first dose of parenteral antibiotics was recorded in 100 children with meningococcal disease (median (range) age 21 (3 - 168) months) admitted to four Merseyside hospitals. RESULTS: Forty five children presented directly to the accident and emergency (A&E) department. Parenteral penicillin was given before admission to 19 of the 55 children referred by general practitioners (GPs). Median door to needle time was 36 minutes.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses survey of 253 Chinese work professionals {{with respect to their}} use of IM tools at work. Findings: IM does empower work teams via shaping the social networks and facilitating knowledge sharing in the workplace, resulting in <b>heightened</b> team performance. <b>Research</b> limitations/implications: The survey was conducted in China so generalization to other national contexts is tentative. It focuses on the bright side of IM, but neglects the dark side, e. g. security concerns and work interruptions. Practical implications: IM is not only a social tool, it also has the potential to contribute to work teams. However, IM cannot achieve better work performance alone. Its contribution to strengthen the social networks at work is also critical. These social networks at work can enable employees to overcome psychological barriers to knowledge sharing. Originality/value: Studies of IM in the workplace have not previously considered social network perspectives, nor the value of such IM-facilitated social networks for work performance.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose that sales {{managers}} use mobile technologies in the working environment to communicate and supportively monitor sales person performance. Design/methodology/approach – A model of supervisor monitoring using mobile technologies is conceptualized that specifies the types of behaviours that promote high-quality working relationships, how mobile technologies increase the likelihood of work-to-nonwork role spill-over that may damage the relationship and why perceptions of supervisor fairness are critical. The paper concludes by presenting strategies for testing hypotheses and for researching mobile technology use by sales managers using qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings – Mobile technology use, supervisory monitoring, and relationship development co-exist in the current workplace. This <b>research</b> <b>heightens</b> awareness of how work-to-nonwork spillover may influence important outcomes of mobile technology usage. Perceptions of quality supervisor-employee relationships are important to retaining and motivating employees. As the workforce ages and skilled workers become more scarce, it is expected that this theoretical examination and ensuing future research will be interesting and important to the twenty-first century manager. Originality/value – This paper aligns research in the areas of leadership, monitoring and ubiquitous or mobile technologies. Previous leadership researches have questioned whether or not the use of different electronic monitoring tools affects the leader 2 ̆ 7 s ability to influence others. However, few researchers have examined performance-based monitoring using mobile technologies, although mobile technologies make it easier for sales managers to monitor non-traditional work arrangements (i. e. off-site or contracted work).

40|$|Chemical use in {{agriculture}} has, {{over the last}} fifty years, been the good, the bad, and the uncertain.

THE ROLE PARAPROFESSIONALS PLAY IN SCHOOLS AND THEIR SELECTION In recent years, American schools have seen a growth in the number of special education paraprofessionals employed to serve our special education students as well as a growth in the roles these individuals are expected to play in schools. In addition, with passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004, school districts have also become increasingly concerned about the quality of individuals filling these paraprofessional positions.

Today, computational skills drive research and industrial applications across most areas in the architectural sciences and all are increasingly underpinned by educational practices. Moreover, computing itself {{is not just a}} tool for supporting other research. The work that began to occur in the 1970 s under the auspices of shape grammars, space syntax and algoritllmic analysis has lead to the rise of a distinct and vibrant sub-field of the architectural sciences; computation and cognition. This is one of the two sub-fields that are the focus of the present book. The second sub-field has always been part of the architectural sciences in Australasia at least, but around the world it has suffered from a lack of equivalent focus and commitment. This second field of research is concerned with architectural education...|$|R

40|$|Contrasting {{predictions}} {{were made}} to differentiate a one-stage from a two-stage model of word-association performance in schizophrenia. Schizophrenics and normals (N = 24 each) provided word associations in response to (a) "free " versus "idiosyncratic " instructions and (5) stimulus words that typically elicit either a strong dominant association or several weak associations. Results confirmed the two-stage model: under idiosyncratic instructions, schizophrenics produced more common associations than normals. Findings were consistent with two assumptions pertinent to the two-stage model: schizophrenics (a) sample from an underlying repertoire of nondeviant associations and (6) are deficient {{in the ability to}} edit out sampled but situationally inappropriate associations, whether common or unusual. Schizophrenics typically emit more deviant or unique responses in word-association tasks than normals (Buss, 1966). Theoretical formulations to account for this have been proposed by Mednick (1958), Broen and Storms (1966), and Cohen and Camhi (1967), among others. These formulations may be classified as using either a one-stage or a two-stage model to describe the process leading to the emission of an associative response. Mednick's (1958) ideas provide a good illustration of a one-stage model of wordassociation performance in schizophrenia. He proposed that the schizophrenic's typically high anxiety level results in a heightened drive state which, in light of Hull's theory (1943), provides remote associations with increased response strength. Once these remote associations are strong enough to clear an "evocation threshold, " they can compete successfully with more common responses. Such a model implies that the momentary associative strength of a response, relative to other potential responses in S's repertoire, is the sole determinant of its being emitted. Mednick's idea that <b>heightened</b> anxiety 'The <b>research</b> upon which this paper is based wa...|$|R

While radical product innovations represent significant engines of firm growth, questions remain over whether marketing helps or hurts (1) a firm's radical product innovation activity and (2) its rewards from radical product innovation activity. By attaching an attention-based view of the firm to a market-based assets view of marketing, this paper examines the role of three marketing resources - market knowledge, reputation, and relational resources - on radical innovation activity. Our conceptual framework posits differentiated effects among marketing resources as antecedents of radical innovation activity and as moderators of its impact on firms' financial performance. Using a survey of a broad set of high-tech business-to-business (B 2 B) firms to test hypotheses, it is found that firms with strong relational resources enjoy a higher propensity for, and stronger financial rewards from, radical innovation activity.

40|$|Increased {{competition}} in the modern economy has driven firms to search for increased efficiency, {{as well as an}} increased access to information. This, in conjunction with the continual advancement in information and communication technologies (ICTs), and coupled with falling prices, has inspired firms to adopt different types of ICTs in order to be competitive. This has <b>heightened</b> and provoked <b>research</b> interest in the effectiveness of ICT at the firm level. However, most studies on the use and effectiveness of ICTs in firm development have focused on developed economies, with mainly anecdotal evidence on many developing countries. Using data collected on 3, 996 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across 14 Sub-Saharan African countries, the thesis examines the factors that motivates the adoption, usage and the contribution of ICTs to turnover of firms. The thesis uses a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model and meta-analysis technique to determine the factor that influence SMEs decision to adopt ICT. We also employ two different production function specifications to ascertain the effect of ICT adoption on turnover of SMEs, as well as on technical efficiency. The effect of ICT on turnover is thoroughly examined also employing quantile regression technique to ascertain the productivity effect of ICT along the entire distribution. The thesis assesses the contribution of ICT adoption to turnover differential among various types of SMEs using a recently proposed decomposition technique. The factors influencing adoption decisions of firm vary significantly across the countries. Nonetheless, the meta-analysis identifies common determinants of ICT adoption among SMEs in these countries. The findings indicate that the ratio of users of computer and the Internet in an industry and perceived national {{competition in}}fluences adoption decisions of firms. Our findings also indicate that ICT capital have a positive and significant effect on firm’s output, suggesting that there is no ICT productivity paradox among SMEs in Africa. We also find that ICT adoption positively influences technical efficiency of firms. Further, the results show that the contribution of returns to ICT adoption to turnover differential varies considerable across income groupings of countries as well as various types of firms...|$|R

TessoThe lack of {{effective}} post-emergence weed control options is often highlighted {{as one of}} the major factors behind dwindling acreage under sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) in the United States. The discovery of herbicide resistance sources in wild sorghum population and subsequent efforts to incorporate them into cultivated sorghum was received with much optimism to change weed management practices in sorghum. As the development of the technology advances, especially of the Acetolactate synthase (ALS) resistance, concerns over the temporary interveinal chlorosis and reduced seedling vigor in some of the resistant families became <b>heightened.</b> This thesis <b>research</b> is designed to shed light on the genetic basis of seedling chlorosis and assess its impacts on yield potential. The study has three parts; the first part is focused on identifying the genetic causes and plant mechanisms associated with the chlorotic phenotype. ALS herbicide resistant sister-lines expressing normal and chlorotic phenotypes were analyzed via RNA sequencing at four time points during seedling growth. The study identified several variants of genes coding chloroplast precursors and those that cause epigenetic modifications. Once confirmed, genetic markers can be developed to track these gene variants in the breeding population and eliminate segregates genetically prone to chlorosis/yellowing. The second part of the study focuses on assessing the effect of ALS resistance associated chlorosis on agronomic and nutritional parameters of sorghum inbred lines. A set of ALS resistant lines expressing different levels of the chlorotic phenotype were evaluated in replicated field trials and laboratory methods. Results showed that interveinal chlorosis delays flowering but does not have negative effect on yield and nutritional parameters with and without herbicide treatment. The last part addresses whether there is any yield drag that may be associated with herbicide resistance traits and foliar interveinal chlorosis. For this, we synthesized a large set (182) of hybrids from ALS resistant, ACCase resistant and regular (susceptible) seed and pollinator parents. The hybrids were then evaluated in three sets at multiple locations during the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons along with commercial checks. The results revealed that resistance to both herbicides do not cause any drag to grain yield. The traits also do not have any negative impact on grain and nutritional quality of resistant hybrids...|$|R
40|$|TB {{patients}} show poor compliance to available drugs {{due to the}} costs, adverse side effects, {{and prolonged}} treatment, leading to multi-drug resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR), and most recently totally drug resistant TB. Shared drug toxicities and drug interactions with antiretrovirals compound the problem. The rapid development of resistance to known antimalarials compared to {{the rate at which}} new agents are coming into the market still remains a big challenge is combating malaria. Currently, with resistance to ACTs having been documented in South-East Asia, the situation is dire as there is no ready alternative to these drugs. There is thus a <b>heightened</b> need for <b>research</b> towards the development of new anti-TB and anti-malarial drugs based on novel chemotypes. Towards addressing this need, SAR studies were conducted on the 2 -amino- 4 -aryl thiazole scaffold by synthesizing a series of derivatives with different motifs at the various positions of the scaffold. These derivatives exhibited moderate antiplasmodial activity in the CQS strain of P. falciparum, and good antimycobacterial activity on the H 37 Rv strain of M. tb. A 2 -pyridyl group at position 4 of the thiazole ring as well as a substituted phenyl at position 2 was found to be essential for antimycobacterial activity. However, the 2 -pyridyl group was not essential for antiplasmodial activity while the substituted phenyl at position 2 was essential for antiplasmodial activity. The linker between these two groups affected antimycobacterial activity with little influence on the antiplasmodial activity. In addition structural modifications were performed on the ergoline backbone of metergoline, and a number of derivatives synthesized with different para substituted phenyls. These compounds exhibited moderate antiplasmodial activity in the CQS strain of P. falciparum, and moderate antimycobacterial activity on the H 37 Rv strain of M. tb. The presence of a substituted phenyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine was found to be essential for antimycobacterial activity, however, this substituted phenyl group didn't confer optimum antimycobacterial activity as the compounds were less active than metergoline. The antiplasmodial activity of these compounds was better than that of metergoline and was enhanced by the hydrophobicity of the substituent on the phenyl ring. Changing the linker between the ergoline backbone and the substituted phenyl ring didn't have any significant effect on either the antimycobacterial or the antiplasmodial activity...|$|R
