The fat-graft <b>injection</b> <b>technique</b> allows the plastic surgeon precise control in accurately contouring the breastfrom the chest {{wall to the}} breast-skin envelopewith subcutaneous fat grafts to the superficial planes of the breast. This greater degree of breast sculpting is unlike the global augmentation realised with a breast implant emplaced below the breast or below the pectoralis major muscle, respectively expanding the retromammary space and the retropectoral space. The greatest proportion of the grafted fat usually is infiltrated to the pectoralis major muscle, then to the retropectoral space, and to the prepectoral space, (before and behind the pectoralis major muscle). Moreover, although fat grafting to the breast parenchyma usually is minimal, it is performed to increase the degree of projection of the bust.|$|E

2500|$|Failure of {{conservative}} treatments such as stretching and {{strengthening of the}} piriformis muscle or {{a high level of}} immediate pain intensity may bring into consideration various therapeutic injections such as local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine), Anti-inflammatory drugs and/or corticosteroids, botulinum toxin (BTX, BOTOX), or a combination of the three, all of which have a well-documented effectiveness at relieving muscle-related pain. <b>Injection</b> <b>technique</b> is a significant issue since the piriformis is a very deep seated muscle. A radiologist may assist in this clinical setting by injecting a small dose of medication containing a paralysing agent such as botulinum toxin under high-frequency ultrasound or CT control. This inactivates the piriformis muscle for 3 to 6 months, without resulting in leg weakness or impaired activity. [...] Though the piriformis muscle becomes inactivated, the surrounding muscles quickly take over its role without any noticeable change in strength or gait. [...] Such treatments may be more or less curative (with no return to pain), or may have limited timespans of effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fault {{tolerant}} circuits {{are currently}} required in several major application sectors. Besides and in complement to other possible approaches such as proving or analytical modeling whose applicability and accuracy are significantly restricted {{in the case}} of complex fault tolerant systems, fault-injection has been recognized to be particularly attractive and valuable. Fault injection provides a method of assessing the dependability of a system under test. It involves inserting faults into a system and monitoring the system to determine its behavior in response to a fault. Several fault <b>injection</b> <b>techniques</b> have been proposed and practically experimented. They can be grouped into hardware-based fault injection, software-based fault injection, simulation-based fault injection, emulation-based fault injection and hybrid fault injection. This paper presents a survey on fault <b>injection</b> <b>techniques</b> with comparison of the different <b>injection</b> <b>techniques</b> and an overview on the different tools...|$|R
