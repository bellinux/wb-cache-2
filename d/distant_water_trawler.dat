In 1956 Ross secured twenty North Sea skippers through acquisition, and {{built up a}} Bird and Cat class North Sea and Middle <b>Water</b> <b>trawler</b> enterprise which went on to acquire the Cochrane yards at Selby.

40|$|Taiwan's <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> tuna fleet in the 1990 s {{has faced}} the twin burden of {{increasing}} operational costs and reduced catches, increasing {{the pressure on}} an industry which {{has in the past}} been able to restructure in response to both constraints and opportunities. Increasing operational costs have been matched with problems in attracting Taiwanese crew. Access arrangements to fish within a coastal state's EEZ are even more problematic for Taiwan given its lack of diplomatic status. Taiwan's ability to cope with the increasing constraints on the operations of its <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fleet emphasises that it will remain a major tuna fishing nation. Taiwan will maintain its interest in high value tuna fisheries although it appears that the catch of these species is being brought under strict control by the Council of Agriculture.

50|$|Britain's {{negotiating}} position was {{complicated by the}} conflicting interest of the inshore and <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishermen. The Scottish fleet had {{a strong interest in}} seeing the exclusive 12 mile (22.2 km) limit retained; but the UK Government was also pressed by the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fleet, mainly, but not solely based on the east coast of England, which wanted to continue fishing off Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. The <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishermen were, of course, strongly opposed to any extension of territorial waters of any country, including the UK. The drama of the cod war with Iceland was still to come, with Britain’s attempt to protect the interests of its <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fleet. Compromise was reached when it was agreed that the applicant countries would retain their 6-mile (11 km) exclusive limits, and their 12 mi limits subject to existing historical rights, for substantial parts of their coastline, preventing continental European vessels fishing in much of the Scottish west coast, including all of the Minch and Irish Sea. These limits have been renewed in legislation on two occasions, and although these rights are not a permanent feature of the policy, it is unlikely now that they will ever be extinguished, especially {{in the light of the}} need to conserve fish stocks.|$|R
40|$|The {{extension}} of fishery jurisdiction out to 200 {{miles from the}} baselines {{used to measure the}} territorial sea by most of the coastal states was the dominant event in global fisheries during the decade of the 1970 s. In principle, under extended jurisdiction, the coastal states have the authority to eliminate economic waste and to reduce excessive fishing pressure; on the other hand, the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing states will have to curtail their fishing activities from the traditional fishing grounds off the coastal states. The Republic of China is a typical <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing state, and is seriously impacted by the new regime of fisheries jurisdiction. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the problems and opportunities of the ROC to expand her <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> tuna fisheries, taking into consideration not only the changes in the international legal regime, but also trends in the world tuna fisheries...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of exclusive economic zones (EEZs), through the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), changed {{the allocation of}} fishing rights. These zones allocated all fishing rights within 200 nautical miles of land to neighbouring coastal States. This change dramatically increased sovereign rights for Pacific small island States. In many cases, these States, with limited terrestrial resources, were allocated large resource rich EEZs {{that had previously been}} dominated by <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing States. <b>Distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing States, concerned that they would lose access to 85 - 90...|$|R
40|$|Many African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) {{countries}} sell {{fishing licenses}} to <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fleets. Fishing agreements {{have the potential}} to improve the performance of local fishing sectors. They create income that can be reinvested into domestic industries and often go along with partnerships in management and enforcement. However, many fishing agreements run a serious risk of undermining sustainable resource management. The present study critically reviews trends in <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing as well as identifies those tropical host countries most dependent on fishing agreements. It is shown that traditional, more responsible <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fleets (DWFs) are being displaced by less responsible, low-cost DWFs and that the most vulnerable host countries are small coastal states with large exclusive economic zones that lack the ability to benefit from value adding processes associated with fishing. The results suggest that the once-promising concept of fishing agreements is gradually posing a threat to both economic development and environmental sustainability of ACP countries...|$|R

40|$|The massive {{destruction}} of fish stocks during the last 100 years has created an enormous environmental problem with consequences that are poorly understood, both for the fish and for the human populations that depend upon them. Many think of the oceans as the ultimate commons, and believe that fish stocks collapsed because individual fishermen did not restrain their behavior. However, the collapse of world fisheries was not caused by individual fishermen rushing to harvest but {{was the result of}} conscious policies adopted by the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing nations in general, and the U. S., in particular, to promote and expand global fisheries, not only for the fish, but for territorial reasons that were bound with foreign policy concerns during the Cold War. The <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> nations pushed for a policy of taking fish without restrictions, until critical biological points were estimated, then applying measures to slow or restrict the catch. The practical effect of this policy, known as Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY) was that <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> nations fished unhindered until countries began expanding their territorial limits to 200 miles during the 1970 s. The policy greatly facilitated the rise of an industrial, global fishing system, creating fishing capacity that far exceeded the ability of stocks to reproduce. MSY was promoted as being grounded in conservation and sound science, but its adoption was greatly influenced by American foreign policy during this period. MSY also focused fisheries science on the narrow objective of determining harvest points, thus allowing the world’s <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> nations, including the U. S., to forestall attempts by smaller and poorer nations to enclose their fishing stocks to protect them from foreign exploitation...|$|R

40|$|Since tagging of smolts {{began in}} Ireland {{there have been}} sixteen <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> recaptures of adult salmon tagged as smolts or parr in Irish waters. Fifteen of these were recaptured from the Greenland fishery and one salmon was {{recovered}} from the Faroe Islands. The recaptures resulted {{from a number of}} salmon smolt and salmon parr tagging programmes. Some of these programmes were designed specifically to obtain information on the distant migrations of Irish salmon but other programmes were to study migrations and mortality in the home waters. Information on recaptures has been published elsewhere (Piggins 1970, Went 1973). This leaflet brings together all the available information on recaptures of tagged Irish salmon in <b>distant</b> <b>waters</b> up to December 1975 and gives background information on the tagging programmes...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a game theoretic {{setting in which}} four {{countries}} have established a regional organisation for the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks as recommended by the United Nations Convention. These countries consist of two coastal states and two <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing nations (DWFNs). A characteristic function game approach is applied to describe the sharing of the surplus benefits from cooperation. We are specifically interested in the effect of possible coalition restrictions on these shares. According to our results the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing nations, by refusing to join with the coastal states, can improve their negotiation position if their fishing costs are high. In addition, we are also allowing for unlimited number of fishing nations in the regional fisheries organisation.
