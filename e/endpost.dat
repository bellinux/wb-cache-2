40|$|Railhead {{material}} becomes severely stressed due to localised wheel/rail contact loadings. The stress {{situation is}} more {{critical in the}} vicinity of the <b>endpost</b> of an insulated rail joint (IRJ). As the contact point moves towards the <b>endpost,</b> the wheel loading peak pressure increases sharply, not following the well-known Hertzian Contact Theory (HTC). Fibre-glass (fg) is used as the <b>endpost</b> material in IRJs in Australia. With a view to finding a more suitable <b>endpost</b> material to reduce impact force and damage of railhead material, a Nylon 66 (ny) <b>endpost</b> has previously been considered for contact force distributions and stresses near the ny <b>endpost,</b> not focussed on railhead damage. However, for designing a longer service life rail joint, it is essential to minimise damage of railhead and <b>endpost</b> materials and limit the extent of the plastic zone in the sub-surface {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>endpost.</b> This paper presents a 3 D finite element analysis targeting damage and stress distributions in the railhead material near a Nylon 66 <b>endpost.</b> The following design parameters are considered: 5 mm <b>endpost</b> thickness in a 6 -bolt IRJ centrally suspended between two sleepers as per Australian Standard AS 1085. 12, 2002. A non-linear isotropic and kinematic material hardening model is used to represent elastic-plastic behaviour. 2000 loading cycles in the form of wheel pressure using the amplitude function in ABAQUS are applied for this analysis. Critical strain and stress components are determined to quantify railhead damage. The effects of both fg and ny <b>endpost</b> material on the mechanical behaviour of IRJs are analysed to find the best design. In this regard, PEEQ and von-Mises stresses are considered to determine plastic deformation and material degradation of the railhead material...|$|E

40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} (IRJs) are safety {{critical}} {{components in the}} electrical signalling system of rail corridors. They are subjected to dynamic loads generated by heavy rollingstock – track system interaction and degrade faster than the other components of the rail track. Degraded IRJs diminish {{the reliability of the}} signalling system, thus posing a serious threat to the safety of rail operations. Therefore there is a pressing need for closely examining the failure mechanisms of the insulated material endposts inserted into the discontinuity in the rail at IRJs with a view to improving their service life, reliability and efficiency. Only limited literature are available examining different IRJ <b>endpost</b> materials, and focussing on contact pressure and contact stress distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>endpost,</b> disregarding the damage to rail end and <b>endpost</b> materials. In this paper, a detailed 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to quantify plastic deformation and damage to <b>endpost</b> and railhead materials of IRJs due to a wheel load which causes the rail steel shakedown limit to be exceeded. A modified Hertzian contact pressure distribution is considered in this simulation. A 5 mm <b>endpost</b> thickness is considered at the discontinuity in the rail which is required to form the IRJ. Three popular IRJ <b>endpost</b> materials are employed in this study, these being fibreglass (FB or fb), polyhexamethylene adipamide (Nylon 66 or ny) and polytetrafluoroethelene (PTFE or ptfe). 2000 cycles of a 174 kN dynamic wheel load (in pressure format over the contact patch) are applied on the top of the rail surface in the vicinity of the IRJ with a dynamic load factor of 1. 16. Equivalent plastic deformations along with vertical and longitudinal plastic strains for loaded and unloaded conditions are presented. The strain plots depict damage of <b>endpost</b> materials and ratchetting failure of the steel in the vicinity of the rail ends. The ratchetting failure modes follow the established trend of decay in ratchetting rate in successive wheel load cycles. Comparisons of strain and stress on the railhead surface and in the railhead sub-surface considering all three different <b>endpost</b> materials are put forward. Out of the three <b>endpost</b> materials, fibreglass is the best performing material considering ratchetting damage...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two types}} of Insulated rail joints (IRJs) in the railway track: {{inserted}} and glued. The IRJs in the track are significant components in relation to integrity and safety of rail signalling operations. Because of low values of vertical bending rigidity of IRJs, cyclical dynamic wheel loading forces increase significantly at IRJs, thus accelerating material degradation and damage of their components such as rail ends, endposts, joint bars, etc. As a result, relatively free rail ends are created at IRJs that further amplify dynamic wheel load impacts. Only limited literature are available addressing the free end of rail effects at IRJs targeting stress distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} rail joints. To understand clearly the delamination process of inserted <b>endpost</b> IRJs and the damage of the <b>endpost</b> and rail end material, a thorough analysis targeting the modes of failure of both glued and inserted IRJs and subsequent damage of the railhead material is necessary to find ways to improve the joint’s life. In this paper, a 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to assess damage when the <b>endpost</b> is either initially installed loosely (“inserted” rather than “glued”) in between the ends of the rail at the IRJ or becomes a loose fit due to plastic delamination of a glued joint, or when a gap is created between the rail and <b>endpost</b> due to pull-apart problems as the rails contract longitudinally in winter. Both 5 mm and 10 mm gaps (inserted <b>endpost</b> IRJs) are considered, using a peak vertical pressure load of 2500 MPa applied at one rail end. This peak load ensures a ratchetting failure mode of the rail end material. Plastic deformations and stress distributions in the vicinity of inserted IRJs are quantified using FEA data and compared with that of the glued IRJs (5 mm and 10 mm <b>endpost</b> thicknesses) to show the free end of rail effects. Residual stress and strain distributions indicate the damage of the railhead material. The progressive damage of the railhead material at the rail ends can be quantified by equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ). The free end of rail effects can be further illustrated by comparing PEEQ for inserted and glued IRJs. The railhead material of 5 mm and 10 mm inserted <b>endpost</b> IRJs is more sensitive to permanent deformation compared to that of the corresponding glued IRJs. Therefore, inserted IRJs pose an increased potential threat to rail operations in relation to damage of railhead and <b>endpost</b> materials and premature failure of IRJs...|$|E
40|$|An {{insulated}} rail joint is a component used to join two abutting rails whilst keeping them electrically separated from one another. This allows {{for the construction of}} track circuits and train detection within signalling systems. Electrical failure of the joints can be caused by plastic flow of the rail steel over the insulating gap, known as lipping. In the following paper this failure mode has been experimentally modelled using twin disc testing and indicative conclusions have been formed. It has been found in this testing that <b>endpost</b> thickness does not {{have an effect on the}} rate of lipping, but the <b>endpost</b> and rail material do. An <b>endpost</b> with higher compressive strength will perform better while tougher / harder rail steel will also improve performance. The application of a laser clad layer of tougher material on the running surface, however, gave the greatest resistance to lipping...|$|E
50|$|A {{truss bridge}} is any bridge whose {{individual}} members are connected in a triangular pattern. Truss bridges {{date back to}} at least the 16th century, although the metal truss bridge, such as the Fair Oaks Bridge, dates only to the 1840s. These metal truss bridges, especially the Pratt and Warren trusses, facilitated the enormous expansion of railroad lines in the late 19th century and were instrumental in turn-of-the-century highway construction as well. The trusses form vertical sides to the bridge, connected to one another by traverse beams, and by stingers and other members which support the deck. Each truss always includes a top and bottom chord, the major beams which resist the bending induced by stresses on the bridge. The top and bottom are connected by some combination of vertical and/or diagonal members, usually both, {{as well as by}} major beams at each end, called <b>endposts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} are {{critical}} for train safety as they control electrical signalling systems; unfortunately they exhibit excessive ratchetting of the railhead near the <b>endpost</b> insulators. This paper reports a three-dimensional global model of these joints under wheel–rail contact pressure loading and a sub-model examining the ratchetting failures of the railhead. The sub-model employs a non-linear isotropic–kinematic elastic–plastic material model and predicts stress/strain levels in the localised railhead zone adjacent to the <b>endpost</b> which {{is placed in the}} air gap between the two rail ends at the insulated rail joint. The equivalent plastic strain plot is utilised to capture the progressive railhead damage adequately. Associated field and laboratory testing results of damage to the railhead material suggest that the simulation results are reasonable...|$|E
40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} (IRJs) {{are the most}} {{important}} structural link in a railway track for electrical signal purposes. Because of the presence of the discontinuity in the rail material at IRJs, problems with maintaining rail/track geometric requirements and much increased dynamic wheel load effects on IRJs result. Material degradation and damage to the rail ends at the discontinuity therefore occur. A few studies have been carried out to address this issue globally. A local stress and damage analysis is essential to study the material behaviour of the rail ends with an appropriate elasto-plastic material model. For cyclic loading, a kinematic hardening material model alone is not enough to predict ratchetting damage, plastic deformation and initiation of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) defects at the rail ends of IRJs. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to study the distribution of stresses and strains {{in the vicinity of the}} IRJs using modified Hertzian Contact Theory (HCT). A solid rail model with a 10 mm thick fibreglass insulating <b>endpost</b> filling the rail discontinuity is considered and two beam elements are connected to the solid rail model by equation constraints. A 5 mm fibreglass <b>endpost</b> is also considered for comparison purposes. A combination of nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening material models is considered in the simulation. A local stress analysis model, called sub-modelling, is incorporated to capture degradation of materials accurately and to obtain ratchetting damage of the <b>endpost</b> material of the IRJ. It also captures the decay of the ratchetting rate. The effects of cyclic wheel loads on the IRJ are also presented. The analysis indicates that material degradation occurs progressively due to the loading spectra. Simulation results also present the IRJs mechanical behaviour with response to <b>endpost</b> thicknesses for enhancing better geometric design of IRJs...|$|E
40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} (IRJs) are safety {{critical}} {{components in the}} signalling system of railway corridors which provide {{a break in the}} continuity of the rail steel to locate trains. IRJs connect the two rail ends at the discontinuity to achieve geometric and mechanical requirements of rail. The bending stiffness of an IRJ is about one third that of continuous rail. As a result, the IRJs, especially those in heavy haul tracks, exhibit early failure predominantly due to ratchetting or alternating plasticity of railhead metal {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>endpost</b> insulators. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element numerical simulation is carried out to examine failures of railhead material in the vicinity of the <b>endpost</b> of an insulated rail joint considering high frequency dynamic wheel loading. A dynamic wheel load of 182 kN is applied through a contact patch; the distribution of contact pressure is considered using a non-Hertzian formulation. A 12 m long global IRJ model and a sub-model for localised analysis are employed. The shakedown theorem is employed in this study. Nonlinear isotropic/kinematic elastic-plastic material modelling is employed in the simulation. A peak pressure load lower than the shakedown limit is considered as the input load. The equivalent plastic strain plot for this load case lower than the shakedown limit demonstrates the railhead damage captured through a localised stress analysis in the vicinity of the <b>endpost</b> using the sub-modelling technique. The sub-surface plastic deformation of railhead material extends down to 8 mm from the railhead top surface. The critical crack initiating stress components are at 2 mm- 4 mm sub-surface depth. As such, the railhead material fails due to alternating plasticity through low cycle fatigue. Laboratory tests were performed to verify the simulation results and found that test and simulation results correlated well...|$|E

A 5 mm <b>endpost</b> thickness is considered at the discontinuity in the rail steel which is required to form the 6 bolt IRJ. In addition, an axial pressure load of 165 MPa was also considered on the rail faces at the discontinuity {{in the form of}} compression (buckling) and tension (pull-apart). A modified Hertzian contact pressure distribution is considered in this simulation. 100 cycles of dynamic wheel load of 174 kN were applied to the rail top materials {{in the vicinity of the}} IRJ. Residual stress and plastic strain, equivalent plastic strain and permanent deformation of railhead material in the vicinity of IRJ are presented. The strain data depict damage of <b>endpost</b> materials and ratchetting failure of rail ends due to vertical wheel load and axial thermal load. The ratchetting failure modes follow the established trend of decay in the ratchetting rate in successive wheel load cycles. The size of the plastic zone in the railhead materials is also identified...|$|E

A dynamic load factor of 1. 21 is considered in modelling for the wheel load based on a previous study as part of this on going research. Shakedown theorem is employed in this study. A peak pressure load whhich is above the shakedown limit is determined as input load. As a result, a progressive damage in the railhead has been captured as depicted in the equivalent plastic strain plot...|$|E
40|$|Ratchetting {{failure of}} {{railhead}} material adjacent to <b>endpost</b> which {{is placed in}} the air gap between the two rail ends at insulated rail joints causes significant economic problems to the railway operators who rely on the proper functioning of these joints for train control using the signalling track circuitry. The ratchetting failure is a localised problem and is very difficult to predict even when complex analytical methods are employed. This paper presents a novel experimental technique that enables measurement of the progressive ratchetting. A special purpose test rig was developed for this purpose and commissioned by the Centre for Railway Engineering at Central Queensland University. The rig also provides the capability of testing of the wheel/rail rolling contract conditions. The results provide confidence that accurate measurement of the localised failure of railhead material can be achieved using the test rig...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{numerical}} simulation {{is carried out}} to determine the stress distribution on railhead {{in the vicinity of}} an insulated rail joint suspended between sleepers. The dynamic wheel load due to rail end discontinuity is considered in the simulation. The dynamic loads are treated as Hertzian pressure modified for plasticity of the railhead and discontinuity of the rail section near <b>endpost.</b> Submodelling is considered in this simulation to present stress distribution on the railhead. Von Mises stresses in loading and unloading (residual), vertical stresses and equivalent plastic strains are presented. Shakedown theorem is considered to apply a peak pressure load on the rail which is below the shakedown limit. As a result, a non-progressive damage of the railhead material is anticipated. Residual longitudinal stress is critical for damage of the railhead top surface and von-Mises along with vertical stresses is significant for subsurface damage of the railhead in the vicinity of rail joint...|$|E
40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} (IRJs) possess lower bending {{stiffness}} across the gap containing insulating <b>endpost</b> and hence {{are subjected to}} wheel impact. IRJs are either square cut or inclined cut to the longitudinal axis of the rails in a vertical plane. It is generally claimed that the inclined cut IRJs outperformed the square cut IRJs; however, there is a paucity of literature {{with regard to the}} relative structural merits of these two designs. This article presents comparative studies of the structural response of these two IRJs to the passage of wheels based on continuously acquired field data from joints strain-gauged closer to the source of impact. Strain signatures are presented in time, frequency, and avelet domains and the peak vertical and shear strains are systematically employed to examine the relative structural merits of the two IRJs subjected to similar real-life loading. It is shown that the inclined IRJs resist the wheel load with higher peak shear strains and lower peak vertical strains than that of the square IRJs...|$|E

A simplified 2 D plane stress finite element model is used to simulate the wheel-rail rolling contact impact at IRJ. This model is validated using data from a strain gauged IRJ that was installed in a heavy haul network; data in terms of the vertical and shear strains at specific positions of the IRJ during train passing were captured and compared with the results of the FE model. The comparison indicates a satisfactory agreement between the FE model and the field testing. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the experimental and numerical analyses reported in this paper provide a valuable datum for developing further insight into the behaviour of IRJ under wheel impacts...|$|E
40|$|As an {{integral}} part the railway network infrastructure, insulated rail joints (IRJs) electrically isolate track segments providing critical feedback to both track signaling and train position detection systems. Because of the discontinuous nature of IRJs, accumulated damage at the railhead is high. Failure modes include plastic flow of metal across joints, bolt and fishplate failures, delamination of insulated material and, {{as a result of}} rolling contact fatigue, end post and <b>endpost</b> surface damage. In the current investigation, microstructural changes in the vicinity of endposts of IRJs made from both surface coated and uncoated rail are investigated using techniques of optical and scanning electron microscopy. Damaged IRJs made from pearlitic head hardened rail steel are compared with head hardened rail steel laser coated with martensitic stainless steel, the latter having an increased service life.

40|$|Bonded (glued) {{insulated}} rail joints {{are widely used}} in continuously welded railroad track. These joints frequently develop problems in which the epoxy debonds from the fishing surfaces of the rail and joint bars, leading to problems such as pull-aparts and electrical failures. Insulated joint problems can be disruptive to railroad operations, and may in some cases {{increase the risk of}} train derailments. This paper describes the results of computer modeling of the effects of epoxy debonding on the stresses and strains in a bonded insulated joint subjected to longitudinal force. The primary goal of this research is to identify measurable changes in the joint’s strain distribution that correlate with the extent of debonding, to serve as the basis of a non-destructive monitoring and evaluation technique. The results of the modeling show that, under thermal tensile loads, strains {{at the center of the}} outer surface of the joint bar tend to increase as debonding begins near the <b>endpost.</b> The strain at this point tends to stabilize after the debonding reaches the innermost bolt hole. Strain at a point between the outermost and middle bolt holes start...|$|E
40|$|Degradation {{and failure}} of {{insulated}} joints (IJ’s) {{is a major}} railroad maintenance problem today. Current techniques for monitoring IJ condition and detecting defects are either too labor-intensive for everyday use or too inaccurate for efficient planning of IJ replacement. While it is nontrivial to directly measure the extent of problems such as epoxy debonding or loss of resistance, such degradation also causes other, more measurable changes in certain properties of the joint. For instance, loss of epoxy bonding near the <b>endpost</b> changes the strain distribution within the joint bars. This paper describes several ways in which simple measurements of such properties can be correlated with common joint problems. The emphasis is on properties that can be measured using inexpensive, fully automatic monitoring systems. The potential application of “smart sensors ” (wireless, self-contained, auto-networking measurement devices) and other technology is discussed. Computer modeling and laboratory testing have confirmed that the strain response of an IJ changes as the epoxy layer debonds from the metal surfaces. Field testing will be conducted to verify that these changes can be reliably detected and distinguished from the normal variation experienced by a healthy joint. Tests to date also suggest that simple voltage measurements, collected automatically and without interference to track circuit operation, could give an indication of intermittent failure in the joint’s insulating capability. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{insulated}} {{block joint}} (IBJ) is a mechanical joint which joins two abutting railway rails whilst keeping them electrically separate from each other. They {{are an integral}} component of block signalling systems as they allow for train detection within the network, however, they are a weak point in the system where failures can occur. The aims of this research work were to develop test regimes to enable life cycle analysis of IBJs and use these tests to assess the performance of different materials and designs. This has been achieved {{by the use of}} specimen, component and full assembly level testing. Specimen and component level shear testing has been carried out which has allowed for the assessment of different glues and insulating materials that are used in an IBJ and also has tested differing design principles. These experiments have been monitored using ultrasound techniques to investigate how failures within the insulating materials occur. It has been found that by using a full fit design with a glass fibre lining material an improvement in the shear strength of the IBJ can be obtained in comparison to a standard UK design. A full scale testing regime was developed in order to cyclically load assembled IBJs and compare a new joint design with the standard design. The new test method enabled testing of the IBJs to failure and gave a good comparison between two joints. Ultrasonic monitoring techniques have been implemented based on knowledge gained in component level testing which has allowed for the assessment of de-bonding within the IBJs as the test is carried out. Further specimen and full scale testing was carried out and a novel test regime was used to experimentally model lipping, the plastic flow of steel over the end of an IBJ causing electrical failure. This test regime allowed for the testing of different materials in both the <b>endpost</b> and the rail. By using a hardened rail steel or a hardened laser clad layer on the running surface of the rail it has been found that lipping performance can be improved greatly. The work has {{led to the development of}} a new design of IBJ that incorporates material and design changes and aims to increase the life cycle of the IBJ by increasing static and dynamic stiffness and improving the rail material with respect to lipping performance. Further work on in service testing of laser cladding technology could be performed to further the work that has been achieved using twin disc testing...|$|E
