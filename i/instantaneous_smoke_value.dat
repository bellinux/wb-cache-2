Abandonment of efforts leading to reduction mainly of carbon dioxide emission by heavy industry, electric power generation based on coal, passenger aviation and wheeled passenger transport will inevitably be leading to deterioration of health condition of our citizens. This article presents an overview of commonly used structural and technological treatments which have impact on reduction of toxic standardized exhaust pollutants in the surface transport, exemplified on SW 400 engine version of L 2 / 3 and its turbocharged version 6 CT 107 2 /L 2. The impact of: engine’s adjustment parameters, catalytic afterburners, exhaust gas recirculation, modifications of injectors, turbochargers, supercharging air-cooling and particulates filter on carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulates emission was thoroughly examined.

40|$|Abstract — In this study, {{by varying}} the {{injection}} pressures, {{the performance and}} emission characteristics were investigated for a dual bio fuel (Jetropha oil and Rubber seed oil) in a diesel engine. For this purpose a single cylinder four stroke Direct Injection (DI) constant speed diesel engine was used. The experiments were conducted {{for each of the}} injection pressures 200, 220 and 240 bar with the different proposition such as 20 % and 60 % of biodiesel blends with pure diesel fuel. While other parameters like injection timing and mass flow rate were constant, the injection pressure was changed during testing of the engine. The performance parameters were obtained for different load conditions from no load to full load at the rated power of 4. 4 kW and a speed of 1500 rpm. From the results, it was observed that, CO 2, HC and CO emissions were reduced about 5 % to 10 %, when the fuel injection pressure is increased with less amount of biodiesel blends. However the <b>smoke</b> <b>value</b> and NOx is increased significantly when the injection pressure is reduced to 200 bar. The analysis revealed higher brake thermal efficiency for the biodiesel of B 20 and a good reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2), unburned hydrocarbon (HC) Nitric oxide (NOx) emissions when compared to the blen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fire hazard {{and risk}} {{analyses}} establish the basis for providing conditions of safety for people, including those that are more sensitive to fire smoke than others. For this purpose, this paper develops a method for estimating, from information on lethal and incapacitating exposures for rats, <b>smoke</b> toxic potency <b>values</b> for incapacitation of smoke-sensitive people. For those engineering applications where the mix of combustibles is unknown, generic values are derived of the concentration of smoke that would incapacitate smoke-sensitive people in 5 min: 6 g/m 3 for a well-ventilated fire and 3 g/m 3 for an underventilated (e. g., post-flashover) fire. These values are estimated with significant assumptions in their derivation, resulting in an estimated uncertainty of about a factor of two. Further, {{there is a wide}} range of <b>smoke</b> toxic potency <b>values</b> reported for various combustibles, and some of these will lead to values significantly higher or lower than these generic figures.

Material/Methods: Rats were separated into 4 groups: nonsmoking (NS) 2 (n= 25; control animals not exposed to tobacco smoke for 2 months), smoking (S) 2 (n= 22; rats exposed to smoke from 40 cigarettes/d for 2 months), NS 6 (n= 18; control animals not exposed to tobacco smoke for 6 months), and S 6 (n= 25; rats exposed to smoke from 40 cigarettes/d for 6 months). All animals underwent echocardiographic, isolated heart, and morphometric studies. Data were analyzed with a 2 -way analysis of variance. Results: No interaction among the variables was found; this suggests that length of exposure to tobacco smoke did not influence the effects of exposure to <b>smoke.</b> <b>Values</b> for left ventricular diastolic diameter/body weight and left atrium/body weight were higher (p= 0. 023 and p= 0. 001, respectively) in smoking (S 2 and S 6) than in nonsmoking animals (NS 2 and NS 6). Left ventricular mass index was higher (p= 0. 048) in smoking than in nonsmoking animals. In the isovolumetrically beating ventricle, peak systolic pressure was higher (p= 0. 034) in smoking than in nonsmoking animals. Significantly higher values were found for left ventricular weight (p= 0. 017) and right ventricular weight (p= 0. 001) adjusted for body weight in smoking as opposed to nonsmoking animals. Systolic pressure was higher (p= 0. 001) in smoking (128 +/- 14 mm Hg) than in nonsmoking animals (112 +/- 11 mm Hg).

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to determine the pH of whole cigarette smoke. In this technique, whole smoke from ten cigarettes was trapped in 300 mL water containing 1 % (w/v) sodium chloride and the pH was determined on the resulting aqueous suspension of cigarette smoke. Two impingers with an extra coarse porosity fritted disc were used to dispense the smoke in the aqueous trapping medium. Cigarettes were smoked on a 20 -port Borgwaldt RM 20 /CS smoking machine using modified FTC (Federal Trade Commission) conditions. The puff volume was adjusted to take a 35 mL puff as measured through the cigarette and the collection traps. This {{new technique}} accounts for the contributions to smoke pH from both the vapor phase and the particulate phase of smoke. The repeatability of this new technique was determined on eighteen replicates of a commercially available non-menthol, filter cigarette. Each measurement was done on a different day to check for a possible drift in pH with time. The mean pH value for the chosen sample {{was found to be}} 4. 97 {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 07 pH units. The <b>smoke</b> pH <b>values</b> for over 150 commercially available cigarette brands with a variety of “tar” levels were determined.

Further increase of biodiesel fraction in the blends will increase the viscosity and decrease performance.

40|$|Biological {{research}} requires {{valid and}} reliable measures of the biologically-based aspects of dependence. Traditional dependence measures focus on behaviors (e. g., patterns of use), that can be constrained by sociocultural factors such as cost and restrictions on smoking. When dependence measures reflect non-biological factors, they are less suitable for biological research. We will present new data concerning several tobacco dependence measures that assess only biologically-based symptoms. The Levels of Physical Dependence (PD) is a 3 -item instrument that assesses how subjects experience the urge to smoke that is triggered by withdrawal. It provides a quantitative measure of a person’s progression along 4 levels of PD. As all tobacco users progress through the 4 levels of PD in the same sequence, biological events associated with level 2 must precede events associated with level 3. This measure provides a unique and valuable time perspective to the interpretation of data. The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist assesses 10 symptoms of dependence. It’s excellent sensitivity and reliability allowed it to demonstrate a nearly perfect correlation (r=-. 96) with changes in neural density that accompany the progression of PD. The Latency to Withdrawal (LTW) is a single item subjective measure {{of the length of}} time a person can forgo the use of tobacco before experiencing a withdrawal-triggered urge to <b>smoke.</b> Valid <b>values</b> for the LTW vary from minutes to weeks. The LTW is an important biological factor to consider in studying withdrawal and cue-induced craving.

40|$|Background: Indoor air {{pollution}} (IAP) from solid fuels {{is a serious}} health problem in low-income countries that can be alleviated using improved stoves. Although women are the principal users, few studies have investigated the self-assessed impact of the stoves on their health and lives. Methods: This {{study was conducted in}} rural highland Guatemala, involving 89 intervention and 80 control Mayan Indian young women (mean 27. 8 years, SD 7. 2). Outcomes were assessed after approximately 18 months use of the new stove. Our objectives were to compare self-rated health and change in health among women participating in a randomised control trial comparing a chimney stove with an open fire, to describe impacts on women's daily lives and their perceptions of how reduced kitchen smoke affects their own and their children's health. Results: On intention-to-treat analysis, 52. 8 % of intervention women reported improvement in health, compared to 23. 8 % of control women (p < 0. 001). Among 84 intervention women who reported reduced kitchen smoke as an important change, 88 % linked this to improvement in their own health, particularly for non-respiratory symptoms (for example eye discomfort, headache); 57 % linked reduced smoke to improvement in their children's health, particularly sore eyes. Conclusion: Women's perception of their health was improved, but although <b>smoke</b> reduction was <b>valued,</b> this was linked mainly with alleviation of non-respiratory symptoms like eye discomfort and headache. More focus on such symptoms may help in promoting demand for improved stoves and cleaner fuels, but education about more severe consequences of IAP exposure is also required. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the microshear bond strength of composite resin restorations in dental blocks {{with or without}} exposure to cigarette smoke. Method: Eighty bovine dental blocks were divided into eight groups (n= 10) according {{to the type of}} adhesive (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose, 3 M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA [SBMP]; Single Bond 2, 3 M ESPE [SB]; Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray Medical Inc, Okayama, Japan [CSEB]; Single Bond Universal, 3 M ESPE [SBU]) and exposure to smoke (no exposure; exposure for five days/ 20 cigarettes per day). The adhesive systems were applied to the tooth structure, and the blocks received a composite restoration made using a matrix of perforated pasta. Data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey test (alpha< 0. 05). Results: For enamel, {{there was no difference between}} the presence or absence of cigarette smoke (p= 0. 1397); however, there were differences among the adhesive systems (p< 0. 001). CSEB showed higher values and did not differ from SBU, but both were statistically different from SB. The SBMP showed intermediate values, while SB demonstrated lower values. For dentin, specimens subjected to cigarette smoke presented bond strength values that were lower when compared with those not exposed to smoke (p< 0. 001). For the groups without exposure to cigarette smoke, CSEB showed higher values, differing from SBMP. SB and SBU showed intermediary values. For the groups with exposure to cigarette <b>smoke,</b> SBU showed <b>values</b> that were higher and statistically different from SB and CSEB, which presented lower values of bond strength.

40|$|Observations of multiwavelength Mie-Raman lidar {{taken during}} the SHADOW field {{campaign}} are used to analyze a smoke/dust episode over West Africa on 24 – 27 December 2015. For the case considered, the dust layer extended {{from the ground up}} to approximately 2000  m while the elevated smoke layer occurred in the 2500  m– 4000  m range. The profiles of lidar measured backscattering, extinction coefficients and depolarization ratios are compared with the vertical distribution of aerosol parameters provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA- 2). The MERRA- 2 model simulated the correct location of the near–surface dust and elevated <b>smoke</b> layers. The <b>values</b> of modeled and observed extinctions at both 355  nm and 532  nm are also rather close. Good coherence between measured and modeled extinction profiles provides an opportunity to test how well the model reproduces backscattering of dust particles at different wavelengths. The comparison shows good agreement of modeled and measured backscattering coefficients at 355  nm, meaning that the modeled dust lidar ratio of 65  sr in the near-surface layer is close to the observed value. At 532  nm however, the simulated lidar ratio is lower than measurements (about 40  sr and 50  sr respectively). The reason for this disagreement could be that the assumed imaginary part of the refractive index for dust (0. 0025 at 532  nm) is too low, or that the particle size distribution in the model is too much weighted toward fine mode dust. The model predicts significant concentration of dust particles inside the smoke layer. This is supported by a high depolarization ratio of 15  % observed in the center of this layer. The backscattering Ångström exponent at 355 / 532  nm as well as both lidar ratios have a minimum {{in the center of the}} elevated layer, which can also be explained by the presence of dust...|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{incidence}} of maternal mortality {{were caused by}} bleeding, eclampsia, bleeding before labor and infection. One of the triggering factors caused the onset of infection was premature rupture (PR). It defined as the rupture of amniotic membrane without uterus contractions and labor signs. The strength of amniotic membrane could also be disrupted due {{to the effect of}} nicotine of cigarette. The nicotine contained in cigarette was harmful to the pregnancies. The premature rupture rate in Indonesia was quite high. In Kendal regency the number of pregnant women who experienced in premature rupture in the year 2011 was approximately 445 patients. Meanwhile, in January up to September 2012 the premature rupture cases reached about 542 patients. Based on the preliminary survey conducted on 7 premature rupture patients in dr. H. Soewondo hospital Kendal in October 2012 the data obtained 5 (71, 4 %) patients had a history of smoking husbands. Methode : This study purposed to know the most influential variable to the incidents of premature rupture in pregnant women in dr. H. Soewondo Kendal, Central Java Province. The design of the study used case control. The case population was pregnant women with premature rupture. Meanwhile, the control population of normal pregnant women and the sampling technique used accidental sampling. The collecting data used questionnaire, checklist and tool, rapid diagnostic cotinine test. The data analysis used chi square test. Result : The result of the study showed the most influential variable to the incidents of premature rupture was the history of cigarette <b>smoke</b> exposure with <b>value</b> p = 0, 00 and OR 23, 188. Thus, it could be concluded that the history of cigarette smoke exposure was the most influential variable to the incidents of the premature rupture than parity and polyhidramnion history.

40|$|An updated set of {{time series}} of derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström’s {{exponent}} a {{from a number}} of Arctic and Antarctic stations was analyzed to determine the long-term variations of these two parameters. The Arctic measurements were performed at Ny-Ålesund (1991 e 2010), Barrow (1977 e 2010) and some Siberian sites (1981 e 1991). The data were integrated with Level 2. 0 AERONET sun-photometer measurements recorded at Hornsund, Svalbard, and Barrow for recent years, and at Tiksi for the summer 2010. The Antarctic data-set comprises sun-photometer measurements performed at Mirny (1982 e 2009), Neumayer (1991 e 2004), and Terra Nova Bay (1987 e 2005), and at South Pole (1977 e 2010). Analyses of daily mean AOD were made in the Arctic by (i) adjusting values to eliminate volcanic effects due to the El Chichón, Pinatubo, Kasatochi and Sarychev eruptions, and (ii) selecting the summer background aerosol data from those affected by forest fire <b>smoke.</b> Nearly null <b>values</b> of the long-term variation of summer background AOD were obtained at Ny-Ålesund (1991 e 2010) and at Barrow (1977 e 2010). No evidence of important variations in AOD was found when comparing the monthly mean values of AOD measured at Tiksi in summer 2010 with those derived from multi-filter actinometer measurements performed in the late 1980 s at some Siberian sites. The long-term variations of seasonal mean AOD for Arctic Haze (AH) conditions and AH episode seasonal frequency were also evaluated, finding that these parameters underwent large fluctuations over the 35 -year period at Ny-Ålesund and Barrow, without presenting well- defined long-term variations. A characterization of chemical composition, complex refractive index and single scattering albedo of ground-level aerosol polydispersions in summer and winterespring is also presented, based on results mainly found in the literature. The long-term variation in Antarctic AOD was estimated to be stable, within ` 0. 10...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for fossil fuels and environmental threat due to pollution a number {{renewable sources of energy}} have been studied worldwide. In the present investigation influence of injection timing on the performance and emissions of a single cylinder, four stroke stationary, variable compression ratio, diesel engine was studied using waste cooking oil (WCO) as the biodiesel blended with diesel. The tests were performed at three different injection timings (24 Â°, 27 Â°, 30 Â° CA BTDC) by changing the thickness of the advance shim. The experimental results showed that brake thermal efficiency for the advanced as well as the retarded injection timing was lesser than that for the normal injection timing (27 Â° BTDC) for all sets of compression ratios. Smoke, un-burnt hydrocarbon (UBHC) emissions were reduced for advanced injection timings where as NOx emissions increased. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was used to predict the engine performance and emission characteristics of the engine. Separate models were developed for performance parameters as well as emission characteristics. To train the network, compression ratio, injection timing, blend percentage, percentage load, were used as the input parameters where as engine performance parameters like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), exhaust gas temperature (Texh) were used as the output parameters for the performance model and engine exhaust emissions such as NOx, <b>smoke</b> and (UBHC) <b>values</b> were used as the output parameters for the emission model. ANN results showed that there is a good correlation between the ANN predicted values and the experimental values for various engine performance parameters and exhaust emission characteristics and the relative mean error values (MRE) were within 8 %, which is acceptable.

40|$|Background and aims: Atherogenic Dyslipidemia is {{a common}} feature of Metabolic Syndrome (MS), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM) and Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (FCHL). The aim of our pilot study was to compare lipid levels, {{cholesterol}} and triglycerides (TG) content in lipoprotein sub fractions in subjects with MS, T 2 DM and FCHL and to correlate lipoprotein subfraction levels with non-HDL cholesterol levels. Materials and methods:Two hundred and four individuals were studied: 80 subjects with MS, 85 with T 2 DM and 39 with FCHL. All subjects were in primary prevention for CVD and not on lipid-lowering therapy. Total Cholesterol (TC), HDL-C and TG were measured by standard assays; NON- HDL-C was calculated as TC minus HDL-C; cholesterol and TG in VLDL, Intermediate density lipoproteins(IDL) and LDL particles were measured after separation by density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Data are expressed as mean (±SD). For comparison between groups the ANOVA was used. Generalized linear model was performed for multivariate analysis (adjusting for age, sex, BMI and <b>smoke).</b> A p <b>value</b> of < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results:Mean age in MS, T 2 DM and FCHL subjects was 51 (± 1. 58), 60. 2 (± 9. 88) and 46. 05 (± 9. 72) years, respectively. AD was present in 53. 7 % of patients with MS, in 23. 5 % of T 2 DM patients and in 46. 1 % of FCHL patients. After multivariate regression analysis, T 2 DM patients showed significantly lower levels of TC, TG, NON-HDL-C and significantly higher HDL-C levels as compared to MS and FCHL patients (p< 0. 001 for all). Accordingly, cholesterol in VLDL and IDL and TG in VLDL, IDL and LDL subfractions were also significantly lower in T 2 DM than in the other 2 groups (p < 0. 001 for all. High correlation between non HDL cholesterol levels and lipid subfraction was founf in all three groups. Conclusion:In the cohorts studied, T 2 DM patients display a less atherogenic lipid profile as {{compared to patients with}} MS and FCHL; non HDL choesterl confirms his high correlation with VLDL and IDL levels...|$|R

N, 126. 53 ?? E) in April 2009, {{in order to determine}} the nature and source of the atmospheric aerosol associated with this event. Integrated monitoring using satellite and depolarization light detection and ranging (lidar) data, together with model analysis, was also completed for the period of the high-PM 10 event. The Sun/sky radiometer-derived particle depolarization ratio values are similar to the lidar-derived values, and these values highlight the effect of dust particles on aerosol observation. High particle depolarization ratios (12. 5 ??? 14. 2 %) were observed when the aerosol plume transported from the west between 5 and 7 April. In contrast, lower particle depolarization ratios (5. 8 ??? 9. 8 %) were detected when the aerosol plume was transported from the north on other observation days. Different optical properties are also shown according to the variation of depolarization ratio. High values in the real part of the refractive index (1. 47 ??? 1. 49 at 440 nm), lower values in the imaginary part of the refractive index (0. 007 ??? 0. 009 at 440 nm), and a high proportion of coarser particles were observed during the high depolarization ratio period. In contrast, the atmospheric aerosol transported from the north showed characteristics more commonly associated with <b>smoke,</b> with lower <b>values</b> in the real part of the refractive index (1. 41 ??? 1. 48 at 440 nm), higher values in the imaginary part of the refractive index (0. 008 ??? 0. 011), and a high proportion of fine particles. This indicates that the Sun/sky radiometer-derived depolarization ratio is a useful parameter when estimating the effect of dust particles during high-PM 10 events...|$|R
