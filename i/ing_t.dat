An equivalent amount of 0. 9 % physiological saline was administered, as above, to mice in the high oxygen saline group. Ten mice {{were randomly selected from}} each group on P 14 and on P 17, euthanized and the retinas examined. Apoptotic cells in the retina were detected using the terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. The expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the retina was detected by immunohistochemistry and changes in rod cells were observed using electron microscopy. RESULTS :TUNEL-positive cells and iNOS immunoreactive neurons were present in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell retinal layers of mice in the high oxygen group. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly greater in the high oxygen group compared with the normal group (t =- 20. 81, P 14 <b>d</b> <b>t</b> =- 15. 05, P 17 <b>d</b> <b>t</b> =- 13. 21, P 14 <b>d</b> <b>t</b> =- 6. 61, P 17 <b>d</b> <b>t</b> =- 21. 95, P 14 <b>d</b> <b>t</b> =- 17. 30, P 17 <b>d</b> <b>t</b> =- 12. 17, P 14 <b>d</b> <b>t</b> =- 10. 30, P 17 d CONCLUSION :AG may protect retinal neurons in OIR by inhibiting apoptosis. The mechanism may be related to iNOS...|$|R

As follows from accurate numerical computations of these five-body ions they {{are similar to the}} negatively charged hydrogen ion H^- with a three-particle central quasi-nucleus a b μ (or (a b μ) ^+). These five-body ions play some role in the muon-catalyzed fusion of nuclear reaction in liquid deuterium and/or deuterium-tritium mixtures. We also discuss the bound {{states in the}} six-body a b c μ e_ 2 quasi-molecules, where (a, b, c) = (p, <b>d,</b> <b>t).</b> These six-body, two-electron quasi-molecules are of great interest for muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion, since in liquid deuterium and/or deuterium-tritium mixture more than 99 % of all muon-catalyzed reactions of the (dd) - and (dt) -fusion occur in such six-body quasi-molecules: <b>d</b> <b>d</b> <b>t</b> μ e_ 2, d d d μ e_ 2 and <b>d</b> <b>t</b> t μ e_ 2...|$|R
