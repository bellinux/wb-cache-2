6000|$|I {{warned him}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> {{of a lost}} rudder at sea, and gave him two {{classical}} examples of makeshifts out of a text-book. In exchange he described to me a jury-rudder he had invented himself years before, when in command of a 3000-ton steamer. It was, I declare, the cleverest contrivance imaginable. [...] "May be of use to you some day," [...] he concluded. [...] "You will go into steam presently. Everybody goes into steam." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced at}} him with surprise. His cordial {{agreement}} with all I said cut the ground from under my feet. It made my position complicated, not to say ludicrous. I was prepared to be persuasive, touching, and hortatory, admonitory and expostulating, if need be vituperative even, indignant and sarcastic; but what the devil does a mentor do when the sinner makes no bones about confessing his sin? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience,</b> since my own practice {{has always been to}} deny everything.|$|R

During her childhood years, Coffin and her mother lived with relatives in Geneva, New York. She found the beautiful scenery of the area, set in the Finger Lakes of upper New York state, an inspiration; she later wrote, [...] "even as a small girl, I loved the country, not so much gardens and growing things, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> with these [...] [...] [...] but simply the great outdoor world." ...|$|R

I was not bad at math, I just could not seem {{to find a way}} to make it {{interesting}} or exciting. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> trouble understanding the purpose of math and how it was applicable to my own life. Word problems were my worst enemy; I appreciated the attempt to make math seem relatable, but never saw the use. Many of these problems involved building or buying something; topics <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> with in elementary school.

She felt her qualification for that position derived from her experience as a regulator rather than any expertise with charities; [...] "My main contact charities has been through volunteering - <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> personally of working for charities. I don't think I had a very well developed {{sense of what the}} Charities Bill was going to do, so I can't describe myself as a charities expert in any sense", and therefore spent her early months in the post absorbing information about the sector.|$|E

I gave them fuel to fight back.With their {{constant}} persuasion and offers for money, they made me write a quote saying that everything was fine. Of course everything was fine for me, because I had the money they had given me. What can you expect, I was dead poor before, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> with business.

5000|$|In 1976, Urquhart {{married the}} Canadian visual artist Tony Urquhart. At the time, Tony Urquhart had four {{children}} from a previous marriage, so the couple’s early years together were filled with children and family life. Jane Urquhart speaks of the time: [...] "It was great...we were all sort of the same age...I'd <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> with children so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> with disciplining children which meant that I didn't {{know how to do}} it. I was the youngest in my family. And so my role in relation to them was never very clearly defined and, as a result, we were just able to develop kind of a friendship." [...] The necessity of being at home, especially when her own daughter Emily was born in 1977, contributed to her writing, and she allowed herself to schedule writing time every day.|$|R

And, being too early, I walked a little to and fro, looking at all those my partners in this matter of the purification of Society. Prosecutors, witnesses, officials, policemen, detectives, undetected, pressmen, barristers, loafers, clerks, cadgers, jurymen. And <b>I</b> remember <b>having</b> something of the feeling that one has when one looks into a sink without holding one's nose. There was such uneasy hurry, so strange a disenchanted look, a sort of spiritual dirt, about all that place, and there were--faces!

Regarding his initial scepticism over working alongside Hval, he noted: [...] "I come from the noise, underground, contemporary, and improvised music scenes, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> making pop music. It didn’t make sense {{to ask me to}} produce to a pop album. Jenny’s a very smart person, and she obviously saw something in me that I didn’t realize that I had." [...] On working with Marhaug, Hval noted, [...] "Lasse relates to sound in an abstract way. That’s a better {{way to look at it}} than as individual songs because many times you end up with an illusion that can’t be broken. Looking at the album as a whole and then putting holes in it means you have these bits of reality peaking through. I love those moments." ...|$|R

She received a BA in Political Science from York University in 1971. After graduation, she toured Europe, worked as a cocktail waitress and began writing poetry. Anxious {{to get away from}} Toronto, Lill moved north to Kenora, Ontario in 1977 where she worked as a mental health consultant. [...] "That was a silly job for me because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>I</b> wasn't that type of person," [...] Lill told an interviewer later. [...] "But I did it for six months, basically trying to ascertain whether a Canadian Mental Health Association would be useful in Northern Ontario. Well, that's sort of like saying, 'Would an aspirin be useful in Bangladesh?'" [...] Lill concluded there were already 44 associations in Kenora, none of them effective in dealing with the socio-economic problems that resulted in alcoholism and violence.|$|R
2500|$|Williams hired {{producer}} Keith Crouch and R group Somethin' for the People to {{work with}} Norwood, and within eight months the team crafted Brandy. A collection of street-oriented rhythm-and-blues with a hip hop edge, whose lyrical content embraced her youthful and innocent image in public, Norwood later summed up the songs on the album as young and vulnerable, stating, [...] "I didn’t really know a lot—all I {{wanted to do was}} basically sing. You can just tell that it’s a person singing from a genuine place, and also a place of basically <b>no</b> <b>experience.</b> I was singing about being attracted to the opposite sex, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> behind it." [...] Released in September 1994, the album peaked at number twenty on the U.S. Billboard 200. Critical reaction to Brandy was generally positive, with AllMusic writer Eddie Huffman declaring Brandy [...] "a lower-key Janet Jackson or a more stripped-down Mary J. Blige [...] with good songs and crisp production." [...] Anderson Jones of Entertainment Weekly asserted, [...] "Teen actress Norwood acts her age. A premature effort at best, that seems based on the philosophy 'If Aaliyah can do it, why can't I?'." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{sat down}} in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's chair, and became fascinated by the dismal {{atmosphere}} of the place. I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else's disadvantage, as his master <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> wondered how many other clerks there were up-stairs, and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home. Of course <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>experience</b> of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.|$|R
