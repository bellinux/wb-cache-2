25|$|When {{it came to}} {{punishment}} {{there were}} straightforward rules. If you did not aid the community then you were seen as an enemy to the band. The way that they disciplined people was also straight forward. If you <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> your punishment would be public shame and ridicule. When the band depends so much on each other, this kind of punishment {{would have been one}} that was hard to deal with.|$|E
2500|$|Poles {{used for}} public ridicule are usually called shame poles, and {{were created to}} embarrass {{individuals}} or groups for their unpaid debts or when they <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b> The poles are often placed in prominent locations and removed after the debt is paid or the wrong is corrected. Shame pole carvings represent the person being shamed.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Sun Ra's {{songs with}} words {{featured}} lyrics that although simple, were inspirational and philosophical. The most famous example was [...] "Space Is the Place!" [...] Another example was {{the song that}} went, [...] "You made a mistake. You <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b> Make another mistake, and do something right!" [...] Sometimes (typically {{at the end of}} a set) the entire Arkestra snaked out through the audience, playing and chanting something like this.|$|E
2500|$|John Johnston, {{a son of}} James, {{devised a}} test for the witch, {{something}} no one outside his family would know, asking the entity what his Dutch step-grandmother in North Carolina {{would say to the}} slaves if she thought they <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b> The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, [...] "Hut tut, what has happened now?" [...] On another occasion, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family the entity had visited his family in England and apologized for his skepticism.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to recognize when grief has turned into something more serious, thus mandating contacting a medical professional. Grief can result in depression or alcohol- and drug-abuse and, if left untreated, it can become severe enough to impact daily living. It recommends contacting a medical professional if [...] "you can’t deal with grief, you are using excessive amounts of drugs or alcohol, you become very depressed, or you have prolonged depression that interferes with your daily life." [...] Other reasons to seek medical attention may include: [...] "Can focus on little else but your loved one’s death, have persistent pining or longing for the deceased person, have thoughts of guilt or self-blame, believe that you <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> or could have prevented the death, feel as if life isn’t worth living, have lost your sense of purpose in life, wish you had died along with your loved one." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and {{subsequently}} missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities. Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal {{during the rest of}} the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview [...] "Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b> I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game." [...] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a [...]500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.|$|E
2500|$|On another occasion, when Cao Pi {{was out on}} {{a hunting}} excursion, the fences built to trap the deer in an {{enclosed}} area were not properly secured so the deer broke through the fences and escaped. Cao Pi was so furious that he drew his sword and wanted to execute his servants. Su Ze knelt down and pleaded with him to spare the servants, saying, [...] "Your Majesty, I heard that the sage-rulers of ancient times would not harm people {{for the sake of}} animals. Now, Your Majesty wishes to promote the culture of Yao's time, yet Your Majesty wants to execute so many people just because a hunting excursion went wrong. I don't think this is something Your Majesty should do. With my life, I beg Your Majesty to spare these people." [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "You're a subject who speaks his mind." [...] He then spared all his servants. Since then, Cao Pi became more wary of Su Ze because he knew that Su Ze would not hesitate to speak up and criticise him if he <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Said Zev Buffman, a Broadway {{producer}} and financier for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, [...] "When Andy {{was at the}} theater, he was a joy. But he wasn't there enough," [...] adding that of the five people to play Joseph up to that point, Gibb was the best actor. He also said after Gibb's death, [...] "We'd lose him over long weekends. He'd come back on Tuesday, and he'd look beat. He was like a little puppy – so ashamed when he <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong.</b> He was all heart, but he didn't have enough muscle to carry through." [...] An unnamed co-star in Dreamcoat was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{he spent most of}} his time in his hotel room in front of the TV. I guess he was frightened and insecure. That's what happens when you're the baby brother of the Bee Gees." [...] Commenting after Gibb's death, Solid Gold producer Brad Lachman stated, [...] "... was a very charming, vulnerable and charismatic performer. He clearly meant well. He wasn't being difficult. He was going through problems he couldn't deal with. He wanted everyone to love him. He had so much going for him, and he just couldn't believe it." ...|$|E
