5|$|Sewage outfalls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are {{proposed}} {{to be completely}} stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> are not fed by streams, and the {{evaporation}} rate of <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> in <b>the</b> hot desert climate exceeds {{the rate at}} which rainwater refills them. <b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> are fed by underground water percolating through <b>the</b> rocks and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b> <b>The</b> high {{evaporation rate}} produces brackish water in <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trout is {{abundant}} in the waters. There have been attempts to introduce <b>the</b> Brook trout <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b> <b>The</b> higher <b>lakes</b> drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower ones due to their step-like situation.

5|$|Studies of {{the water}} quality of the lake in 1983–84 {{indicate}} a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as seepage and diffused runoff, also add to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO3–N and NH4–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|The small {{water courses}} that flow {{radially}} {{from the northern}} direction <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> which are seasonal streams, abound in lichens. Mosses are found but are more prevalent on {{the northern end of}} Poseidon Lake. In the region as a whole, 23 species of lichens and six moss species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{soil and}} {{topography}} in the catchment are predominantly sandy with very low water retention capacity. The land use {{pattern in the}} Pushkar valley that drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> comprises 30% of the area under shifting sand dunes, 30% under hills (degraded and barren) and streams and 40% of the area is agricultural.|$|E

5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
5|$|A story {{tells of}} a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition.

Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.|$|E
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD to tap <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due {{to the threat of}} the Quagga mussel, an invasive species that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> In addition, discrepancies between shell and other organic material ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{well known}} for trout fishing from its banks and the fleet of 18 rowing boats for hire. The suction tanks which {{originally}} supplied water to the steam boilers for the pumping engines are now used as rearing pools for the fish before they are transferred <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> On average 50,000 trout are reared at Blagdon each year by Bristol Water to stock this and surrounding lakes such as Chew Valley Lake and the Barrow Tanks.|$|E
5|$|Topographically, Scarborough is {{dominated}} by two watersheds, Highland Creek and the Rouge River. Highland Creek lies almost entirely within Scarborough and occupies approximately 70% of its total area. It occupies the western half of Scarborough, while the Rouge River flows through the eastern portion. Both of these rivers flow into Lake Ontario on Scarborough's shore. Due {{to the location of}} the Lakeshore CN railway right-of-way, both river deltas are constricted to narrow channels where they flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E
