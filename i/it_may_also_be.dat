5|$|While {{much care}} work is {{performed}} in the home, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> done for pay. As such, feminist economics examine its implications, including the increasing involvement of women in paid care work, the potential for exploitation, and effects {{on the lives of}} care workers.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
50|$|The QY10's {{sequencer}} data {{is maintained}} by an internal back-up battery, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> stored externally by transferring it to a suitable device (e.g. a MIDI equipped computer).|$|R
50|$|It can be {{associated}} with digitalis toxicity. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> due to onset of acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, conduction system diseases with enhanced automaticity, or administration of theophylline.|$|R

5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> {{related to}} the Three-Chapter Controversy, a phase in the Chalcedonian controversy.|$|R

5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive {{piercing}} and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as a culturally binding ritual. But {{at the same time that}} piercing can be culturally binding, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> a means of rebellion, particularly for adolescents in Western cultures.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> relevant in achieving haemostasis during trauma surgery.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{following}} season but the modus remained the same for the 1943-44 edition, suggesting <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> the same in 1942-43.|$|R
50|$|Located 95 km {{down the}} Ohio River to the {{southwest}} of the westernmost Fort Ancient settlements were the Middle Mississippian culture peoples of the Prather Complex. This stretch of river was an empty buffer zone, possibly for social or political reasons, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> because the narrowing of the alluvial valley between the Falls of the Ohio region near Louisville, Kentucky and {{the mouth of the}} Miami River at Cincinnati, Ohio made it less suitable for the intensive maize agriculture practiced by both societies.|$|R
50|$|Heele County was {{a county}} of the extralegal United States Territory of Jefferson that existed from November 28, 1859, until February 28, 1861. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> known as Steele County.|$|R
5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion, {{a variety of}} {{phenomena}} may occur, including novae and Type Ia supernovae. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> a super-soft x-ray source if {{it is able to}} take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface. A close binary system of two white dwarfs can radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves, causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge.|$|E
5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, C. graminis {{is widespread}} from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> found in central Asia and China. In Russia {{it may be}} found in the tundra zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany it is rare in one district, endangered in another.|$|E
50|$|This stout body may {{implicate}} {{a preference}} for dense or mixed habitats although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> similar to the extant jaguar with its range from forest to open range including wetland.|$|R
5000|$|A Norwegian loop is {{an element}} made out of two elements: a dive loop, then an Immelmann; forming an {{inversion}} that looks like two side by side loops. This element {{is similar to the}} flying coasters pretzel loop, except that the train goes through a twist when entering and exiting the loop. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> seen as a normal loop entered from the top. It was first introduced on Speed Monster in TusenFryd, Norway. Other examples of a Norwegian Loop can be found on Hersheypark's roller coaster Fahrenheit and Helix at Liseberg ...|$|R
50|$|The {{organization}} <b>is</b> <b>also</b> {{responsible for}} the suppression and cover-up regarding the Mayfair family's fiasco concerning the Taltos birth anomaly. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> responsible for covering the burning of the Théâtre des Vampires.|$|R
5|$|In overt primary {{hypothyroidism}}, TSH {{levels are}} high and T4 and T3 levels are low. Overt hypothyroidism may also be diagnosed in {{those who have a}} TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T4. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|Silver(I) sulfide, Ag2S, is very readily {{formed from}} its {{constituent}} elements {{and is the}} cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous Ag+ ions. Many non-stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> {{placed in}} Proterocosma, {{but this was}} usually {{considered}} a subgenus of Stagmatophora in earlier times. As it seems, though, Proterocosma is not particularly closely related to either Stagmatophora or Anatrachyntis.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the rosyface chub {{includes}} the Saluda, Savannah, and Altamaha river drainages. It is mostly found above the fall line in these drainages. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> introduced to the Chattahoochee River system.|$|R
50|$|The preceptory {{served as}} an {{administrative}} centre for the lands held by the Templars in the south west of England and Cornwall. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> used to train men and horses for the Crusades.|$|R
5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Surgery may {{be useful}} in those with a herniated disc that is causing {{significant}} pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of bowel control. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> useful in those with spinal stenosis. In the absence of these issues, there is no clear evidence of a benefit from surgery.|$|E
5|$|Syphilis is most {{commonly}} spread through sexual activity. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria {{can also be}} detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.|$|E
50|$|First {{successful}} in-place {{analysis of}} another planet. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>been</b> the first space probe to impact {{the surface of}} another planet, although {{it is unclear whether}} it reached Venus' surface.|$|R
5000|$|Eyes down - Avoiding eye contact, {{or looking}} down, {{can be a}} sign of {{submission}} or fear. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> indicate that someone feels guilt. However, depending on the culture of the person, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> just <b>be</b> a sign of respect.|$|R
5|$|In the mid- {{and late}} 1950s, {{the attitudes and}} {{institutions}} of McCarthyism slowly weakened. Changing public sentiments heavily contributed to the decline of McCarthyism. <b>Its</b> decline <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> charted {{through a series of}} court decisions.|$|R
