5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large <b>intestine</b> is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small <b>intestine</b> lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the <b>intestine</b> may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} inside {{the base of the}} crown of tentacles but to one side. The gut runs from the mouth {{to one side of the}} stomach, in the bottom of the ampulla. The <b>intestine</b> runs from the stomach, up the other side the body, and exits at the anus, outside and a little below the crown of tentacles. The gut and <b>intestine</b> are both {{supported}} by two mesenteries (partitions that run the length of the body) connected to the body wall, and another mesentery connects the gut to the <b>intestine.</b>|$|E
5|$|As other rays, {{spotted eagle}} rays are host {{to a variety}} of parasites. Internal parasites include the gnathostomatid {{nematode}} Echinocephalus sinensis in the spiral <b>intestine.</b> External parasites include the monocotylid monogeneans Decacotyle octona, Decacotyle elpora and Thaumatocotyle pseudodasybatis on the gills.|$|E
2500|$|Animal <b>intestines</b> have {{multiple}} uses. [...] From each species of livestock {{that is a}} source of milk, a corresponding rennet is obtained from the <b>intestines</b> of milk-fed [...] [...] Pig and calf <b>intestines</b> are eaten, and pig <b>intestines</b> are used as sausage casings. Calf <b>intestines</b> supply calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP), and are used to make goldbeater's skin.|$|R
50|$|Internationally, gopchang {{could be}} {{compared}} to chitterlings (pork small <b>intestines)</b> or Latin American chunchullo (beef, pork, or lamb small <b>intestines).</b> The Spanish/Portuguese term tripas or the English tripe also occasionally refer to small beef <b>intestines,</b> attesting to the practice consuming animal <b>intestines</b> as a truly world-wide phenomenon.|$|R
50|$|Catgut {{is a type}} of cord that is {{prepared}} from the natural fibre found in the walls of animal <b>intestines.</b> Catgut makers usually use sheep or goat <b>intestines,</b> but occasionally use the <b>intestines</b> of cattle, hogs, horses, mules, or donkeys. Despite the name, catgut manufacturers do not use cat <b>intestines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small <b>intestine).</b> It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|Chelating agents {{can have}} adverse effects; for example, {{chelation}} therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc. Chelating agents taken orally {{can increase the}} body's absorption of lead through the <b>intestine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small <b>intestine).</b> This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small <b>intestine</b> may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E

5|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of cabbage {{may lead to}} increased intestinal gas which causes bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small <b>intestine</b> cannot digest.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small <b>intestine</b> (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small <b>intestine,</b> where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large <b>intestine</b> where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E

40|$|Alimentary tract {{morphology}} and {{its relationship}} with diet was examined in three coral reef fish families: Labridae, Chaetodontidae and Pomacentridae. Convergent patterns of dietary‐related morphological variation were evident across the three families, with corallivores possessing long and narrow <b>intestines,</b> carnivores relatively short and wide <b>intestines</b> and herbivores relatively long and wide <b>intestines.</b> Between‐family differences were also evident: chaetodontids typically possessed long and narrow <b>intestines,</b> pomacentrids long and wide <b>intestines</b> and labrids generally possessed short and wide <b>intestines.</b> Overall, intestinal length variation was most strongly attributable to diet, whilst intestinal diameter varied most widely among families. Relative intestinal length appears as a useful predictor of dietary variation, particularly within families. Relative intestinal diameter appears as a less reliable measure, but rather, a useful adjunct to intestinal length comparisons...|$|R

5|$|Mulder and a {{group of}} police search for Lewton's remains. Scully sees blood {{dripping}} on Mulder's face from above and, upon looking up, they see a portion of Lewton's <b>intestine</b> hanging from a tree. Scully, about to perform an autopsy on the <b>intestine,</b> is interrupted when Mona suddenly calls and reports that Bilac was under the influence of Yaje. At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a toilet lid, she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the MADH4 gene {{is usually}} {{associated}} with juvenile polyposis, and detection of such a mutation would indicate a need to screen the patient and affected relatives for polyps and tumors of the large <b>intestine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} the gut, and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small <b>intestine,</b> leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium. The triple protein coats make them resistant to the acidic pH of the stomach and the digestive enzymes in the gut.|$|E

25|$|The {{small and}} large <b>intestines</b> may be {{affected}} by infectious, autoimmune, and physiological states. Inflammation of the <b>intestines</b> is called enterocolitis, which may lead to diarrhoea.|$|R
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep <b>intestine</b> can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb <b>intestine</b> has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, {{and later to}} the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large <b>intestine</b> or lungs. It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that Andalusians {{experience}} ischaemic (reduced blood flow) diseases of the small <b>intestine</b> at a rate significantly higher than other breeds; and stallions had higher numbers of inguinal hernias, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater than other breeds. At the same time, they also showed a lower incidence of large intestinal obstruction. In {{the course of the}} study, Andalusians also showed the highest risk of laminitis as a medical complication related to the intestinal issues.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{epidermal}} growth factor (EGF) on neonatal <b>intestines</b> were examined in the rat. In 5 -day-old rats, sucrase, trehalase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) activities in the small <b>intestines</b> were significantly increased after subcutaneous injection of EGF for 3 days (1 microgram/rat/day). gamma-GTP activity was also accelerated after oral EGF administration (2 micrograms/rat/day). Small <b>intestines</b> of 12 -day-old rats injected with EGF for 10 days (1 microgram/rat/day) were significantly heavier than those of controls. These results suggest that EGF influences neonatal growth improving enlargement and functional development of their <b>intestines.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in manganese absorption from the <b>intestine,</b> and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the <b>intestine,</b> lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|Although the tested {{potatoes}} {{were not}} a commercial variety and not {{intended for human consumption}} a contract was signed with Cambridge Agricultural Genetics, which included a profit-sharing agreement, if potatoes developed using this technology were approved and released commercially. In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded that they did not significantly affect growth, despite some hypertrophy of the small <b>intestine</b> and a slight decrease of gut enzyme activity.|$|E
