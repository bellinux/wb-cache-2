5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance</b> in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E

40|$|Many {{governments have}} {{recognised}} {{the necessity of}} banning <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> in {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (EEE) to prevent harm to people and the environment. This has resulted in legislation such as the Eu RoHS Directive on the restriction of use of certain <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances.</b> However, the substitution of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> in EEE may provoke manifold unwanted side-effects, such as increased energy consumption in production and increased losses of scarce metals. In some cases, there are no potential substitutes that can provide the same mechanical and chemical properties as the <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> found in EEE. Therefore this chapter argues for a more differentiated and holistic approach, hence, taking into account the actual environmental and health risks related to the use of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> compared with the substitutes, as well as more eco-efficiency-oriented measures to achieve a result that contributes to sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|This {{report was}} {{conducted}} {{on behalf of the}} regional coordination function regarding <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances.</b> The report deals with the presence of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> at industrial facilities and on carriage by road and rail but also the municipal fire brigades and other relevant authorities' ability to manage accidents involving <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> in the County of Norrbotten. <b>Substances</b> with <b>hazardous</b> properties are handled in large quantities. The carriage of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> are made by road, rail, sea and air. Transport by road is the most frequent way to carry dangerous goods on land. In Sweden severe incidents involving <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> are rare but still occur each year. To minimize the risks of harm to people, environment and property the operation of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> are surrounded by laws and regulations. This framework is designed to minimize the risks involved in manufacturing, operations and transportation of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances.</b> Because of the large-scale industries <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> are handled extensively in Norrbotten. Large quantities of explosive and oxidizing substances are handled by the mining industry in the municipalities of Gällivare and Kiruna. Corrosive acids, bases and peroxides are handled in the paper pulp mills in Piteå and Kalix while large amounts of petroleum products are handled in the port of Luleå and Piteå, but also occurs throughout the country. To what extent, amount and frequency, <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> are transported to, from and within the county by road is currently not defined. Because of this, carriage of all classes of dangerous goods can not be excluded to occur. Flammable liquids, oxidizing agents and flammable gases are the most frequent carriage of dangerous goods by rail. However, <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> from almost all hazard classes, except radioactive materials, were carried by rail in 2010. The locations that are recipients or senders of dangerous goods is Piteå, Luleå, Haparanda, Gällivare and Kiruna where Luleå and Haparanda receiving and dispatching the most dangerous goods. The rescue services’ ability to manage accidents involving <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> differs between the municipalities in the county. Though a risk status of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> within the county not yet have been established, required capacity can’t be expressed. To meet a suitable contingency, an identification of the presence of <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> in the County of Norrbotten is required. The information about the carriage of dangerous goods is incomplete and outdated. Therefore hold neither the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, the County Administrative Board nor the local rescue services the accurate knowledge about the situation. A national level effort is required to tackle the problem. The county is today suffering from a lack of capacity in the preventative work since accurate planning information can not be presented by, or to, the local governments.

25|$|On March 8, 2010, Norfolk Southern Railway Company {{agreed to}} pay $4 million penalty to resolve alleged {{violations}} of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and hazardous materials laws for a 2005 chlorine spill in Graniteville, S.C. Under the settlement filed {{in federal court in}} Columbia, S.C., Norfolk Southern will be required to pay a civil penalty of $3,967,500 for the alleged CWA violations, to be deposited in the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The alleged CWA violations, included in an amended complaint filed in March 2009, are for the discharge of tons of chlorine, a <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance,</b> from a derailed train tank car and thousands of gallons of diesel fuel from ruptured locomotive engine fuel tanks. For the alleged Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) violation for failure to immediately notify the National Response Center of the chlorine release, Norfolk Southern will pay a penalty of $32,500, to be deposited in the <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Substance</b> Superfund. Under the terms of the agreement, Norfolk Southern will provide incident command system training to environmental and transportation personnel; stock nearby Langley Pond with at least 3,000 fish to replace fish killed by the chlorine spill; and post the telephone number for the National Response Center to facilitate spill reporting. Further, the settlement includes a supplemental environmental project (SEP) valued at $100,000 to plant vegetation along the banks of Horse Creek to decrease erosion and sedimentation, thereby improving water quality in Horse Creek.|$|E

25|$|The {{reactivity}} that {{is responsible}} for many of ethylene oxide's hazards also make it useful. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. These products include detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as ethylene glycol, ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers, and other compounds. Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance.</b> At room temperature it is a flammable, carcinogenic, mutagenic, irritating, and anaesthetic gas.|$|E
500|$|When {{mephedrone}} was rediscovered in 2003, it was {{not specifically}} illegal to possess in any country. As its use has increased, many countries have passed legislation making its possession, sale and manufacture illegal. It was first made illegal in Israel, {{where it had been}} found in products such as Neodoves pills, in January 2008. After the death of a young woman in Sweden in December 2008 was linked to the use of mephedrone, it was classified as a <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance</b> a few days later, making it illegal to sell in Sweden. In June 2009, it was classified as a narcotic with the possession of 15grams or more resulting in a minimum of two years in prison—a longer sentence, gram for gram than given for the possession of cocaine or heroin. In December 2008, Denmark also made it illegal and through the Medicines Act of Finland, it was made illegal to possess without a prescription. In November 2009, it was classified as a [...] "narcotic or psychotropic" [...] substance and added to the list of controlled substances in Estonia and made illegal to import into Guernsey along with other legal highs, before being classified as a Class B drug in April 2010. It was classified as a Class C drug in Jersey in December 2009.|$|E
