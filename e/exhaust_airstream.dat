5000|$|Throughout {{the cooling}} season, {{the system works}} to cool and {{dehumidify}} the incoming, outside air. This is accomplished by the system taking the rejected heat and sending it into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream.</b> Subsequently, this air cools the condenser coil at a lower temperature than if the rejected heat had not entered the <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream.</b> During the heating seasons, the system works in reverse. Instead of discharging the heat into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream,</b> the system draws heat from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream</b> in order to pre-heat the incoming air. At this stage, the air passes through a primary unit and then into a space. With this type of system, it is normal, during the cooling seasons, for the exhaust air to be cooler than the ventilation air and, during the heating seasons, warmer than the ventilation air. It {{is for this reason}} the system works very efficiently and effectively. The [...] Coefficient of Performance (COP) will increase as the conditions become more extreme (i.e., more hot and humid for cooling and colder for heating).|$|E

The thermal behaviour of the system proposed, essentially consisting of a counterflow, three-fluid type, wet surface heat exchanger, where outside air is cooled simultaneously by humidified exhaust air and dehumidified supply air to be heated before its introduction into the ambient, is studied through a specifically developed finite-difference numerical model. Simulations are executed for different outdoor air and supply air psychrometric states relevant to typical summer climatic conditions, {{as well as for}} several values of the air-passage width, mean air velocity and heat exchanger length, whose influence on the {{cooling performance}} of the system discussed is pointed out. The numerical results obtained are expressed in terms of correlations among dimensionless parameters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric analysis using a numerical {{model of a}} new concept in desiccant and evaporative air conditioning. The concept consists of two stages: a liquid desiccant dehumidifier and a dew-point evaporative cooler. Each stage consists of stacked air channel pairs separated by a plastic sheet. In the first stage, a liquid desiccant film removes moisture from the process (supply-side) air through a membrane. An evaporatively-cooled <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream</b> {{on the other side}} of the plastic sheet cools the desiccant. The second-stage indirect evaporative cooler sensibly cools the dried process air. We analyze the tradeoff between device size and energy efficiency. This tradeoff depends strongly on process air channel thicknesses, the ratio of first-stage to second-stage area, and the second-stage exhaust air flow rate. A sensitivity analysis reiterates the importance of the process air boundary layers and suggests a need for increasing airside heat and mass transfer enhancements...|$|E
40|$|Air-to-air {{membrane}} energy exchangers (MEEs) are attracting increasing attention {{as one of}} the most important novel trends in heat and energy recovery exchangers for heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. In MEEs, simultaneous heat and moisture transfer through the selectively permeable membrane reduces the energy consumed for heating, cooling, dehumidifying or humidifying the ventilation air. In cold climates, the moisture transfer from the warm and humid <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream</b> to the cold and dry supply air lowers the dew point of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream.</b> Consequently, condensation and frost initiates at lower outdoor air temperatures compared to sensible-only heat exchangers. Frosting may be reduced or even prevented when the exhaust air is sufficiently dried by the moisture recovery in the MEE. However, the metrics of MEEs for avoiding frosting in cold climates are less known and explained in the literature. The main objective of the thesis is to explore the feasibility of the {{membrane energy}} exchanger for cold climates with respect to frosting limits, performance of the quasi-counter-flow MEE and to further explain heat and mass transfer processes in MEEs. In order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the frost-tolerant characteristic and the performance of the membrane energy exchanger in cold operating conditions, MEEs and other heat/energy recovery exchangers applied in cold climates are compared. The frosting limit models for the cross-flow and the quasi-counter-flow MEEs were theoretically developed and experimentally verified through this work. The frost-free operating conditions of the membrane energy exchanger was analyzed through parametric analyses on the frosting limit model. A quasi-counter-flow membrane energy exchanger was designed and constructed. This configuration combines the easy sealing of cross-flow headers and the high effectiveness nature of a counter-flow core. The performance under cold operating conditions of the quasi-counter-flow membrane energy exchanger filled with spacer was analyzed and tested. The conjugate heat and mass transfer through the membrane energy exchanger for various membranes in cold climates were investigated. The convective heat and mass transfer were examined under developing and fully developed flow regimes for open channel and the spacer-filled MEEs. The permeation or diffusion through the dense or the porous membranes were investigated for cold operating conditions. The frosting limits for cross-flow and quasi-counter-flow MEEs have been mathematically developed and experimentally verified. Based on the results and analyses in the thesis, it can be confirmed that the membrane energy exchanger tends to lower the outdoor air temperatures which initiate onset of frosting, compared to sensible-only heat exchangers. Both thermal and hydraulic performance of the quasi-counter-flow MEE under cold operating conditions were investigated. The quasi-counter-flow arrangement is able to provide relatively high sensible and latent effectivenesses. This flow arrangement may be an ideal alternative to the widely-used cross-flow exchangers. The heat and mass transfer in the MEE are more complex and boundary conditions may be different from sensible-only heat exchangers. However, most classic knowledge and data of heat exchangers tend to be applicable to MEEs under some conditions...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern with air and odor {{emissions}} from agricultural facilities. A supplementary research project was conducted to complement the U. S. National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17 -month period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine finisher facility. Samples from a representative <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstream</b> at each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, guaiacol, phenol, 4 -methylphenol, 4 -ethylphenol, 2 -aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole, dimethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAV), defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor threshold for that compound. The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low: hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, butyric acid, isovaleric acid). The dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and in addition diethyl disulfide was ranked second at one dairy site, while ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a good predictor of odor concentration (R 2 = 0. 16 to 0. 52), underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, isovaleric acid, ammonia, and diethyl disulfide are the most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methyl phenol, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid are the most likely contributors to dairy odors...|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} demand for energy demand {{reduction}} in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, a novel design incorporating a heat recovery device into a wind tower was proposed. The integrated system uses a rotary thermal wheel for heat recovery {{at the base of}} the wind tower. A 1 : 10 scale prototype of the system was created and tested experimentally in a closed-loop subsonic wind tunnel to validate the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) investigation. Wind towers have been shown to be capable of providing adequate ventilation in line with British Standards and the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) guidelines. Despite the blockage of the rotary thermal wheel, ventilation rates were above recommendations. In a classroom with an occupancy density of 1. 8 m 2 /person, the wind tower with rotary thermal wheel was experimentally shown to provide 9 L/s per person at an inlet air velocity of 3 m/s, 1 L/s per person higher than recommended ventilation rates. This is possible with a pressure drop across the heat exchanger of 4. 33 Pa. In addition to sufficient ventilation, the heat in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstreams</b> was captured an...|$|R
40|$|Rotary air-to-air energy {{exchangers}} (also called energy wheels) transfer both {{heat and}} moisture between supply and <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstreams</b> in buildings. In this thesis, it is {{hypothesized that the}} transient step response characteristics of an energy wheel are uniquely related to the steady-state cyclic response of the wheel. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to study the transient response of a humidity/temperature sensor and measure energy wheel performance with a new test procedure that uses only transient response characteristics. In this thesis, the transient characteristics of a humidity/temperature sensor and an energy wheel to a step change in relative humidity and temperature are investigated through two types of measurements. One test uses a small airflow, at controlled temperature and humidity conditions, passing through a small section of a porous wheel while measuring the outlet conditions after the inlet conditions are suddenly changed. For a step input, it is shown that the outlet humidity/temperature sensor data correlate with an exponential function with two time constants. Since the transient response characteristics of the humidity/temperature sensor must be known to predict the response of the wheel alone, a second test is required that is similar to the first test except that the wheel is removed. This test is used to obtain the transient response of the sensor alone. Data from these tests show that both the sensor and the sensor plus wheel have two sets of two time constants. An analysis is presented to determine the transient response of the wheel alone using the correlated properties of the sensor alone and the sensor with a wheel upstream. The challenge undertaken in this research was the development of a more flexible, lower cost test facility than that presented in ASHRAE Standard 84 - 1991 (Method of Testing Air-to-Air Heat Exchangers). In future work, this new laboratory experimental test facility should be adapted to test most types of energy wheels. The configuration allows a wide range of mass flow rates, inlet supply air temperatures and relative humidities. Uncertainty analysis is used for each transient test for the sensors and air-to-air energy wheels to specify the sensor and wheel plus sensor characteristics. This uncertainty analysis shows that accurate sensor calibration under equilibrium conditions and the start time for the humidity sensor step change is crucial to achieve low uncertainties in the transient behaviour of sensor and energy wheels. Knowing the uncertainty in the characteristics of the sensors and the wheel plus sensors the uncertainty in the transient response of the wheel alone is predicted. The first time constant of the humidity sensor is found to be about 3 seconds, while the second time constant is found to be about 100 seconds. It is found that the predicted response of the wheel alone gives time constants that are about 6 seconds and 140 seconds. Other researchers can use this information presented in this thesis to estimate the effectiveness of an energy wheel...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, several {{possible}} liquid desiccants (aqueous solutions of LiCl, LiBr, MgCl 2 and CaCl 2) are investigated {{to find the}} most appropriate working fluid to be used in a run-around membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE). The liquid desiccant {{is one of the main}} components of the RAMEE and indirectly conditions the outdoor ventilation air by using the energy of the exhaust air, significantly reducing the building energy consumption. Numerical simulations, in this thesis, show that the total effectiveness of the RAMEE changes less than 0. 5 % when different salt solutions are used. However, the capital and operational costs of the RAMEE are significantly different for different desiccants. MgCl 2 is the most inexpensive among the selected salt solutions and is followed by CaCl 2, LiBr and LiCl. The price of a LiCl solution in the RAMEE is almost 20 times more than the price of MgCl 2 solution. Different thermo-physical properties of the salt solutions result in different pumping energy consumptions for each specific salt solution. For example, the pumping energy consumption for a MgCl 2 solution is 3. 5 times more than for a LiBr solution in the RAMEE. The change in the volume of the liquid desiccant throughout a year is another characteristic which depends on the thermo-physical properties of the salt solution. Solutions with larger volume expansion require larger storage tanks and will experience longer transient delays. The difference between the volume expansions of different salt solutions is less than 5 % of the total solution volume. MgCl 2 solution expands more than 17 % throughout a yearly operation of the system in Saskatoon. Crystallization of the salt solution is another important parameter in the selection of the liquid desiccant. Simulations show that, for a specific indoor and outdoor operating condition the risk of crystallization is greatest for MgCl 2, followed by CaCl 2, LiCl and LiBr. The risk increases as the supply or <b>exhaust</b> <b>airstreams</b> become dryer. For a cross flow RAMEE with a total effectiveness of 55 % (NTU= 10 and Cr*= 3) operating in a building with indoor RH of 50 %, the critical outdoor humidity below which crystallization will begin to occur is 28 % RH for MgCl 2, 20 % for CaCl 2 and 0 %RH for LiCl and LiBr. According to the simulations, all four investigated salt solutions can be used in North America (except the states of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Texas) with no risk of crystallization when the indoor humidity is 50 % RH. However, with indoor humidity of 30 % MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 solutions will have risk of crystallization for a large number of hours in a year in most of the central western United States. A mixture of 50 % LiCl and 50 % MgCl 2 solution is suggested to be used when the cost-effective MgCl 2 solution cannot be used due to crystallization issues. The price of this newly suggested mixture is 30 % less than that of a pure LiCl solution and can be used in all North American climates with very small risk of crystallization...|$|R
