However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being <b>good</b> <b>parents</b> is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor.

40|$|Background Parenting {{quality is}} {{important}} in child development. In the presence of HIV poverty and life stress, parenting may be challenged and child development affected. Methods This study examines cross-sectional associations of situational factors such as poverty, mental health, HIV status, living with a biological parent, and stigma with <b>good</b> <b>parenting</b> and child outcomes (n= 989; age= 4 - 13 years) within the Child Community Care study (South Africa and Malawi). A parenting measure was created from 10 variables comprising 6 child and 4 parent ratings. These were highly correlated. Total parenting score was generated on a 10 point continuous scale, with a <b>good</b> <b>parenting</b> cut off then defined as >= 8 {{out of a possible}} 10. Results Five factors were associated with <b>good</b> <b>parenting.</b> Positively associated with <b>good</b> <b>parenting</b> were being the biological parent of the child, parental mental health and dwelling in households with multiple adults. Poverty and stigma were negatively associated with <b>good</b> <b>parenting.</b> Using multiple mediation analysis, a positive direct effect of <b>good</b> <b>parenting</b> was found on child self-esteem, child behaviour and educational risks with a partial mediation via child depression and trauma. Conclusions These data highlight possible intervention points. Influences on parenting could be seen through being the biological parent, parental mental health, poverty and stigma. In these challenging environments, health, nutrition, mental health, education, and treatment to keep parents alive are all clearly identified as potential pathways to ensure child well-being. 19 </p...|$|R

40|$|Defining <b>parenting,</b> and <b>good</b> <b>parenting</b> in particular, is {{a complex}} task wrought with ambiguities.

To address this lack of consensus, the current study explored the convergence and divergence of different professional groups 2 ̆ 7 opinions on <b>good</b> <b>parenting.</b> A mixed-methods design was employed, with semi-structured interviews and rating scales administered to 19 professionals with experience in parenting capacity assessments.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{caretaker}} in parenting is the biological parent(s) {{of the child}} in question, although others may be an older sibling, a grandparent, a legal guardian, aunt, uncle or other family member, or a family friend. Governments and society may {{have a role in}} child-rearing as well. In many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent blood relations.
