5000|$|Penny is {{the second}} studio album by Austrian-born singer Penny McLean {{released}} in 1977. Three solo singles were released before the album launched: Nobody's Child, Zwischen Zwei Gefühlen and Dance, Bunny <b>Honey,</b> <b>Dance,</b> but only the last one {{was included in the}} final track list. At the same time, Penny also sang on Silver Convention, and the group's single: [...] "The Boys from Liverpool" [...] was released, after that she announcing her departure from the group. The album wasn't as successful as her previous release, and managed to chart only in Sweden. Reviews for the album were mixed, and its second single (Mambo Mama) didn't chart anywhere.

Results of the method are demonstrated with real oscillatory motions showing the viability of a structured categorical framework. 1. Introduction Many communicative behaviors throughout the animal kingdom consist of performing and recognizing specialized patterns of motion.

40|$|Abstract The waggle <b>dance</b> of the <b>honey</b> bee is used {{to recruit}} nest mates to a resource. Dancer bees, however, may {{indicate}} many directions within a single dance bout; we show that this scatter in <b>honey</b> bee <b>dances</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} the sensory modality used to determine a reference angle in the dance. Dances with a visual reference are more precise than those with a gravity reference. This finding undermines the idea that scatter is introduced into dances, which the bees could perform more precisely, in order to spread recruits out over resource patches. It also calls into question reported interspecific differences that had been interpreted as adaptations of the dance to different habitats. Our results support a non-adaptive hypothesis: that dance scatter results from sensory and performance constraints, rather than modulation of the scatter by the dancing bee. However, an alternative adaptive hypothesis cannot be ruled out...|$|R

He hears {{a knock at the}} door, and opens it for Bosko, the hero of the picture. Blown in by the wind, Bosko latches on to the sergeant's trousers; so intense is the wind that the sergeant cannot seem to close the door, and Bosko is so buffeted by the gust that the sergeant's pants follow him to the wall. Once the door is closed, the sergeant angrily confronts his inferior, who, embarrassed, hands the trousers back. But on to business! The sergeant shows Bosko a wanted poster bearing the legend [...] "$5000 reward" [...] and [...] "Dead or Alive." [...] "That's your man," [...] growls the sergeant. Out into the cold and wind goes Bosko alone. Three dogs on a sled await their master, two of a proper size, one tiny. Bosko boards his chariot and yells [...] "Mush!". The dogs thunder across the snowy hills, their legs sometimes extending to accommodate the valleys rather than their bodies simply descending and ascending with the steep slopes. The party crashes into the side of a saloon; the dogs are so tangled as to have become as one, and a disoriented Bosko sits uselessly on the cold ground for a few moments as they collect their bearings. We come with Bosko to the front entrance of the saloon and see again the poster shown to Our Hero by the sergeant. A nervous Bosko spit-shines his badge, readies two revolvers, and enters the bar. Within, <b>Honey</b> <b>dances</b> and scats to the delight of the patrons.

40|$|The {{orientation}} of <b>honey</b> bee <b>dances</b> {{is affected by}} the earth's magnetic field. Honey bees possess localized, well-oriented, stable and superparamagnetic domains of magnetite. Four lines of evidence suggest that the superpara-magnetic domains of bees {{are more likely to be}} involved in magnetic field detectors than the stable domains. (1) Although the stable domains vary widely in size and number between bees, approximately 2 X io 8 superpara-magnetic domains are found reliably in all bees, and are restricted to the relatively narrow size range of 300 - 350 A. This suggests that the superpara-magnetic domains are more likely to have a biological function. (2) Be-havioural observations of dances in null fields are difficult to reconcile with a stable-domain detector but are clearly predicted by many superpara-magnetic detector models. (3) When honey bees are demagnetized, their ability to orient to the earth's field is unaffected. This suggests that the detector either utilizes the superparamagnetic domains or depends on aligned anisotropic stable domains processed without regard to magnetic polarity. (4) Bees that have only superparamagnetic domains are able nevertheless to orient to the earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon which indicates that permanent domains may not be required for detection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Temporal {{segmentation}} {{of human}} motion into plausible motion primitives {{is central to}} understanding and building computational models of human motion. Several issues contribute {{to the challenge of}} discovering motion primitives: the exponential nature of all possible movement combinations, the variability in the temporal scale of human actions, and the complexity of representing articulated motion. We pose the problem of learning motion primitives as a temporal clustering one, and derive an unsupervised hierarchical bottom-up framework called hierarchical aligned cluster analysis (HACA). HACA finds a partition of a given multidimensional time series into m disjoint segments such that each segment belongs to one of k clusters. HACA combines kernel k-means with the generalized dynamic time alignment kernel to cluster time series data. Moreover, it provides a natural framework to find a low-dimensional embedding for the time series. HACA is efficiently optimized with a coordinate descent strategy and dynamic programming. Experimental results on motion capture and video data demonstrate the effectiveness of HACA for segmenting complex motions and as a visualization tool. We also compare the performance of HACA to state-of-the-art algorithms for temporal clustering on data of a <b>honey</b> bee <b>dance.</b> The HACA code is available online.

40|$|<b>Honey</b> bee <b>dance</b> {{communication}} {{is a classic}} form of animal behavior, with over 70 years of intense study. In this chapter, we first discuss conceptually {{how it is possible}} to dissect dance communication into simpler behavioral modules for neurogenomics analysis, based on information from prior ethological studies of dance behavior and a rapidly advancing functional analysis of the insect brain. We then review recent studies that have used this conceptual approach and new genomic tools to begin to explore neurogenomic and neurochemical aspects of dance communication, highlighting the following findings. Comparative transcriptomic studies of specific brain regions across Apis species that differ in dance behavior have implicated genes involved in the geotactic and odometric elements of dance, and genes involved in learning and memory systems and the circadian clock as important modulators of dance output. This research also has identified distinct patterns of gene expression in different brain regions that provide additional hints about the regulation of dance behavior. Pharmacological studies with octopamine and related compounds have demonstrated the role of the reward system in modulating the likelihood that a bee will dance upon returning from a foraging trip. The results of these early studies provide a foundation for a more comprehensive molecular dissection of dance behavior and suggest that the mechanisms regulating dance communication involve evolutionary reuse and adaptation of neuromolecular systems that control elements of solitary behavior. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In {{groups of}} cooperatively {{foraging}} individuals, communication may improve the group’s performance by directing foraging effort {{to where it}} is most useful. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) use a specialized dance to communicate the location of floral resources. Because <b>honey</b> bees <b>dance</b> longer for more rewarding resources, communication may shift the colony’s foraging effort towards higher quality resources, and thus narrow the spectrum of resource types used. To test the hypothesis that dance communication changes how much honey bee colonies specialize on particular resources, we manipulated their ability to communicate location, and assessed the relative abundance of different pollen taxa they collected. This was repeated across five natural habitats that differed in floral species richness and spatial distribution. Contrary to expectation, impairing communication did not change the number or diversity of pollen (resource) types used by individual colonies per day. However, colonies with intact dance communication were more consistent in their resource use, while those with impaired communication {{were more likely to}} collect rare, novel pollen types. This suggests that communication {{plays an important role in}} shaping how much colonies invest in exploring new resources versus exploiting known ones. Furthermore, colonies that did more exploration also tended to collect less pollen overall, but only in environments with greater floral abundance per patch. In such environments, the ability to effectively exploit highly rewarding resources may be especially important–and dance communication may help colonies do just that. This coul...|$|R

50|$|The quorum {{sensing process}} in honey bees {{is similar to}} the method used by Temnothorax ants in several ways. A small portion of the workers leave the swarm to search out new nest sites, and each worker assesses the quality of the cavity it finds. The worker then returns to the swarm and {{recruits}} other workers to her cavity using the <b>honey</b> bee waggle <b>dance.</b> However, instead of using a time delay, the number of dance repetitions the worker performs is dependent {{on the quality of the}} site. Workers that found poor nests stop dancing sooner, and can therefore be recruited to the better sites. Once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number (usually 10-20 bees) has been reached, they return to the swarm and begin using a new recruitment method called piping. This vibration signal causes the swarm to take off and fly to the new nest location. In an experimental test, this decision-making process enabled honey bee swarms to choose the best nest site in four out of five trials.|$|R

Our results show that the direction component conveys 2. 9 bits and the distance component 4. 5 bits of information, which agrees to some extent with Haldane and Spurway's estimates that were based on data gathered by von Frisch. Of course, these are small amounts of information compared to what can be conveyed, given enough time, by human language, or compared to what is routinely transferred via the internet. Nevertheless, small amounts of information can be very valuable if it is the right information.

40|$|Honey bee foragers use a "waggle dance" {{to inform}} nestmates about {{direction}} and distance to locations of attractive food. The sound and air flows generated by dancer's wing and abdominal vibrations have been implicated as important cues, but the decoding mechanisms for these dance messages are poorly understood. To understand the neural mechanisms of <b>honey</b> bee <b>dance</b> communication, we analyzed {{the anatomy of}} antenna and Johnston's organ (JO) in the pedicel of the antenna, {{as well as the}} mechanical and neural response characteristics of antenna and JO to acoustic stimuli, respectively. The honey bee JO consists of about 300 - 320 scolopidia connected with about 48 cuticular "knobs" around the circumference of the pedicel. Each scolopidium contains bipolar sensory neurons with both type I and II cilia. The mechanical sensitivities of the antennal flagellum are specifically high in response to low but not high intensity stimuli of 265 - 350 Hz frequencies. The structural characteristics of antenna but not JO neurons seem to be responsible for the non-linear responses of the flagellum in contrast to mosquito and fruit fly. The honey bee flagellum is a sensitive movement detector responding to 20 nm tip displacement, which is comparable to female mosquito. Furthermore, the JO neurons have the ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information of acoustic stimuli including the "waggle dance" sound. Intriguingly, the response of JO neurons was found to be age-dependent, demonstrating that the dance communication is only possible between aged foragers. These results suggest that the matured honey bee antennae and JO neurons are best tuned to detect 250 - 300 Hz sound generated during "waggle dance" from the distance in a dark hive, and that sufficient responses of the JO neurons are obtained by reducing the mechanical sensitivity of the flagellum in a near-field of dancer. This nonlinear effect brings about dynamic range compression in the honey bee auditory system...|$|R

We tested the hypothesis that tremble followers and waggle followers exhibit the same dance-following behavior. If correct, this could unify our understanding of dance following, provide insight into dance information transfer, and offer a way to identify the signal receivers of tremble dance information. Followers showed similar initial attraction to and tracking of dancers. However, waggle dancers were faster than tremble dancers, and follower-forward, -sideways, and -angular velocities were generally similar to the velocities of their respective dancers. Waggle dancers attracted followers from 1. 3 -fold greater distances away than tremble dancers. Both follower types were attracted to the lateral sides of dancers, but tremble followers were more attracted to the dancer's head, and waggle followers were more attracted to the dancer's abdomen. Tremble dancers engaged in 4 -fold more brief food exchanges with their followers than waggle dancers. The behaviors of both follower types are therefore relatively conserved. Researchers can now take the next steps, observing tremble followers to determine their subsequent behaviors and testing the broader question of whether follower attraction and tracking is conserved {{in a wide range}} of social insects...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{analysis}} of temporal data {{is a task}} of utmost importance for intelligent machines. For example, ubiquitous computing systems {{need to understand the}} intention of humans from the stream of sensory information, and health-care monitoring systems can assist patients and doctors by providing automatically annotated daily health reports. 	 We present a set of extensions of switching linear dynamic systems (SLDSs) which provide the ability to capture the higher-order temporal structures within data and to produce more accurate results for the tasks such as labeling and estimation of global variations within data. The presented models are formulated within a dynamic Bayesian network formulation along with the inference and learning methods thereof. First, segmental SLDSs (S-SLDSs) produce superior labeling results by capturing the descriptive duration patterns within each LDS segment. The encoded duration models describe data more descriptively and allow us to avoid the severe problem of over-segmented labels, which leads to superior accuracy. Second, parametric SLDSs (P-SLDSs) allows us to encode the temporal data with global variations. In particular, we have identified two types of global systematic variations : temporal and spatial variations. The P-SLDS model assumes that there is an underlying canonical model which is globally transformed in time and space by the two associated global parameters respectively. Third, we present hierarchical SLDSs (H-SLDSs), a generalization of standard SLDSs with hierarchic Markov chains. H-SLDSs are able to encode temporal data which exhibits hierarchic structure where the underlying low-level temporal patterns repeatedly appear among different higher-level contexts. The developed SLDS extensions have been applied to two real-world problems. The first problem is to automatically decode the <b>dance</b> messages of <b>honey</b> bee <b>dances</b> where the goal is to correctly segment the dance sequences into different regimes and parse the messages about the location of food sources embedded in the data. The second problem is to analyze wearable exercise data where we aim to provide an automatically generated exercise record at multiple temporal and semantic resolutions. It is demonstrated that the H-SLDS model with multiple layers can be learned from data, and can be successfully applied to interpret the exercise data at multiple granularities. Ph. D.

40|$|Bees {{are well}} known {{for their ability to}} {{pollinate}} a diverse range of plants. In the process of gathering food (pollen and nectar), bees transfer pollen from one flower to another, facilitating reproduction. I investigate two important aspects of foraging: pollination of an important crop by native bees and communication of floral resources by social bees. Native bees that pollinate apples are an economically important and potentially limited resource. Native bees are often overlooked since orchard growers traditionally rely on managed honey bees for pollination. Given their potential to ameliorate the deficit of honey bee pollinators, it is important to identify the suite of apple pollinators in New York State, the life history of each native bee group in relation to apple pollination, and to promote their occurrence in and around apple orchards. In order to facilitate visiting flowers, collecting nectar and pollen, and pollinating crops, honey bees have a language that conveys information from a recent foraging trip. This communication maximizes colony-level foraging efficiency and is achieved by a complex dance language. An interesting phenomenon in the dance language is the presence of distance-dependent error; precision increases as food-source distance increases. Here, I investigate three hypotheses for why there is imprecision within dances. Bees may be constrained, either physically or physiologically, to high precision for nearby food sources. Alternately, there may be an adaptive value to scattering recruits over a larger area. Direction indicated within dances is gleaned from the sun?s azimuth, but the extent to which to sun?s position influences the precision of dances is unclear. Here, I test the hypothesis that error encoded in dances changes throughout the day. 	 Through a series of seminal experiments, Karl von Frisch decoded the <b>honey</b> bee?s <b>dance</b> language. Since then, it has been widely accepted that there are two distinct types of dances: the round dance and the waggle dance and that they convey different information. Here I show that distance and direction information appears to be encoded in the same manner in both forms, suggesting {{that there is only one}} recruitment signal, the adjustable waggle dance...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{presence}} of geomagnetic sensitivity has been suspected {{for a long time}} in a variety of marine and terrestrial animals, many responses reported in the literature have been based on extensive statistical analysis of orientation results or rely on obscure behavioral activities (like cetacean strandings or <b>honey</b> bee waggle <b>dances.)</b> None of these reports have yet approached the level of clarity and simplicity displayed in experiments with the magnetotactic bacteria, which is the best example of geomagnetic sensitivity in any living organism. Furthermore, claims of magnetic effects on living organisms pervade the literature of biomagnetism, but many have failed subsequent attempts at replication. We need to develop simple and easily replicated experiments for marine and terrestrial animals which can be modified to answer basic questions concerning the psychophysics of any geomagnetic sensory system which might be present. In this paper, we report the first replication of the Walker-Bitterman magnetic anomaly conditioning experiment in honey bees, as well as one of our attempts to slightly alter their basic protocol. We also report our attempts to condition honey bees to magnetic direction in simple maze experiments, and the initial results of a pulse-remagnetization experiment designed to test the ferromagnetic transduction hypothesis. We conclude honey bees are sensitive to the geomagnetic field, that the signal processing for it is more complex than previously thought, and that a ferromagnetic transducer is compatible with all known behavioral data...|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} and {{uses of the}} <b>honey</b> bee waggle <b>dance</b> {{have come a long}} way since its discovery by Karl von Frisch in the 1940 s. It is now used as a powerful research tool for investigating various features of honey bee biology. Manual dance decoding is time-consuming. It is impractical to decode all circuits of a dance to determine foraging location; however, intra-dance waggle runs vary, so it is important to decode enough to obtain a good average. In chapter 2 I examine the variation among waggle runs made by foraging bees to devise a method of dance decoding. The first and last waggle runs within a dance are significantly more variable than any waggle run in between. We recommend that any four consecutive waggle runs, not including the first and last runs, may be decoded. This thesis also examines how artificially moving hives affects the foraging efficiency of colonies that are moved and whether it has any effect on resident colonies (Chapter 3). We moved three colonies (in observation hives) onto the University of Sussex campus from a site more than 20 km away and compared their foraging efficiency to three similarly sized resident colonies. Foraging distance, forager effort, nectar concentration, percentage of successful nectar foragers were the factors used to quantify foraging efficiency. We found that bringing new hives onto the apiary site had no effect on the foraging efficiency of the resident colonies that moved colonies were able to match the foraging efficiency of resident colonies immediately after the move...|$|R
