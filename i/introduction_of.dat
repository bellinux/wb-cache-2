5|$|The <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> {{the euro}} {{has led to}} {{extensive}} discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in {{the population of the}} eurozone that the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro to do so.|$|E

5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration {{of the possibility of}} the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E
