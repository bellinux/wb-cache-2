50|$|Arterial {{elastance}} (Ea) is {{a measure}} of arterial load and is calculated as the simple ratio of ventricular <b>end-systolic</b> pressure to stroke volume.|$|E
50|$|Several {{parameters}} can {{be calculated}} for each loop (e.g. end-diastolic pressure, <b>end-systolic</b> pressure, ejection and filling intervals, contractility index, stroke volume, and ejection fraction).|$|E
5000|$|<b>End-systolic</b> volume (ESV) is {{the volume}} of blood in a {{ventricle}} {{at the end of}} contraction, or systole, and the beginning of filling, or diastole.|$|E
50|$|In cardiology, the {{performance}} of the ventricles are measured with several volumetric parameters, including end-diastolic volume (EDV), <b>end-systolic</b> volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (Ef).|$|E
50|$|This is a {{narrowing}} of the mitral valve orifice when the valve is open. Mitral stenosis impairs LV filling {{so that there}} is a decrease in end-diastolic volume (preload). This leads to a decrease in stroke volume by the Frank-Starling mechanism and a fall in cardiac output and aortic pressure. This reduction in afterload (in particular, aortic diastolic pressure) enables the <b>end-systolic</b> volume to decrease slightly but not enough to overcome the decline in end-diastolic volume. Therefore, because end-diastolic volume decreases more than <b>end-systolic</b> volume decreases, the stroke volume decreases.|$|E
50|$|Stroke volume (SV) is {{the volume}} of blood ejected by the right/left {{ventricle}} in a single contraction. It {{is the difference between}} the end-diastolic volume (EDV) and the <b>end-systolic</b> volume (ESV).|$|E
50|$|ESV is {{the lowest}} volume {{of blood in the}} {{ventricle}} at any point in the cardiac cycle.The main factors that affect the <b>end-systolic</b> volume are afterload and the contractility of the heart.|$|E
50|$|The {{constant}} backflow {{of blood}} through the leaky mitral valve implies {{that there is}} no true phase of isovolumic contraction. Since the afterload imposed on the ventricle is reduced, <b>end-systolic</b> volume can be smaller than normal.|$|E
50|$|<b>End-systolic</b> {{pressure}} volume relationship (ESPVR) describes the maximal pressure {{that can be}} developed by the ventricle at any given LV volume. This implies that the PV loop cannot cross over the line defining ESPVR for any given contractile state.|$|E
50|$|More importantly, other {{interesting}} parameters {{are derived from}} series of loops obtained under changing conditions. For example, the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) and <b>end-systolic</b> pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) are derived from series of loops obtained by slowly inflating a balloon to occlude the inferior vena cava, a procedure that reduces cardiac preload.|$|E
50|$|The {{slope of}} ESPVR (Ees) {{represents}} the <b>end-systolic</b> elastance, which provides {{an index of}} myocardial contractility. The ESPVR is relatively insensitive to changes in preload, afterload, and heart rate. This makes it an improved index of systolic function over other hemodynamic parameters like ejection fraction, cardiac output, and stroke volume.|$|E
50|$|Functionally, the Anrep effect {{allows the}} heart to {{compensate}} for an increased <b>end-systolic</b> volume present and the decreased stroke volume that occurs when aortic blood pressure increases. Without the Anrep effect, an increase in aortic blood pressure would create a decrease in stroke volume that would compromise circulation to peripheral and visceral tissues.|$|E

50|$|End {{systolic}} volume {{can be used}} clinically as {{a measurement}} of the adequacy of cardiac emptying, related to systolic function. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, the <b>end-systolic</b> volume will be seen {{at the end of}} the T wave. Clinically, ESV can be measured using two-dimensional echocardiography, MRI (magnetic resonance tomography) or cardiac CT (computed tomography)or SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography).|$|E
50|$|The {{progression}} {{of heart failure}} is associated with left ventricular remodeling, which manifests as gradual increases in left ventricular end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> volumes, wall thinning, and a change in chamber geometry to a more spherical, less elongated shape. This process is usually associated with a continuous decline in ejection fraction. The concept of cardiac remodeling was initially developed to describe changes {{that occur in the}} days and months following myocardial infarction.|$|E
5000|$|Premature {{ventricular}} contraction causes early emptying of {{the left}} ventricle (LV) into the aorta. Since the next ventricular contraction occurs at its regular time, the filling time for the LV increases, causing an increased LV end-diastolic volume. Due to the Frank-Starling mechanism, the next ventricular contraction is more forceful, leading to the ejection of the larger than normal volume of blood, and bringing the LV <b>end-systolic</b> volume back to baseline.|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} for TIC after {{treatment of the}} underlying tachyarrhythmia is generally good. Studies show that left ventricular function often improves within 1 month of treatment of the tachyarrhythmia, and normalization of the left ventricular ejection fraction occurs {{in the majority of}} patients by 3 to 4 months. In some patients however, recovery of this function can take greater than 1 year or be incomplete. In addition, despite improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction, studies have demonstrated that patients with prior TIC continue to demonstrate signs of negative cardiac remodeling including increased left ventricular <b>end-systolic</b> dimension, <b>end-systolic</b> volume, and end-diastolic volume. Additionally, recurrence of the tachyarrhythmia in patients with a history of TIC has been associated with a rapid decline in left ventricular ejection fraction and more severe cardiomyopathy that their prior presentation, which may be a result of the negative cardiac remodeling. There have also been cases of sudden death in patients with a history of TIC, which may be associated with worse baseline left ventricular dysfunction. Given these risks, routine monitoring with clinic visits, ECG, and echocardiography is recommended.|$|E
50|$|In {{cardiovascular}} physiology, {{stroke volume}} (SV) is {{the volume of}} blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat. Stroke volume is calculated using measurements of ventricle volumes from an echocardiogram and subtracting {{the volume of the}} blood in the ventricle {{at the end of a}} beat (called <b>end-systolic</b> volume) from the volume of blood just prior to the beat (called end-diastolic volume). The term stroke volume can apply to each of the two ventricles of the heart, although it usually refers to the left ventricle. The stroke volumes for each ventricle are generally equal, both being approximately 70 mL in a healthy 70-kg man.|$|E
5000|$|By definition, {{the volume}} of blood within a {{ventricle}} immediately before a contraction {{is known as the}} end-diastolic volume (EDV). Likewise, {{the volume of}} blood left in a ventricle at the end of contraction is <b>end-systolic</b> volume (ESV). The difference between EDV and ESV represents a ratio between the ventricles full and emptied. This ratio allows many variables such as stroke volume (SV) and Cardiac Output (CO). SV describes the volume of blood ejected from the right and left ventricles with each heartbeat. Ejection fraction is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected with each beat; that is, it is stroke volume (SV) divided by end-diastolic volume (EDV): ...|$|E

50|$|During diastole, the {{ventricular}} pressure {{falls from}} the peak reached {{at the end of}} systole. When this pressure falls below the atrial pressure, atrio-ventricular valves open (mitral valve at left side and tricuspid valve at right side) and the blood passes from the atria into the ventricles. First, ventricles are filled by a pressure gradient but near the end, atria contract (atrial kick) and force more blood to pass into ventricles. Atrial contraction is responsible for around 20% of the total filling blood volume. (In atrial fibrillation, this additional 20% filling volume is lost and the patient may experience systolic heart failure symptoms). Complete left ventricular filling is essential to maintain maximum cardiac output. Left ventricular filling is dependent upon ventricular relaxation and compliance, mitral valve area, atrio-ventricular gradient, atrial contraction and <b>end-systolic</b> volume. Diastole has four phases: isovolumetric relaxation, rapid filling, diastasis and atrial contraction. All of these phases can be evaluated by Doppler echocardiography.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} to {{what extent}} cardiac MRI derived measurements of right ventricular (RV) volumes using the left ventricular (LV) <b>end-systolic</b> and end-diastolic frame misrepresent RV <b>end-systolic</b> and end-diastolic volumes in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) and a right bundle branch block. METHODS: Sixty-five cardiac MRI scans of patients with ToF and a right bundle branch block, and 50 cardiac MRI scans of control subjects were analyzed. RV volumes and function using the <b>end-systolic</b> and end-diastolic frame of the RV were compared to using the <b>end-systolic</b> and end-diastolic frame of the LV. RESULTS: Timing of the RV <b>end-systolic</b> frame was delayed compared to the LV <b>end-systolic</b> frame in 94 % of patients with ToF and in 50 % of control subjects. RV <b>end-systolic</b> volume using the RV <b>end-systolic</b> instead of LV <b>end-systolic</b> frame was smaller in ToF (median - 3. 3 ml/m(2), interquartile range - 1. 9 to - 5. 6 ml/m(2); p< 0. 001) and close to unchanged in control subjects. Using the RV instead of LV <b>end-systolic</b> and end-diastolic frame hardly affected RV end-diastolic volumes in both groups and ejection fraction in control subjects (54 ± 4 %, both methods), while increasing ejection fraction from 45 ± 7 % to 48 ± 7 % for patients with ToF (p< 0. 001).

Ejecting beats were compared with isovolumic beats having the same volume as at end systole. While holding <b>end-systolic</b> volume constant, various stroke volumes, including negative stroke volumes (volume injected during systole), were imposed using a predetermined volume command. After switching contraction mode between ejecting and isovolumic, we measured the immediate and steady changes in <b>end-systolic</b> pressure. In the first isovolumic beat after switching from steady-state ejecting beats, the change in <b>end-systolic</b> pressure was variable, depending on the stroke volume. The <b>end-systolic</b> pressure of the ejecting beat exceeded that of the isovolumic beat on average by up to 18 mm Hg with small stroke volume, but the ejecting <b>end-systolic</b> pressure became lower than isovolumic with either large stroke volume (stroke volume/end-systolic volume < 0. 96) or with negative stroke volume.

40|$|A hemodynamic-radionuclide {{study was}} {{performed}} to compare the relations between <b>end-systolic</b> pressure and volume in {{the left and right}} ventricles in 10 patients with biventricular failure, and to correlate the <b>end-systolic</b> pressure-volume slope with baseline variables of systolic function. During nitroprusside or nitroglycerin infusion, or a combination of both, linear relations were found between <b>end-systolic</b> pressure and volume for both ventricles. In 9 of 10 patients, the <b>end-systolic</b> pressure-volume slope was greater for the left ventricle (mean ± SD 1. 12 ± 0. 36 mm Hg·m 2 /ml) than for the right ventricle (0. 46 ± 0. 27 mm Hg·m 2 /ml) (p < 0. 001). In all 10 patients, the volume-axis intercept of the pressure-volume relation was greater for the left ventricle (82 ± 66 ml/m 2) than for the right ventricle (2 ± 30 ml/m 2) (p < 0. 005). Right ventricular pressure-volume slope corre- lated weakly with baseline right ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0. 69, p < 0. 05), strongly with the baseline right ventricular <b>end-systolic</b> pressure-volume ratio (r = 0. 89) and inversely with baseline right ventricular <b>end-systolic</b> volume (r = − 0. 86).

The left ventricle of excised cross-circulated canine hearts was fitted with a water-filled balloon. The balloon was connected to a hydraulic pump that allowed the ventricle to contract to a preset constant <b>end-systolic</b> volume (19 - 37 ml) from a variable end-diastolic volume. At each of control, enhanced, and depressed levels of contractility, differences of <b>end-systolic</b> pressures of steady state isovolumic and ejecting contractions were evaluated while stroke volume and velocity of ejection were widely varied.

40|$|The linear {{dimensions}} of the ventricle of an in situ perfused trout heart were measured with an ultrasound scanner. Using a pyramidal model, linear dimensions taken from real-time, two-dimensional, echotomographic images of the ventricle were used to calculate ventricular end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> volumes and, by the difference between them, stroke volumes for various filling and output pressures. Stroke volumes calculated from the ultrasound measurements were significantly correlated with actual stroke volumes determined from cardiac output and heart rate and had a regression line slope close to one. Increases in stroke volume with greater filling pressures resulted from increased ventricular end-diastolic volume with constant <b>end-systolic</b> volume; <b>end-systolic</b> volumes were negligible. Maintenance of stroke volume with increasing output pressure was by increases in both end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> volumes.
