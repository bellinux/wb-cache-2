6000|$|... "Either {{hold your}} tongue or <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story," [...] cried the warrior king, in whose mind these remarks awakened disagreeable family reflections.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so," [...] said Edward, [...] "you, whom I {{have heard}} say {{so many things}} which {{no one else could}} say, or dared to say--you, who have <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{laughing}} assurance in your own powers of pleasing, shrink from trying that power when a noble and generous heart might be saved by it. You have been willing to venture a great deal for the sake of amusing yourself and winning admiration; but you dare not say a word for any high or noble purpose. Do you not see how you confirm what I said of the selfishness of you women?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} you young men. I don't {{see why you}} need be ashamed to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the Course <b>with</b> <b>your</b> wife in her carriage, Clive," [...] remarks the Colonel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{it not be}} well {{to carry}} him to the steps of San Stefano?" [...] said Romola. [...] "We shall cease then to stop up the street, and you can <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> way <b>with</b> <b>your</b> bier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{look forward}} to the pleasure, then," [...] Sabatini concluded. [...] "Now I will leave you to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> money-coining. Au revoir!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Must you, dear?" [...] she said. [...] "Can't you {{reconcile}} it to yourself--to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work of mercy, {{of saving}} poor folks' lives?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want {{neither the}} one nor {{the other from}} any one,' said she, 'and {{certainly}} not from you of all creatures. <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> report.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never you mind," [...] said Mr. Kybird, {{who was not}} in a {{position}} to satisfy his curiosity--"never you mind. You <b>go</b> and get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> work, Charles, and p'r'aps by the time your moustache 'as grown big enough to be seen, you'll 'ear something." ...|$|R
50|$|Following The Vestibule, Moosh and Twist {{released}} Back to the Basement, {{their fourth}} mixtape, on March 12, 2013. The project featured production from producers such as DK and Logic's in-house producer 6ix.

From the 2000 season <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to compete <b>with</b> <b>your</b> long-time partner, Peter Gartmayer, where they {{remained}} until 2005. In 2004 Gartmayer/Nowotny obtained the qualification for the 2004 Summer Olympics, in Athens, but they lost all their games in the group stage and did not advance to the medal round.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I can't say,' the Gnat replied. 'Further on, in {{the wood}} down there, they've got no names--however, <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> list of insects: you're wasting time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you can <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> painting," [...] {{said the}} will in him. [...] "Or {{else you can}} beget children. They both carry on her effort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For goodness' sake, Lottie, don't <b>go</b> <b>on</b> again <b>with</b> <b>your</b> usual absurdities. Since you {{are bent}} on being an artist, and your Popper has consented and put you {{under the most}} {{expensive}} master in Paris, the least {{you can do is}} to follow the rules. And I dare say he only wanted you to 'sink the shop' in company. It's such horrid bad form for you artistic people to be always dragging out your sketch-books. What would you say if your Popper came over here, and began to examine every lady's dress in society to see what material it was, just because he was a big dry-goods dealer in America?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} afraid his courage will fail him. I will see him again, {{and bring him}} up with me: but now, my dear Mr. Armsworth, do {{remember}} one thing; that if you <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> him at <b>your</b> usual rate of hospitality, the man will as surely be drunk, as his nerves and brain are all but ruined; {{and if he is}} so, he will most probably destroy himself to-morrow morning." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Either {{hold your}} tongue, fellow, or <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story," [...] cried the Raja, wearied out {{by so many}} words that had no manner of sense.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{likes the}} fire," [...] {{explained}} Withers. [...] "Whenever {{he comes to}} Kayenta he always visits me like this.... Don't mind him. <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “And she so wealthy,” Therese <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> “Even you <b>with</b> <b>your</b> dear generous little heart can {{do nothing}} for our Rita. No man can do {{anything}} for her—except perhaps one, but she is so evilly disposed towards him that she wouldn’t even see him, if in the goodness of his forgiving heart he were to offer his hand to her. It’s her bad conscience that frightens her. He loves her more than his life, the dear, charitable man.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{ask your}} pardon,' said Will stoutly; 'you do not {{understand}} my meaning. As to whether I have ever loved you or not, I must leave that to others. But for one thing, my feeling is not changed; and for another, you may make it your boast that you have made my whole life and character something {{different from what they}} were. I mean what I say; no less. I do not think getting married is worth while. I would rather you <b>went</b> <b>on</b> living <b>with</b> <b>your</b> father, so that I could walk over and see you once, or maybe twice a week, as people go to church, and then we should both be all the happier between whiles. That's my notion. But I'll marry you if you will,' he added.|$|R
60|$|Connected {{with this}} Second Law Reform, and indeed {{partially}} {{a source of}} it, or provocation to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> it, mending <b>your</b> speed, there is one little Lawsuit, called the MILLER ARNOLD CASE, which made an immense noise in the world, and is still known by rumor to many persons, who would probably be thankful, as certainly I myself should, for some intelligible word on it. In regard to which, and to which alone, in this place, we will permit ourselves a little more detail.|$|R
6000|$|... "Make {{yourself}} quite easy, mother," [...] said Willie; [...] "I'll {{explain it}} all presently. Just <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> knitting, and don't put {{yourself into a}} state." ...|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, {{before the}} day broke, Dinarzade said to her sister, [...] "Dear sister, if you are awake I pray you to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|E

6000|$|So our Cockney Jefferies proceeds, {{presently}} coming upon a cinder path. They use cinders a {{lot about}} Sutton, to make country paths with; it gives you an unexpected surprise {{the first time it}} occurs. You drop suddenly out of a sweetly tangled lane into a veritable bit of the Black Country, and <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> loathing in <b>your</b> soul for your fellow-creatures. There is also an abundance of that last product of civilisation, barbed wire. Oh that I were Gideon! with thorns and briers of the wilderness would I teach these elders of Sutton! But a truce to dark thoughts! ...|$|R
60|$|Nor {{let it be}} {{supposed}} that artists who possess minor degrees of imaginative gift need be embarrassed by the doubtful sense of their own powers. In general, when the imagination is at all noble, it is irresistible, and therefore those who can at all resist it ought to resist it. Be a plain topographer if you possibly can; if Nature meant you to be anything else, she will force you to it; but never {{try to be a}} prophet; <b>go</b> <b>on</b> quietly <b>with</b> <b>your</b> hard camp-work, and the spirit will come to you in the camp, as it did to Eldad and Medad, if you are appointed to have it; but try above all things to be quickly perceptive of the noble spirit in others, and to discern in an instant between its true utterance and the diseased mimicries of it. In a general way, remember it is a far better thing to find out other great men, than to become one yourself: for you can but become one at best, but you may bring others to light in numbers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] I interrupted, drawing {{myself up}} and animating my {{features}} to their full extent and speaking with a withering scorn {{that should have}} blasted {{the man on the}} spot. [...] "Listen! I came here for a photograph--a picture--something which (mad though it seems) would have looked like me. I wanted something that would depict my face as Heaven gave it to me, humble though the gift may have been. I wanted something that my friends might keep after my death, to reconcile them to my loss. It seems that I was mistaken. What I wanted is no longer done. <b>Go</b> <b>on,</b> then, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> brutal work. Take your negative, or whatever it is you call it,--dip it in sulphide, bromide, oxide, cowhide,--anything you like,--remove the eyes, correct the mouth, adjust the face, restore the lips, reanimate the necktie and reconstruct the waistcoat. Coat it with an inch of gloss, shade it, emboss it, gild it, till even you acknowledge that it is finished. Then when you have done all that--keep it for yourself and your friends. They may value it. To me it is but a worthless bauble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you'll <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> dinner,' said Tom, 'I'll {{tell you}} my reason the while. I mustn't eat myself, or I shall have no {{appetite}} for the chops.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heads, stay," [...] he said, [...] "Tails, go." [...] He {{opened his}} hand, {{and looked at}} the coin. [...] "Heads! Very good. <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> hocus-pocus, Doctor--I'll wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} him now," [...] said Billy Byrne. [...] "If he's alive that's all that counts--I haven't got his blood on my hands. <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 25. Then take a {{piece of}} smooth, but not glossy, Bristol board or {{pasteboard}}; divide it, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> pencil and rule, into squares as large as those of the very largest chess-board: they need not be perfect squares, only as nearly so as you can quickly guess. Rest the pasteboard on something sloping as much as an ordinary desk; then, dipping your brush into the color you have mixed, and taking up as much of the liquid as it will carry, begin at the top of one of the squares, and lay a pond or runlet of color along the top edge. Lead this pond of color gradually downwards, not faster at one place than another, but as if you were adding a row of bricks to a building, all along (only building down instead of up), dipping the brush frequently so as to keep the color as full in that, and in as great quantity on the paper, as you can, so only that it does not run down anywhere in a little stream. But if it should, never mind; <b>go</b> <b>on</b> quietly <b>with</b> <b>your</b> square till you have covered it all in. When you get to the bottom, the color will lodge there in a great wave. Have ready a piece of blotting-paper; dry your brush <b>on</b> it, and <b>with</b> the dry brush take up the superfluous color as you would with a sponge, till it all looks even.|$|R
6000|$|... "However, {{they all}} insisted on my {{having the same}} share as the rest. Uncle wanted me to take his hundred dollars and send them home to you with mine, but I told him that I would not do so, for I know you have money enough to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with,</b> even if <b>your</b> school has turned out a failure. So I {{think it would be}} as well for us to keep our money in hand for the present. There is never any saying what may happen; we may lose our horses and kit, and it would be very awkward if we hadn't the money to replace them. As soon as we get more we will send it off, as you know I always {{intended}} to do. I have still some left of what I brought out with me, but that and the two hundred dollars would not be more than enough to buy an entirely new outfit for us both.|$|R
6000|$|Very {{romantic and}} charming {{the arrival of}} your gallant George--from all across Europe--for his Xmas eve <b>with</b> you; <b>your</b> account of it touches me and I find myself ranking you with the celebrated fair of history and fable for whom the swimmings of the Hellespont and the breakings of the lance were perpetrated. I congratulate you on such a George in these {{for the most part}} merely [...] "awfully sorry" [...] days, and him on a chance of which he must have been awfully glad. And àpropos of such felicities--or rather of felicities pure and simple, and not quite such, I do heartily hope that you will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to Spain <b>with</b> <b>your</b> niece in the spring--I'm {{convinced}} that you'll find it a charming adventure. I've myself utterly ceased to travel--I'm a limpet now, {{for the rest of my}} life, on the rock of Britain, but I intensely enjoy the travels of my friends.|$|R
