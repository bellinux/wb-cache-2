40|$|In {{spite of}} {{existence}} {{of a number of}} works related to transient analysis of grounding systems in general, more detailled analysis of the influence of different parameters on their performance is available only for ground grid. In power distribution systems and in telecommunication installations, <b>ground</b> <b>rod</b> are widely used. All conclusion done in transient analysis for ground grids are not fully applicable for <b>ground</b> <b>rod.</b> Thus, complementary analysis of influence of some parameters on the transient performance of <b>ground</b> <b>rod</b> is of importance. This paper presents analysis of the influence of soil structure, <b>ground</b> <b>rod</b> length, buring depth, shape of current impulse that energises the <b>ground</b> <b>rod</b> and soil relative permittivity on TGPR.

50|$|Lightning {{protection}} {{is provided by}} bonding the multipoint ground grid {{to one or more}} <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> under or at the perimeter of the building, and then up to the lightning rods. If the building has significant metal framing elements, these should be bonded to the lightning <b>rods</b> and <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas with}} {{high-resistance}} soil, {{the resistance of}} the soil wastes energy. Another issue is that the resistance may be high enough that insufficient current flows into the earth neutral, causing the <b>grounding</b> <b>rod</b> to float to higher voltages. Self-resetting circuit breakers usually reset because of a difference in voltage between line and neutral. Therefore, with dry, high-resistance soils, the reduced difference in voltage between line and neutral may prevent breakers from resetting. In Australia, locations with very dry soils need the grounding rods to be extra deep.Experience in Alaska shows that SWER needs to be grounded below permafrost, which is high-resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary reason}} {{for the use of}} {{isolated}} grounds (IG) is to provide a noise-free ground return, separate from the equipment grounding (EG) return. The EG circuit includes all of the metal conduit, outlet boxes, and metal enclosures that contain the wiring and must be grounded to provide a safe return path in case of fault currents. The IG provides an insulated, separate ground path for the ground reference in electronic equipment, such as computers, hospital equipment, and audio equipment. IG does not break ground loops, which can damage equipment like computers, printers, etc.. Interconnected computer equipment often benefits from single-point grounding. IG is only used with special equipment that require it. The IG is typically insulated and separate {{all the way back to}} the point of earth <b>grounding</b> <b>rod</b> outside of the building. The IG is NOT connected neutral or any other. Due to the installation of a separate, insulated conductor and the associated special outlets required, IG circuits are more expensive to install than standard power circuits.|$|E

50|$|The Helicopter Support Team (HST) is {{a unit of}} {{organization}} within the United States Marine Corps that manages the activities of a helicopter landing zone (LZ). It consists {{of a team of}} eight Landing Support Marines who are trained to hook up external loads to the hooks of primarily military helicopters. All kinds of gear can be lifted by helicopter and taken to locations with terrain that is not suited for other kinds of vehicles. For example communications equipment can be placed on top of a mountain within a few minutes of flight instead of a few hours of driving, if one could even drive the equipment to the designated location. The HST is a valuable resource to the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF)), as it provides an expedient manner of transportation for gear and supplies. Within the HST there is the HST commander whose job is to coordinate the mission between the airwing, the supporting unit, and the Marine Logistics Group who provides the HST. The HST Commander is usually a Sergeant and sometimes a Staff Sergeant. Subordinate to the HST Commander is the HST Safety NCO, the job of the safety NCO is to ensure that the gear or supplies are rigged properly, and to ensure that everyone underneath the Helicopter are doing their job in a safe manner. The Safety NCO is normally a Corporal or Sergeant. The primary members of the HST are the Leg-men and the inside and outside directors along with the hookman and the Static Man. The inside and outside directors direct the pilot of the aircraft as he centers his helicopter over the load that is being lifted. The leg-men ensure that the slings used to lift the gear do not get caught on anything and lift in a straight manner as to not disturb the load being lifted. The job of the Static man is to use a <b>grounding</b> <b>rod</b> to attach to the hook so that the static electricity conducted by the helicopter is grounded out and does not end up killing a Marine. The Hook Man the hooks up the load to the hook of the aircraft in a safe manner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A test airport runway {{lighting}} system, including a buried cable {{protected by a}} counterpoise and vertical <b>ground</b> <b>rods,</b> was subjected to direct lightning strikes, and currents and voltages measured {{in different parts of}} the system were reported earlier by Bejleri et al. In this paper, we attempt to model the lightning interaction with this system using the transmission line theory. Lumped devices along the cable such as current regulator and transformers are ignored; possible nonlinear phenomena (arcing) in the system are neglected; the soil is assumed to be homogeneous. The model-predicted currents in the counterpoise, <b>ground</b> <b>rod,</b> and the cable are compared with the measurements, and a reasonable agreement was found for the currents along the counterpoise. It is found that current in the counterpoise is not much influenced by the presence of the cable. Further, vertical <b>ground</b> <b>rods</b> connected to the counterpoise do not have significant influence on the current distribution along the counterpoise. It appears that the model is unable to predict cable currents and voltages in the test system, presumably due to neglecting nonlinear phenomena in the soil and in cable’s insulation and electromagnetic coupling with the lightning channel.

40|$|A test {{technique}} {{was developed to}} assess various grounding system concepts used for mobile facilities. The {{test technique}} involves applying a high current pulse to the grounding system with the proper waveshape and magnitude to simulate a lightning return stroke. Of concern were the step voltages present along the ground near the point of lightning strike. Step voltage is equated to how fast the current pulse is dissipated by the grounding system. The applied current pulse was produced by a high current capacitor bank with a total energy content of 80 kilojoules.

The singularities in computing surface voltage, when the first image upwards lies at surface, are analysed and it's shown that a small change in top layer thickness allows an approximate solution. Surface potentials due to grid conductor are also considered and the values of resistance are compared with those from other methodologies. Singularities for a <b>ground</b> <b>rod</b> that crosses the two layers are also treated. The obtained values of resistance are not satisfactory, due to lower segments images that overlap the upper segments.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the backflashover {{phenomenon}} in HV overhead transmission lines (TLs) with towers grounded by means of long counterpoises, typically used in high resistivity soils. Although long counterpoises are effective in reducing the grounding impedance at power frequency, their impulse response may affect negatively the TL backflashover rate. The study {{is focused on the}} enhancement of TL lightning performance obtainable by adding a small number of vertical <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> to horizontal counterpoises. An extensive ATP-EMTP parametric analysis, based on a detailed 161 kVTL model including the leader progression model (LPM) of line insulations and the non-linear transient behaviour of grounding systems, has been carried out taking into account several different values of soil resistivity as well as varying numbers, locations and lengths of additional vertical rods. Critical lightning current ranges causing backflashover have been then predicted for several lightning waveforms, of different severity. The paper shows that the addition of a few vertical <b>grounding</b> <b>rods</b> significantly improves TL lightning performance by increasing critical lightning current values. even if their influence is negligible at power frequency. The authors have ascertained an increment of average critical backflashover current up to similar to 55 % for some typical TL grounding system configurations and lightning waveshapes.
