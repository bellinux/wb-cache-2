5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{say that}} if the {{government}} <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> top of this range inflation could rise up to 40% through the economy. The International Monetary Fund, however, has predicted a more moderate rise in inflation of just 32 percent. As of January 2010, the official inflation rate stands at 15 percent. The cost of living in Iran, according to the Majlis Research Center, could rise by up to 60 percent. Ahmadinejad's administration contends that the negative side effects will be transient and that the projections are based on out-of-date models.|$|E
5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father {{to pay for an}} illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E

50|$|In the Survival Challenge, each Limbo captives had {{to select}} a target (between an egg, a grapefruit, a melon, a {{pineapple}} and a watermelon) and had only two shots to make the target. They all got a practice shot at the melon because it was medium-sized. Livvi <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> egg because she hit the melon in <b>the</b> centre, Jack <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> grapefruit, Amie <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> melon, Ollie <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pineapple and Alex T <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> watermelon <b>for</b> completely missing <b>the</b> melon. Alex T hit the watermelon in his first shot, Ollie missed the pineapple in both attempts, Amy just hit {{the bottom of the}} melon in her second attempt and Jack just missed the grapefruit, so Livvi didn't need to <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> egg because the group failed the challenge. As a result, they all had to eat in the dark. Despite having to do the forfeit, the Limbo captives made a bad situation fun by having a food fight in the dark.|$|R

25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative.

The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The same <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> experience of reading a single line of Homer. If you wish to explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E

B. N. Puri, of the Department of Ancient Indian History and Archaeology, University of Lucknow, India, also identified Gondophares with the ruler said to have been converted by Saint Thomas the Apostle. The same <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reference to an Indo-Parthian king in the accounts of the life of Apollonius of Tyana.

25|$|The {{time of the}} Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 {{and founded}} the {{government}} known as the Ganden Phodrang, {{was a period of}} rich cultural development. His reign and that of Desi Sangye Gyatso are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> great {{increase in the number of}} foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him. The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see Further Reading). He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.|$|E

500|$|Until {{asked to}} perform and {{interpret}} Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... I might add that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far more than is normally heard. And that <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa". In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{admitted}} {{his team}} had underachieved during the season, but took criticism of failing to challenge Manchester United {{in the league and}} progressing further in the UEFA Champions League as a [...] "compliment to the club". He spoke in favour of moving FA Cup ties midweek to prevent fixture congestion, because the current system was too demanding for the big clubs: [...] "In England a team that <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> FA Cup automatically has a problem in the championship, especially if they play in the Champions League. There are then so many games something has to be sacrificed and I have sacrificed points in the championship to the FA Cup." [...] When asked whether reducing the number of teams in the UEFA Champions League would help, Wenger commented it [...] "...would mean less money and no one with the wages we pay can accept a drop in income. As for cutting the Premiership – they have done that in France and now those teams not involved in the cups are complaining." ...|$|E
500|$|As with 1989's album Like a Prayer, Madonna's {{hair was}} dyed dark brown to signify [...] "seriousness", {{and on the}} cover of the album Madonna wore a beret while resurrecting the famous Guerrillero Heroico image of Guevara. In an {{interview}} with Veja magazine, she described Guevara as [...] "an icon instantaneously identified with an revolution spirit. That <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole album: the current moment, I feel a revolutionary state of mind". Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández wrote in his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Subcultural Transformations, that the inclusion of Guevara as an inspiration for the cover was one of the many instances of Madonna incorporating Hispanic identity and the Latino subculture in her work. Because of the paramilitary theme, the dyed hair and the artistic composition, was compared with an infamous seventies photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress, Patty Hearst. The cover also had military styled stenciled lettering. The word [...] "American Life" [...] is written in blood red color and has a punk-rock style. Inside the CD booklet, she wielded an Uzi submachine gun, her body in various martial art poses, spelling out her name. By late 2003, she had wiped out the military image completely, and followed with another subtle toned-down image of that of a writer and philanthropist.|$|E
