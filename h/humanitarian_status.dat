Simultaneously, successive governments have sought to limit the welfare entitlements of forced migrants. Drawing on two sets of semi-structured qualitative interviews, with migrants and key respondents providing welfare services, this paper considers the adequacy of welfare provisions {{in relation to the}} financial and housing needs of four different groups of forced migrants i. e. refugees, asylum seekers, those with <b>humanitarian</b> protection <b>status</b> and failed asylum seekers/‘overstayers’.

40|$|Utilising {{insights}} from a qualitative {{study in the}} city of Leeds (UK), this paper considers issues related to the housing of dispersed forced migrants. The term 'dispersed forced migrants' is used here as a general label to include four groups of international migrants (i. e. refugees, asylum seekers, those with <b>humanitarian</b> protection <b>status</b> and failed asylum seekers) who have previously been dispersed, on a no choice basis, to a variety of locations across the UK under the requirements of the Immigration and Asylum Act (1999). The tiering of housing entitlement that exists within the generic population of dispersed forced migrants (a consequence of the particular socio-legal status assigned to individuals), and its role in rendering migrants susceptible to homelessness is outlined. The adequacy/standard of accommodation made available to forced migrants is also discussed. It is concluded that current arrangements fail to meet the basic housing needs of many forced migrants. Any future improvement in this situation will require a significant shift in government policy...|$|R
50|$|Resettlement {{continues}} to evade thousands of Iraqi-Palestinians, living as IDPs in Iraq or refugees in squalid border camps. However, {{there has been}} progress - particularly for those living in the border camps in Iraq, Syria and Jordan. At the end of 2009, 61 residents of Al-Tanf camp were given permission to settle in Italy, {{and out of the}} 1,300 Iraqi-Palestinian residents who had been stranded in the camp, more than 1000 were relocated to third countries; including Belgium, Chile, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In 2009, the United States also allowed more than a thousand Iraqi Palestinians from camps inside Iraq to be resettled within its borders. This was the largest ever Palestinian refugee resettlement in U.S. history. Critics of the State Department decision to resettle this group of Palestinians objected that they were sympathizers of Saddam Hussein. In December 2009, the united efforts of the not for profit company, Australian Society for Palestinian Iraqi Refugees Emergency (ASPIRE), and Amnesty International-Australia led to the Australian government approving 16 families making up 68 people from Al Hol for <b>humanitarian</b> refugee <b>status.</b> They are now living in Melbourne and Perth.|$|R
50|$|Within Peru, {{human rights}} are {{protected}} under the Constitution. The Peruvian Constitution {{underscores the importance of}} the state to preserve the dignity of all human beings. The Constitution includes articles that promote the right to self-determination, equality and non-discrimination, and life. Ever {{since the end of the}} internal conflict that occurred in Peru from 1980-2000, the country has worked to integrate <b>humanitarian</b> regulations and <b>statuses</b> into national law. However, there are still instances of particular rights being challenged. The 2014 Human Rights Report by the United States Department of State explains how even with the Constitution protecting these basic human rights, many violations continue to occur despite these laws. Also, in spite of the country’s progress since the Maoist insurgency, many problems are still visible and show the continued marginalization and displacement of those who suffered through the systematic violence of the Peruvian conflict. In 2001, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was founded to address the abuses that took place during this conflict.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the establishing {{of a law}} clinic to assist individuals with their application under the refugee family reunion (RFR) provision. We consider that a significant gap exists in the scope of university law clinics to provide a dedicated RFR service, a gap which extends to service providers generally in many regions in the UK. The removal of legal aid for family reunion applications has negatively affected the efficacy of refugees and those with <b>humanitarian</b> protection <b>status</b> {{to be reunited with}} their families (a right provided under international law to which the UK is a signatory). Family reunion is a very current issue of concern given global developments and the political instability in many countries, and it is also a topic which is {{at the very heart of}} social justice, a philosophy which underpins many law clinics in universities. Law clinics allow universities and their students to use their talents and resources to positively change the lives of people in their local communities. Significantly, broadening the scope of law clinics to offer a RFR service will enrich the learning experience of staff and students involved in RFR clinics, help to produce the next generation of lawyers, policy and decision-makers with an awareness of the issues facing refugees and the human perspective of the crises affecting them, and facilitate research opportunities through effective data collection and analysis. Subsequent outputs can positively affect national policy on immigration, asylum, legal aid, and engagement with, and the education of, the public...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{changes in}} {{educational}} settings place pressure on teachers to update their professional knowledge and skills, {{which can be}} accomplished by their participation in continuous professional development (CPD) programmes. The notion that teachers are true lifelong learners implies that they should hold positive attitudes and values needed to excel in learning. However, information on how teachers value their learning is sparse. This paper examines the dimensions of value placed on learning by teachers who undertook further learning as part of their CPD. As professionals, teachers are workers; therefore, their learning context is inevitably career-oriented. Thus, a Learning Value Scale questionnaire was developed by adapting Super’s Work Values Inventory proposed by Super and Neville (1986). The respondents were 599 teachers categorised into four groups—three groups engaged in different types of learning programmes (Undergraduate (UG), Postgraduate (PG), and Generic), and the control group did not participate in any learning activities. The responses were subjected to Principal Component Analysis. Results show that teachers see learning in four dimensions which are conceptually meaningful for, or associate with, the values of Achievement, <b>Humanitarian</b> Concern, <b>Status,</b> and Career Security. Examination of individual item responses across groups reveals that items for economic and job promotion show a distinct difference between the UG and Generic groups. In light of these findings, the study discusses the systemic cultural factors that conditioned the teachers’ concept of the value of learning. This baseline data can help teacher educators to understand teachers’ identity as learners. The findings also suggest that policy makers should review their learning policy initiative, and teachers as implementers of education should reflect on their own practice of learning...|$|R

Although international humanitarian law and human rights law are complementary systems, the main stress is layed on humanitarian law. The Global War on Terror is described in offical statements of american administrative, in particular on G. W. Bush ́s statements and documents like National Security Strategy of United States of America (2002) and National Strategy for Combating Terrorism (2003). Special account {{is given to the}} afghan conflict between 2001 and 2006, including analysis of opposing sides, in particular of Taliban, and chracter of combat operations. At the same time the thesis is dealing with Guantanamo Bay detaineesi. It takes note of discrepancy between official statements and standard practice on Guantanamo Base. After introduction to <b>humanitarian</b> law, the <b>status</b> of detainees is discussed following the facts of previous chapters.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The dataset deposited include 83 in-depth interviews that {{were conducted with}} refugees across the UK: Glasgow, Cardiff, Manchester and London. Detailed migration histories were collected from 83 refugees living in the UK and explored issues including arrival to the UK, experiences of the dispersal process, opinions and experiences of place, integration and citizenship. There are 81 word files of individual interviews and one word file which contains the transcripts of a joint interview with two different individuals. Project description: Since 2000 the UK has operated compulsory dispersal, a policy designed to ‘spread the burden’ of housing asylum seekers who require accommodation across the UK and discourage long-term settlement in London and the South East. To enhance understanding of refugee integration in the UK, this research focuses on the onward migration decisions {{of those who were}} dispersed and later granted refugee or <b>humanitarian</b> protection <b>status.</b> To date, much of the dispersal literature has critiqued the policy and focused on the negative outcomes for individuals removed from their networks. This project fills a knowledge gap surrounding the onward migration decisions and integration outcomes of refugees who were dispersed as asylum seekers in the UK. In this two-year (2012 - 2014), ESRC-funded project, we mapped the geography of onward migration amongst refugees dispersed across the UK as asylum seekers. We then explored the main factors that influence refugees' decision to stay in a town or city or move on and considered how this affects the process of integration. And finally we examined policy implications for different levels of governance, service providers and the voluntary sector, in terms of the long-term impact of UK dispersal policy upon refugee onward migration and integration...|$|R

The aims of the project were: to consider how far the basic housing and financial needs of refugees and asylum seekers are being adequately met; to explore the strategies used by asylum seekers and refugees {{in order to meet}} their needs in relation to housing and social security; to explore the role of the formal and informal welfare agencies and actors in meeting such needs; to engage in some preliminary scoping of the appropriateness of a policy that would allow asylum seekers to engage in paid work in order to meet their needs. Main Topics : This data collection consists of two related sets of transcribed semi-structured qualitative interviews. The first set comprises interviews with eleven key respondents involved in the provision of welfare services to forced migrants. The second set includes interviews with 23 forced migrants, including five refugees, seven asylum seekers, six people with <b>humanitarian</b> protection <b>status</b> (leave to remain), five failed asylum seekers/'overstayers', and one migrant classified as 'other'. Users should note that some of the interviews are combined, and one is a focus group interview. Thirteen of the forced migrants were male and ten female. Ages ranged between 21 and 57 years. Nine countries of origin were identified: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, Somalia and Zimbabwe. The countries of origin of individual respondents are not included in the interview transcripts, for confidentiality reasons. Topics covered include: Set one (providers) : background statistics; position of organisation and organisational role; key issues for welfare and housing provision to forced migrants; perceptions of the effects of formal immigration status on welfare; coping strategies of forced migrants, including welfare rights, informal provision, migrant behaviour, migrant employment; ways forward for the future improvement of migrant welfare. Set two (migrants) : arrival and length of stay in United Kingdom; housing provision and conditions; whether basic needs are being met by current provision; how migrants 'manage'; coping strategies; legal and illegal employment; ways forward for future improvement of provision. <br...|$|R
50|$|When {{carrying}} out their humanitarian function during armed conflicts, medical personnel are protected persons under international humanitarian law, and are entitled {{under the laws}} of war to carry out their work without being inhibited; they may not be attacked, harmed, taken as prisoners of war or persecuted in any way; deliberately attacking or hindering medical personnel from performing their humanitarian work is a serious war crime. The same protection extends to buildings and vehicles identified as part of the medical service. The Army Medical Service uses the red cross as a protective sign recognised under {{the laws of war}}; the sign is used on buildings and vehicles and may be worn on armbands as needed. Personnel are issued identity cards identifying them as protected persons under the Geneva Conventions. Although personnel of the Army Medical Service are members of the armed forces and hold military ranks, they are considered non-combatants under international humanitarian law and thus enjoy protection and neutrality because of their <b>humanitarian</b> duties. The <b>status</b> of medical personnel as protected persons goes back to the 1864 Geneva Convention and was repeated in the subsequent Geneva Conventions of 1906 and 1929. It is currently set forth in the First, Second and Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949, their additional protocols and is recognised under customary international humanitarian law, specifically by rules 25 and 26.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the international refugee regime as it has evolved over the last quarter century is the proliferation of labels. Rather than simply assessing the circumstances of applicants against the Convention refugee definition, the governments of most developed states have instead invented a seemingly endless list of alternative statuses - 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 <b>status,</b> <b>humanitarian</b> admission, temporary protected status, special leave to remain, Duldung, and the like. Persons assigned one of these labels have generally been protected against refoulement in line with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention. But in a variety of other ways, they have not been treated as refugees. They have, in particular, faced limits on freedom of movement, the ability to earn a livelihood, and access to education and general social support systems. Most critically, there has been a near-universal association of alter-native status with non-permanent presence. While refugees are by and large granted 2 ̆ 2 asylum 2 ̆ 2 - understood to entail an enduring right to remain in, or to be enfranchised by, the host country - the beneficiaries of alternative forms of protection have usually been admitted instead to what is commonly called 2 ̆ 2 temporary 2 ̆ 2 protection. That is, they are not granted an indefinite right to remain, but are instead allowed to stay in the host state {{for the duration of the}} risk in their country of origin...|$|R
