This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the sound absorption properties of a single layer date palm fiber based on the <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity.</b> Experimental measurements were carried out to estimate the <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity</b> value using differential pressure tube.

The <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity</b> was used to calculate the sound absorption coefficient using Delany and Bazley model.

40|$|The {{production}} processes of porous materials introduce an inherent geometric anisotropy {{in the material}} at micro scale, which influences the material properties at macro scale. In this thesis, the focus is turned {{to one of these}} macroscopic properties, the <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity,</b> which {{is a measure of the}} resistance felt by the sound pressure waves as they propagate through a porous space. In the current work, two different porous materials have been studied, a fibrous glass wool and a Melamine foam. The two materials are expected to show different degrees of anisotropy with respect to <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity.</b> Glass wool is assumed to be transversely isotropic, as a result of the stacking of layers of fibres. The level of anisotropy in Melamine foam is not as obvious, and might be related to production specific aspects, such as the rise-direction, and the position of the injection nozzles. The thesis begins by giving an introduction to porous materials in general, and to glass wool and Melamine foam in particular, followed by an introduction to <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity,</b> together with two methods to measure the <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity.</b> The full anisotropic <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity</b> of glass wool and Melamine foam samples is determined by means of measurements and inverse estimation. An eigenvalue and eigenvector decomposition of the <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity</b> tensor provides an insight into the connection between the directionality of the <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity</b> in each material, and its production process. A study of the homogeneity in density and <b>flow</b> <b>resistivity</b> for the two materials shows that these properties vary within the block of material.

The 18 centrifugal pumps are capable of delivering approximately 9. 900 GPM of LCW. At each service building, the temperature of LCW is regulated to 95 +/- 1 degF by a 3 -way control valve which diverts a portion of LCW around a heat exchanger when less cooling is required. A constant flow of pond water is circulated in the tube side of the heat exchanger to remove the heat.
