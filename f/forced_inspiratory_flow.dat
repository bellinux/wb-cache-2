40|$|The {{effect of}} {{unilateral}} vocal cord paralysis and intracordal Teflon injection on maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows was studied in 15 consecutive patients. Ten patients had {{a ratio of}} forced expiratory flow to <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % vital capacity (Ve 50 /Vi 50) more than one. Of the remaining five, four had low Ve 50 consistent with underlying bronchial disease. Repeat studies were obtained in 10 patients two or more weeks after Teflon injection into a vocal cord for voice therapy. Maximum expiratory flow rates did not change (means 6. 64 +/- 0. 881 /sec before and 6. 47 +/- 1. 101 /s after injection). Inspiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity improved in all six patients with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) greater than 75 % of the forced vital capacity (FVC). In patients with an FEV 1 less than 75 % FVC, no consistent changes could be seen. We conclude that a high Ve 50 /Vi 50 suggestive of variable extrathoracic airways obstruction is a frequent finding {{in the presence of}} unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Teflon injection does not cause a significant reduction in forced expiratory flows and improves inspiratory flows in subjects without evidence of underlying bronchial disease...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionChronic cough is {{a common}} {{clinical}} problem {{and there is a}} shortage of effective treatments for it. Within the group of transient receptor potential ion channels a receptor for the cooling substance menthol has been identified. This study aimed to assess whether pre-inhalation of dissolved, nebulised menthol could increase capsaicin cough thresholds and influence spirometric values. MethodsFourteen patients with chronic cough and airway sensitivity to environmental irritants and 15 control subjects were tested on three occasions. Each one inhaled a 1  mL of nebulised menthol solution of 0. 5 % or 1 % or placebo (saline with 0. 05 % menthol) at each visit in a randomized and double-blind order. They were then provoked by capsaicin inhalation. ResultsPatients' cough thresholds differed significantly from the controls' on all three provocations (P <  0. 0001). After inhalation of 1 % menthol, the patients' cough thresholds were significantly higher (P <  0. 02) compared to after placebo inhalation and to after 0. 5 % menthol inhalation (P <  0. 05). The patients' peak <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flows</b> were significantly reduced after inhalation of the placebo (saline) (P <  0. 05) but not after inhalation of 0. 5 % or 1 % menthol. <b>Forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flows</b> 50 % were lowered after inhalation of placebo and of 0. 5 % menthol (P <  0. 05) but not after 1 % menthol. Among the controls, <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flows</b> 50 % were lowered after only placebo inhalation (P <  0. 05). ConclusionsIn patients with chronic cough, pre-inhalation of menthol reduces cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin and influences <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flows.</b> The findings may provide scientific support for the common practice of using menthol as a reliever for variant airway discomfort. The use of menthol in different cigarette brands could be questioned since it could conceal the natural irritation following smoking...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} objectively assess our {{outcomes}} after laparoscopic diaphragmatic plication for symptomatic hemidiaphragmatic paralysis or eventration using a respiratory quality-of-life questionnaire and pulmonary function tests. MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of all symptomatic patients with hemidiaphragmatic paralysis or eventration who underwent laparoscopic diaphragmatic plication from March 1, 2005, through August 31, 2008. Patients with primary neuromuscular disorders {{were excluded from}} our analysis. We collected St George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores (a respiratory quality-of-life questionnaire) and pulmonary function test results preoperatively and at 1 month and 1 year postoperatively. A 2 -sided significance level of. 05 was used for all statistical testing. ResultsDuring the study period, 25 patients underwent laparoscopic diaphragmatic plication (9 right-sided and 16 left-sided plications); 1 patient required conversion to a thoracotomy. St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total scores (59. 3 ± 26. 8) improved by more than 20 points on average (a reduction of ≥ 4 points after an intervention is considered a clinically significant improvement). This improvement was statistically significant at 1 month (36. 6 ± 15. 9, P =. 001) and maintained significance at 1 year (30. 8 ± 18. 8, P =. 009). Similarly, percent predicted maximum <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> (93. 2 % ± 34. 1 %) was significantly improved 1 month after plication (113. 9 % ± 31. 8 %, P =. 01) and maintained significance at 1 year (111. 5 % ± 30. 9 %, P =. 02). ConclusionsOur objective evaluation of laparoscopic diaphragmatic plication for hemidiaphragmatic paralysis or eventration demonstrated significant short-term and midterm improvements in respiratory {{quality of life and}} pulmonary function test results.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of inhaled salbutamol 400 mcg, ipratropium 80 mcg and a placebo on ILP and FEV(1) and their relationship to dyspnea, as measured with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). METHODS: A total of 85 subjects with stable COPD participated in a crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Spirometry was performed before and after inhalation of salbutamol, ipratropium or a placebo. The primary analysis was performed using 63 participants with absent reversibility. RESULTS: All ILP and FEV(1) values improved significantly after bronchodilator administration except for FIF(50) after ipratropium administration. After administration of both bronchodilators, the mean percent changes from initial values did not significantly differ between the various ILPs and FEV(1). The mean VAS score showed significant improvements after bronchodilator and placebo inhalation but did not significantly correlate with changes in lung function parameters. For each lung function parameter, patients were further classified as responders if the amount of change was greater than the coefficient of repeatability of the test. Response rates did not differ significantly between the various ILPs. Moreover, no significant differences were found between responders and non-responders with respect to dyspnea after bronchodilator inhalation. This finding applied to all ILP and FEV(1) values. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with COPD, all ILP, FEV(1) values and VAS scores showed significant improvements after bronchodilator use as well as with placebo. However, ILPs were not more sensitive than FEV(1) for detecting responders after bronchodilator use or changes in the VAS score...|$|E

Since hypercapnia increases the motor activity of airway dilating muscles {{its effects on}} the maximum expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume curves (MEIFV) in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and in normal subjects in different postures was studied. METHODS: The effects of posture on the maximum expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume curves during the breathing of air and 7 % carbon dioxide in 11 patients with obstructive sleep apnoea were compared with those in nine normal subjects. Measurements {{were made in the}} sitting, supine, and right lateral recumbent positions. Forced expiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity (FEF 50), <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % vital capacity (FIF 50) and FEF 50 /FIF 50 were determined. RESULTS: In the normal subjects FEF 50, FIF 50, and FEF 50 /FIF 50 were not affected by change in posture or by breathing carbon dioxide. In the patients there was a fall in FIF 50 and an increase in FEF 50 /FIF 50 when breathing air in the supine position compared with values in the seated and lateral position. While they were breathing carbon dioxide there was a slight increase in FEF 50 when patients were seated or in the lateral position compared with values during air breathing. Hypercapnia abolished the effects of posture on FEF 50 /FIF 50. Values for FEF 50 /FIF 50 in the supine position while they were breathing air correlated with the apnoeic index but not with other polysomnographic data. CONCLUSION: In patients with obstructive sleep apnoea the upper airway is prone to collapse during inspiration when the patient is supine, even when awake; this tendency can be reversed by breathing carbon dioxide...|$|E

One hundred and eighteen asthmatics (aged 4 1012 – 20 612 years) with bronchial obstruction (mean V̇max 50 %: 59 · 5 %pred., sd 17 · 8 %pred.) were allocated at random to two groups of 59 patients to inhale 0 · 5 mg terbutaline either by TH or by pMDI (and placebo by dummy of the other device). In- and expiratory spirometry and bodyplethysmography were conducted before and 10 min after inhalation. Bronchodilatation was effective [change in airways resistance (ΔRAW) − 50 %, change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ΔFEV 1) + 15 %, ΔV̇max 50 % or 25 % + 25 % of baseline] in 41 of 59 patients with pMDI (69 · 5 %) and 33 of 59 patients with TH (55 · 9 %). The effect on V̇max 50 % was significantly better with pMDI than with TH. Turbuhaler® users with higher inspiratory flow [forced inspiratory volume in 1 s (FIV 1), <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % vital capacity (FIF 50) ] reached better bronchodilatation, while bronchodilatatory effect was not correlated with inspiratory performance in MDI users. Peak inspiratory flow (PIF) did not correlate well with bronchodilatation by TH. When using TH for bronchodilatation, the effectiveness of terbutaline depends upon the degree of inspiratory capacity. This can lead to impaired bronchodilatatory effect in subgroups of obstructive young asthmatics with low inspiratory flow. In contrast, when using a pMDI, inspiratory capacity does not seem to influence the effectiveness of terbutaline...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIn chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) the clinical efficacy of bronchodilator therapy delivered via a nebulizer versus an aerochamber on FEV 1 is controversial. No studies comparing changes in inspiratory pulmonary function parameters (ILPs) using these inhaler devices are currently available. This information {{might be of}} interest because due to dynamic bronchial compression, the relationship between the ILPs and dyspnea is more reliable than that between FEV 1 and dyspnea. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate whether changes in ILPs after use of these inhaler devices were similar to the changes in FEV 1 and correlate with VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). MethodsForty-one stable COPD patients participated in a crossover trial. Spirometry was performed before and after two puffs Combivent (200  mcg salbutamol and 20  mcg ipratropium per puff) using an aerochamber or 2  mL of Combivent (2. 5  mg salbutamol and 250  mcg ipratropium per mL) using a nebulizer. Differences in lung function parameters and changes in VAS were measured. ResultsILP values improved significantly from baseline after Combivent administration using both devices (p ≤  0. 004). With both devices, the mean percent changes were significantly greater for FEV 1 than the ILPs (p ≤  0. 003), except for IC (p =  0. 19). The mean VAS score did not differ significantly between the devices (p =  0. 33), but significant correlations were found between the VAS and <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % of the vital capacity (FIF 50) and peak inspiratory flow (PIF) when a nebulizer was used. With an aerochamber, no significant correlations between lung function parameters and VAS were found. ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that ILPs improved significantly after using either device. Although significant correlations were found between the VAS and FIF 50 and PIF for the nebulizer, in stable COPD patients, the pMDI plus spacer is a better route of administration than a nebulizer...|$|E

Evaluation and identification of patients as potential candidates tonsillectomy is a primary concern for otolaryngologists. This study focuses {{on the results of}} pulmonary function tests (PFTs) after tonsillectomy in children. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study examined 50 patients suffering from tonsillar hypertrophy in 2013. Full details and results of otolaryngology examinations were recorded. Moreover, patients were examined with respect to <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % of vital capacity (FIF 50 %), forced expiratory flow at 50 % of vital capacity (FEF 50 %), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) /peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and FEV 1 /forced expired volume in 0. 5 seconds (FEV 0. 5) before and after surgery using spirometry. All data were analyzed using SPSS Software (version 19), and central descriptive measures, and data were compared by performing T-test and Chi-square tests. Results: According to tonsil size, patients were distributed as follows: 18 patients (36 %) with + 1 tonsil size, 18 patients (36 %) with + 2 tonsil size, and seven patients (14 %) with + 3 tonsil size, and seven patients (14 %) with + 4 tonsil size. Thirty-three (66 %) and 17 patients (34 %) were female and male, respectively, with a mean of age of 9. 7 2. 97 years (range, 7 – 18 years). Seventy-eight percent of patients were aged 10 years or less. Moreover, 25 patients (50 %), 17 patients (34 %), and eight patients (16 %), respectively, reported obstructive symptoms, recurrent tonsillitis, and both symptoms. In patients with + 3 and + 4 tonsil size, spirometric parameters indicated relief of symptoms of obstruction. Only in patients with + 4 tonsil size were the changes statistically significant. Conclusion:  Tonsillectomy can relieve obstructive symptoms in patients with tonsils larger than + 3 to a great extent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endobronchial {{radiotherapy}} by a {{high dose}} rate remote after-loading technique (high dose rate brachytherapy) has become an established treatment for major airway occlusion by inoperable carcinoma of the bronchus. Only limited objective data on its effect on pulmonary physiology and on radiographic and bronchoscopic appearances are available. The {{aim of this study}} was to make a detailed assessment of patients before and after high dose rate brachytherapy to determine which investigations were useful and to generate data for comparing this with other methods of treatment. METHODS: Twenty patients with major airway obstruction by inoperable lung cancer underwent a detailed assessment before receiving endobronchial radiotherapy (15 Gy at 1 cm in a single fraction) and six weeks after treatment. This included chest radiography, computed tomography of the thorax, bronchoscopy including an obstruction index, five minute walking tests, isotope ventilation and perfusion lung scanning, and full lung function tests with maximum inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (mean age 69 years) completed the study. Symptomatic improvement occurred in 17 patients. A collapsed lobe or lung, seen on the chest radiograph in 13, reexpanded in nine. Bronchoscopic appearances improved in 18, the mean obstruction index decreasing from 6. 2 to 2. 8. The isotope scans showed significant increases in the percentage of total lung ventilation (V) and perfusion (Q) measured over the abnormal lung (V 17. 7 % to 27. 7 %, Q 15. 1 to 21. 9 %). Five minute walking distance (305 to 329 m), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 1. 45 to 1. 61 l), forced vital capacity (FVC 2. 17 to 2. 48 l) and ratio of forced expiratory to <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate at 50 % vital capacity (FEF 50 /FIF 50 0. 58 to 0. 88) all increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial radiotherapy led to subjective benefit in most cases in terms of symptoms and bronchoscopic and radiological appearances. There was objective improvement in spirometric indices and in exercise tolerance with increased pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and evidence of decreased intrathoracic airway obstruction...|$|E

40|$|SummaryForced inspiratory {{measures}} have been described to reflect the reduction in dyspnoea upon bronchodilation in severe COPD. Based on this we evaluated the applicability and usefulness of a portable device {{for the assessment of}} forced inspiration. In 37 patients with COPD (GOLD II/II/IV n =  16 / 15 / 6, mean ± SD FEV 1 46. 2  ±  15. 4 %pred) lung function was recorded prior to inhalation of 24  μg formoterol and 30  min later. Assessments comprised spirometry including forced inspiration, body plethysmography, maximum <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> (InCheck, Clement Clarke), and changes in dyspnoea via visual analogue scale (VAS). The sequence was repeated on a second day to assess reproducibility. Bronchodilation by formoterol was detectable in all functional indices (p <  0. 05 each) except total lung capacity. FEV 1 improved by (mean ± SD) 11. 1  ±  10. 3 %, <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> volume in 1 s (FIV 1) by 11. 6  ±  13. 5 %, <b>inspiratory</b> peak <b>flow</b> (PIF) by 10. 7  ±  16. 2 %, and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> determined by the InCheck device (IF-IC) by 11. 9  ±  14. 4 %. Remarkably, the changes of IF-IC (p <  0. 001) but not those of other measures except FIV 1 (p <  0. 05) were related to those of dyspnoea. Effects on IF-IC showed reproducibility comparable to that of other indices. The results suggest that a simple, portable device for recording forced inspiration could be useful in monitoring COPD, as a functional correlate of acute changes in dyspnoea.

Our study showed that peak nasal <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow,</b> nasal patency index and nasal patency visual analog scale correlate with the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale in contrast to peak oral <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow.</b> Peak nasal <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> and nasal patency index also showed significant association with the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale after adjustment for confounders. Peak nasal <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> is the most reliable method for the assessment of nasal patency. It is quick, inexpensive, and easy to perform, and correlates significantly with the subjective feeling of nasal obstruction. There is no clinical need to measure peak oral <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> or to calculate the nasal patency index in the evaluation of nasal patency. 4 Laryngoscope, 124 : 2665 - 2669, 201...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) the clinical efficacy of bronchodilator therapy delivered via a nebulizer versus an aerochamber on FEV 1 is controversial. No studies comparing changes in inspiratory pulmonary function parameters (ILPs) using these inhaler devices are currently available. This information {{might be of}} interest because due to dynamic bronchial compression, the relationship between the ILPs and dyspnea is more reliable than that between FEV 1 and dyspnea. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate whether changes in ILPs after use of these inhaler devices were similar to the changes in FEV 1 and correlate with VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). METHODS: Forty-one stable COPD patients participated in a crossover trial. Spirometry was performed before and after two puffs Combivent (200 mcg salbutamol and 20 mcg ipratropium per puff) using an aerochamber or 2 mL of Combivent (2. 5 mg salbutamol and 250 mcg ipratropium per mL) using a nebulizer. Differences in lung function parameters and changes in VAS were measured. RESULTS: ILP values improved significantly from baseline after Combivent administration using both devices (p </= 0. 004). With both devices, the mean percent changes were significantly greater for FEV 1 than the ILPs (p </= 0. 003), except for IC (p = 0. 19). The mean VAS score did not differ significantly between the devices (p = 0. 33), but significant correlations were found between the VAS and <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % of the vital capacity (FIF 50) and peak inspiratory flow (PIF) when a nebulizer was used. With an aerochamber, no significant correlations between lung function parameters and VAS were found. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that ILPs improved significantly after using either device. Although significant correlations were found between the VAS and FIF 50 and PIF for the nebulizer, in stable COPD patients, the pMDI plus spacer is a better route of administration than a nebulizer...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), {{there is a}} poor correlation between forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and dyspnea following bronchodilator use. Better correlations have been observed between inspiratory lung function parameters (ILPs) and dyspnea, which drives our interest in ILPs. However, the acute and prolonged effects of long-acting bronchodilators and oral corticosteroids on ILPs have not been well investigated. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of these treatments on the ILPs, FEV 1, dyspnea (visual analog scale (VAS)) and clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ). METHODS: Twenty-eight stable COPD patients had their ILPs and FEV 1 measured both before and 2 h after the use of a single dose of 18 mcg bronchodilator tiotropium and 50 mcg salmeterol. Thereafter, the patients were randomized to 2 weeks of treatment with 30 mg oral prednisolone once daily or oral placebo in combination with daily treatment with these two bronchodilators. Four weeks after the cessation of the randomized treatment, the ILPs and FEV 1 were again measured. After each intervention, any change in the VAS score was assessed. RESULTS: With both bronchodilators, significant improvements in ILPs were demonstrated (p < 0. 005), with the exception of changes in ILPs inspiratory capacity (IC) and <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % of the vital capacity (FIF 50) after tiotropium inhalation. After 2 weeks of treatment with prednisolone, significant differences were found for ILP forced inspiratory volume in 1 s (FIV 1) and FEV 1 compared with placebo. These differences were no longer present 4 weeks after the cessation of prednisolone. Significant relationships between ILPs and VAS scores were only found after 2 weeks of treatment with prednisolone or placebo. CONCLUSIONS: After a single dose of long-acting bronchodilator salmeterol, significant improvements are observed in all ILPs and in FIV 1 and PIF after tiotropium. Two weeks of oral corticosteroid treatment improved the FIV 1 and FEV 1. The dyspnea VAS score was only significantly correlated with the ILPs after 2 weeks of oral corticosteroid treatment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Symptoms {{of vocal}} cord {{dysfunction}} (VCD) are caused predominantly by vocal cord adduction during inspiration. It is commonly {{seen in the}} asthma clinic, both where asthma has been misdiagnosed and as an additional diagnosis. The current “gold standard” for diagnosis of VCD is direct visualisation of the vocal cords during laryngoscopy. A flow volume loop recorded whilst symptomatic may also demonstrate an abnormal pattern, and VCD may be induced in susceptible subjects—for example, by hypertonic saline (HS) challenge. Taramarcaz and colleagues (J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2004) have reported a decrease in <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> (FIF 50) after HS challenge in a case series of three patients with postviral VCD. Methods We designed a prospective, controlled study to determine whether HS challenge testing provokes VCD, as evidenced by changes in FIF 50 and visual analogue scores (VAS). Baseline questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety Depression Score (HAD), adapted John Hunter Cough Questionnaire (aJHCQ) and a VCD VAS) were completed, then HS challenge performed, with a shortened VAS and spirometry recorded after each dose interval. Results Twenty-seven subjects (mean (range) age 38 (21 – 62) years, 38 % male) completed the study, seven subjects with VCD (6 with a previous diagnosis of asthma), six physician-confirmed asthma alone and 14 healthy controls (HCs). Subjects with VCD were older, with higher HAD, baseline VAS and aJHCQ scores than the other groups. As expected, HS induced a greater fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) in the group with asthma than in the VCD or HC groups. However, change in FIF 50 after the final dose of HS did not significantly differ between groups. The change in mean VAS score, and particularly items 1 and 2, discriminated between VCD and the other groups during HS challenge (table 1). Conclusion FIF 50 {{may not be a}} useful dynamic marker of VCD during HS challenge, but our modified VCD VAS did show symptom changes in subjects with VCD compared with those with asthma and healthy controls. This tool could potentially be used in the diagnosis and treatment of VCD after further evaluation and validation...|$|E

Sixty patients with obstructive lung disease (40 asthmatics, 20 patients with COPD) and without DPI experience were enrolled into this investigator initiated, randomized, cross-over study. Collected data of 56 patients were eligible for analysis. Inspiratory pressure and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> through both devices were measured in every patient using a double-beam oscilloscope. Peak <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> (PIF), duration of <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> > 60 l/min and increase in inspiratory pressure were significantly higher in the Novolizer® group. In addition, the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate 0. 1 s after beginning of inhalation was over two-times higher at inhalation through the Novolizer® compared to inhalation through the Turbuhaler®. The Turbuhaler® data, but not the Novolizer® data, showed a significant negative correlation between lung function and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow.</b> The dynamic resistance of the Turbuhaler® was 5. 5 -times {{higher than that of}} the Novolizer®. Patients using the Turbuhaler® had to invest a significantly higher inspiratory effort compared {{to the use of the}} Novolizer® in order to achieve the same <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> (e. g., 60 l/min). Indeed, more than 40 % of the patients in the Turbuhaler® group failed to reach an <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> of 60 l/min.

30|$|In vitro and {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} performed to optimize aerosol lung deposition [2, 3]. Many factors related to the device, the artificial airways and the respiratory pattern inherent to invasive mechanical ventilation influence lung deposition [4]. Most of them should be controlled to deliver high doses of concentration-dependent drugs such as antibiotics. Vibrating-mesh nebulizers ensure currently the best drug output, ergonomy and practical use in the ICU [5, 6]. Applying a constant <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> pattern with a slow <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate improved aerosol delivery as compared to a decelerating <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> pattern with a higher peak <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate [7]. This mandates volume-controlled ventilation modality and a deep depression of the respiratory drive with sedatives [8]. Conversely, reducing sedation is promoted in ICU {{in order to preserve}} the diaphragmatic function through a spontaneous breathing activity and hence to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation [9, 10]. The decelerating <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> pattern and the spontaneous breathing activity of the patient (uncontrolled respiratory rate, <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate) related to the pressure support modality may affect aerosol delivery to the lungs. The comparison of pressure support ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation regarding aerosol administration has not been investigated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), {{the response of}} the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) after bronchodilator application is weak. Inspiratory parameters like the <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> volume in 1 second (FIV 1) and inspiratory capacity (IC) can be responsive to bronchodilators. In an individual patient with COPD, a significant bronchodilator response must at least exceed the random variation for that parameter. Therefore, {{it is important that the}} type of scatter is homoscedastic, as the chance of underestimating or overestimating the random variation for low or high parameter values is minimized. The aim of this study is to investigate the random variation (type and quantity) of inspiratory parameters. Methods In 79 stable COPD patients, spirometry was performed. The <b>forced</b> <b>inspiratory</b> volume in 1 second (FIV 1), inspiratory capacity (IC), maximal <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> at 50 % (MIF 50) and peak <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> (PIF) were measured five times in one day and again within two weeks of the first measurement. The values of these parameters, taken within one hour, within one day and between two different days, were compared. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) was calculated, and, in addition, linear regression was performed to investigate the type of scatter (homo- or heteroscedastic) of the measured parameters. Results The type of scatter was heteroscedastic for all of the parameters when the differences were expressed as absolute values; however, when the differences were expressed as the percent change from the initial values, we found a more homoscedastic scatter. The CR within one hour of each parameter expressed as the percent change from the initial value was: IC, 19 %; FIV 1, 14 %; PIF, 18 %; MEF 50, 21 %. Conclusions To obtain a more homoscedastic scatter, percentage changes in FIV 1, IC and MIF 50 are more appropriate than absolute changes. In an individual patient with COPD, a significant improvement for a particular parameter must at least exceed the above-mentioned CR. </p...|$|R

40|$|Fixed {{performance}} oxygen masks operate {{by supplying}} mixtures of oxygen and air at rates exceeding the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> {{rate of the}} patient. In this study the oxygen concentration delivered by three fixed performance oxygen masks was determined non-invasively at various <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rates. At low <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rates all the masks studied acted as fixed performance devices. When the peak inspiratory rate increased the performance of all the masks showed some variability. The change from fixed to variable performance depended on the relation between <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate and the total gas flow delivered by the mask and was independent {{of the volume of}} the mask. Hence the use of low volume masks and high oxygen flow rates should produce more consistent results than high volume masks and lower flow rates...|$|R

Pentazocine reduced the occlusion pressure and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> responses at a given Pco 2 during carbon dioxide rebreathing and these effects were antagonized by naloxone.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate of a {{human is}} changed {{with the amount of}} the workload. The flow {{characteristic}} is affected by the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate. In the flow field of airway, the both of turbulence intensity and secondary flow affect the deposition pattern of particles which is important for the drug-aerosol targeting. Thus the analysis of the flow characteristic in a human airway is important. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate on the flow characteristics in a human airway. The tubular airway is con-sistent with the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and trachea. The relatively <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate is used at each case of human states regarding the workload. By the effect of geometric airway changes, transition to turbulent airflow after the larynx can occur with relaminarization further downstream. The low Rey-nolds number k-ω turbulence model is used for analysis with flow regime. As the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>flow</b> rate is larger, the turbulence kinetic energy and secondary flow intensity increase in airway. On the othe...|$|R
