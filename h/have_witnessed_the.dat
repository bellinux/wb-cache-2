5|$|Working {{alongside}} Gemma whilst {{they were}} producing the globes, Mercator would <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents {{to work in}} a burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a map of the Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to reform the}} structure of English counties {{and the question of}} county government had become a major political issue. Both the Liberal and Conservative party manifestos for the 1886 general election contained promises to introduce elected local authorities. The Local Government (Boundaries) Act 1887 received Royal Assent in September 1887 and appointed Boundary Commissioners to review the existing county boundaries, except for the 'Counties Corporate'. Worcestershire would <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> formation of a county administration and a loss of territory to Birmingham. The Act also legislated for Dudley to unite {{with the rest of the}} county, although this would be achieved through a transfer of territory from Staffordshire. This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative Local Government Act 1888.|$|E
5|$|Gerard (died 21 May 1108) was Archbishop of York between 1100 and 1108 and Lord Chancellor of England from 1085 until 1092. A Norman, he was {{a member}} of the cathedral clergy at Rouen before {{becoming}} a royal clerk under King William I of England and subsequently his son King William II Rufus. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the Bishopric of Hereford in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> first charter issued by the new king, Henry I of England, within days of William's death.|$|E

5|$|The Klamath {{tribe of}} Native Americans, whose {{ancestors}} may <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> collapse of Mount Mazama {{and the formation}} of Crater Lake, have long regarded the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating Crater Lake, called giiwas in the Klamath language. The Klamath people used Crater Lake in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.|$|E
5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though {{no one on the}} ground is known to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Suetonius {{was born}} in about AD70, and started writing around AD100. He was a child {{at the time of}} the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.|$|E

5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E

Diana made a tape of the interview. The whereabouts of the tape became a matter of considerable controversy following Diana's death in August 1997.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} {{of such a}} large and distinctive bridge soon {{caught the attention of}} the general public. The launching of the Cornish span in 1857 attracted a crowd of around 20,000, with similar numbers said to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> launch of the Devonport span and the opening day. During its construction it was photographed many times and after its opening it was the subject for many paintings, including those by Devonport-born artist Alfred Wallis. It has also been the subject of many photographs and postcards.|$|E

Dabney, the father of the chief engineer of that railroad, in 1850.

25|$|The first {{decades of}} the 21st century <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> rapid {{gentrification}} of these neighborhoods. Istiklal Avenue has once again become a destination for tourists, and formerly bohemian neighborhoods like Cihangir have once again become fashionable and quite expensive. Some 19th and early 20th century buildings have been tastefully restored, while others have been converted into mammoth luxury malls of dubious aesthetic value. As newer, more international and affluent residents have begun to creep down the hills into Tophane and Tarlabasi, disagreements with more conservative elements in the neighborhoods have become common.|$|E
25|$|Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan {{discusses}} {{this as an}} inaccuracy regarding Mordecai's age. In the passage, either Mordecai or {{his great-grandfather}} Kish is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar (in 597 BC). If this refers to Mordecai, {{he would have had}} to live over a century to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> <b>the</b> events described in the Book of Esther (assuming the biblical Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I). However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai's exile to Babylon, but to his great-grandfather Kish's exile—a reading which many accept.|$|E

In 1903 he emigrated to Montreal, Canada, but soon relocated to Chicago, Illinois to work for Hull Laboratory. While there he collaborated with American physician Charles Claude Guthrie in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs {{as well as the}} head, and Carrel was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these efforts.|$|E
