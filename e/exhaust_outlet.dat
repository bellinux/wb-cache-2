25|$|The {{position}} of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> changed {{so that it was}} now angled upwards toward the rear wing instead of downwards to face the rear diffuser so as to make the practice of using exhaust blown diffusers—passing exhaust gasses over the rear diffuser to improve the car's downforce—extremely difficult to achieve.|$|E
25|$|Tiran-5Sh - {{upgraded}} T-55, {{fitted with}} Sharir 105mm gun. It also has ammunition racks modified {{to suit the}} 105mm ammunition, new communications equipment, modified commander's seat, new gunner's seat, azimuth indicator installed, driver's hatch modified {{so that it can}} opened from the outside, coaxial machine gun replaced by a 7.62mm Browning machine gun and the cupola mounted DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun replaced by a 12.7mm Browning heavy machine gun, new fire control, night vision equipment, electrical system, air-conditioning system, antennae mounts on the rear of the turret, <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> angled upwards, additional track stowage and fire-extinguishing system installed. It is also known as T-55S.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} a 4.0L V6 mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed automatic transmission. The V6 powertrains were unchanged from {{those used in}} 2005–2009 Mustangs. Though the 2010 Mustang V-6 retained a single <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet,</b> {{the diameter of the}} tip had been increased one-half of an inch to three inches. The 2010 Mustang included new spring rates and dampers to improve ride quality and control and Ford's AdvanceTrac traction and stability control system standard. Newly standard on the base Mustang were 17-inch painted aluminum wheels while 18-inch wheels continue to be optional (except for V8 models, where 18-inch wheels were mounted by default). Other new available features and options for the 2010 Mustang included Ford SYNC, dual-zone automatic climate control, an updated navigation system with Sirius Travel Link, a capless fuel filler, a reverse camera system to aid in backing up, and an updated version of the V6 Pony Package.|$|E
50|$|Externally, the GUPPY IIA {{differed}} from the GUPPY II and IA by having only three diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets,</b> whereas the earlier conversions had four.|$|R
5000|$|Re-entry of {{exhaust air}} occurs when <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> and fresh air intakes are either too close, or {{prevailing}} winds change exhaust patterns, or by infiltration between {{intake and exhaust}} air flows.|$|R
25|$|Other advancements {{on the car}} {{include the}} {{clutchless}} direct shift technology within the gearbox, a new fluid traction control system to replace the previous 2001 traction control system, and upright aerodynamically shaped periscopic <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> at the rear. The latter technology was incorporated both to use the hot exhaust gases for aerodynamic effect and to raise these gases higher and out {{the way of the}} rear suspension. On previous occasion Ferrari's non chimneyed top exiting <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> had caused the rear suspension and other elements {{at the rear of the}} car to overheat or even melt when minor cracks occurred.|$|R

2500|$|VSC was not {{available}} across the range until August 2007, where it became standard on all variants. In May 2008, the Grande variant received a change in specification to {{the same set of}} alloy wheels as the [...] "Sportivo" [...] variant, as opposed to the previous style shared with the [...] "Ateva" [...] grade. Toyota released the [...] "Ateva L" [...] {{at the same time as}} this running change. The limited edition [...] "Ateva L" [...] added a rear lip spoiler, [...] "Sportivo" [...] alloy wheels, and leather trim. A second limited edition XV40, the [...] "Touring" [...] was launched in April 2009 based on and priced identically to the automatic transmission-equipped [...] "Altise". The [...] "Touring" [...] added 17-inch alloy wheels, the [...] "Sportivo" [...] grille, a chrome <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet,</b> front fog lamps, a six-disc CD changer, dual zone climate control air conditioning, and a leather steering wheel, handbrake and gear selection lever.|$|E
2500|$|Tiran-4Sh - {{upgraded}} Tiran-4, {{fitted with}} Sharir 105 mm gun.

50|$|On September 8, BP {{published}} {{a report that}} suggested that the ignition source was the released gas entering the air intakes of the diesel generators, and engulfing the deck area where the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> for the main generators were emitting hot exhaust gas.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the {{negative}} attributes focused upon by potential sellers of steel tube <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> configurations, engineers who design engine components choose conventional cast iron exhaust manifolds can similarly list positive attributes, such as an array of heat management properties and superior longevity than {{any other type of}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> design. For the average consumer, having trouble with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> system may qualify as 'poorer performance'.|$|E

5000|$|Cosmetically, the XJR {{differed}} from the standard cars with a body-coloured grille surround, mesh grille insert, body-coloured boot-lid plinth, larger <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets,</b> special five-spoke [...] "Sport" [...] alloy wheels, and [...] "XJR" [...] badging. Rain gutters and window surrounds were matte black, except on North American models where they were polished stainless steel.|$|R
50|$|Shown at the 1969 Tokyo Motor Show, the EX-III was the {{big brother}} of the EX-I. The larger body was even more aerodynamic, being built very low with a pointed front (no bumper), a long bonnet, sharply sloped sides and a tapered rear. Large <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> hinted at a gas turbine engine but no details were given.|$|R
50|$|Changes {{from the}} X120 {{generation}} include {{the elimination of}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> diffuser, 6-speed automatic for AWD models and a return to the hinge design trunk instead of lift support.|$|E
50|$|Prototypes Two and Three {{featured}} developmental improvements {{including a}} lighter three-frame chassis central periscope providing rearward vision, larger side windows, recessed headlights and a roof-mounted stabilizer with rear-facing <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first chassis was {{assembled}} in early October 2012, completed on 30 January and launched on 5 February. The CT03 aroused controversy during pre-season testing. Lotus technical director James Allison observed {{details of the}} car's <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> that he believed contravened Article 5.8.4 of the technical regulations, that prohibits the use of bodywork within a defined area {{with respect to the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet.</b> The FIA later deemed this system to be illegal. After driving the car during FP1 at Bahrain, Heikki Kovalainen stated the car was basically the previous year's car with nothing done to it.|$|E

50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{overcome}} the restrictive exhaust-port design of the Nailhead, Buick drag racing enthusiasts in the 1960s adapted superchargers with a custom camshaft to feed intake air in through the exhaust ports; the larger intake ports became the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets.</b> Perhaps this feat of ingenuity, and the unusual appearance of the engine modified in this manner, also intimidated rival racers {{and contributed to the}} Nailhead V8 legend in US auto history.|$|R
5000|$|The Cologne V6 {{was made}} to be very {{compatible}} in installation with the Ford Taunus V4 engine, having the same transmission bolt pattern, the same engine mounts, and in many versions, a cylinder head featuring [...] "siamesed" [...] exhaust passages, which reduced the three <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> down to two on each side. The latter feature was great for compatibility, but poor for performance. The 2.4, 2.9, and 4.0 had three exhaust ports, making them preferable.|$|R
50|$|Contrary to {{statements}} that the R-7 was {{based largely on}} experience and assistance of German scientists, the missile is noteworthy for looking beyond past achievements that had used German ideas. For example, instead of using jet vanes for control, which increased resistance generated at the engine nozzle <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet,</b> the R-7 used special control engines. These same engines served as the last stage’s vernier thrusters.|$|E
50|$|AMX-10Ps {{have a very}} distinctive, pointed {{hull and}} a sloping glacis plate, with the driver's {{position}} plainly visible to the left. The hull roof is horizontal as well as sloped slightly inwards, accommodating a turret ring near {{the centre of the}} chassis. Both hull sides are vertical and lack firing ports. There is a circular <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> {{on the right side of}} the hull above the second and third road wheels.|$|E
5000|$|A {{first in}} its class is the rear bumper with {{integrated}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet,</b> which later {{made its way}} on to the corresponding model year Lexus LS series and the Toyota Crown.
