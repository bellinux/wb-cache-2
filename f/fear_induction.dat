40|$|Within {{a second}} of seeing an {{emotional}} facial expression, people typically match that expression. These rapid facial reactions (RFRs), often termed mimicry, are implicated in emotional contagion, social perception, and embodied affect, yet ambiguity remains regarding the mechanism(s) involved. Two studies evaluated whether RFRs to faces are solely nonaffective motor responses or whether emotional processes are involved. Brow (corrugator, related to anger) and forehead (frontalis, related to fear) activity were recorded using facial electromyography (EMG) while undergraduates in two conditions (<b>fear</b> <b>induction</b> vs. neutral) viewed fear, anger, and neutral facial expressions. As predicted, <b>fear</b> <b>induction</b> increased fear expressions to angry faces within 1000 ms of exposure, demonstrating an emotional component of RFRs. This did not merely reflect increased fear from the induction, because responses to neutral faces were unaffected. Considering RFRs {{to be merely}} nonaffective automatic reactions is inaccurate. RFRs are not purely motor mimicry; emotion influences early facial responses to faces. The relevance of these data to emotional contagion, autism, and the mirror system-based perspectives on imitation is discussed...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE A case is {{presented}} and a systematic {{review of the}} literature is provided to update our current knowledge of induction of fear by cortical stimulation. METHODS We present a case of refractory epilepsy associated with a lesion where fear could be induced by intraoperative electrical stimulation of the posterior inner part of the superior temporal gyrus. We performed a systematic {{review of the literature}} using PubMed with the key words "epilepsy AND emotion", "cortical stimulation AND emotion," and "human brain stimulation AND behavior". RESULTS Intraoperative cortical stimulation of the inner part of the posterior superior temporal gyrus reliably induced fear and progressive screaming behavior. Stimulation through subdural grid electrodes did not induce this phenomenon. A systematic review of the literature identified <b>fear</b> <b>induction</b> by stimulation of different widespread cortical areas including the temporal pole, the insula, and the anterior cingulate cortex. The posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus has so far not been associated with <b>fear</b> <b>induction</b> after electrical stimulation. CONCLUSION Although our observation suggests that this area of the brain could be part of a network involved in the elicitation of fear, dysfunction of this network induced by epilepsy could also explain the observed phenomenon. Electrophysiologic and imaging studies must be conducted to improve our understanding of the cortical networks forming the neuroanatomical substrate of higher brain functions and experiences such as fear...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} fear and anger {{content in the}} political rhetoric of former U. S. President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the period 2001 - 2003. A total of 49 terrorism-related speeches were coded for content that could plausibly elicit fear or anger in listeners. Although anger and <b>fear</b> <b>inductions</b> {{were present in the}} vast majority of coded speeches, the percentage of speeches containing emotional content varied widely over time and between speakers, with the highest levels present in the lead-up to the War in Iraq. The content of Bush's communication was also considered alongside polling data measuring presidential approval and fear of falling victim to a terrorist attack. Results indicate that fear content in political rhetoric was not associated with significant changes in public fear of terrorism. However, the presence of emotional content did coincide with declining presidential approval. This finding is consistent with claims that emotional appeals are selectively deployed at times of declining public support for governments and their counter-terrorism policies. However, the lack of relationship between fear content and fear levels also raises questions about the purpose and effectiveness of alleged fear appeals...|$|R

40|$|Music is used {{to induce}} moods in {{experimental}} settings {{as well as for}} therapeutic purposes. Prior studies suggest that subjects listening to certain types of music experience strong moods and show physiological responses associated with the induced emotions. We hypothesized that cardiovascular and respiratory patterns could discriminate moods induced via music. 18 healthy subjects listened to 12 music clips, four each to induce happiness, sadness, and fear, while cardiovascular and respiratory responses were recorded using an electrocardiogram and chest strain-gauge belt. After each clip subjects completed a questionnaire. Subjects consistently reported experiencing the targeted mood, suggesting successful mood induction. Cardiovascular activity was measured by calculating time domain measures and heart rate changes during each clip. Respiratory activity was measured by total, inspiration, and expiration lengths as well as changes in mean respiration rate during each clip. Evaluation of individuals' patterns and mixed-model analyses were performed. Contrary to expectations, the time domain measures of subjects' cardiovascular responses did not vary significantly between the induced moods, although a heart rate deceleration was found during the sadness inductions and acceleration during the <b>fear</b> <b>inductions.</b> The time domain respiratory measures varied with clip type: the mean breath length was longest for the sad <b>induction,</b> intermediate during <b>fear,</b> and shortest during the happiness induction. However, analysis using normalized least mean squares adaptive filters to measure time correlation indicated that much of this difference may be attributable to entrainment of respiration to characteristics of the music which varied between the stimuli. Our findings point to the difficulty in detecting psychophysiological correlates of mood induction, and further suggest that part of this difficulty may arise from failure to differentiate it from tempo-related contributions when music is used as the inducer...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{confirmation}} bias in children without explicitly inducing fear. Eighty non-clinical children (7 - 13 years) were shown pictures of a neutral animal (quokka) and two dangerous-looking animals (aye aye and possum). For each animal, levels of perceived fear, threat and request for additional threatening or non-threatening information were obtained. A behavioral approach test (BAT) was included as behavioral measure of fear. The results indicated that the aye aye and possum were rated as more threatening and fearful than the quokka. For the aye aye and possum higher fear levels coincided with search for more threatening than non-threatening information. This pattern was absent in non-fearful children and for the non-threatening quokka. During the BAT the quokka was more often approached first compared to the aye aye and possum. Our findings suggest that confirmation bias in children can be observed without using verbal <b>fear</b> <b>induction...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} was to examine whether borderline personality (BP) features moderate the effect of social rejection on impulsive behaviours. Previous research suggests that individuals with BPD report greater impulsiveness than nonpsychiatric controls and that following a <b>fear</b> <b>induction,</b> university students high in BP features engage in more impulsive responding than low BP individuals. In the present study, 77 individuals from a mixed community and undergraduate sample were randomly assigned to either listen to and visualize a social rejection scenario, or to sit through a neutral emotion induction. Impulsive responding was then measured in a passive avoidance learning task. Against prediction, BP features failed to moderate the relationship between assigned condition and the frequency of impulsive responses. This suggests that social rejection operates distinctly from other forms of negative emotional experience (e. g., fear) that have been shown to elicit more impulsive responding in individuals high in BP features...|$|E

In this Study we examined whether pre-existing behavioral differences, and/or behavioral differences displayed during <b>fear</b> <b>induction,</b> predict {{the severity of the}} conditioned fear response that can develop after an episode of psychosocial conflict.

Results: Upon return to this territory 24 h later, intruders moved less than controls and produced more distress vocalizations, indicating conditioned fear to context. Additionally, analyses revealed that both pre-existing behavioral differences, and the animal's response during social conflict, predicted the magnitude of the subsequent conditioned fear response. Specifically, animals that engaged in higher levels of novel environment exploration, that exhibited it greater number of defensive burying behaviors, and that demonstrated higher levels of fighting and guarding during social conflict, displayed less evidence of conditioned fear.

40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} agent bleomycin is <b>feared</b> for its <b>induction</b> of sometimes fatal pulmonary toxicity, {{also known}} as bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP). The central event {{in the development of}} BIP is endothelial damage of the lung vasculature due to bleomycin-induced cytokines and free radicals. Ultimately, BIP can progress in lung fibrosis. The diagnosis is established by a combination of clinical symptoms, radiographic alterations, and pulmonary function test results, while other disorders resembling BIP have to be excluded. Pulmonary function assessments most suitable for detecting BIP are those reflecting lung volumes. The widely used transfer capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide appeared recently not to be specific when bleomycin is used in a polychemotherapeutic regimen. There are no proven effective treatments for BIP in humans, although corticosteroids are widely applied. When patients survive BIP, they almost always recover completely with normalization of radiographic and pulmonary function abnormalities. This review focuses on BIP, especially on the pathogenesis, risk factors, and its detection...|$|R

40|$|Emotions {{influence}} {{information processing}} {{because they are}} assumed to carry valuable information. We predict that induced anger will increase ethnic but not gender intergroup bias because anger is related to conflicts for resources, and ethnic groups typically compete for resources, whereas gender groups typically engage in relations of positive interdependence. Furthermore, we also predict that this increased ethnic intergroup bias should only be observed among men because men show more group-based reactions to intergroup conflict than women do. Two studies, with 65 and 120 participants, respectively, indeed show that anger induction increases ethnic but not gender intergroup bias and only for men. Intergroup bias was measured with an implicit measure. In Study 2, we additionally predict (and find) that <b>fear</b> <b>induction</b> does not change ethnic or gender intergroup bias because intergroup bias is a psychological preparation for collective action and fear is not associated with taking action against out-groups. We conclude {{that the effect of}} anger depends on its specific informational potential in a particular intergroup context. These results highlight that gender groups differ on a crucial point from ethnic groups and call for more attention to the effect of people's gender in intergroup relations research. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, on {{differentiated}} emotions in healthy volunteers. In order to induce differentiated emotions, film excerpts were {{selected on the basis}} of the type of emotion they induced (fear, anger and for affective tone neutral film). For 6 days (D 1 to D 6), ten healthy volunteers received lorazepam (1 mg bid) or placebo in a randomized cross-over double-blind trial. During each treatment period, emotional induction occurred on D 4, D 5 and D 6. One film excerpt (fear, anger or neutral) was presented each morning after relaxation. Evaluation was performed before and after each emotional induction and included questionnaires (Differential Emotions Scale and physical activation visual analog scales), and neurophysiological parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and norepinephrine levels). Globally, the film excerpts induced the predicted emotions. An analysis of variance was undertaken and revealed a significant effect of lorazepam versus placebo. On the Differential Emotions Scale and during <b>fear</b> <b>induction,</b> lorazepam induced a significantly higher increase in fear, anxiety and disgust emotions than placebo, whereas no effect was observed after anger induction. Lorazepam also induced a significantly higher increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure with no change in heart rate, and physical activation items ("tears" and "faster breathing") without no significant change in norepinephrine. In conclusion, our results are consistent with an overall increase in emotional reactivity with lorazepam (1 mg bid) as compared to placebo. The pertinence of film-induced differentiated emotions has to be confirmed for clinical pharmacological use...|$|E
40|$|Current {{treatments}} for anxiety disorders are effective but {{limited by the}} high frequency of clinical relapse. Processes underlying relapse {{are thought to be}} experimentally modeled in fear conditioning experiments with return <b>fear</b> (ROF) <b>inductions.</b> Thereby reinstatement-induced ROF might be considered a model to study mechanisms underlying adversity-induced relapse. Previous studies have reported differential ROF (i. e. specific for the danger stimulus) but also generalized ROF (i. e. for safe and danger stimuli), but reasons for these divergent findings are not clear yet. Hence, the response pattern (i. e. differential or generalized) following reinstatement may be of importance for the prediction of risk or resilience for ROF. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate state anxiety as a potential individual difference factor contributing to differentiability or generalization of return of fear. Thirty-six participants underwent instructed fear expression, extinction and ROF induction through reinstatement while physiological (skin conductance response, fear potentiated startle) and subjective measures of fear and US expectancy were acquired. Our data show that, as expected, high state anxious individuals show deficits in SCR discrimination between dangerous and safe cues after reinstatement induced ROF (i. e. generalization) as compared to low state anxious individuals. The ability to maintain discrimination under aversive circumstances is negatively associated with pathological anxiety and predictive of resilient responding while excessive generalization is a hallmark of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we suggest that experimentally induced ROF might prove useful in predicting relapse risk in clinical settings and might have implications for possible interventions for relapse prevention...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of oral contraceptives (OCs) on emotional reactivity and cognitive ability. Previous research has suggested that OC users may experience blunted positive affect (PA) reactivity and that some women also experience negative mood side effects from OCs. In the present study, 149 participants (58 OC users, 46 nonusers, and 38 men) viewed three different emotional videos paired with music intended to evoke either happiness, sadness, or fear. After each emotional video, participants completed a facial emotions recognition task, and a GoNogo task of inhibition. The hypothesis that women taking OCs would have lower PA reactivity compared to nonusers and men was not supported. However, a sex difference in negative emotional reactivity (women > men) was found and was strongest in OC users (OC users > men) and longer duration OC users. While a small sample size reduces validity of the findings, the hypothesis that OC users with current negative mood side effects would have faster response times than nonusers and men was not supported. However, a sex difference was evident in that men had slower response times to negative faces. Also, men had slower response times than OC users, after sad and <b>fear</b> mood <b>inductions.</b> There was partial support for the third hypothesis that OC users would have more errors of commission than nonusers and men. OC users (and women as a group) made more errors of commission during the GoNogo task compared to men, but only after the happy mood induction. Also, OC users with current negative mood side effects had fewer errors of commission after the sad mood induction compared to OC users with no mood side effects. Possible mechanisms are discussed for OC-associated impulsivity and for the possible reversal of such an effect in women experiencing OC mood side effects...|$|R
40|$|Affect {{appears to}} have a central role in people’s risk {{perception}} and decision-making. It is, therefore, important that researchers and communicators know how risk communication can induce affect or more specific emotions. In this paper, several studies that examined affect-inducing cues presented in and around risk communication are discussed. We thereby distinguish between integral affect induction, meaning through the risk message, and incidental affect induction, which occurs unintentional through the risk communication context. The following cues are discussed: emotion <b>induction,</b> <b>fear</b> appeals, outrage factors, risk stories, probability information, uncertainty information and graphs and images. Relatively few studies assessed the effect of their risk communication material on affect or specific emotions. Incidental affect induction appeared to occur more often than expected based on its factual content. Risk communication easily seems to induce affect incidentally and, thus, may be difficult to control. We, therefore, argue that incidental affect induction is more influential than integral affect induction. Implications for further research and risk communication in practice are given. Based on this overview, we strongly suggest considering and empirically assessing the affect-inducing potential of risk communication formats and content during their development and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{generate}} socially conditioned fear in two different strains of rat (Wistar, W and Sprague Dawley, SD) using social conflict, in order to investigate whether the magnitude of the conditioned fear responses in each strain was related to behaviour exhibited prior to or during <b>fear</b> <b>induction</b> (i. e. social conflict). On day one of the study, all intruders were assessed for exploratory activity in a novel environment. Twenty four hours following the novel environment test the locomotor activity of the intruders was assessed, while they underwent a single familiarisation exposure to the arena in which the conflict was subsequently to occur in. Twenty-four hours following familiarisation, intruders underwent either a 10 min social conflict or sham conflict session. One day later we examined the response of the intruders when they were returned to the vacant resident 2 ̆ 7 s cage. Upon return to the conflict context, we examined the intruder 2 ̆ 7 s ultrasonic distress vocalisations {{and the extent to which}} locomotor activity was inhibited. We found that W rats displayed significantly more immobility (i. e. conditioned fear) upon return to context than did SD rats (p < 0. 05). Importantly, we observed that the differences in the two strains behaviour upon return to context appeared to be related to their quite different patterns of coping behaviour. The results {{of the current study}} indicate that preclinical between-strain comparisons potentially have much to offer in regard to understanding the basis of resilience to social stress. <br /...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Many {{patients}} with blood, injection, and injury (BII) phobia respond to specific stimuli with vasovagal dysregulation and fainting. However, {{little is known}} about the role of hyperventilation in the distress of these patients. Hyperventilation, defined by subnormal arterial pCO 2 levels, induces anxiety and may promote the development of fainting. We studied end-tidal pCO 2 in 12 {{patients with}} BII phobia and 14 nonanxious controls during presentation of emotional films. METHOD: Ten film clips were shown, two in each of 5 categories: pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, BII-related (surgery), and asthma-related (portraying labored breathing). For each subject, two subsets were created, each containing one clip from each category. For one subset, the instruction was simply to view the film, and for the other subset, to view the film while tensing the leg muscles. PCO 2, heart rate, blood pressure, and leg electromyogram were recorded continuously during viewing, and self-report of symptoms and emotion was collected after each film. RESULTS: Patients reported the greatest anxiety and disgust during surgery films. PCO 2 was relatively stable throughout all categories except surgery films, during which minima were below 30 mm Hg, indicating significant hypocapnia. Cardiovascular variables suggested biphasic patterns in two patients with BII phobia. These patients, together with one additional patient and one control who were close to fainting after or during one surgery film, also showed a marked fall in pCO 2) Leg muscle tension raised heart rate and systolic blood pressure for all films, but was not related to near-fainting or endurance in surgery film viewing. CONCLUSION: Hyperventilation is part of the fear response of patients with BII phobia, but was transitory in experimental <b>fear</b> <b>induction</b> using surgery films. Its role in real-life exposure and fainting deserves further study...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the function of}} biological, personality, and cognitive factors as predictors of violence and aggression in children, adolescents, and adults. Chapter 2 sought to understand biopsychosocial profiles of aggressive groups of children (N = 110). Children who engaged in more severe forms of aggressive behavior were highest in psychopathic traits, and most distinct from other aggressive and nonaggressive children on biological indices of prefrontal functioning. This group of children displayed fewer executive functioning deficits compared to other aggressive children, which may explain their ability to implement planned aggression. Chapter 3 included 60 adolescents from Emotional and Behavioral Difficulties (EBD) schools and 62 adolescents from a stratified community school sample (N = 696). The aim was to test the association between callous-unemotional (CU) traits and fearlessness using cardiovascular measures of sympathetic (pre-ejection period) and parasympathetic reactivity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) during <b>fear</b> <b>induction,</b> and self-report measures of fear. Adolescents high in CU traits, from both samples, exhibited high levels of conduct problems and aggression. No group differences emerged on self-report of fear, but the high CU group did display a unique autonomic profile when experiencing fear. This pattern of biological reactivity, a coactivation of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, may suggest adolescents high in CU traits {{are better able to}} manage fearful situations by remaining physiologically calm yet alert. This may explain why individuals with CU traits have been previously characterized as fearless. Chapter 4 included 182 female offenders, and aimed to predict misconducts over 9 -months. Callous and antisocial psychopathic traits best predicted violence, while impulsivity and antisocial psychopathic traits predicted nonviolent misconducts. The key findings across all chapters show psychopathic traits, regardless of age and population type (forensic, clinical, and community), were related to high levels of aggressive and antisocial behavior, and a host of biological and cognitive differences. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} suggests that mechanisms related to the introduction and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) {{may be associated with}} long-term memory (LTM) processes. Previous studies from our group suggested that factors known to function in DNA recombination/repair machineries, such as DNA ligases, polymerases, and DNA endonucleases, play a role in LTM. Here we report data using C 57 BL/ 6 mice showing that the V(D) J recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG 1), which encodes a factor that introduces DSBs in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, is induced in the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus, after context <b>fear</b> conditioning. Amygdalar <b>induction</b> of RAG 1 mRNA, measured by real-time PCR, was not observed in context-only or shock-only controls, suggesting that the context fear conditioning response is related to associative learning processes. Furthermore, double immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the neuronal localization of RAG 1 protein in amygdalar sections prepared after perfusion and fixation. In functional studies, intra-amygdalar injections of RAG 1 gapmer antisense oligonucleotides, given 1 [*]h prior to conditioning, resulted in amygdalar knockdown of RAG 1 mRNA and a significant impairment in LTM, tested 24 [*]h after training. Overall, these findings suggest that the V(D) J recombination-activating gene 1, RAG 1, {{may play a role in}} LTM consolidation...|$|R

We aimed to investigate subjective and brain responses during anticipatory <b>fear</b> and subsequent <b>induction</b> of vestibular pain {{in women with}} GPPPD. Methods: Women with GPPPD (n =  18) and age-matched healthy controls (HC) (n =  15) underwent fMRI scanning during vestibular pain induction at individually titrated pain threshold after a cued anticipation period. (Pain-related) fear and anxiety traits were measured with questionnaires prior to scanning, and anticipatory fear and pain intensity were rated during scanning using visual analog scales. Results: Women with GPPPD reported {{significantly higher levels of}} anticipatory fear and pain intensity. During anticipation and pain induction they had stronger and more extensive brain responses in regions involved in cognitive and affective aspects of pain perception, but the group difference did not reach significance for the anticipation condition. Pain-related fear and anxiety traits as well as anticipatory fear ratings were positively associated with pain ratings in GPPPD, but not in HC. Further, in HC, a negative association was found between anticipatory fear ratings and brain responses in regions involved in cognitive and affective aspects of pain perception, but not in women with GPPPD. Conclusions: Women with GPPPD are characterized by increased subjective and brain responses to vestibular pain and, to a lesser extent, its anticipation, with fear and anxiety associated with responses to pain, supporting the introduction of anticipatory fear as a criterion of GPPPD in DSM- 5...|$|R

To assess the validity of these concerns, we have retrospectively compared two autotransfusion devices: one without (the modified Bentley device) and one with (the Baylor Rapid Autologous Transfusion system) a cell washing step, over a 48 -month period. In the Bentley group (n = 13), the mean estimated blood loss was 8, 423 ml and the mean amount of blood autotransfused was 1, 826 ml.

The measurement of concrete doses was made in one screening centre center located in western bohemia region. The group of observed patients at the age of 45 - 59 was divided into three categories. The object of measurement was an average dose received during the screening mammography, plus an average dose received during an additional mammography, which may sometimes occure during the examination.
