30|$|<b>External</b> <b>triggers</b> for {{destabilizing}} liposomes include heat, light, and ultrasound. Heat {{can also}} be generated using alternating magnetic field. It is noteworthy that thermosensitive liposomes (ThermoDoxÂ®, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials) are thus far the best-studied example of triggerable nanoparticles [8]. Among different <b>external</b> <b>triggers,</b> light provides unparalleled spatio-temporal control and is easy to access and patient-friendly. Thus, liposomes responsive to light have great potentials in topical and transdermal drug delivery and can readily be used for delivering drugs to superficial tissues like skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.|$|R
5000|$|Pulse {{duration}} {{can also}} affect lifetime. Very long pulses can strip {{large amounts of}} material from the cathode, depositing it on the walls. With very short pulse durations, {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the arc is centered in the lamp, far away from the glass, preventing serious wall ablation. <b>External</b> <b>triggering</b> is not usually recommended for short pulses. Simmer voltage triggering is usually used for extremely fast discharges, as are used in dye lasers, and often combine this with a [...] "pre-pulse technique", where as a small flash is initiated just milliseconds before the main flash, to preheat the gas for a faster rise time.|$|E
50|$|No {{definitive}} conclusions {{have been}} reached on {{the reasons behind}} the 1987 Crash. Stocks {{had been in a}} multi-year bull run and market P/E ratios in the U.S. were above the post-war average. The S&P 500 was trading at 23 times earnings, a postwar high and well above the average of 14.5 times earnings. Herd behavior and psychological feedback loops play a critical part in all stock market crashes but analysts have also tried to look for <b>external</b> <b>triggering</b> events. Aside from the general worries of stock market overvaluation, blame for the collapse has been apportioned to such factors as program trading, portfolio insurance and derivatives, and prior news of worsening economic indicators (i.e. a large U.S. merchandise trade deficit and a falling U.S. dollar, which seemed to imply future interest rate hikes).|$|E
50|$|Series {{triggering}} is {{more common}} in high powered, water-cooled flashtubes, such as those found in lasers. The high-voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series, (one lead to an electrode and the other to the capacitor). The trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp, without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp. The advantages are better insulation, more reliable triggering, and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass, but at a much higher cost. The series-triggering transformer also acts as an inductor. This helps to control the flash duration, but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications. The triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at the capacitor than is required for <b>external</b> <b>triggering.</b> However, the trigger-transformer becomes part of the flash circuit, and couples the triggering-circuit to the flash energy. Therefore, because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance, the transformer, triggering-circuit, and silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) must be able to handle very high peak-currents, often in excess of 1500 amps.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, {{the design}} and {{construction}} of smart materials capable of switching into a polyzwitterionic state by an <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> have been intensively pursued. Polyzwitterionic states have unique antifouling and surface properties and <b>external</b> <b>triggers,</b> such as pH, light, ions, electric field and CO 2, cause significant changes in materials with regard to overall charge, ionic strength and wettability. This survey highlights current progress in the irreversible {{as well as the}} reversible switching process involving polyzwitterionic moieties, which can, in turn, be applied to studying the interaction of various interfaces with biological species as protein, DNA, bacteria or platelets and also for advanced use...|$|R
50|$|In some instances, static {{electricity}} can attract particulates {{to the skin}} and can also cause body hair to move, giving a sensation like insects crawling over the skin. However, in many cases no <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> creates the sensation.|$|R
50|$|Very rapid rise-times {{are often}} {{achieved}} using a prepulse technique. This method is performed by delivering a small flash through the lamp {{just before the}} main flash. This flash is of much lower energy than the main flash (typically less than 10%) and, depending on the pulse duration, is delivered just a few thousandths to a few millionths of a second before the main flash. The prepulse heats the gas, leaving a good quantity of ionized particles {{to be used by}} the main flash. This greatly decreases the rise time. It also reduces the shock wave and makes less noise during operation, vastly increasing the lifetime of the lamp. It is especially effective on very fast-discharge applications, allowing the arc to expand faster and better fill the tube. It is very often used with simmer voltage and sometimes with series triggering, but rarely used with <b>external</b> <b>triggering.</b> Prepulse techniques are most commonly used in the pumping of dye lasers, greatly increasing the conversion efficiency. However, it has also been shown to increase the efficiency of other lasers with longer fluorescence lifetimes (allowing longer pulses), such as Nd:YAG or titanium sapphire, by creating pulses with almost square waveforms.|$|E
5000|$|Simmer-voltage {{triggering}} is {{the least}} common method. In this technique, the capacitor voltage is not initially applied to the electrodes, but instead, a high voltage spark streamer is maintained between the electrodes. The high current from the capacitor is delivered to the electrodes using a thyristor or a spark gap. This type of triggering is used mainly in very fast rise time systems, typically those that discharge in the microsecond regime, such as used in high-speed, stop-motion photography or dye lasers. The simmering spark-streamer causes the arc to develop in the exact center of the lamp, increasing the lifetime dramatically. If <b>external</b> <b>triggering</b> is used for extremely short pulses, the spark streamers may still be {{in contact with the}} glass when the full current-load passes through the tube, causing wall ablation, or in extreme cases, cracking or even explosion of the lamp. However, because very short pulses often call for very high voltage and low capacitance, to keep the current density from rising too high, some microsecond flashtubes are triggered by simply [...] "over-volting", that is, by applying a voltage to the electrodes which is much higher than the lamp's self-flash threshold, using a spark gap. Often, a combination of simmer voltage and over-volting is used.|$|E
5000|$|<b>External</b> <b>triggering</b> is {{the most}} common method of operation, {{especially}} for photographic use. The electrodes are charged to a voltage high enough to respond to triggering, but below the lamp's self-flash threshold. An extremely high voltage pulse, (usually between 2000 and 150,000 volts), the [...] "trigger pulse", is applied either directly to or very near the glass envelope. (Water-cooled flashtubes sometimes apply this pulse directly to the cooling water, and often to the housing of the unit as well, so care must be taken with this type of system.) The short, high voltage pulse creates a rising electrostatic field, which ionizes the gas inside the tube. The capacitance of the glass couples the trigger pulse into the envelope, where it exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas surrounding {{one or both of the}} electrodes, forming spark streamers. The streamers propagate via capacitance along the glass at a speed of 1 centimeter in 60 nanoseconds (170 km/s). (A trigger pulse must have a long enough duration to allow one streamer to reach the opposite electrode, or erratic triggering will result.) The triggering can be enhanced by applying the trigger pulse to a [...] "reference plane", which may be in the form of a metal band or reflector affixed to the glass, a conductive paint, or a thin wire wrapped around the length of the lamp. If the capacitor voltage is greater than the voltage drop between the cathode and the anode, when the internal spark streamers bridge the electrodes the capacitor will discharge through the ionized gas, heating the xenon to a high enough temperature for the emission light.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} sensor nodes {{reduce the}} need for post- deployment physical human interaction by using environmental power and wireless communication; however, they must adapt performance to accommodate the energy availability. This thesis presents three application- independent algorithms that adapt performance based on energy availability for steady and <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> state conditions. Steady state operation describes the periodic execution of a set of tasks on the system. For steady state operation, a method is presented that adapts the execution rate to achieve high performance while maintaining sufficient energy. <b>External</b> <b>trigger</b> state operation occurs when an external device makes a request to the system. For <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> state operation, algorithms are used to determine the execution time, energy consumption and performance of the request. These methods are applied to SHiMmer, a wireless, energy- harvesting structural health monitoring platform. Unlike other sensor systems that periodically monitor a structure and route information to a base station, SHiMmer is designed to acquire data using active sensing and process it locally before communicating with an external device. Results from this application demonstrate the controller's ability to adapt at runtime and maintain sufficient energy. Steady state results show that the execution rate changes with weather conditions. On average, the execution rate on a sunny day increases by 62 % compared to the rate on cloudy days. <b>External</b> <b>trigger</b> state results show that processing significantly affects the efficiency of a structural health monitoring system; specifically, complex processing requires 17 times less execution time and 2. 5 times less energy than transmitting raw data...|$|R

30|$|For the {{considered}} {{model the}} source of free energy for the ballooning instability is the excess of the hot plasma pressure in the radial direction. However, our model {{does not take into}} account few factors which might be significant for the instability development: pressure anisotropy (Cheng and Qian, 1994), drift effect (Miura et al., 1989), kinetic effects (Klimushkin and Mager, 2008), and the azimuthal pressure gradient related to a background field-aligned current (Ivanov et al., 1992; Golovchanskaya and Maltsev, 2003). The ballooning instability can be excited nonlin-early by an <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> (Hurricane et al., 1999).

The connection operated by trigger thrystor (SCR) as a switch and ionized gaseous inside the lamp. After the gaseous breakdown, the current from the capacitor flows continuously through the flashlamp. The output current is initially increased proportion in order to the input energy.

40|$|We re-examine whether substorms are {{triggered}} by solar wind fluctuations or an internal magnetospheric instability {{by comparing the}} statistical associations between substorm onsets and (1) an <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> definition, (2) a simple internal trigger definition of only prior loading of solar wind energy that is {{a subset of the}} <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> definition. Statistical associations are calculated both for observed substorm onsets and onsets generated by a Minimal Substorm Model in which substorms are purely internally triggered. Thence we argue that a minimum interval of prior loading is a necessary condition for substorm onset, a subsequent northward IMF turning is not necessary, and consequently that an internal trigger from a magnetospheric instability is a necessary and sufficient condition for substorm onset. We discuss how this result may explain a report that externally triggered substorms are systematically larger than non-externally triggered substorms...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{indicate that}} some class 0 sources have {{orders of magnitude}} higher accretion rates than those of class I. We investigated the conditions for the high accretion rates of some class 0 sources by numerical calculations, modelling an <b>external</b> <b>trigger.</b> For no <b>external</b> <b>trigger,</b> {{we find that the}} maximum value of the accretion rate is determined by the ratio Î± of the gravitational energy to the thermal one within a flat inner region of the cloud core. The accretion rate reaches â¼ 10 ^- 4 M_ yr^- 1 if the cloud core has Î± > 2. For an <b>external</b> <b>trigger</b> we find that the maximum value of the accretion rate is proportional to the momentum given to the cloud core.
