5|$|Seizing the {{opportunity}} the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in Operation Fortitude, sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton {{was leading the}} Invasion of Europe. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid-1944, the slapping <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors.|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no evidence to suggest the two <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> related.|$|E

5|$|Discontent {{began to}} spread among the people, which {{sometimes}} escalated to violence. Casamance has since experienced years of conflict which put local initiatives in jeopardy, such as nature reserves and the first network of villages. In 1998, {{in the middle of}} the conflict, the French commune of Bon-Encontre committed to providing Carabane with humanitarian aid, both economically and culturally. Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention.|$|E
5|$|Namely {{the country}} has been ranked 85th (of 196 countries), and the 2011 Freedom House report noted {{improvement}} of applicable legislation reflecting Croatia's accession to the EU, yet pointed out instances of politicians' attempts to hinder investigative journalism and influence news reports contents, difficulties regarding public access to information, and that most of print media market is controlled by German-owned Hanza Media and Austrian-owned Styria Media Group. Amnesty International reports that in 2009 in Croatia there was {{an increase in the number}} of physical attacks and murders of journalists. The <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> mainly perpetrated against journalists investigating war crimes and organised crime.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 first ran in 1974. In April 1979, {{the joint}} venture had not {{received}} a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved. The program was saved when Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and Flying Tigers chose the CFM56 to re-engine their DC-8s and shortly thereafter it was chosen to re-engine the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet of the U.S. Air Force. The first engines entered service in 1982. Several fan blade failure <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail. Both these issues were resolved with engine modifications.|$|E

30|$|The {{prediction}} model must adopt incomplete information because when an <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> reported, {{only part of}} the information on the <b>incident</b> can <b>be</b> obtained for <b>incident</b> duration prediction and even until the <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> cleared. Obtaining all the information that influences the traffic <b>incident</b> duration time <b>is</b> impossible. For example, if no traffic detector is present near the incident location, then obtaining the volume of traffic that passes through the <b>incident</b> location <b>is</b> almost impossible. Thus, the traffic incident duration {{prediction model}} to be developed should have the ability to consider incidents with incomplete information.|$|R

5|$|The ant is notorious in Tasmania, {{where most}} {{fatalities}} have been recorded. In 2005, {{over a quarter}} of all jack jumper sting <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> sustained in Tasmania; excessive in comparison to its 2006 population of only 476,000 people. Jack jumper stings are the single most common cause of anaphylaxis in patients at the Royal Hobart Hospital. The ant has also been a major cause of anaphylaxis outside Tasmania, notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne, while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed. One in 50 adults have been reported to suffer anaphylaxis due to the jack jumper or other Myrmecia ants.|$|E
5|$|Hoepner now {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} French. Being impatient, {{he did not}} wait for his infantry divisions to catch up. Instead, he hoped to continue pushing the French back and not give them time to construct a coherent defence line. German formations pursued the enemy to Gembloux. The Panzer Corps ran into retreating French columns and inflicted heavy losses on them. The pursuit created severe problems for the French artillery. The combat was so closely fought that the danger of friendly fire <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> very real. Nevertheless, the French, setting up new anti-tank screens and Hoepner, lacking infantry support, caused the Germans to attack positions head-on. During the following Battle of Gembloux the two Panzer Divisions reported heavy losses during 14 May and were forced to slow their pursuit. The German attempts to capture Gembloux were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, a {{day before}} Austria was annexed into Greater Germany {{following}} the Anschluss, Justas Lukoševičius, a Lithuanian border patrol, shot Stanisław Serafin, a Polish soldier, on the demarcation line {{in the village of}} Trasninkai near Merkinė. The exact circumstances are not clear as the obscure event was variously portrayed as a Lithuanian provocation, a Polish provocation, or as an unfortunate accident. During the 1920s and 1930s, similar incidents had occurred: between 1927 and 1937 seven Lithuanian border guards were killed during the course of 78 events. Usually, such <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> handled at the local level in an attempt to forestall escalation. On this occasion, however, Polish radio and newspapers picked up the story and fanned anti-Lithuanian sentiment. Protests were held in Warsaw, Vilnius, and four other cities where the crowds shouted for military action against Lithuania. There is evidence that the Camp of National Unity was involved in organizing the protests.|$|E

5|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty-two Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested. Between 23 November and 26 December 1952, ninety-five {{soldiers}} were court martialed and tried by General Court-Martial in fifteen separate trials. Ninety-one {{were found guilty}} and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court-martial of the Korean War. According to cultural historian Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, the government of Puerto Rico, {{caught in the middle}} of a potentially damaging affair that could jeopardize its political agenda, kept silent for nearly two months. Finally, the <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> made known by a local newspaper alerted by several letters written by the imprisoned soldiers to their families. Secret negotiations between the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments took place and the Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved.|$|E
5|$|Patton did not {{command a}} force in combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton's junior in both rank and experience, was {{selected}} to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. This decision had been made before the slapping <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> made public, but Patton blamed them for his being denied the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that the slapping incidents had been an example of Patton's inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive or prone to making mistakes. On January 26, 1944 Patton was formally given command of the Third United States Army in England, a newly arrived unit, and assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy in early 1944 preparing for the pending invasion.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were scheduled to run before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. The first session was held on a wet track from earlier morning rain and lap times reduced as the 90-minute period progressed due to the track drying out. No <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> reported. Timo Bernhard in the No. 1 Porsche led the practice session in its final minutes with a lap time of one minute and 42.182 seconds, eight-tenths of a second faster than Marc Lieb in the sister entry. LMP2 was led by René Rast in G-Drive Racing's No. 26 Oreca 05 Nissan with a fastest timed lap of one minute and 51.617 seconds set in the session's final 15 minutes. The No. 51 AF Corse car driven by Gianmaria Bruni was fastest in LMGTE Pro while Rui Águas in the sister team's No. 83 entry helped the Italian marque to be the fastest vehicle in LMGTE Am.|$|E

5|$|The protests {{involved}} over 2,500 {{people and}} among those present were incumbent parish priest John Barboza, Valerian Fernandes, Ajekar parish priest Valerian Fernandes, Attur parish priest Arthur Pereira, Miyar parish priest Ronald Miranda, Paschal Menezes, Parappady parish priest Alex Aranha, Michael D'Silva, Hirgan parish priest Michael Lobo, Kanajar parish priest Alwyn D'Cunha {{and many other}} priests and nuns in the area. The Christian protestors also clashed with police at St. Sebastian Church in the Permannur area of Ullal {{on the outskirts of}} Mangalore, shouting slogans and throwing stones at the police for their failure to arrest the perpetrators of the attacks. The police arrested several Christians after firing into the air and being involved in a lathi charge. A witness in Permannur claimed that Christians attacked the houses of Hindus in retaliation, shouting slogans against the BJP government. Four people of pro-Hindu organisations were reportedly injured at Kalladka and Attavar {{on the outskirts of the}} Mangalore when their vehicles were attacked and were pelted with stones. Ten people, including one of the Sri Ram Sena activists, were reportedly stabbed during the protests and according to the police, the situation was used by some to settle personal scores and not all stabbing <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> related to attack on churches and the subsequent violence in the city. The Sri Ram Sena protested against the stabbing of one of their activists by organising a shutdown of educational institutions and shops. The district administration responded by declaring a holiday for all educational institutions in Mangalore taluk, and extended prohibitory orders under the Section 144 Criminal Procedure Code for two more days in the wake of the attacks and protests as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|When Hitler and {{his army}} chiefs {{asked for a}} pretext for the {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich Müller masterminded and carried out a false flag project code-named Operation Himmler. German soldiers dressed in Polish uniforms undertook border skirmishes which deceptively suggested Polish aggression against Germany. The <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> then used in Nazi propaganda to justify the invasion of Poland, the opening event of World War II. At {{the beginning of the}} war against Poland, Hitler authorised the killing of Polish civilians, including Jews and ethnic Poles. The Einsatzgruppen (SS task forces) had originally been formed by Heydrich to secure government papers and offices in areas taken over by Germany before World War II. Authorised by Hitler and under the direction of Himmler and Heydrich, the Einsatzgruppen units—now repurposed as death squads—followed the Heer (army) into Poland, and by the end of 1939 they had murdered some 65,000 intellectuals and other civilians. Militias and Heer units also took part in these killings. Under Himmler's orders via the RSHA, these squads were also tasked with rounding up Jews and others for placement in ghettos and concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|Around 8.30 pm on 14 September, miscreants pelted {{stones at}} the chapel of Padua Pre-university College, a Christian college located at Nanthoor, badly {{damaging}} its windows. Around 9.30 pm, miscreants badly damaged a statue located {{in front of}} Carmelites' house in Katkere, near Koteshwar. The Church of St. Sebastian in Permannur was badly damaged, including its windows and furniture. The Holy Cross Church at Kulshekar and St. Joseph, The Worker Church at Vamanjoor were also damaged. Police reports confirmed that Our Lady's Grotto at Vijayamarie Technical Institute and properties at the Infant Jesus Higher Primary School and Mary Hill Convent were also damaged by the miscreants {{on the night of}} 14 September. K. A. Abraham, pastor of Divine Deliverance Prayer Centre at Neerugadde in Shiroor, claimed that over 25 miscreants had attacked his prayer hall, and they were reported to have smashed the window panes, ransacked equipment and set a motorcycle and car on fire. Later, {{in the early hours of}} 15 September, individuals broke into the St. George Church belonging to the Syro Malabar Catholic Rite of the Belthangady Diocese in Ujire, Dakshina Kannada district, 70km from Mangalore and burned the Bible, the carpet, prayer books and desecrated holy icons. Miscreants also ransacked the St. Thomas Church in Gorigandi in Chikkamagaluru district. Seven or eight masked men arriving on scooters were reported to have desecrated the large statue of St. Antony at St. Ann's Friary on Jail Road in Bejai, throwing flower pots to smash its glass covering. The official report into the attacks later claimed that the Bajrang Dal were the likely suspects for the attacks on churches in Chikkamagaluru district, including the Christian Believers' Prayer Hall, Jagadeshwara Church in Mudigere and Carmel Mathe Devalaya in Kudremukh, and had also harassed people gathered at Kapitanio High School in Mangalore. Several people also reportedly invaded the house and prayer meeting of a neo-convert in Singatagere of Kadur taluk. Other areas affected by the attacks include Kalkanady, Falnir, Madyanthar, Makodu, Singatagere, Jayapura, Shaktinagar, Thokottu, Bantwal, Belthangady, Udupi, Kulur, Kundapura, Karkala, Koppa, Balehanoor and Moodbidri. Individuals were also targeted during the event; in Kulur, two men and two children were attacked by a Hindu mob near Gurupur Bridge while on their way to their hometown in a private car, and in Kalladka, the Souza Textile owner and his wife were attacked by unidentified people. Two separate stabbing <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> also reported in Kalladka, and the two men affected were admitted to hospital with serious injuries.|$|E
