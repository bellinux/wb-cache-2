40|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> {{behavior}} of novel polyethylene-based nanocomposite films was investigated, as they re-late to flexible packaging of fresh-cut vegetables, processed foods and biomedical devices. Appropriately designed sealant nanocomposites, which include dispersed montmorillonite nanofillers and ethyl vinyl ac-etate copolymer, produce a hermetic but peelable <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> across a broad, 30 – 40 ◦C, range of <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> temperatures, outperforming optimized commercial polyethylene-based sealants that achieve peelable seals {{in a much}} narrower <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> temperature range, of less than 15 ◦C. Appropriate nanocomposite design leads to a general easy-open/peelable character of <b>heat</b> <b>seals,</b> which is: (a) independent of sealing conditions and apparatus — ranging from long dwell times at very high sealing pressures to very short heat impulses at very low sealing pressures; (b) markedly independent of {{the opposite side of}} the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> — for example, when sealed on itself, on unfilled sealant, or on high density polyethylene; and (c) rather insensitive to for-mulation variations of the sealant — for example, variations of the polyethylene of the ethyl vinyl acetate type and concentration, and of nanofiller loading. Insights from observations of the fracture seal surfaces by infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy reveal that the underlying mechanism of this behavior is related to a synergistic effect of the ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer and the montmorillonite clay nanofiller...|$|R

50|$|A third {{textile layer}} is often {{found between the}} carrier and the {{ballistic}} components. The ballistic panels are covered in a coated pouch or slip. This slip provides the encapsulation of the ballistic materials. Slips are manufactured in two types: <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> hermetic slips and simple sewn slips. For some ballistic fibers such as Kevlar the slip is {{a critical part of}} the system. The slip prevents moisture from the user's body from saturating the ballistic materials. This protection from moisture cycling increases the useful life of the armor.|$|E
50|$|In general a vest's textile {{material}} temporarily degrades when wet. Neutral water at room temp {{does not affect}} para-aramid or UHMWPE but acidic, basic and some other solutions can permanently reduce para-aramid fiber tensile strength. (As a result of this, the major test standards call for wet testing of textile armor.) Mechanisms for this wet loss of performance are not known. Vests that will be tested after ISO type water immersion tend to have <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> enclosures {{and those that are}} tested under NIJ type water spray methods tend to have water resistant enclosures.|$|E

40|$|In this study, polyamide-aluminum foil-polypropylene (PA-Al-PP) {{composite}} {{films with}} different orientation {{status of the}} PP layer were prepared, and their morphology, tensile, peeling and <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior were studied. The comparative study of tensile and fracture behaviors of single-layer film of PA, Al and PP, {{as well as the}} composite films of PA-Al, PP-Al and PA-Al-PP revealed that in PA-Al-PP composite film, the PA layer with the highest tensile strength can share the tensile stress from the Al layer during stretching, while the PP layer with the lowest tensile strength can prevent further development of the small cracks on boundary of the Al layer during stretching. Moreover, the study of <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior suggested that both the orientation status and the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> conditions were important factors in determining the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> strength (HSS) and failure behavior of the sample. Four failure types were observed, and a clear correspondence between HSS and failure types was found. The results also elucidated that for the composite film, only in the cases where the tensile stress was efficiently released by each layer during HSS measurement could the composite film exhibit desired high HSS that was even higher than its tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} bar sealing {{parameters}} on the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> strength of oriented polypropylene (OPP) /metallic cast polypropylene (MCPP) laminate film was investigated. Based {{on the results}} obtained from the parametric study, a bar sealing process window was developed. All points drop within the process window are combinations of platen temperature and dwell time that produce acceptable <b>heat</b> <b>seal.</b> Optimum combinations are indicated by the lower border of the window. The plateau initiation temperature, Tpi of OPP/MCPP laminate film {{used in the present}} study occurred before the final melting temperature, Tmf of the sealant material. The highest achievable <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> strength was at the plateau region, and the corresponding failure modes were delaminating, tearing or combine failure modes (delaminating and tearing). Minimum pressure level of 1. 25 bars is necessary to bring the laminate interface into intimate contact in order to effect sealing...|$|R
50|$|Secondary seals {{are common}} with {{sensitive}} products that may deteriorate or where extra security is needed. Foil or plastic innerseals are used on some bottles, <b>Heat</b> <b>sealed</b> lidding films are used on some tubs. External shrink bands, labels, and tapes are sometimes used outside the primary closure structure. Additionally, many closures feature ventilation to prevent bloating, collapse or explosion due to unequalized pressure during processing or storage. Venting technologies utilize common {{materials such as}} PTFE, PP, etc. These elements are preferred due {{to their ability to}} withstand temperatures of 260°C and water intrusion pressure levels of 770 mbar.|$|E
50|$|Vinyl coated {{polyester}} is {{a material}} frequently used for flexible fabric structures. It {{is made up}} of a polyester scrim, a bonding or adhesive agent, and an exterior PVC coating. The scrim supports the coating (which is initially applied in liquid form) and provides the tensile strength, elongation, tear strength, and dimensional stability of the resulting fabric.Depending on its formula, the PVC coating makes the material waterproof and resistant to dirt, mildew, oil, salt, chemicals and UV rays and gives the material added strength and durability. It can be sewn or <b>heat</b> <b>sealed</b> by way of RF(Radio Frequency) welding or hot-air welding.|$|E
50|$|Metallised {{films have}} a {{reflective}} silvery surface similar to aluminium foil and are highly flammable. The coating also reduces the permeability {{of the film}} to light, water and oxygen. The properties of the film remain, such as higher toughness, {{the ability to be}} <b>heat</b> <b>sealed,</b> and a lower density at a lower cost than an aluminium foil. This gives metallised films some advantages over aluminium foil and aluminium foil laminates. It was thought that metallised films would become a replacement for aluminium foil laminates, but current films still cannot match the barrier properties of foil. Some very high barrier metallised films are available using EVOH, but are not yet cost effective against foil laminates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{the work}} of the GDX 2 {{packaging}} units, commonly appear the defects of BOPP heat-sealing face of the hard small box such as relaxation, wrinkles, bubbles etc. So analyzing the <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> defects and has become the primary task to improve the GDX 2 packaging units quality. This article based on the Matlab image processing technologies offers image recognition of the defects, and extracts the defects information of the image feature. After statistical analyses of the defect information extracted, the location of the defect concentrating region and the area of the defect region can be determined, and the research shows that the result is basically consistent with the actual distribution of the defects of the side of the hardware package of the small box. By using the image processing technology, the extraction of feature information on the <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> defects will be more accurate, and the data information collection of the defect characteristics provides the theoretical basis for analyzing the causes why the defects occur and improving the <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> system of the GDX 2 packaging machine...|$|R
50|$|A hinged blister {{is known}} as a clamshell, used for a variety of products. It {{can be used as a}} {{security}} package to deter package pilferage for small high-value items, such as consumer electronics. It consists of one sheet folded over onto itself and sometimes fused at the edges. They can be securely <b>heat</b> <b>sealed,</b> making them difficult to open by hand to deter tampering. A pair of scissors or a sharp knife is often required to open them (although these are often sold in similar packages). Care must be used to safely open some of these packages, as opening it without care can result in injury; 6,000 Americans are sent to the emergency room each year by injuries suffered in opening such packages.Wrap rage is sometimes the result.|$|E
