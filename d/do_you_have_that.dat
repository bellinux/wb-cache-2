5000|$|In the History of the Latter Han {{version of}} this story, it is Liu Gen himself who does the xiao rather than changxiao whistling. Liu Gen {{was a native of}} Yingchuan. He dwelt in {{seclusion}} on Mount Song. Curiosity seekers came from afar to study the Dao with him. The Governor Shi Qi 史祈 took him for a charlatan and had him arrested and brought in to his offices. He questioned him, saying, [...] "What arts <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>that</b> you mislead and deceive the people so? You will perform a confirmatory feat, or else you will die at once." [...] Liu said, [...] "I truly have no unusual powers, except that I have some small ability to cause people to see ghosts." [...] "Summon one right now," [...] Shi said, [...] "so that I can see it with my own eyes, and only then will I take it as clearly established." [...] At this, Liu Gen looked to the left and whistled 左顧而嘯. In a moment, Shi's deceased father, along with several dozen of his departed relatives, appeared before them, bound. They knocked their heads on the ground toward Liu and said, [...] "Our son has acted wrongly and should be punished!" [...] Then they turned to Shi Qi and said, [...] "As a descendant, not only do you bring no benefit to your ancestors, but you bring trouble to us departed spirits! Knock your head on the ground and beg forgiveness for us!" [...] Shi Qi, stricken with fear and remorse, knocked his head until it ran blood and begged to take the punishment for his crime himself Liu Gen remained silent and made no reply. Suddenly he the ghosts all vanished. (tr. Campany 2002: 249) ...|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, most of Later Jin {{officials}} {{submitted to}} the Liao emperor at least nominally, {{but one of the}} strongest Later Jin generals, Liu Zhiyuan the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), after initially also pretending to submit to Liao, declared himself the emperor of a new Later Han. Li secretly submitted to Liu and encouraged Liu to have a bandit leader, Liang Hui (梁暉), who had submitted to Later Han, attack nearby Xiang Prefecture (相州, in modern Handan), which Liu did, and Liang attacked and captured Xiang. Subsequently, the Liao emperor attacked Xiang, killed Liang, and slaughtered the city. Under the belief that Li had secretly submitted to Later Han, he had Li arrested and accused him of treason, but Li denied the allegations. [...] The Liao emperor pretended to be holding letters that he had intercepted between Li and the Later Han emperor, but Li, seeing through that it was an act, stated, [...] "If this is real, please show me the evidence." [...] The Liao emperor interrogated him six times, but was unable to get him to admit that he had submitted to Later Han. As Khitan laws dictate that a person who does not admit his crimes cannot be put to death, Li was spared and released. [...] Meanwhile, the Liao emperor had been ill, and he stated to Li, [...] "When I advanced south, I was told by others that you said that I will surely be unable to return north.

40|$|What do you owe? What’s most important? How do you decide? When you don’t {{have enough}} money to cover your family’s basic living {{expenses}} and pay all your creditors, you face some difficult financial decisions. It may be tempting to use credit cards, take out a home equity loan or borrow money to pay bills. But taking on more debt is generally not a good idea. Unless your situation turns around quickly it only puts you further behind and creates bigger problems. Instead, focus on cutting your spending and working with your creditors to reduce your payments until your situation improves. When family income is reduced, your spending habits must change. The sooner you change, the more likely your financial problems can be lessened. Your family {{should be part of the}} decision-making process, since their cooperation is essential to carry out the plans. Sizing Up Your Situation When your bills are more than you can pay, you need to contact the people to whom you owe money, your creditors, and explain your situation. Creditors are usually willing to work with you if you contact them before you get behind in your payments. Before you can talk to your creditors, you need to take a hard look at your situation and make some decisions about how much, and when you can pay each creditor. Answer these questions: How long is your present financial situation likely to last? How much income can you count on each month? How much money is needed to cover your family’s essential monthly living expenses? How many creditors do you owe and what is the total amount you owe?

40|$|The {{controversy}} over the 65 % Solution underscores the public’s perception that school libraries do not provide vital instructional programs. This legislation, which has been enacted in states such as Texas, Kansas and Louisiana, pumps 65 percent of a state’s educational budget into direct classroom resources (Toppo 2006). Unfortunately, school library media specialists are classified as non-instructional, support personnel according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This has led the American Association of School Librarians to produce a position statement on the instructional classification of school library media specialists ([URL] in hopes of including certified library media specialists {{as part of the}} NCES “instruction” classification. Even without the 65 % Solution, however, library media programs are frequently on the chopping block when school budgets shrink. A principal in that predicament recently told me, “I would love to keep my librarian but I have to consider my priorities. I need to retain the positions and programs that show my students are actually learning. ” Indeed! When building level administrators and school advisory councils meet to wrangle over budgets, they seek to support programs that demonstrate positive student growth in areas of high need. The big question is: As a library media specialist, are you able to produce this type of evidence? While many library media specialists spend a major portion of their week engaged in instructional activities, the impact of their teaching is often invisible (Harada and Yoshina 2006). The following are critical questions that library media specialists must wrestle with: How does your library media center support student learning? What compelling evidence <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> students have achieved the learning targets? For library media specialists, who have been comfortable with traditional forms of reporting, responses to the above questions require a dramatic paradigm shift from an object-oriented approach to a student-oriented approach to assessment and evaluation. The object-oriented approach centers on evaluation reports that include statistical counting of “things” such as new acquisitions, circulation figures, and numbers of instructional sessions and planning meetings. The student-oriented approach focuses on assessment of student performance. It involves not only what students learn but also the degree to which student learning is demonstrated (Harada and Yoshina 2005). </p...|$|E

A/C Judson ClarkSqdrn 5 Class 45 -ACadet DetachmentStewart FieldNewburgh, New York [Transcription begins]:Sunday nite Dearest Judson, Golly, here another weekend {{has just}} flown by. Can’t you do {{something}} to slow them down a little and hurry the week in between them. Ever since you said {{that we might be}} mistaking good friendship for love, I’ve been worrying. That may be the way you feel and that’s what I’m afraid of. I know that’s not the way it is with me, though. I’m sure of that. Honey, your mother and sister are really swell. They’re real nice 2 ̆ 6 loads of fun—I like them an awful lot. We had quite a talk about you on the way home. They’re both crazy about you—(me, too) (I mean I’m crazy about you, too) —I really am. You’re so sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful and just wonderful in general. You said you were afraid of getting serious. Why are you afraid? I meant to ask you about that. What’s wrong with that? The only thing is that I’m terribly afraid of falling too hard and getting hurt. It seems to me that someplace I read that the real kind of love was the kind that started or had a real good friendship, too. Oh, well, time alone will tell. Darling, I miss you already. You’ve only been away for a few hours and it seems months already. If this is friendship—well, I don’t think I’ve ever had that kind of a feeling for any friend. There were so darned many things I wanted to write you but now that I’m actually writing all I can think of is how much I love you and miss you. Every weekend seems to be nicer than the one before that. Just being with you is so wonderful. You’re so sweet. (I could go on like that all night). Oh, before I forget. This is really an effort to get my mind away from you for a while. Was talking to Woody and she has to go to school this Saturday morning until one or something like that. But anyhow. Do you think you can get a date with that fellow you were telling me about for her for Saturday night? What would you like to do, honey, anything special? Let’s go easy on your money for a change. I hate to have you spend so much on me. Oh, yes, how about going out with your Mom 2 ̆ 6 sister because I’m sure they’d enjoy seeing you a little bit more. Your Mom is swell about your going out all the time but I think if you took her too she’d enjoy it an awful lot. What do you think? Judson, I’m afraid I’m too serious already. Honestly, it’s really getting pretty bad. Remind me to be more aloof next time I see you. Another thing, remind me to tell you how wonderful you are, too. This letter is slightly different from the ones I usually write, isn’t it. Seems to be in a rut. Oh, yes, please answer all the questions I ask you. I hate people who just ignore questions. It drives me crazy. Don’t forget about your promise not to fly over Pelham unless it’s legal. Please don’t forget about it because I know how much the air corps 2 ̆ 6 flying means to you and I’d hate to see anything happen because of a few minutes of pleasure. Golly, I could just write all night about how much I miss you and everything but you’d get very bored reading it no doubt. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> 40 hour check this week?
