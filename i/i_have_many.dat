We {{share the same}} type of {{religion}} and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.|$|E

He says [...] "my favourites are the McDSP FilterBank for my EQ, the Waves Rvox and Renaissance Compressor as my compressors, the [...] L2, and my favourite reverb is [...] D‑Verb. I also use [...] Echo Farm, Sound Toys Echoboy, and, well that’s pretty much it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> plug-ins, but I don't really use them." [...] He said [...] "I’ve tried convolution reverbs, but they don’t really work. They sound cheap." [...] However, he also stated that the Avid Reverb One sounded substantially better than Altiverb to him.|$|E

[...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>many,</b> many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|While McKellen {{had made}} his sexual {{orientation}} known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, {{it was not until}} 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio. The context that prompted McKellen's decision– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality [...] "... as a kind of pretended family relationship". McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [...] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps {{it would be all right}} for other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|Game Informers Jeremy Zoss {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.25 out of 10, writing [...] "if titles like Fatal Frame represent the psychological end of horror gaming, then The Suffering {{is the equivalent}} of a splatter flick." [...] He concluded [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> positive things to say about this title, I cannot stress enough that it's not for everyone. Like a Friday the 13th movie, I would hardly call this game scary; it lacks the claustrophobia and dread of a survival horror title. It is, however, filled with tons of gore, vulgarity, and offensive material [...] If you think Peter Jackson's true masterpiece is Dead Alive, you'll be right at home with The Suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March 1895, Leskov died, aged 64. The {{funeral service}} {{was held in}} silence, in {{accordance}} with the writer's December 1892 will, forbidding any speeches to be held over his dead body. [...] "I know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> bad things in me and do not deserve to be praised or pitied," [...] he explained. Leskov was interred in the Literatorskiye Mostki necropolis at the Volkovo Cemetery in Saint Petersburg (the section reserved for literary figures). Due to Leskov's purportedly difficult nature (he has been described as despotic, vindictive, quick-tempered and prone to didacticism), he spent the last years of his life alone, his biological daughter Vera (from his first marriage) living far away and never visiting; his son Andrey residing in the capital but avoiding his father.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} on June 25, 2003, criticizing giving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, Paul said, [...] "These medals {{generally}} have been proposed to recognize a life of service and leadership, and not for political reasons—as evidenced by the overwhelming bipartisan support for awarding President Reagan, a Republican, a gold medal. These awards normally go to deserving individuals, which is why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> times offered to contribute $100 of my own money, to be matched by other members, to finance these medals." [...] Texas Monthly awarded him the [...] "Bum Steer" [...] award for voting against a congressional honor for cartoonist Charles Schulz, but also noted, [...] "When he was criticized for voting against the [...] medal, he chided his colleagues by challenging them to personally contribute $100 to mint the medal. No one did. At the time, Paul observed, 'It's easier to be generous with other people's money. [...] In February 2009, he joined with Democratic congressman Harry Mitchell of Arizona to call {{for an end to}} automatic Congressional pay increases, through a proposed amendment to the economic stimulus package.|$|E
