5|$|Karađorđe was feared by {{enemies and}} allies alike {{because of his}} {{volatile}} temper. In 1806, he had ordered that his brother Marinko be hanged. According to one account, Marinko {{had been accused of}} raping a peasant girl. Another suggests that he had been attempting to seduce young women whose husbands were away at the front. Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother's lifeless body <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> the front gate—a warning to others to refrain from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, Miller was {{deployed}} to the RAF station at Great Massingham in Norfolk, East Anglia. He {{was assigned to}} 169 Squadron, flying Mosquito fighter-bombers. Miller's squadron took part in missions against targets on mainland Europe in April and May 1945. They attacked V-1 and V-2 production and test launch sites {{on the island of}} Peenemünde in the North Sea. On 19 April, Miller took part in an attack on a German installation at Flensburg in northern Germany. In May, his squadron was deployed in Operation Fire Bash, to attack Westerland Airfield on the island of Sylt. One of Miller's bombs failed to release and the load <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> a wing. Miller was obliged to land the plane with the bomb still attached. Miller's next mission was delayed by poor weather, by which time Germany had surrendered. His commanding officer ordered him to fly air force personnel over Germany to view the results of Allied bombing. On one flight, Miller broke away from the flying formation and returned to base late because he wanted to fly over Bonn, the birthplace of Beethoven.|$|E

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} when Jack is {{dangling}} from the cliff, Matthew Fox performs the stunt himself, as he considered that relying on stunt doubles [...] "always sort of inhibits the director's ability to shoot it in cool ways." [...] Fox <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> a thirty foot high cliff {{in front of a}} blue screen, that through digital extensions appeared to be hundreds of feet high. However, Fox's long time stunt actor, Steve Blalock, performed Jack's rolling down the mountain before grabbing the edge of the cliff, given Fox considered that [...] "there are some things that I'm not gonna be able to do".|$|E

500|$|First Class {{employed}} 1,150 {{visual effects}} shots, which {{was done by}} six companies: Rhythm & Hues was responsible for Emma Frost, Mystique and Angel, as well as set extensions; Cinesite handled Azazel, the visuals for Cerebro and environment effects; Luma Pictures did Banshee, Havok and Darwin; Moving Picture Company did Beast, Riptide, and the scene where Shaw's yacht is destroyed and he escapes in a submarine; Digital Domain created Sebastian Shaw's powers, and Weta Digital {{was responsible for the}} climactic battle in Cuba. The overall coordination was provided by visual effects designer John Dykstra, who said the biggest difficulty was the tight schedule: [...] "It was slightly less than a year and I've never done anything like that before (Spider-Man was frequently two years)." [...] British company 4dMax employed special 3D scanners to digitize data of the sets and actors which would be used by the effects companies. This allowed for computer-generated sets such as the mirrored nuclear reactor where Magneto battles Shaw—for which the effects team used the mirror maze fight in Enter the Dragon as a reference—and the domed walls of Cerebro. Digital models of Washington and Moscow were also created based on photographs of the actual cities, with the Russian one in particular having vehicles and military hardware based on videos of a 1962 Red Square, and a digital army doing an actual Soviet-style march. With the exception of scenes featuring the actors on ships (shot on a small bridge set) and the X-Jet (done on a set replicating the front two-thirds of the aircraft, which was mounted atop a roller wheel so it could be spun) the naval battle was entirely digital, featuring a simulated ocean and high resolution 3D models of the X-Jet, Shaw's submarine and 16 warships. The designs were mostly based on real vehicles, with the jet being a modified SR-71 Blackbird, the submarine a combination of various models from the 1940s and 1950s, and replicas of the actual US and USSR fleets in the 1960s — though a few were not in service in 1962. A particular Soviet cruiser was a larger version of the Kresta I and II, leading Weta to dub it the Kresta III. Practical effects were still used whenever possible, such as having on location most of the objects young Erik throws after his mother's death, actors and stuntmen <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> wires, and real explosions and light effects as reference for Havok's beams.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis Hine took {{a myriad}} of {{photographs}} providing not only a documentation of the construction, but also a glimpse into common day life of workers in that era. Hine's images provided much fodder for the media, with many news sources publishing daily press releases that featured one of Hine's pictures. According to Jim Rasenberger, Hine [...] "climbed out onto the steel with the ironworkers and <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> a derrick cable hundreds of feet above the city to capture, as no one ever had before (or has since), the dizzy work of building skyscrapers". In Rasenberger's words, Hine turned {{what might have been}} an assignment of [...] "corporate flak" [...] into [...] "exhilarating art". These images were later organized into their own collection. The steelworkers' sheer height enraptured onlookers, with New York magazine writing of the steelworkers: [...] "Like little spiders they toiled, spinning a fabric of steel against the sky".|$|E
2500|$|Giuliani gave much of {{the credit}} for a drop in 2001 crime to Kerik, saying that [...] "Commissioner Kerik took over a police {{department}} that was leading the country in crime declines, and somehow he was able {{to figure out how to}} create even more crime reduction and to do that against a national trend in which crime is going up in {{much of the}} rest of the country." [...] Known in the department as the [...] "beat-cop commissioner," [...] Kerik frequently cruised the city at night with a security detail composed of cops who had been in shootouts, <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> rooftops, hit by bullets, raced into burning buildings, and seen their partners die. During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex-convicts—one a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia—for allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem. As police commissioner, Kerik served on the terrorism committee with the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Criminal Justice Advisory Board for St. John's University.|$|E
