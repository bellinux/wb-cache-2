25|$|Benzene is {{a natural}} {{constituent}} of crude oil {{and is one of}} the elementary petrochemicals. Due to the cyclic continuous pi bond between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon, the second -annulene (-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated Ph–H. Benzene is a colorless and <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>liquid</b> with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as ethylbenzene and cumene, of which billions of kilograms are produced. As benzene has a high octane number, it is an important component of gasoline.|$|E

50|$|Dantec’s FIRESAFE hose is fire {{resistant}} for {{in excess of}} 30 minutes at temperatures up to 1,200 °C. It is designed to carry <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids</b> in environments where there is increased risk of explosion.FIRESAFE is made {{of a series of}} specially designed ceramic cloths and heat reflective films which counter the radiant heat effects of fire. This construction allows vapour to burn off slowly as the increased heat of the liquid inside the hose vaporises and seeks to escape. The fire retardant hose remains intact under fire attack and will not forcefully expel its contents. This construction retains the advantages of composite hose including flexibility and durability.|$|R

40|$|Fluorinated surfactant-based aqueous {{film-forming}} foams (AFFFs) {{are made}} up of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) and are used to extinguish fires involving <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids.</b> The use of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and other perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in some AFFF formulations has been linked to substantial environmental contamination. Recent studies have identified a large number of novel and infrequently reported fluorinated surfactants in different AFFF formulations. In this study, a strategy based on a case-control approach using quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS/MS) and advanced statistical methods has been used to extract and identify known and unknown PFAS in human serum associated with AFFF-exposed firefighters. Two target sulfonic acids [PFOS and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) ], three non-target acids [perfluoropentanesulfonic acid (PFPeS), perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS), and perfluorononanesulfonic acid (PFNS) ], and four unknown sulfonic acids (Cl-PFOS, ketone-PFOS, ether-PFHxS, and Cl-PFHxS) were exclusively or significantly more frequently detected at higher levels in firefighters compared to controls. The application of this strategy has allowed for identification of previously unreported fluorinated chemicals in a timely and cost-efficient way...|$|R

50|$|Ethylbenzene is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H5CH2CH3. It is a <b>highly</b> <b>flammable,</b> colorless <b>liquid</b> with an odor {{similar to that}} of gasoline. This monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is important in the petrochemical industry as an intermediate in the production of styrene, the precursor to polystyrene, a common plastic material. In 2012, more than 99% of ethylbenzene produced was consumed in the production of styrene. Ethylbenzene is also used to make other chemicals, in fuel, and as a solvent in inks, rubber adhesives, varnishes, and paints. Ethylbenzene exposure can be determined by testing for the breakdown products in urine.|$|R

40|$|A steel {{cupboard}} of {{a design}} {{proposed for the}} storage of flammable liquids {{has been subjected to}} an all-enveloping kerosine fire. The interior and contents of the cupboard rapidly reached high temperatures leading to the-collapse of one of the shelves, destruction of gauze vents, fracture of glass bottles and the ignition of their contents, and general distortion of the cupboard. Comparison with the results of earlier tests on wooden cupboards for solvents indicates that the steel cupboard tested afforded much less protection from fire to its contents. It must be expected that any simple steel cupboard even if it were of acceptable integrity would, when exposed to a similar fire, permit its contents to be heated sufficiently for flammable liquids in bottles to escape and ignite.

40|$|It is {{of great}} {{importance}} to develop inorganic solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, thus enabling solid state Li-ion batteries to address the notorious safety issue about the current technology due to use of <b>highly</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>liquid</b> organic electrolytes. On the basis of systematic first principles modelling, we have formulated new inorganic electrolytes with ultra-low activation energies for long-distance diffusion of Li+ ions, through alloying in the cubic Li 6 PA 5 X chalcogenides (chalcogen A; halogen X). We find that the long-distance transportation of Li+ is dictated by inter-octahedral diffusion, as the activation energy for Li+ to migrate over a Li 6 A octahedron is minimal. The inter-octahedral diffusion barrier for Li+ is largely dependent on the interaction with chalcogen anions in the compound. Radical reduction of diffusion barrier for Li+ ions can be realized through isovalent substitution of S using elements of lower electronegativity, together with smaller halogen ions on the X site...|$|E

40|$|Benzene (C 6 H 6) is a <b>highly</b> <b>flammable,</b> colorless <b>liquid.</b> Ubiquitous {{exposures}} {{result from}} {{its presence in}} gasoline vapors, cigarette smoke, and industrial processes. Benzene increases the incidence of leukemia in humans when {{they are exposed to}} high doses for extended periods; however, leukemia risks in humans subjected to low exposures are uncertain. The exposure-dose-response relationship of benzene in humans is expected to be nonlinear because benzene undergoes a series of metabolic transformations, detoxifying and activating, resulting in multiple metabolites that exert toxic effects on the bone marrow. Since benzene is a known human leukemogen, the toxicity of benzene in the bone marrow is of most importance. And because blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, we investigated the effects of benzene on hematopoiesis (blood cell production and development). An age-structured model was used to examine the process of erythropoiesis, the development of red blood cells.

5000|$|Because of {{flammability}} concerns, many product containers list {{safety precautions}} for storage and disposal for varnishes and drying oils {{as they are}} flammable, and materials used to apply the varnishes may spontaneously combust.

A highly important note, that is often over looked, all drying oils, certain alkyds (including paints), and many polyurethanes produce heat (an exothermic reaction) during the curing process.

40|$|Benzene is a <b>highly</b> <b>flammable,</b> colorless <b>liquid,</b> and {{ubiquitous}} exposures {{result from}} {{its presence in}} gasoline vapors, cigarette smoke, and industrial processes. After uptake into the body, benzene undergoes a series of metabolic transformations resulting in multiple metabolites that exert toxic effects on the bone marrow. We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the uptake and elimination of benzene in mice to relate the concentration of inhaled and orally administered benzene to the tissue doses of benzene and its key metabolites. This model {{takes into account the}} zonal distribution of enzymes and metabolisms in the liver, rather than treating the liver as one homogeneous compartment, and considers metabolism in tissues other than the liver. Analysis was done to examine the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the system. We then formulated an inverse problem to obtain estimates for the unknown parameters; data from multiple laboratories and experiments were used. Despite the sources of variability, the model simulations matched the data reasonably well in most cases, showing that the multicompartment metabolism model does improve predictions over the previous model [6] and that in vitro metabolic constants can be successfully extrapolated to predict in vivo data for benzene metabolism and dosimetry. ...|$|R
