"When {{we reached}} the {{projecting}} angle all the loads were over, but the tusks still had to be passed up, and owing to their weight and the smoothness of their surface, {{this was a very}} difficult task. Of course I ought to have abandoned the tusks; often and often have I since reproached myself for not doing so. Indeed, I think that my obstinacy about them was downright sinful, but I was always obstinate about such things, and I could not bear the idea of leaving those splendid tusks which had cost me so much pains and danger to come by. Well, it nearly cost me my life also, and did cost poor Gobo his, as will be seen shortly, {{to say nothing of the}} loss inflicted by my rifle on the enemy. When I reached the projection I found that the men, with their usual stupidity, were trying to hand up the tusks point first. Now the result of this was that those above had nothing to grip except the round polished surface of the ivory, and in the position in which they were, this did not give them sufficient hold to enable them to lift the weight. I told them to reverse the tusks and push them up, so that the rough and <b>hollow</b> <b>ends</b> came to the hands of the men above. This they did, and the first two were dragged up in safety.|$|E
50|$|Sheridan Hollow is, as {{its name}} suggests, a low-lying area (ravine) between two uplands, Capitol Hill {{to the south and}} Arbor Hill to the north.

The Hollow gently slopes up towards the west and at a sharper increase between Henry Johnson Boulevard and Lexington Avenue; the <b>Hollow</b> <b>ends</b> at the eastern edge of West Hill.

40|$|The {{influence}} of edge {{effects on the}} tensile properties of angle-ply laminate composites can be eliminated by using edgeless (round tubular) specimens. However, uniaxial tests with such specimens, static and fatigue, have been generally unsuccessful because of the differential Poisson effect between the test section and the grips. An edgeless cylindrical specimen, developed to circumvent these difficulties, is examined in the present paper. It is a flattened tube consisting of two flat sides connected by curved sections. It can be handled much like the standard flat coupon. The flat ends of the specimen are provided with crossplied fiberglass gripping tabs, the same as used for flat test coupons. As part of the tabbing, the <b>hollow</b> <b>ends</b> must be plugged with inserts to prevent crushing of the ends. A special insert design was developed to minimize detrimental Poisson effects ordinarily introduced by inserts...|$|E

50|$|In practice, a {{flattened}} thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the <b>hollow</b> <b>end</b> to a fixed pipe containing the fluid {{pressure to be}} measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the gear ratio. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations {{in the behavior of}} the Bourdon tube itself. Differential pressure can be measured by gauges containing two different Bourdon tubes, with connecting linkages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{concrete-filled}} steel tubes (CFST) {{in engineering}} structures has become popular {{because of their}} excellent seismic resistance structural properties such as high strength, high ductility and large energy absorption capacity. In CFSTs the surrounding steel tube provides effective confinement to the filled-in concrete and in turn the concrete helps to reduce the potential local buckling of the steel tube resulting improved seismic resistant performance. This study aimed at investigating the benefit of CFST members in railway steel truss bridges susceptible to earthquake loads. Since the end frames of truss bridges are mainly subjected to compressive loads CFST is a good alternative for end raker. The steel weight of the rib can be reduced with CFST and hence the method is economically sound. The seismic behaviour of steel truss bridges with steel and CFST end rakers is discussed {{based on the results}} of nonlinear time history analyses. Five truss bridges were designed with different types of end rakers namely existing HEB <b>end</b> raker, square <b>hollow</b> <b>end</b> raker, three square <b>hollow</b> CFST <b>end</b> raker bridges with varying concrete grades. Time history analyses were performed for transverse direction using selected past earthquakes and natural frequencies, maximum vertical and lateral deflections, residual vertical and lateral deflections and member stresses were checked. It was found that the use of CFST in steel truss bridges can be effectively utilized to improve the seismic resisting performance...|$|R

50|$|The Stölzel valve {{bears the}} name of its inventor, Heinrich Stölzel, who first applied these valves to the french horn in 1814. Until that point, {{there had been no}} {{successful}} valve design, and horn players had to stop off the bell of the instrument, greatly compromising tone quality to achieve partial music.In a Stölzel valve, the air enters through the bottom of the valve casing, up through the <b>hollow</b> bottom <b>end</b> of the piston, and through a port to the valve loop. The air is then led through an oblique port in the piston to a short tube connecting the valves where it is then directed through the second valve and out the bottom.This type of valve, however, had inherent problems. It forced the air to double back on itself and the 90 degree turns disrupted the bore, causing significant undesired back-pressure. These problems were improved upon later by the double-piston valve.|$|R

At first Honda did not admit {{that there was a}} problem but after conducting further research, they decided that the camshaft wear was most likely caused by oil flow issues. Valve clearance issues were also suggested as a possible contributory factor. Honda issued a recall on the bikes and added kink-free oil lines and less restrictive banjo bolts. They also made alterations by drilling holes in the cam lobes and capping off the <b>hollow</b> cam's <b>ends.</b> This did not fix the problem, so Honda went back to the drawing board. The first thought was that the issue was heat related, but after further investigation the real problem was discovered - there was too much clearance in the camshaft bearings. Honda fixed this by changing all the camshafts with new components. This fixed the camshaft issues but the reputation of the Honda V4 was already damaged.|$|R
