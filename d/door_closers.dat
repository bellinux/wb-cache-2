2500|$|In {{the design}} plan, {{the nursing home}} complex only had two {{stairways}}. The first stairways {{are located in the}} first building, near the lobby area and the second stairway is located in the second building. Both stairways had doors that have wire mesh windows and are operated by hydraulic <b>door</b> <b>closers.</b> The complex also had only one elevator which also located in the first building across from the lobby stairway. The exterior walls of the building consisted of brick and concrete blocks surrounded by gypsum board. The interior walls also consistent of gypsum with the outer wall finish consisting of paint, wallpaper, [...] ceramic tile and vinyl. Overall, the entire structural system of the building complex consisted of a reinforced concrete foundation and floor slabs up to [...] thick. All of the floor slabs are supported by fire resistant columns and beams.|$|E
50|$|Surface-mounted <b>door</b> <b>closers</b> come in four variations: slide-track arm, regular arm surface mounted, {{parallel}} arm surface mounted, and top jamb mounted. Overhead <b>door</b> <b>closers</b> {{are typically}} surface mounted, some manufacturers offer concealed models too. Such closers mount inside a pocket {{in the door}} frame or are mounted in the floor directly under the pivot point and are completely concealed.|$|E

50|$|Architectural Ironmongery or (Architectural Hardware) is a {{term used}} for the {{manufacture}} and wholesale distributor of items made from iron, steel, brass, aluminium or other metals, including plastics, for use in all types of buildings.

5|$|Introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system. In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power <b>door</b> and trunk <b>closers,</b> heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|R
50|$|<b>Door</b> <b>closers</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} installed on fire doors, which {{need to be}} closed in case of fire, to help {{prevent the spread of}} fire and smoke. In most countries, their performance will be governed by national standards.|$|E
50|$|There is {{also the}} storm door and screen door {{variation}} of the door closer: As the name implies, these piston shaped closers are used on storm, security, and screen doors which give the home an extra {{line of defense against}} weather, intruders, and insects. Whereas interior closers typically use hydraulics, storm <b>door</b> <b>closers</b> are more typically pneumatic, using air and springs to close the door. Storm <b>Door</b> <b>closers</b> generally have a small metal washer on the rod that is used to lock the closer in the open position when moving stuff in or out, but more recent models such as the Touch 'n Hold door closer have a button to actuate the hold open feature to make this process easier.|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to active}} fire {{protection}} measures, {{passive fire protection}} means do not typically require electric or electronic activation or a degree of motion. Exceptions to that particular rule of thumb are fire dampers (fire-resistive closures within air ducts, excluding grease ducts) and fire <b>door</b> <b>closers,</b> which must move, open and shut in order to work, {{as well as all}} intumescent products, which swell, thus move, in order to function.|$|E
50|$|Historically, locksmiths {{constructed}} or repaired {{an entire}} lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production {{has made this}} less common; {{the vast majority of}} locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including <b>door</b> <b>closers,</b> hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service electronic locks by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.|$|E
50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most <b>door</b> <b>closers</b> use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly {{the first half of the}} sweep range. <b>Door</b> <b>closers</b> which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' <b>door</b> <b>closers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Changes to fire {{protection}} systems or items affecting the structural or fire-integrity or use (occupancy) of a building is subject to regulatory scrutiny. A contemplated change to a facility requires a building permit, or, if the change is very minor, a review by the local fire prevention officer. Such reviews by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) also help to prevent potential problems {{that may not be}} apparent to a building owner or contractors. Large and very common deficiencies in existing buildings include the disabling of fire <b>door</b> <b>closers</b> through propping the doors open and running rugs through them and perforating fire-resistance rated walls and floors without proper firestopping.|$|E

All of the floor slabs are supported by fire resistant columns and beams.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, Weihrauch began {{international}} sale of bicycle parts and mechanical <b>door</b> <b>closers.</b> During World War II, Weihrauch {{was the only}} German factory to continue production of spare parts for bicycles. At {{the end of the}} war, Zella-Mehlis became part of the Soviet occupation zone and In 1948, the Weihrauchs were forced out of their homes and factories by the communist government. Otto Weihrauch became a mechanic and later a gunsmith in Zella-Mehlis. Werner went to work at the Jagdwaffenwerk (Hunting Weapon Factory) in nearby Suhl. Hermann Weihrauch, Jr. moved to the little German village of Mellrichstadt in Bavaria. There, {{with the help of his}} long-time hunting club friends and former customers, and his son Hans, he started the Weihrauch business all over again in the barracks of a pre-war laundry. Spare parts for bicycles were their first and main products.|$|E
