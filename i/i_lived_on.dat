500|$|Rado and Ragni {{brought their}} drafts {{of the show}} to {{producer}} Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition [...] "African Waltz" [...] (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). [...] The composer's lifestyle was {{in marked contrast to}} his co-creators: [...] "I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> Staten Island." [...] "I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni." [...] But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. [...] "We work independently," [...] explained MacDermot in May 1968. [...] "I prefer it that way. [...] They hand me the material. [...] I set it to music." [...] MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs [...] "I Got Life", [...] "Ain't Got No", [...] "Where Do I Go" [...] and the title song. [...] He first wrote [...] "Aquarius" [...] as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.|$|E

In 2010, her books Ek leef van vrugte and <b>I</b> <b>Live</b> <b>On</b> Fruit will be updated and republished by Benedic Books.|$|R

The shock was severe, for though he had never treated me with kindness, still he was my father, and at his death I felt myself alone in the world.|$|E

60|$|JOHN [glorified by {{experiences}} he has {{shared with}} many a gallant soul].
