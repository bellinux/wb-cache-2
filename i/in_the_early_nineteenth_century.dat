5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one {{sat down in the}} pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|Following the First Seminole War and {{a treaty}} with Spain, Florida became a U.S. {{territory}} in 1821. Under pressure from US settlers, Seminole and Black Seminoles began to migrate into {{central and southern}} Florida. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> African-American slaves and Black Seminoles escaped to the Bahamas from Cape Florida, including hundreds in the 1820s, to evade American slavers.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Neoclassical {{architectural}} elements {{began to}} appear in the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many Federal-style row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.|$|E

5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Western Europe, {{in the nineteenth}} century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped together into a Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included octagonal lantern on ogival arches. Other examples included James Playfair's chapel-like Farnell Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered Craig Parish Church (1799). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> examples influenced by the English Perpendicular included Glenorchy Church (1810–11), built by the Earl of Breadalbane, John Paterson's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul's Church, Perth (c. 1800–07) and Fetteresso Church, Stonehaven (1810–12). Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's Collace (1813), or David Hamilton's Old Erskine (1813–14).|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment {{on some of}} the Orkney islands, {{but when}} the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|John Sherman {{was born}} in Lancaster, Ohio on May 10, 1823 to Charles Robert Sherman and his wife, Mary Hoyt Sherman, the eighth of their eleven children. John Sherman's grandfather, Taylor Sherman, a Connecticut lawyer and judge, first visited Ohio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> gaining title to several parcels of land before {{returning}} to Connecticut. After Taylor's death in 1815, his son Charles, newly married to Mary Hoyt, moved the family west to Ohio. Several other Sherman relatives soon followed, and Charles became established as a lawyer in Lancaster. By the time of John Sherman's birth, Charles had just been appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Buckland had not {{provided}} a specific name, as {{was not uncommon}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept. In 1826, Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial, Megalosaurus conybeari, which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a nomen oblitum. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included Megalosaurus in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current valid binomial name, Megalosaurus bucklandii. Until recently, the form Megalosaurus bucklandi was often used, a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original M. bucklandii has priority.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbita {{have been}} used in various {{cultures}} as folk remedies. Pumpkins {{have been used}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> as an anthelmintic for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, pumpkin seed is approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> was Abbotsford House, the residence the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929) and in urban contexts, including the building of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859–69). The rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace and its adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–8 confirmed the popularity of the style.|$|E
5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E

5000|$|David Ricardo was {{the first}} to propose this {{possibility}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century; however, he was unconvinced of its empirical relevance.

5|$|In the arts, Romanticism {{manifested}} itself in literature and drama in {{the adoption of the}} mythical bard Ossian, the exploration of national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his re-building of Abbotsford House <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part of an attempt to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed dramatically}} with the French military expedition to Egypt in 1798, which {{brought with it}} a corps of scholars to examine the surviving ancient monuments. The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt, both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities. Many temple artifacts, from small objects to enormous obelisks, were removed by outside governments and private collectors. This wave of Egyptomania resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel, but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness. The discoveries of the period made possible the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the beginnings of Egyptology as a scholarly discipline.|$|E
