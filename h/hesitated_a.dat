2500|$|On {{their next}} {{possession}} the Colts offense got a break. After two straight incompletions {{to open the}} drive, Unitas uncorked a pass to Eddie Hinton that was both high and behind the receiver. The ball ricocheted off Hinton's hands, was tipped by Dallas defensive back Mel Renfro, then landed {{in the arms of}} tight end John Mackey, who sprinted 75 yards for a touchdown. The Cowboys subsequently blocked Jim O'Brien's extra point attempt to keep the score tied at 6-6, with O'Brien later saying that he was [...] "awfully nervous" [...] and <b>hesitated</b> <b>a</b> second too long before kicking it.|$|E
2500|$|The rise {{of skiing}} as a sport {{considerably}} promoted {{the creation of}} health resorts in the then recently established Lenzerheide and Valbella. [...] They <b>hesitated</b> <b>a</b> long time in promoted tourism, and showed themselves, to this end, as less accessible than the populations of other health resorts. [...] The development of tourism in Engadin and Davos was a stimulus and encouragement to establish a health resort in Vaz/Obervaz. [...] The first regular and successful Ski-course in Lenzerheide was finished in 1903. [...] The similar success of the repetition during the next year, suddenly made Lenzerheide well known as an outstanding ski area. [...] In the following years a pleasing {{increase in the number}} of visitors prompted the building of new hotels and the continual improvement of the tourism infrastructure. [...] The beginning of tourist development was marked by the construction of a Funi track (a Funi was a mechanism by which two carriages on skids pulled each other up and down the mountain) between Val Sporz and Tgantieni in 1936. At the end of 2013 the ski resort of Lenzerheide was linked with Arosa by cable-car, creating the new ski resort of Arosa Lenzerheide. Since then transport passes work in both resorts.|$|E
2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I <b>hesitated</b> <b>a</b> while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E

60|$|Macheson <b>hesitated.</b> <b>As</b> {{yet he had}} not {{dared to}} ask himself that question. Holderness watched the {{struggle}} in his face.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{came to a halt}} before Leastways Cottage, and, after <b>hesitating</b> <b>a</b> moment, pounded vigorously at the door.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Clarkson {{turned and}} eyed him; removed the pipe from his mouth, and, after <b>hesitating</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{replaced}} it with a jerk.|$|R

60|$|M. le Duc <b>hesitated</b> <b>a</b> while, {{a troubled}} look {{appeared}} on his handsome face.|$|E
