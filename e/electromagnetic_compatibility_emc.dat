2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} voltage spikes caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} snubber is to improve <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> (<b>EMC)</b> by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive ignition coil with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and bipolar transistors. Snubber capacitors (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to define {{responsibilities}} for grid operators and network owners, as well as for those responsible for electromagnetic immunity and emission of equipments, including the standardisation community.

Based on the framework of EMC, requirements for grid operators, owners and other stakeholders are proposed in terms of network strength and on how to distribute available emission levels in order to comply with defined voltage disturbance planning levels.

The transmission resource is an available radio spectrum which consists of {{a limited number of}} frequencies or (channels). Channel assignment problem involves assigning frequencies to each radio cell {{in such a way that}} a set of constraints is satisfied [13]. These include the limited number of available frequencies in the radio spectrum as well as the traffic constraints corresponding to the minimum number of frequencies indispensable for covering communication between mobile devices moving in a particular cell. In addition, the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> constraints (<b>EMC)</b> may happen between channels in the same cell (co-site channel constraint), interference between neighboring cells (adjacent channel constraint) and interference between other cells utilizing the same channel (co-channel constraint) [14].|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Distance Preserving Mappings (DPM) is a {{relatively}} new technique finding its way to a wide use in the coding field. New codes mapping convolutional code outputs onto spectral nulls codewords have the purpose of generating a code with a certain spectrum specification and error correction capabilities, which can be exploited by the Viterbi decoder. Combining this class of new codes with an OFDM modulation scheme is actually a tool to reduce <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>Compatibility</b> Interference (<b>EMC)</b> in selected subbands or to cancel the narrowband interference (NBI) potentially caused by, amongst others, HF radio transmissions. Taking into consideration the fact that a narrowband noise source is almost similar to a modulated OFDM carrier, and also the periodicity of the nulls in our spectrum, we are able to cancel the narrowband signal and its sideband interferences without using traditional techniques of cancellation, which is based on filtering. Shaping our spectrum at the transmitter is a technique, which can be exploited at the receiver to suppress any narrowband signal interference, which is regarded as noise. We will present in this paper the technique of cancellation and the coding gain that can be obtained when comparing to the uncoded data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With {{the growing}} {{concerns}} about <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> of integrated circuits, {{the need for}} accurate prediction tools and models to reduce risks of noncompliance becomes critical for circuit designers. However, an on-chip characterization of noise is still necessary for model validation and design optimization. Although different on-chip measurement solutions have been proposed for emission issue characterization, no on-chip measurement methods have been proposed to address the susceptibility issues. This paper presents an on-chip noise sensor dedicated {{to the study of}} circuit susceptibility to electromagnetic interferences. A demonstration of the sensor measurement performances and benefits is proposed through a study of the susceptibility of a digital core to conducted interferences. Sensor measurements ensure a better characterization of actual coupling of interferences within the circuit and a diagnosis of failure origins.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive guideline {{for the design}} of a single-phase PFC targeting for minimal volume, as it is highly relevant for ultracompact integrated systems. It is shown, how different operation modes (continuous, boundary, and discontinuous conduction mode) may influence the design and consequently the achieved power density. Furthermore, the effect of interleaving of several boost stages is analyzed as a measure for compactness increase. Finally, the selection of the appropriate switching frequency in order to achieve an overall optimized sys-tem is discussed. In this way, the design of the crucial components is carried out, namely, the boost inductor, including a volume optimization through a thermal connection to the heat sink; the output capacitor considering the rms current stress; and the input filter, which is designed for compliance with high-frequency <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> standards, taking into account the quasi-peak detection measurement of the test receiver equipment.
