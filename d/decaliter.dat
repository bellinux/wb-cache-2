25|$|In April 2004, Skilling {{got into}} a scuffle with patrons of a cigar bar in New York City {{after a night of}} drinking. He was not arrested, but he and his wife, Rebecca, who was hurt during the scuffle, were transported to a {{hospital}} where a blood test showed Skilling had a blood-alcohol level of 190 milligrams per <b>decaliter</b> (0.19% BAC), as indicated in the government's motion to modify conditions of Skilling's pretrial release order. Prosecutors pounced, asking a judge to increase his $5 million bond to $7 million, restrict his travel to Texas and impose a curfew. They argued that Skilling violated his bond's terms by drinking excessively and failing to report his contact with police to federal pretrial services authorities.|$|E
40|$|Where lead pollutes urban soils, {{both human}} and animals risk {{exposure}}. This exposure gives rise to similar health risks across species. A group of 50 outdoor living cats from inner city Tampa, Florida were tested for blood lead concentration (BLC). Most cats had no measurable lead loads, 14 percent had levels {{less than or equal}} to 6 micrograms per <b>decaliter.</b> Soil samples were taken from the home location of each cat. None of these samples, which ranged from 2. 6 microgram per gram to 170 micrograms per gram, had hazardous levels of lead. Overall, BLCs were lower than expected. In addition, the BLCs were lower than those found in older industrial cities. The reduction of the use of lead as well as Tampa 2 ̆ 7 s location in the newly developed Sunbelt, may be responsible for the overall low levels found in the region 2 ̆ 7 s outdoor living cat population...|$|E
40|$|Serum-denatured TBG (dnTBG) {{measured}} in 32 families deficient in native TBG (nTBG) was undetectable in all subjects with complete nTBG deficiency and was high in 2 of 16 families with partial nTBG deficiency. nTBG (in mean micrograms per <b>decaliter</b> +/- SD) in {{members of the}} Quebec and Montreal families, respectively were: 258 +/- 54 and 230 in affected men, 747 +/- 190 and 927 +/- 90 in affected women, and 1568 +/- 151 and 1300 +/- 195 in unaffected relatives. Corresponding mean dnTBG levels were: 14. 3 +/- 2. 9 and 21. 3 in affected men, 8. 6 +/- 1. 0 and 11. 6 +/- 3. 1 in affected women, and less than 2. 1 and less than 2. 6 in unaffected relatives. All were euthyroid with normal free thyroxine and thyrotropin levels. In comparison to common type TBG, TBG-Quebec was more heat labile by 10 degrees C and TBG-Montreal by 12 degrees C. The degree of dnTBG elevation and nTBG lability at 37 degrees C were correlated (r = 0. 99). Isoelectric focusing showed cathodal shift of all TBG bands: TBG-Quebec by 0. 06 isoelectric points (pI) and TBG-Montreal by 0. 02 pI. These two TBG variants represent different mutations most likely affecting the polypeptide chain of the molecule. Their inheritance is X-chromosome linked. The instability of these TBGs at 37 degrees C may lead to more rapid degradation in vivo resulting in low nTBG and high dnTBG concentrations in serum...|$|E

50|$|The {{wine storage}} and wine {{department}} with {{a capacity of}} 600 thousands of <b>decaliters</b> were opened in 1960. The range of beverages was more than 60 products (red wines, brandy, liquors) prepared from natural raw material purchased in France and Spain. Wine warehouse was built in 1964, bottling department - in 1966.|$|R
2500|$|Each sietch {{has its own}} water store underground. [...] This store {{can hold}} {{millions}} of <b>decaliters</b> of water and is accounted for literally to the last drop. [...] This store {{is used as a}} bank for all the water owned by members of the sietch through water rings, {{as well as for the}} sietch's own store of water for the eventual transformation of their planet into something other than desert.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturing {{accounted}} for 67.4% of the region's industrial output in 2007. The most notable sector was food products, {{beverages and tobacco}} (20.7%). The region produced a total of 278,100 tons of whole milk products, 144,100 tons of bread and baked goods, 6,300 tons of pasta, 54,100 tons of meat, 518.7 million <b>decaliters</b> of mineral water (including the popular Karachinskaya mark), 137,300 tons of mixed fodder and 218,700 tons of flour.|$|R
