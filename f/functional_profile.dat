40|$|International audienceFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies map {{the human}} brain by testing the {{response}} of groups of individuals to carefully-crafted and contrasted tasks in order to delineate specialized brain regions and networks. The number of functional networks extracted {{is limited by the}} number of subject-level contrasts and does not grow with the cohort. Here, we introduce a new group-level brain mapping strategy to differentiate many regions reflecting the variety of brain network configurations observed in the population. Based on the principle of functional segregation, our approach singles out functionally-specialized brain regions by learning group-level <b>functional</b> <b>profiles</b> on which the response of brain regions can be represented sparsely. We use a dictionary-learning formulation that can be solved efficiently with on-line algorithms, scaling to arbitrary large datasets. Importantly, we model inter-subject correspondence as structure imposed in the estimated <b>functional</b> <b>profiles,</b> integrating a structure-inducing regularization with no additional computational cost. On a large multi-subject study, our approach extracts a large number of brain networks with meaningful <b>functional</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R

5000|$|David Chalmers {{tries to}} show that even though mental content cannot be fully {{accounted}} for in functional terms, there is nevertheless a nomological correlation between mental states and functional states in this world. A silicon-based robot, for example, whose <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> matched our own, {{would have to be}} fully conscious. His argument for this claim {{takes the form of a}} reductio ad absurdum. The general idea is that since it would be very unlikely for a conscious human being to experience a change in its qualia which it utterly fails to notice, mental content and <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> appear to be inextricably bound together, at least in the human case. If the subject's qualia were to change, we would expect the subject to notice, and therefore his <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> to follow suit. A similar argument is applied to the notion of absent qualia. In this case, Chalmers argues that it would be very unlikely for a subject to experience a fading of his qualia which he fails to notice and respond to. This, coupled with the independent assertion that a conscious being's <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> just could be maintained, irrespective of its experiential state, leads to the conclusion that the subject of these experiments would remain fully conscious. The problem with this argument, however, as Brian G. Crabb (2005) has observed, is that it begs the central question: How could Chalmers know that <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> can be preserved, for example while the conscious subject's brain is being supplanted with a silicon substitute, unless he already assumes that the subject's possibly changing qualia would not be a determining factor? And while changing or fading qualia in a conscious subject might force changes in its <b>functional</b> <b>profile,</b> this tells us nothing about the case of a permanently inverted or unconscious robot. A subject with inverted qualia from birth would have nothing to notice or adjust to. Similarly, an unconscious functional simulacrum of ourselves (a zombie) would have no experiential changes to notice or adjust to. Consequently, Crabb argues, Chalmers' [...] "fading qualia" [...] and [...] "dancing qualia" [...] arguments fail to establish that cases of permanently inverted or absent qualia are nomologically impossible.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{functional}} implications {{of changes in}} gene expression, mutations, etc., is the aim of most genomic experiments. To achieve this, several <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e. g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e. g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> methods, a common limitation {{to all of them}} is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e. g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples.

50|$|The tool serves in {{the field}} of metagenomic {{analysis}} where it allows inference of the <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> of a microbialcommunity based on marker gene survey along one or more samples. In essence, PICRUSt takes a user supplied OTU table, representing the marker gene sequences (most commonly a 16S cluster) accompanied with its relative abundance in each of the samples. The output of PICRUSt is a sample by functional-gene-count matrix, telling the count of each functional-gene in each of the samples surveyed. The ability of PICRUSt to estimate the functional-gene profile for a given sample relies on a set of known sequenced genomes. This could also be thought of as an automated alternative to manually researching the gene families likely to be present in organisms whose sequences are found in a 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon library.|$|E

Method: Data on dwellings from existing Swedish research databases were utilized. EB and accessibility were assessed {{by means of the}} Housing Enabler instrument. In simulations of EB removal, five items that correspond to the most common housing adaptations were selected. The simulations were applied to four <b>functional</b> <b>profiles</b> of different complexity. Result: EB known to be commonly removed by housing adaptations exist in large proportions of the existing ordinary housing stock. Estimated targeted elimination of selected barriers would have the largest accessibility effects for the more complex <b>functional</b> <b>profiles.</b> The effects would be consistently larger for one-family houses, and for all types of dwellings built before 1960. Conclusions: The elimination of the EB most commonly addressed by housing adaptations could result in a reduction of the housing accessibility problems that community-living older people are facing.

Metagenomic reads are the starting data for these studies, however considerable differences are observed between the functional profiles—built from sequencing reads produced by different sequencing techniques—for even the same microbial community. Using simulation experiments, we show that such functional differences are likely to be caused by the actual difference in read lengths, and are not the results of a sampling bias of the sequencing techniques. Furthermore, the functional differences derived from different sequencing techniques cannot be fully explained by the read-count bias, i. e. 1) the higher fraction of unannotated shorter reads (i. e., “read length matters”), and 2) the different lengths of proteins in different functional categories. Instead, we show here that specific functional categories are under-annotated, because similarity-search-based functional annotation tools tend to miss more reads from functional categories that contain less conserved genes/proteins. In addition, the accuracy of functional annotation of short reads for different functions varies, further skewing the <b>functional</b> <b>profiles.</b> To address these issues, we present a simple yet efficient method to improve the frequency estimates of different functional categories in the <b>functional</b> <b>profiles</b> of metagenomes, based on the functional annotation of simulated reads from complet...|$|R

Accurate parcellation allows each node in the macroscale connectome to be more informative by associating it with a distinct connectivity pattern and <b>functional</b> <b>profile.</b> Parcellation of localized areas of cortex have been accomplished using diffusion tractography (Beckmann et al. 2009) and functional connectivity (Nelson et al. 2010) to non-invasively measure connectivity patterns and define cortical areas based on distinct connectivity patterns.

Accurate whole brain parcellation may lead to more accurate macroscale connectomes for the normal brain, which can then be compared to disease states.|$|E

In gamma- 2 herpesviruses, the transactivating factor RTA is essential for initiation of lytic gene expression and viral reactivation. We used the RTA locus as a model to develop the <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> approach. The mutant murine gammaherpesvirus 68 viral library, containing 15 -bp random insertions in the RTA locus, was passaged in murine fibroblast cells for multiple rounds of selection.

The <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> phenotypes were verified by examining several individual RTA mutant clones for transactivating function of the RTA promoter and transcomplementing function of the RTA-null virus. Thus, the profiling approach enabled us to identify several novel functional domains in the RTA locus in the context of the herpesvirus genome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 64 women referred for urodynamic investigation underwent sequential urethral pressure measurements using an air charged and a microtip catheter in randomized order. Patients were blinded {{to the type}} and sequence of catheter used. Agreement between the 2 catheter systems was assessed using the Bland and Altman 95 % limits of agreement method. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients of air charged and microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest were 0. 97 and 0. 93, and for <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> length they were 0. 9 and 0. 78, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients and Lin's concordance coefficients of air charged and microtip catheters were r = 0. 82 and rho = 0. 79 for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest, and r = 0. 73 and rho = 0. 7 for <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> length, respectively. When applying the Bland and Altman method, air charged catheters gave higher readings than microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (mean difference 7. 5 cm H(2) O) and <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> length (mean difference 1. 8 mm). There were wide 95 % limits of agreement for differences in maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (- 24. 1 to 39 cm H(2) O) and <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> length (- 7. 7 to 11. 3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: For urethral pressure measurement the air charged catheter {{is at least as}} reliable as the microtip catheter and it generally gives higher readings. However, air charged and microtip catheters cannot be used interchangeably for clinical purposes because of insufficient agreement. Hence, clinicians should be aware that air charged and microtip catheters may yield completely different results, and these differences should be acknowledged during clinical decision making...|$|E

40|$|In {{functional}} metagenomics, BLAST homology {{search is}} a common method to classify metagenomic reads into protein/ domain sequence families such as Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) in order to quantify the abundance of each COG in the community. The resulting <b>functional</b> <b>profile</b> of the community is then used in downstream analysis to correlate the change in abundance to environmental perturbation, clinical variation, and so on. However, the short read length coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies poses a barrier in this approach, essentially because similarity significance cannot be discerned by searching with short reads.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Functional</b> <b>profiling</b> {{methods have}} been {{extensively}} used {{in the context of}} high-throughput experiments and, in particular, in microarray data analysis. Such methods use available biological information to define different types of functional gene modules (e. g. gene ontology -GO-, KEGG pathways, etc.) whose representation in a pre-defined list of genes is further studied. In the most popular type of microarray experimental designs (e. g. up- or down-regulated genes, clusters of co-expressing genes, etc.) or in other genomic experiments (e. g. Chip-on-chip, epigenomics, etc.) these lists are composed by genes {{with a high degree of}} co-expression. Therefore, an implicit assumption in the application of <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> methods within this context is that the genes corresponding to the modules tested are effectively defining sets of co-expressing genes. Nevertheless not all the functional modules are biologically coherent entities in terms of co-expression, which will eventually hinder its detection with conventional methods of functional enrichment. Results Using a large collection of microarray data we have carried out a detailed survey of internal correlation in GO terms and KEGG pathways, providing a coherence index to be used for measuring functional module co-regulation. An unexpected low level of internal correlation was found among the modules studied. Only around 30 % of the modules defined by GO terms and 57 % of the modules defined by KEGG pathways display an internal correlation higher than the expected by chance. This information on the internal correlation of the genes within the functional modules can be used in the context of a logistic regression model in a simple way to improve their detection in gene expression experiments. Conclusion For the first time, an exhaustive study on the internal co-expression of the most popular functional categories has been carried out. Interestingly, the real level of coexpression within many of them is lower than expected (or even inexistent), which will preclude its detection by means of most conventional <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> methods. If the gene-to-function correlation information is used in <b>functional</b> <b>profiling</b> methods, the results obtained improve the ones obtained by conventional enrichment methods. </p...|$|R
