40|$|Using {{the case}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>assurance,</b> this paper argues that a focused concern with the {{pragmatics}} of market devices can offer a particularist politics of analysis by uncovering the material, technical and social conditions through which economic objects and persons are constituted. <b>Industrial</b> <b>assurance</b> grew exponentially in the UK after 1880 to become, {{through a series of}} political and economic twists and turns, by the 1910 s the key commercial institution offering to ‘foster and protect’ the savings of the poor.

40|$|DNA barcoding methods {{originally}} {{developed for the}} identification of plant specimens have been applied to the authentication of herbal drug materials for <b>industrial</b> quality <b>assurance.</b> These methods are intended to be complementary to current morphological and chemical methods of identification. The adoption of these methods by industry will be accelerated {{by the introduction of}} DNA-based identification techniques into regulatory standards and monographs. The introduction of DNA methods into the British Pharmacopoeia is described, along with a reference standard for use as a positive control for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A general troubleshooting chart is provided to guide the user through the problems that may be encountered during this process. Nevertheless, the nature of the plant materials and the demands of industrial quality control procedures mean that conventional DNA barcoding is not the method of choice for industrial quality control. The design of DNA barcode-targeted quantitative PCR and high resolution melt curve tests is one strategy for developing rapid, robust, and reliable protocols for high-throughput screening of raw materials. The development of authentication tests for wild-harvested Rhodiola rosea L. is used as a case study to exemplify these relatively simple tests. By way of contrast, the application of next-generation sequencing to create a complete profile of all the biological entities in a mixed herbal drug is described and its potential for <b>industrial</b> quality <b>assurance</b> discussed...|$|R
40|$|What {{might it}} {{mean to say that}} the market will have you? This chapter tackles this {{question}} by using Gabriel Tarde’s central provocation that what we are, our identities, are not matters of ‘being’ but of ‘having’. The art of markets lies in how this having – of data, relations, associations, ties, ‘us’ – is practically accomplished. We test this idea by looking at how marketing conversations have been conducted in two consumer finance product cases: the <b>industrial</b> life <b>assurance</b> company Prudential Assurance and the payday loan company Wonga. These two cases, we argue, shed new light both on how we understand market attachment and what this might mean in a rapidly evolving digital economy...|$|R

Firstly, multi-channel measurements, with several transmitter and receiver pairs will be discussed. Secondly, a single transmitter / multiple receiver scheme using THz beam splitters is investigated. Thirdly, a rotational scanner, transforming the translational movement of a raster scanned sample into a rotational movement of a THz reflector, will be explored in detail. Experimental verification of all three imaging schemes will be presented on hand of line scans...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} the ‘good, average man’ or the ‘man at the door’ in marketing life assurance and industrial life assurance in particular. While older commercial life assurance companies struggled to establish and expand their markets in the nineteenth century, the industrial life offices saw exponential growth selling a form of life assurance targeted at the poor. The paper explores the role of door to door agents in securing this growth. Almost by accident, <b>industrial</b> <b>assurance</b> agents emerged as the salve to widespread concerns about the complexity, propriety and safety of life assurance. As the familiar ‘man at the door’, agents helped foster the trust at a distance that large financial institutions depended upon and they also helped, through their weekly visits, to impose the discipline of thrift on the often precarious cash economies of working class households. It was through entanglement in the social lives of their policyholders that agents helped establish and reproduce <b>industrial</b> <b>assurance</b> markets. But the social ties that linked agents to their policyholders were a delicate matter. <b>Industrial</b> <b>assurance</b> offices had sprung up initially as a means of providing death benefits and came increasingly to provide life, endowment and other forms of cover to poorer communities. It was thus by definition a business transacted on intimate personal and social turf. But this social entanglement just added to the controversies aroused by a product reliant on an expensive business model of weekly door to door collection. Government and regulatory bodies feared that <b>industrial</b> <b>assurance</b> not only offered low financial returns but that it might damage traditional social bonds in sometimes dramatic ways – by for instance giving poor parents a pecuniary motive for neglecting their offspring or even hastening their deaths. The offices and their customers meanwhile defended agents on the grounds of their ties and their value to their communities. While offices may have sometimes exaggerated the goodwill customers felt towards their agents as ‘philosophers, guides and friends’; these agents were profoundly linked to their communities and policyholders through a variety of overlapping market, social and personal relations. The chapter will explore the way these varied ties arise as an inevitable component of the commerce or traffic of everyday life...|$|E

40|$|Agencements are {{arrangements}} {{endowed with}} the capacity of acting in different ways depending upon how they are configured. In advocating the term 'agencement' Callon's aim is to signal the close interweaving of words and actions and thus jettison the more Austinian associations of performativity. Agencement calls attention to the various processes by which economic actors, both human and non-human, are endowed with the fixtures, fittings and devices necessary to conduct themselves in particular ways. Thus depending upon how things are arranged or configured, disinterested or selfish, calculative or non-calculative, individual or collective agencies become possible. This model works well to describe the emergence of markets for <b>industrial</b> branch life <b>assurance</b> in the UK from the nineteenth century. Companies like the Prudential and the Pearl reacted to the conflicts, crises and controversies in the commercial market and the competition between socialised and privatised or prudentialist insurance models with <b>Industrial</b> Branch <b>Assurance.</b> This claimed to provide security for the thrifty poor by employing an army of agents whose weekly premium collections helped impose the discipline of thrift and security. Through the notion of agencement, the effect of hybrid combinations of human bodies, material equipment, technical devices and cognitive processes in creating a sustainable market for a peculiarly expensive financial savings product targeted at the working classes thrift is exposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Measurement {{uncertainty}} {{has important}} economic consequences for calibration and inspec-tion activities {{and is often}} taken {{as an indication of}} the quality of a test laboratory. Smaller uncertainty values are generally of higher value. In industry decision rules employed in accepting and rejecting products are based on the measurement uncertainty budget of the related characteristics of the prod-ucts. Conformity assessment based on the product specification and the measurement evaluation {{is an important part of}} the <b>industrial</b> quality <b>assurance</b> of manufactured products and for the stability of production processes. The aim of this paper is to describe the relationship between the conformance zone and the accep-tance zone and to address the problem of determining acceptance limits that define the boundaries of the acceptance zone...|$|R

50|$|The {{digitalisation}} of real-world objects is {{of vital}} importance in various application domains. This method is especially applied in <b>industrial</b> quality <b>assurance</b> {{to measure the}} geometric dimension accuracy. Industrial processes such as assembly are complex, highly automated and typically based on CAD (Computer Aided Design) data. The {{problem is that the}} same degree of automation is also required for quality assurance. It is, for example, a very complex task to assemble a modern car, since it consists of many parts that must fit together {{at the very end of}} the production line. The optimal performance of this process is guaranteed by quality assurance systems. Especially the geometry of the metal parts must be checked in order to assure that they have the correct dimensions, fit together and finally work reliably.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{analytical}} chemistry {{is dominated by}} instrumental analysis. Many analytical chemists focus on a single type of instrument. Academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis. The discovery of a chemical present in blood that {{increases the risk of}} cancer would be a discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in. An effort to develop a new method might involve the use of a tunable laser to increase the specificity and sensitivity of a spectrometric method. Many methods, once developed, are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time. This is particularly true in <b>industrial</b> quality <b>assurance</b> (QA), forensic and environmental applications. Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of optical 3 -D measuring techniques {{and their use}} in <b>industrial</b> quality <b>assurance,</b> in design, and for rapid prototyping has experienced strong growth. A large number of optical 3 -D measuring methods and systems are {{on the market in}} dentistry. CAD/CAM production has become firmly established in dental medicine, not least due to the systematic introduction of the Cerec technique and the digiDent method. The scanners on which these technologies are based are designed for a relatively small measuring area. To be able to measure and three-dimensionally assess the face - and the numerous changes in the face/forehead/neck region - it was necessary to design and develop a self-calibrating measuring system with gray code for clinical use: the G-Scan measuring system. Objects up to a size of 500 x 500 x 400 mm can be acquired three-dimensionally with it, with a measuring inaccuracy of 10 to 70 m in a typical measuring time of 15 s. The present article describes th e measuring principle, the system parameters, and the features of the new measuring system, and illustrates the measuring results on 3 -D displays of the face in static occlusion and in functional occlusion positions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Drawing {{upon the}} {{historical}} relationship between statistics, probabilistic reasoning and life insurance, the article argues that mathematical calculation played a necessary but limited role in making markets for life insurance. Insuring publics have been fairly consistently cautious {{in the use}} of probabilistic and statistical reasoning to inform investment in life insurance. In this they follow a pattern set by early insurance companies who themselves were slow to alter their commercial practices in line with emerging knowledge. I examine some of the reasons for this glacial pace and some of the ambiguities on which statistical ‘certainties’ were built as part of an argument that the role of statistics and mathematics in market calculation is both less and more than it seems. This is manifest in the history of <b>industrial</b> life <b>assurance,</b> an industry with a phenomenally successful track record in the mass enrolment of consumers. Unlike their predecessors, industrial companies disdained swamping their target markets with probabilistic arguments in favour of a very different sort of argument that, nevertheless, carried a trace of statistical thinking with it. This trace {{came in the form of}} ‘good, average men’, the agents who became industrial insurance’s core marketing device and who translated the essentials of a statistically informed product into a more palatable, more calculable form...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} optical {{non-destructive}} methods for 3 D surface metrology {{have become increasingly}} important in contrast to traditional tactile measurement techniques. Here, we present the operating principle and possible applications of the optical 3 D measurement system “InfiniteFocus”, {{which is based on}} the technology of Focus-Variation and used for quality assurance in the lab and in production. In contrast to traditional tactile methods it is able to perform 3 D measurements without touching the surface, it measures whole areas instead of only surface profiles and delivers true color information in addition to the 3 D data. The technique of Focus-Variation combines the small depth of focus of an optical system with vertical scanning to provide topographical and color information from the variation of focus. The main characteristics of the system are that it delivers high resolution measurements of even complex surfaces, that it is able to measure surfaces with steep flanks up to 80 °, with strongly varying reflection properties and greatly varying roughness. In addition to 3 D and color information a repeatability measure is analytically estimated for each measurement point. Focus-Variation is used to perform high resolution 3 D surface measurement for <b>industrial</b> quality <b>assurance</b> as well a...|$|R
