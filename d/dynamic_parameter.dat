Accuracy of the IUH/UH predicted using GIUH models largely depends on the estimate used for <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> velocity. Kirpich formula and velocity relationships are independently used to estimate time of concentration for a watershed. In the present study it is shown that combining these empirical formulae a new relationship useful for estimating <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> velocity for a watershed can be developed.

40|$|The Maseng-Bakken model simulates rain {{attenuation}} induced on {{a microwave}} link, and it accepts as input three parameters: {{the first two}} coincide with the parameters belonging to the conditional lognormal cumulative distribution of rain attenuation while the third one-called the <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> hereafter-should be assigned appropriately so that the model reflects some particular dynamic properties of rain attenuation. Thus far, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> has been calculated with emphasis on the simulation of the spectral density function of rain attenuation. This in turn, does not necessarily imply that the Maseng-Bakken model also simulates other crucial statistical features of rain attenuation such as Fade/Inter-Fade Duration Statistics.

However, a multi degree of freedom robot arm has many parameters, and the process of determining them is challenging.

A new {{particle swarm optimization}} {{based on}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> modification is proposed in this paper (<b>Dynamic</b> <b>Parameter</b> Modification Particle Swarm Optimizer, DPSO).

Parameters 1 c and 2 c of topical PSO are modified dynamically based on the comparison of () i i p x t − and () g ip x t − in order to coordinate between global search and local search. Then find out the optimal value of Goldstein-Price function using topical PSO and the improved DPSO respectively, and the results demonstrate that compared to topical PSO, DPSO algorithm avoids falling into the local minimum and improves the search efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{dynamics}} of rain attenuation are examined, and dynamic diversity gain is evaluated for a pico-scale site diversity system. Since modern satellite communication systems operate at frequencies above 10 GHz, their efficient design requires the adoption of Propagation Impairment Mitigation techniques and so rain attenuation time series synthesizers. For rain attenuation, {{which is the most}} dominant fading mechanism, the dynamic stochastic model, proposed by Maseng-Bakken, based on the lognormal distribution is the most widely accepted and used. In this latter model, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> is required for the generation of slant path rain attenuation time series. In this paper, firstly, a simple expression is proposed for the calculation of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> in terms of the mean wind speed, elevation angle of the link, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> of rainfall rate. The new theoretical expression is tested with simulated data with very encouraging results. This expression is then used into a unified rain attenuation synthesizer with inputs from the rainfall rate statistics and the satellite slant path characteristics. Finally, the dynamic diversity gain is calculated for pico-scale site diversity systems for various link characteristics. 1...|$|E
40|$|User-centered Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) {{has been}} applied {{to a wide variety of}} areas, {{including}} UML software design. The performance of evolutionary search is important as user interaction fatigue remains an on-going challenge in IEC. However, to obtain optimal search performance, it is usually necessary to “tune” evolutionary control parameters manually, although tuning control parameters can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue in other fields of evolutionary computation, <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> control including deterministic, adaptive and self-adaptive mechanisms have been applied extensively to real valued representations. This paper postulates that <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> control may be highly beneficial to IEC in general, and UML software design in particular, wherein a novel objectbased solution representation is used. Three software design problems from differing design domains and of differing scale have been investigated with mutation probabilities modified by simulated annealing, the Rechenberg “ 1 / 5 success rule” and self-adaptation within local search. Results indicate that selfadaptation appears to be the most robust and scalable mutation probability modification mechanism. The use of self-adaption with an object-based representation is novel, and results indicate that <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> control offers great potential within IEC...|$|E

40|$|Meta-heuristics are {{commonly}} used to solve combinatorial problems in practice. Many approaches provide very good quality solutions in {{a short amount of}} computational time; however most meta-heuristics use parameters to tune the performance of the meta-heuristic for particular problems and the selection of these parameters before solving the problem can require much time. This paper investigates the problem of setting parameters using a typical meta-heuristic called Meta-RaPS (Metaheuristic for Randomized Priority Search.). Meta-RaPS is a promising meta-heuristic optimization method that has been applied to different types of combinatorial optimization problems and achieved very good performance compared to other meta-heuristic techniques. To solve a combinatorial problem, Meta-RaPS uses two well-defined stages at each iteration: construction and local search. After a number of iterations, the best solution is reported. Meta-RaPS performance depends on the fine tuning of two main parameters, priority percentage and restriction percentage, which are used during the construction stage. This paper presents two different <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> setting methods for Meta-RaPS. These <b>dynamic</b> <b>parameter</b> setting approaches tune the parameters while a solution is being found. To compare these two approaches, nonparametric statistic approaches are utilized since the solutions are not normally distributed.
