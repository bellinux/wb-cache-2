5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to Paris, feeding doubts that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been looking at Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to ease his own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E
5|$|Tucker's {{effectiveness}} in the lecture hall is not objectively certain, and <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have encountered difficulty with public speaking {{as he had}} in the courtroom previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, and he published numerous works—including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, as well as two pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the Virginia Literary Museum (1829–1830) in which he published voluminous writings; and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Muirchertach Ua Briain was one {{of three}} sons of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1086), a man who secured control of the Kingdom of Munster in the 1060s before gaining the high-kingship of Ireland less than a decade later. In 1175, in an act of overlordship over the Kingdom of Dublin, Toirdelbach Ua Briain {{appointed}} Muirchertach Ua Briain King of Dublin, following a precedent set by Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072), a previous claimant to the Irish high-kingship who had done the same to his own eldest son, Murchad (died 1070), in 1052. When Toirdelbach Ua Briain finally died in 1086, his sons bitterly contested the kingship of Munster before Muirchertach Ua Briain succeeded in securing it for himself. By 1091, the latter appears to have regained control of the Dublin, only to lose it to Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095), who united it with the Kingdom of the Isles. Gofraid's reign in Ireland was short-lived, as Muirchertach Ua Briain forced him from Dublin in 1094. After the Gofraid's death the following year, Muirchertach Ua Briain appointed his own nephew, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), as King of the Isles. Uí Briain influence in the Isles was similarly short-lived, however, as Domnall mac Taidc was apparently forced from the region, and Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway seized control of not only the Isles, but perhaps even Dublin itself, before falling in battle in 1103. Later in 1111, Domnall mac Taidc temporarily seized the kingship of the Isles in an act that may have been opposed by his aforesaid uncle. The reasons for Domnall mac Taidc's exit from the Isles are uncertain. Although he may have been forcibly ejected by the Islesmen, <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have returned to Ireland to take advantage of Muirchertach Ua Briain's rapidly failing health.|$|E

25|$|Having lost Robert Colchin and the 2nd Duke of Richmond in 1750, cricket {{was hit by}} {{the death}} of another {{significant}} patron Frederick, Prince of Wales, on Sunday, 31 March. The loss of these patrons had an adverse impact on the game's finances and the number of top-class matches reduced for some years to come, although economic difficulties arising from the wars of the period certainly inhibited many potential investors. It was said that the Prince of Wales {{died as a result of}} being struck on the head by a cricket ball. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been hit on the head but that did not kill him; the cause of death was a burst abscess in a lung. The early death of Prince Frederick meant that his son Prince George became heir to the throne and he succeeded in 1760 as George III.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{year after}} {{completing}} his first string quintet, Dvořák completed his String Quartet No. 1 in A major, Op. 2, {{the first of his}} fourteen string quartets. For some time Dvořák was very tentative in his approach to quartets. In the 1880s Dvořák made a list of compositions he had destroyed, which lists two quartets and 2 other quartets. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have destroyed the scores, but only after the individual instrumental parts had been copied out. The number of errors in the parts makes it highly unlikely that he actually had them played. The quartets numbered 2 to 4 were probably composed between 1868 and 1870 and show the strong influence of the music of Richard Wagner. Dvořák kept the manuscripts of these quartets but did not give them opus numbers. They have numbers B.17, B.18, and B.19 in the Burghauser catalog. An Andante religioso from his fourth quartet was used five years later in his second string quintet Op. 77, as a second movement named Intermezzo: Nocturne, making this initially a five-movement composition, although he later withdrew this second movement, and later still reworked it variously, resulting in the Nocturne for Strings in B major, Op. 40 (B. 47). The two Quartets he wrote in 1873 (number 5, B37 and number 6, B40) show a stronger sense of form.|$|E

500|$|Henry had {{a passionate}} desire to rebuild his {{control of the}} territories that his grandfather, HenryI, had once governed. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been {{influenced}} by his mother in this regard, as Matilda also had a strong sense of ancestral rights and privileges. Henry took back territories, regained estates, and re-established influence over the smaller lords that had once provided what historian John Gillingham describes as a [...] "protective ring" [...] around his core territories. He was probably the first king of England to use a heraldic design: a signet ring with either a leopard or a lion engraved on it. The design would be altered in later generations to form the royal seal of England.|$|E
500|$|Usually, {{only the}} podium or base {{platform}} used stone, with the upper parts {{of wood and}} mud-brick, greatly reducing what survives for archaeologists. [...] However, there is evidence for the portico columns sometimes using stone, as at Veii. [...] This has left much about Etruscan temples uncertain.

500|$|The text, which {{concerns}} a sinner seeking and finding redemption, {{was written by}} Georg Christian Lehms. Lehms was based in Darmstadt, {{and it is not}} known whether Bach knew him personally, but <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have had access to Lehms's 1711 publication , which includes this text and that of another solo cantata, Widerstehe doch der Sünde, BWV 54, performed the month before. The third stanza of Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "" [...] is integrated as the sixths movement. The text in the first person shows the dramatic change of a person initially feeling as [...] "a monster in God's eyes" [...] to finally feeling accepted as God's child. The cantata text was set to music in 1712 by Christoph Graupner in Darmstadt. It is not known if Bach knew of Graupner's composition. The text has no specific relation to the prescribed readings, therefore it is possible that Bach may have already composed the work before his promotion to concert master with regular Sunday services, like the other cantata on a text by Lehms.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as the}} map of Britain was {{published}} Mercator was invited to undertake the surveying and mapping of Lorraine (Lotharingia). This was a new venture {{for him in the}} sense that never before had he collected the raw data for a new regional map. He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated his way around the forests, hills and steep sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as anything could be. He never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend Ghim who would later write: [...] "The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement {{as a result of his}} terrifying experiences." [...] Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey. No map {{was published}} at the time but Mercator did provide a single drawn copy for the Duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas.|$|E
500|$|... "Angry Dad: The Movie" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with many of}} them praising the [...] "visual gags" [...] featured in the episode. TV Squad writer Brad Trechak praised the episode's use of Hollywood references writing that [...] "that's what good episodes of 'The Simpsons' are made of". He also praised Gervais's performance calling his two monologues [...] "classic". The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser praised the multiple references layered in the episode commenting that they saved the episode from being [...] "mediocre". Despite this, he criticized the plot commenting {{that it did not}} come [...] "from the heart of the show". He ultimately gave the episode a B-, being beaten only by Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Hamburger Dinner Theater". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly mostly praised the short films competing against [...] "Angry Dad" [...] calling them [...] "the truly amusing stuff" [...] and adding that Condiments was a [...] "very accomplished replication of Pixar". However, he was critical of the guest stars, noting that, [...] "None of them were very funny, but that was the joke — they were parodying the toadying tone of awards patter. Well, Brand and Berry were; Gervais seemed to have improvised a lot of Gervais-y stream-of-jokiness blather that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have intended to be funny". Aly Semigran of MTV praised the episode for its animation parodies, writing, [...] "Sure, Toy Story and Wallace and Gromit might enjoy more Oscar love than their animated brethren, but The Simpsons send-ups were nothing if not a brilliant tip-of-the-hat to all of those films".|$|E
