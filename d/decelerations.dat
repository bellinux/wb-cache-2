25|$|In 2011, Sicking {{turned his}} {{attention}} to impact energy management in sports. Serious neck injuries in hockey are relatively infrequent but can be catastrophic. Impacts with the rigid walls can produce <b>decelerations</b> of over 100 G’s, causing severe concussions and even quadriplegia. Sicking led the creation of energy absorbing walls that have been shown to successfully reduce head <b>decelerations</b> by 50% under severe impact conditions. These walls are designed to flex and extend during impacts, reducing peak G’s on the player’s head by absorbing the energy of the impact. Sicking is now applying this same concept to develop both improved helmet impact performance standards and a helmet that is more flexible and can decouple head rotation from helmet rotation, thus reducing peak G’s on the head.|$|E

Right before a wheel locks up, it will experience a rapid deceleration. If left unchecked, the wheel would stop much more quickly than any car could. It might take a car five seconds to stop from 60mph (96.6km/h) under ideal conditions, but a wheel that locks up could stop spinning in less than a second.|$|E
40|$|<b>Deceleration</b> {{characteristics}} of vehicles {{are important for}} intersection design, <b>deceleration</b> lane design, traffic simulation modeling, vehicular emission and fuel consumption modeling, etc. Heterogeneous traffic stream consists of vehicles with wide variation in their physical dimensions, weight to power ratio and dynamic characteristics, which affect their <b>deceleration</b> behaviour. Majority of past studies are restricted to <b>deceleration</b> behaviour study of cars and trucks in homogenous traffic. Present study aims to analyze the <b>deceleration</b> behaviour of different vehicles types (like truck, car, motorized two and three-wheeler) on Nagpur-Mumbai Express Highway at Wardha, India. Drivers were asked to decelerate their vehicles from their maximum speed to zero speed in shortest time and their speed profiles are collected using Global Positioning System. <b>Deceleration</b> behaviour of different vehicle types is significantly different. Vehicles with higher maximum speed have higher <b>deceleration</b> time, <b>deceleration</b> distance, maximum and mean <b>deceleration</b> rates during their <b>deceleration</b> manoeuvre. In <b>deceleration</b> manoeuvre, vehicle’s <b>deceleration</b> rate initially increases, attains the maximum <b>deceleration</b> and decreases afterwards. A dual regime model is developed to describe <b>deceleration</b> behaviour over entire speed range of all vehicle types except car. For car, a second order polynomial is proposed...|$|R

500|$|... …And Justice for All is a musically {{progressive}} album featuring {{long and}} complex songs, fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures. Hetfield later explained: [...] "Songwriting-wise, [...] was just us really showing off {{and trying to}} show what we could do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go crazy with it.'" [...] Music critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's epically constructed songs: [...] "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, <b>decelerations</b> and abrupt halts". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that …And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album {{is more of a}} progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands [...] "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took [...] "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|Many of the foraging, {{breeding}} and signaling behaviors of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using the bill. To prevent brain {{damage from the}} rapid and repeated impacts, woodpeckers {{have a number of}} physical features evolved to protect the brain. These include a relatively small and smooth brain, narrow subdural space, little cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding it to prevent it from moving back and forth inside the skull during pecking, the orientation of the brain within the skull (which maximises the contact area between the brain and the skull) and the short duration of contact. The skull consists of strong but compressible sponge-like bone which is most concentrated in the forehead and the back of the skull. Computer simulations have shown that 99.7 percent of the energy generated in pecking was stored in the form of strain energy, which was distributed throughout the bird's body, with only a small remaining fraction of the energy going into the brain. The pecking also heats up the woodpecker's skull, {{which is part of the}} reason why they often peck in short bursts with brief breaks in between, giving the head some time to cool. During the millisecond before contact with wood, a thickened nictitating membrane closes, protecting the eye from flying debris. These membranes also prevent the retina from tearing. The nostrils are also protected; they are often slit-like and have special feathers to cover them. Woodpeckers are capable of repeated pecking on a tree at high <b>decelerations</b> on the order of [...] (1000 g).|$|E
