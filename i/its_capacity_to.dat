Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter homolog, carbon. <b>Its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> {{do so is}} much less because the Pb–Pb bond energy is over {{three and a half}} times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{indicate}} that the angelshark was once abundant all around the coasts of Western Europe. Yarrell (1836), Day (1880–04), and Garstang (1903) all noted that the angelshark was common around the British Isles, and Rey (1928) recorded that this species was common around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean. However, from {{the latter half of}} the 20th century onwards, the angelshark has come under intense pressure from commercial fisheries operating across much of its range. Due to its benthic, near-shore habits, individuals of all ages are susceptible to incidental capture by bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; the low reproductive rate of this shark limits <b>its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> withstand population depletion.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Galapagos shark as near threatened, as its low reproductive rate limits <b>its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> withstand population depletion.

The meat {{is said to be}} of excellent quality. While still common at areas such as Hawaii, the Galapagos shark may have been extirpated from sites around Central America and its fragmented distribution means other regional populations may also be at risk. The populations at the Kermadec and Galapagos Islands are protected within marine reserves.|$|E

5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to <b>its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{details about}} the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes from {{the heat of the}} impact, {{presented}} a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth’s denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers ablate from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to <b>its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> retain heat during atmospheric entry.|$|E
5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit <b>its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> recover from population depletion.|$|E

5|$|While {{pollination}} by ants {{is somewhat}} rare, several Myrmecia {{species have been}} observed pollinating flowers. For example, the orchid Leporella fimbriata is a myrmecophyte {{which can only be}} pollinated by the winged male ant M. urens. Pollination of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males all die. The flower mimics M. urens queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. M. nigrocincta workers have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis, and are considered a potential pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict <b>its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> effect pollination. Foraging M. pilosula workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether M. pilosula contributes to pollination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after {{returning}} to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for <b>its</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No.1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology. In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No.1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, which it operated until June 1973. Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No.1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.|$|E
