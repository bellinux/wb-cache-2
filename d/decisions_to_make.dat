5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
25|$|Development on the {{original}} Dreamcast version of the game began in 1999, under the code name of Project Ares. The game's title was then changed to Eternal Arcadia in 2000, which was the game's final name it was released under in Japan. The internal Sega development team, Overworks, consisted of development staff from Team Andromeda and from the Phantasy Star development teams. The game's producer, Rieko Kodama, in addition to working on Phantasy Star 1, 2, and 4, had also worked {{on the first two}} Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Sega Genesis, while scenario writer Shuntaro Tanaka had written the stories for the first two Sakura Wars game, highly popular Japan-only RPG releases. The game's soundtrack was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda, the latter of which had composed music for Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Anticipation and expectations were immediately set high, between the team's pedigree, especially considering that Team Andromeda's prior game, Panzer Dragoon Saga, had received critical acclaim, and the relative lack of high quality JRPG's on the Dreamcast. Despite the pressure placed on the team, development generally went smoothly, something attributed to the increased horsepower and easier to develop for nature of the Dreamcast, in comparison to the Saturn. The team was made up of a staff of around 20 people. The team made conscious <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> entering individual buildings in towns seamless, without additional loading, and to use an expressive, anime art style to more clearly show facial expressions and emotions of characters, both of which they felt had been lacking from recent popular RPGs such as Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII. Similarly, while the aforementioned games were focused on dark themes and complicated gameplay systems, Overworks strove to keep the game bright and cheerful, with simple gameplay mechanics that focused on exploring a large game world. The game had to be released across two of Sega's proprietary GD-Rom discs, to accommodate its relatively large size.|$|E

500|$|... "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{features}} {{the third and}} final appearance by Alyson Hannigan on the show. The show's crew found it difficult to work an episode into Hannigan's schedule because of other projects. The episode was accompanied by an alternate ending, a publicity move made by executive producer Joel Silver and the UPN promotions department. The episode was initially viewed by 2.82 million viewers and received mostly positive reviews. For example, Rowan Kaiser, of The A.V. Club, wrote [...] "I am intrigued by the <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Veronica less than pure, but this time, I'm not as disappointed by the followthrough." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} to mid-1970s Brezhnev had {{established}} a strong enough power base to effectively become leader. According to historian Ilya Zemtsov, the author of Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika, Kosygin [...] "began to lose power" [...] with the 24th Party Congress in 1971 which {{for the first time}} publicised the formula 'the Politburo led by Brezhnev'". Along with weakening Kosygin's position, Brezhnev moved to strengthen the Party's hold on the Government apparatus, weakening Kosygin's position further. Historian Robert Wesson, the author of Lenin's Legacy: The Story of the CPSU, notes that Kosygin's economic report to the 25th Party Congress [...] "pointed even more clearly to the end of struggle" [...] between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Kosygin was further pushed aside when Brezhnev published his memoirs, which stated that Brezhnev, not Kosygin, was in charge of all major economic <b>decisions.</b> <b>To</b> <b>make</b> matters worse for Kosygin, Brezhnev blocked any future talks on economic reform within the party and government apparatus, and information regarding the reform of 1965 was suppressed.|$|E

500|$|On {{election}} day, Bevin garnered 125,759 votes– 35.4% of the vote– to McConnell's 213,666 votes (60.2%); {{the remaining}} votes were scattered among three lower-profile candidates. In his concession speech, Bevin opined [...] "there is zero {{chance that the}} solutions for what ails us {{is going to come}} from the Democratic Party", but did not endorse McConnell. He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say {{with all due respect to}} a lot of folks who might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to get over it and move on. We have new races to run and new <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears." [...] McConnell defeated Grimes in the general election, and Bevin eventually told reporters that he voted for McConnell.|$|E

And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another of Easterbrook's books, {{focusing}} on social science, is The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse (2003), which explores people's {{perception of their}} own well-being. The book cites statistical data indicating that Americans are better off in terms of material goods and amount of free time but are not happier than before. Easterbrook argues that this has occurred due to choice anxiety (too many <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>make)</b> and abundance denial (not realizing how well we are doing). [...] His proposed remedy is to make our lives more meaningful by doing good while living well.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{of managed}} care argue that [...] "for-profit" [...] managed care has been an {{unsuccessful}} health policy, as it has contributed to higher health care costs (25–33% higher overhead {{at some of the}} largest HMOs), increased the number of uninsured citizens, driven away health care providers, and applied downward pressure on quality (worse scores on 14 of 14 quality indicators reported to the National Committee for Quality Assurance). Others argue that managed care puts the emphasis on financial implications instead of healthcare.

2500|$|Playing as {{a general}} manager {{is similar to the}} {{previous}} General Manager modes in the series, in which one has to choose a brand and act as its General Manager (Jonathan Coachman for Raw, Theodore Long for SmackDown!, Tommy Dreamer for ECW), draft a roster and make <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it the most popular brand of the three. The General Manager is allowed to make staffing decisions, schedule workouts and events. This was also the last game in the Smackdown vs Raw series to have a General Manager mode. There is also an all-new Tournament Mode, which allows the player to control [...] a superstar through the various stages of the WWE tournament, such as Beat The Clock Sprint [...] and King of the Ring, as well as Money in the Bank tournament. The game also allows you to create your own tournament. (This feature is excluded from the Nintendo DS version.) Like previous games in the series, the game also allows players to challenge for and defend championships. The game includes championships used by the WWE in 2007, bringing back the branded championships from the previous game and for the first time, the ECW Championship.|$|E
