All regulated countries have clearly defined <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> as has the GHTF. Although GHTF has tried to achieve harmonization with respect to <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> some differences still exist in the national laws of the countries of GHTF. Further, regulated countries have classified <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> {{on the basis of}} their associated risk. In the Indian regulatory system, <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> are still considered as drugs. In 2006, the <b>Medical</b> <b>Device</b> Regulation Bill was recommended to consolidate laws for <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> and to establish the <b>Medical</b> <b>Device</b> Regulatory Authority of India.

40|$|Abstract Software {{traceability}} {{is central}} to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software develop-ment and essential for regulatory approval. In order {{to comply with the}} regulatory requirements of the <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> industry it is essential to have clear linkages and traceability from requirements- including risks- through the different stages of the software development and maintenance lifecycles. The regulatory bodies request that <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development organizations clearly demon-strate how they follow a software development lifecycle without mandating a par-ticular lifecycle. However, due to the traceability requirements of the industry most <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> companies adopt the V-model. Within this chapter we will discuss the importance of traceability to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development, the current state of practice within the industry in relation to traceability and how we feel that traceability could be improved within the industry.

40|$|Purpose – <b>Medical</b> <b>device</b> {{users are}} one of the {{principal}} stakeholders of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technologies. User involvement in <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technology development and assessment is central to meet their needs. Design/methodology/approach – A structured review of literature, published from 1980 to 2005 in peer-reviewed journals, was carried out from social science perspective to investigate the practice of user involvement in the development and assessment of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technologies. This was followed by qualitative thematic analysis. Findings – It is found that users of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> include clinicians, patients, carers and others. Different kinds of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> are developed and assessed by user involvement. The user involvement occurs at different stages of the <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> technology lifecycle and the degree of user involvement is in the order of design stage > testing and trials stage > deployment stage > concept stage. Methods most commonly used for capturing users’ perspectives are usability tests, interviews and questionnaire surveys.
