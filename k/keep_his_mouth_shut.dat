500|$|The 1922 scandalous {{story in}} the Sunday Los Angeles Times by Scanland annoyed Earp. He was tired of all the lies perpetuated about him and became {{determined}} to get his story accurately told.

And though he promises to keep the device a secret, Homer can't <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> and so shamefully exposes to the world his un-manful behavior concerning the mates. So given that Homer once again learns absolutely nothing from his traveling experience, he can only take to heart the thoughts of the British writer Stephen Fry. 'At my age travel broadens the behind.'" ...|$|E

By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Manchester United amassed their fourth title in five seasons, whereas Arsenal {{finished}} the campaign in third – their highest position since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. During the season, Wenger commented on rule changes which permitted an extension to the league calendar: [...] "It's wrong the programme is extended so Manchester United can rest and win everything."

500|$|By 1957, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Ford, then age 31, {{might not make}} the Browns' roster. Ford arrived at training camp well above his playing weight, and rookie Bob Mischak was given Ford's spot in August. [...] When Mischak withdrew from the team, the spot was awarded to another rookie, Paul Wiggin. [...] Ford worked to shed pounds during training camp and worked to train the young defensive players, including Wiggin and Bill Quinlan. Rookie running back Jim Brown recalled that Ford pulled him aside during the 1957 training camp and gave him advice on dealing with the Browns' head coach Paul Brown. [...] Ford advised the rookie to <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and do as the coach set during practice and waiting until game day: [...] "Run it your way {{in the game and}} hope it works, and if it does, don't say anything.

500|$|In December 1902, the German {{government}} asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its {{dispute with}} Venezuela over unpaid debts. [...] Hay {{did not think}} this appropriate, as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money, and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in. [...] Hay supposedly said, as final details were being worked out, [...] "I have it all arranged. [...] If Teddy will <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> until tomorrow noon!" [...] Hay and Roosevelt also differed over {{the composition of the}} Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute. [...] The commission was to be composed of [...] "impartial jurists" [...] and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges. [...] Roosevelt appointed politicians, including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge. [...] Although Hay was supportive of the President's choices in public, in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt, complained by letter to his friends, and offered his resignation. [...] Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. [...] The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.|$|E

2500|$|Butkus sparked {{controversy}} in 1972 {{with the release}} of Stop-Action, a memoir describing the final week of the 1971 season. The Bears had lost their final five games in 1971, and Butkus used the memoir as an outlet to voice his frustrations and grievances. In particular, he harshly criticized the Lions organization, saying, [...] "I think they are a lot of jerks, from the owner, the general manager, the coach on down... If we were voting for a jerk team or organization they'd have my vote all the way." [...] The Lions responded with a 38–24 win over the Bears in Week 3 of 1972. After the game Lions linebacker Mike Lucci, whom Butkus had labeled a [...] "crybaby", denied that the book had any bearing on the game's outcome, but told reporters that [...] "Butkus should just <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and play football." [...] Butkus, who was notoriously cross with reporters, also denied the attribution and accused the media of sensationalism. Bears teammate Gale Sayers later said he did not like the book, feeling Butkus was above such name-calling. The season as a whole was another productive one for Butkus, who reclaimed the first-team middle linebacker spot on the major All-Pro teams and was invited to his final Pro Bowl.|$|E

A fairly quiet and unassuming character, she comes to his {{attention}} when she delivers Keita his entrance exam results; having passed, he joyfully befriends her. Unlike the other girls, Miharu is comparatively meek, easily intimidated and predisposed to anxiety; as such, she suffers from enuresis (which becomes a running gag in the series). Her relationship with Keita is mostly platonic; what feelings she does have for him are generally overshadowed by the not-too-greatly over-imagined images she has {{of him and his}} stepsisters. She sometimes fantasizes about Keita making non-consensual advances against her, but initially doesn't seem have any romantic interest in him. This situation may not last as she seems to be (glacially) slowly developing a romantic interest in him after he helps her out of various (and sometimes extremely embarrassing) situations (that are usually but unintentionally caused by either the twins or Mikazuki) and <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> about them. Her fondness for Keita grew noticeably when he 'tripped' during a race (actually hurting his leg a little) so that she could finish first and experience {{what it felt like to}} win a sporting event.

Mocha interrogates Drifter, wanting to know the location of Nuri, a Gypsy girl who escaped their camp many years ago. “She mentioned the name Drifter.” Mocha, not happy with Drifter’s refusal to give up any information, orders another Gypsy to burn him with her fire wands.

60|$|When these {{muscles are}} {{strongly}} contracted, those {{running to the}} upper lip[3] likewise contract and raise the upper lip. This {{might have been expected}} from the manner in which at least one of them, the malaris, is connected with the orbiculars. Any one who will gradually contract the muscles round his eyes, will feel, as he increases the force, that his upper lip and the wings of his nose (which are partly acted on by one of the same muscles) are almost always a little drawn up. If he <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> firmly <b>shut</b> whilst contracting the muscles round the eyes, and then suddenly relaxes his lips, he will feel that the pressure on his eyes immediately increases. So again when a person on a bright, glaring day wishes to look at a distant object, but is compelled partially to close his eyelids, the upper lip may almost always be observed to be somewhat raised. The mouths of some very short-sighted persons, who are forced habitually to reduce the aperture of their eyes, wear from this same reason a grinning expression.|$|R
