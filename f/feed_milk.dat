One group was fed untreated milk (UMG). For the other group, milk was thermised at 61 °C for one minute (heat treated milk group¿=¿HMG). After weaning, calves were followed up until first calving. A milk sample of these heifers was taken at first milking to compare udder health of both groups. ResultsThermisation of milk led to an effective reduction of S. aureus in the <b>feeding</b> <b>milk.</b> 78 % of the analysed pools were free of S. aureus, a reduction of at least one log was obtained in the other pools. Quarter milk samples revealed that two heifers had a S. aureus intramammary infection, but caused by a genotype different from genotype B. During the suckling period, the UMG had a significantly higher incidence rate of 1. 09 diarrhoea cases per 100 calf days at risk compared to 0. 26 cases per 100 calf days in the HMG (p¿<¿ 0. 05). ConclusionsUnder the conditions of this study, no effects of <b>feeding</b> <b>milk</b> containing SAGTB on udder health after first calving were observed. But a power analysis indicated that the sample size in the current setup is insufficient to allow for assessment on mastitis risk after SAGTB exposition, as a minimal number of 4 calves infected (vs. 0 in the HMG) would have shown significant effects. High bacterial load, however, was associated with an increased incidence rate of diarrhoea. Thus, thermisation as a minimal preventive measure before <b>feeding</b> mastitis <b>milk</b> to calves might be beneficial for maintaining calf health...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} serovar and {{antimicrobial resistance}} patterns of Salmonella spp isolated from healthy, diseased and necropsied cows and calves in this observational study. Methods: Nineteen isolates recovered from feces and tissues of salmonellosis-affected animals of two commercial farms in north-east of Iran. In {{second part of}} the study, the two farms were sampled 4 times with an interval of 2 month. The samples included calves' feces, adult cows' feces, feeds, water, milk filters, and milk fed to calves. Five Salmonella were isolated from 332 fecal samples collected from calves and peri-parturient cows. No Salmonella was recovered from water, <b>feed,</b> <b>milk</b> filers and milk fed to calves. Results: Salmonella Typhimurium was the most frequently isolate among all sero-groups. S. Dublin was only accounted for 8 % (two out of 24) of isolates. Isolated Salmonella strains were used for the ERIC PCR DNA fingerprinting assay. Our results grouped Salmonella isolates into 3 clusters, suggesting that specific genotypes were responsible for each sero-group of Salmonella. The results also revealed diversity among Salmonella isolates in cluster III (sero-group B). Eighteen out of 19 Salmonella spp. were resistant to oxytetracycline. Five isolates out of 19 showed more than one drug resistance. Multi-drug resistance was seen only among Salmonella Typhimurium isolates. Enrofloxacin was the most susceptible antibiotic against all isolates in this study. Conclusion: The emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium should be of great concern to the public.

40|$|Weaning is a {{stressful}} event for pigs and induces {{changes in the}} gut integrity of pigs. Feed intake {{is a very important}} determinant for gut integrity. In this thesis the effect of nutritional strategies (with regard to feed intake level and physical structure of the feed) on changes in gut morphology, barrier function and inflammatory response were investigated. In the experiments individually housed piglets were fed diets at different intake levels with different physical forms and compositions during 4 to 14 days post weaning. The working hypotheses were that high feed intake minimizes the degeneration of the gut integrity and stimulates the regeneration of a compromised integrity. Weaning induced changes in gut integrity. Overall, feed intake level modulated parameters related to gut integrity like morphology, in vitro barrier function and inflammatory response. The effects found depended on sampling site in the gut and sampling day post weaning. Only the supply of reconstituted milk resulted in voluntary feed intake level sufficiently high to maintain gut integrity. In vitro paracellular permeability for small molecules was transiently increased after weaning, while permeability for large molecules was decreased. High intake <b>feed</b> (<b>milk)</b> resulted in lower permeability values compared to a low intake level. Changes in gut morphology and permeability were related to feed intake level. In most experiments, individual feed intake was also correlated with body weight gain and in some experiments with inflammatory response parameters. At a low feed intake level, gut barrier function was already affected at day 1 post weaning, followed by changes in gut morphology. Variation in parameters related to gut integrity between piglets within trials and between experiments was high making it very difficult to compare data of different experiments...|$|E

(Biotechnology) Abstract: The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues in both animals and humans remained major public health concerns which require some serious attention especially in South Africa with high consumption rate of cattle and cattle products. However, review of literature revealed that, {{there seems to be}} no studies conducted to establish estimated levels of dairy cattle exposure to OCP by estimating levels in dairy cattle feeds, milk, urine, and water, in South Africa. Therefore, this present study was carried out to analyse the possible presence of OCP residues in cattle/ bovine <b>feed,</b> <b>milk,</b> water and urine samples. The samples analysed included, milk (24 samples), urine (12 samples), water (12 samples) and feed (36 samples) which were collected into 50 mL sterile capped bottle from 12 selected farms in Gauteng province of South Africa. Six different OCP residues namely, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and endrin were analysed. The samples preparation method for OCP involved the use of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure, while separation and quantification was done using a two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight with mass spectrometer (GCXGC TOF MS). The results of the perception study revealed that out of the 12 farms, 41. 7 % practice chemical method and 58 % practice biological method of pest control. The majority of farmers (75 %) were found to be aware of pesticide residues risks but (92 %) neither tested for pesticide residues nor attended any food safety training on pesticide uses. Moreover, the results from GCXGC TOF MS analysis revealed that urine samples were contaminated with OCP residues with high concentration of endosulfan I ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 05 mg/kg, while DDT and its isomers ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 02 mg/kg.

The aim of this project was to develop and test blended pelleted products based on combinations of carinata/canola meal, pea screenings, and lignosulfonate at different levels for ruminants. Chemical profile, energy value, rumen degradation kinetics of nutrients, hourly effective rumen degradation ratios/potential N-to-energy synchronization, and intestinal digestion of nutrients were analyzed, then the truly absorbed protein supply to dairy cattle and <b>feed</b> <b>milk</b> values were evaluated using on the DVE/OEB system and the NRC Dairy model. Comparisons were made among blend pelleted products based on carinata meal versus canola meal based pelleted products, addition vs. non addition of lignosulfonate, and low level of inclusion of those co-products with high level of inclusion of pea screenings vs. high level of inclusion of co-products with low level of inclusion of pea screenings. Statistical analyses were performed using PROC MIXED of SAS 9. 4 with significance declared at P< 0. 05. The results showed that all blend pelleted products had safe levels of glucosinolates (3. 46 to 5. 86 µmol/g) and condensed tannins (maximum of 0. 033 % DM), and high pellet durability index (PDI) (88. 5 to 97. 5 %). Carinata based pelleted products were lower in NDF content (- 4. 6 % DM), but higher in protein (+ 3. 2 % DM), and in total amino acids (+ 1. 23 % DM) than the canola pelleted products. Canola pelleted products contained higher level of methionine (1. 90 vs. 1. 70 % CP) than the carinata blend pelleted products. Canola blend pelleted products contained higher lysine ranging from 5. 71 to 5. 90 % CP than carinata based pelleted products which ranged from 4. 20 to 4. 43 % CP. Carinata based blend pelleted products contained higher NE for lactation (NEL), maintenance (NEm) and growth (NEg) (1. 99 vs. 1. 83, 2. 15 vs. 1. 98 and 1. 47 vs. 1. 33 Mcal/kg, respectively) than canola based pelleted products. In terms of protein fractions, carinata based blend pelleted products contain lower true soluble protein (PA 2) {{with a mean of}} 29. 5 % of CP and indigestible protein (PC) with a mean of 1. 5 % of CP, but higher (P< 0. 05) fiber bound-protein (PB 2) with a mean of 12. 0 % of CP than canola based blend pelleted products. In terms of CHO fractions, carinata based blend pelleted products had lower (P< 0. 05) indigestible fiber (CC) with a mean of 12. 5 % of CHO. According to the hourly effective degradation ratios between rumen available N and CHO (ED_N/ED_CHO), all blend pelleted products had overall degradation ratios above the optimal N to CHO ratio. In addition, carinata based blend pelleted products contain lower (P< 0. 05) rumen effective degraded protein (221 vs. 245 g/kg DM), higher rumen bypass protein (207 vs. 146 g/kg DM), higher effective fiber degradability of NDF (28. 3 vs. 25. 4 %), higher intestinal absorbable feed protein (IADP 146 vs. 90 g/kg DM) than canola based blend pelleted products. Furthermore, carinata based blend pelleted products contained higher total protein truly digested in the small intestine (DVE 218 vs. 158 g/kg DM), metabolizable protein (MP 210 vs. 151 g/kg DM) and lower degradable protein balance (OEB and DPB values) (105 vs. 130 and 111 vs. 142 g/kg DM, respectively) than canola based blend pelleted products, which leads them to contain higher (P< 0. 05) <b>feed</b> <b>milk</b> value (FMVDVE and FMVNRC) (4. 43 vs. 3. 22 and 4. 01 vs. 2. 76 g/kg DM, respectively) than canola based blend pelleted products...|$|E
40|$|More than {{a century}} ago, Johne and Frothingham dis-covered Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (MAP) in cattle, the causative agent of Johne`s Disease (Paratuberculosis), a chronic, debilitating intestinal infection. Johne`s Disease is found most often among domestic and wild ruminants but also {{has been reported in}} non-ruminants (1, 15). What`s more, the suggestion that MAP {{may play a role in}} human Crohn`s Disease has led to increased awareness in the medical community and the public (2, 13). Johne`s Disease is a frustrating disease for both livestock producers and veterinarians and is associated with large economic losses in dairy cattle (14, 17). Losses are primarily due to decreased milk production and reproduction (5), and reduced salvage value of clinically affected animals. A national study of US dairies found that approx 22 % of farms have at least 10 % of the herd infected with MAP (12). In Michigan, recent estimates suggest that 54 % of herds are test positive for Johne’s disase (8). The average loss ranges from $ 40 per cow (low clinical cull rate) to $ 227 per cow (high clinical cull rate). In this report, we focus on new developments in diagno-sis, vaccines, and control measures in the fight against Johne’s Disease. Through on-going national and international research programs, our ability to detect infected cattle is constantly improving and new vaccines are ready for testing. Signs and Transmission Calves under 6 months of age are most susceptible to MAP infection. Although many animals in a herd may be infected, usually less than 5 % of these will develop clinical disease, which is always fatal. Healthy, but MAP-infected animals (carriers) can actively shed the organism in their feces, thereby heavily contaminating the environment on the farm, without being recognized as infectious. The fact that MAP is able to survive in stagnant water, manure, and deep soil for up to a year makes the control of Johne`s Disease even more complicated (9, 10).

40|$|Jersey calves {{were fed}} warm (38 'C) or cool (lO'C) milk, diluted or undiluted, from {{five days of}} age until weaning at 55 kg live weight. The <b>feeding</b> of warm <b>milk</b> {{resulted}} in greater liveweight gains to eight weeks of age, and an earlier weaning age, when compared with <b>feeding</b> cool <b>milk.</b> The <b>feeding</b> of undiluted cool milk resulted in a reduction in diarrhoea, and dilution of both warm and cool milk led to increased feed refusals.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to determine whether or not}} the probiotic Lactobacillus GG can colonise the immature bowel of premature infants and if so, does colonisation result in a reduction of the size of the bowel reservoir of nosocomial pathogens such as enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, yeasts or staphylococci, and does colonisation with Lactobacillus GG have any effect on the clinical progress and outcome. Twenty preterm infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks or less who were resident on a neonatal unit were studied from the initiation of <b>milk</b> <b>feeds</b> until discharge. The infants were randomised to receive either <b>milk</b> <b>feeds</b> or <b>milk</b> <b>feeds</b> supplemented with Lactobacillus GG 10 (8) colony forming units twice a day for two weeks. The clinical features of the two groups of infants were similar. Orally administered Lactobacillus GG was well tolerated and did colonise the bowel of premature infants. However, colonisation with Lactobacillus GG did not reduce the faecal reservoir of potential pathogens and there was no evidence that colonisation had any positive clinical benefit for this particular group of infants...|$|R
