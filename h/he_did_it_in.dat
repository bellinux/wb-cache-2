In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from The Sunday Times newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition.

The most famous composition in the soundtrack is the [...] "James Bond Theme", which is heard in the gunbarrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits, and was written by Norman based on a previous composition of his. John Barry, who would later go on to compose the music for eleven Bond films, arranged the Bond theme, but was uncredited—except for the credit of his orchestra playing the final piece.

2500|$|The Connecticut Court {{found the}} {{argument}} of the defendant-respondent to be exceptionally weak {{in terms of the}} law.

[...] The plaintiff had [...] "improved" [...] what was otherwise a nuisance to the town. [...] In this act, he also had some legal standing to claim a superior ownership to anyone else. [...] The existing laws allowing persons who piled up seaweed to have a legitimate claim of possession for 24 hours was invoked. [...] The court had nothing good to say about the defendant-respondent, stating he had not placed himself in an enviable light.|$|E
2500|$|Petre's buildings, in {{whatever}} style, all have one common denominator: an {{attention to the}} smallest detail. It was said that his drawings of stones, window traceries, arches and ornamentation were so precise that stonemasons could execute his intentions from one single drawing. It is this attention to detail which is outstanding, whether the simple carving on the capital of an Ionic column or the heavy ornate work on the monumental corbel of a Gothic design. While this precision enabled him to work as successfully {{in a wide range}} of styles as <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> no way inhibited his sense of developing design. In his own words, an architectural style could be [...] "treated liberally", and this is the key to the individuality of his designs. Dunedin's Royal Exchange building is a Palladian town Palace, yet has an almost Rastrellian restrained baroque design. Cargill's Castle would not have looked out of place in the Cimini Hills; it also has an almost hacienda spirit. His work in the Gothic style was lighter and more delicate than that of Alfred Waterhouse, and equal in detail to Augustus Pugin's. It has been said of his work that he never fully developed his vision or overcame the limitations of his training, but his experience as an engineer equipped him to find sound innovative solutions to construction problems. His placing the dome at the Blessed Sacrament over the altar has also been criticised, as many feel it does not cohere to the design. However, others feel it was a stroke of genius, enhancing the interior.|$|E

The Guardian scored the film {{four out of five}} stars, calling it [...] "...the first great contemporary Shakespeare since Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet". Christopher Schobert of IndieWire wrote, [...] "The result is an utter joy, Whedon's most emotionally resonant and fully realized feature film to date. And I say that as one who is not a devoted member of the Whedon army". Sheila O'Malley of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, noting that [...] "Much Ado About Nothing {{is one of the best}} films of the year". BBC Radio 5 Live's Mark Kermode said of the film, [...] "One of the things that it manages to do is, firstly, make all the dialogue and the language completely comprehensible". He proceeded to note that [...] "it makes sense to its audience. I think that the comedy is funny, and I don't say that lightly. [...] And finally, I think in terms of the way in which it deals with that gender politics issue is really well done. [...] It's a very hard trick to pull off, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> two weeks!" [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire believed that, while keeping a sense of noir to compensate the romance, it was [...] "in balancing these competing elements and characters that this version really shines". The Village Voices Chris Packham said that the director [...] "approaches the story with a tremendous amount of joy".|$|E
