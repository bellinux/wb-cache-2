Prior to going with him to the hospital, I checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.|$|E

60|$|Dominey felt {{as though}} <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>breathing</b> an {{atmosphere}} of turgid and poisoned sweetness. There was a flavour of unreality about the whole situation,--the room, this child woman, her beauty, her deliberate, halting speech and the strange things she said.|$|R
5000|$|Slyck - Slyck is {{the evil}} twin of Blob. His battle stance {{looks as if}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>breathing</b> heavily. His eyes are yellow with green and his teeth <b>are</b> yellow. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> seen glaring with his mouth open with closed teeth. He turns into {{different}} objects than Blob, but they fight in a similar manner. When he wins, he glares and says [...] "I'm number one!".|$|R

60|$|When, after a time, Bob {{attempted}} {{to ease down}} the mad pace, spurs and quirt went into him again with undiminished vim and put him to renewed effort. And when, at last, Daylight decided that the horse had had enough, he turned him around abruptly and put him into a gentle canter on the forward track.

6000|$|... "You will {{communicate}} that fact also to your superiors," [...] he said, with taunting irony. [...] "The monster of the seas, he who plunders defenceless fishermen ravages unprotected coasts, and eludes {{the flag of}} King George, as other serpents steal into their caves at the footstep of man, is safe in speaking his mind, backed by {{a hundred and fifty}} freebooters, and in the security of his own cabin. Perhaps he knows too, that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>breathing</b> in the atmosphere of peaceful and peace-making woman." ...|$|R
50|$|As the Koenig-image remains comatose, the Alpha {{community}} becomes ill-tempered and quarrelsome. Bergman referees {{a heated}} discussion between Carter and Paul Morrow. Without Koenigs leadership, Morrow argues, {{the base is}} unravelling; someone must step up and fill the void. Carter proclaims that, as long as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>breathing,</b> Koenig <b>is</b> still the commander. On Zenno, Raan interrupts the lovers by bringing another visitor to his home: Sandra. Vana is distressed by her fathers attempts to separate her and Koenig. Raan goes one step further when he tells Koenig his image on Alpha is dying—ending any chance of returning there. He must make a choice now.|$|R
5000|$|Anapanasati is {{described}} in detail in the Anapanasati Sutta: Breathing in long, <b>he</b> discerns, 'I <b>am</b> <b>breathing</b> in long'; or breathing out long, <b>he</b> discerns, 'I <b>am</b> <b>breathing</b> out long.' Or breathing in short, <b>he</b> discerns, 'I <b>am</b> <b>breathing</b> in short'; or breathing out short, <b>he</b> discerns, 'I <b>am</b> <b>breathing</b> out short.' <b>He</b> trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' If it is pursued and well developed, {{it is said to}} bring great benefit according to the Anapanasati Sutta: [...] "This is how mindfulness of in-&-out <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> developed & pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit." [...] As for the training, the Anapanasati sutta states: On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady & without lapse. When his mindfulness is steady & without lapse, then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.|$|R
