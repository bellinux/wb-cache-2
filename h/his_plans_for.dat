5|$|That year, {{relations}} with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Amin expelled Israeli military advisers {{and turned to}} Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and the Soviet Union for support. Amin became {{an outspoken critic of}} Israel. In return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to Amin. In the 1974 French-produced documentary film , Amin discussed <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers, and suicide squadrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{structural}} material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi to change <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> the statue's assembly. He had originally expected {{to assemble the}} skin on-site as the masonry pier was built; instead he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe's Island.|$|E

5|$|Although McKinley enjoyed {{meeting the}} public, Cortelyou was {{concerned}} with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> a second term.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} {{approached in}} 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors {{to take a}} year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> several months, while he strove to secure {{the future of the}} orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} approached, Beecham {{was advised}} by his doctors {{to take a}} year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had been seeking for several years {{to get him to}} conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.|$|E

After beating Powell for the sixth time in Daegu, Gay stated that he would reconsider <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> groin surgery in the off-season as it was mainly a case of resolving discomfort when running, rather than a more serious injury.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was sworn}} in on December 31, 2005 at the Buffalo Convention Center. During his first day in office he toured the Buffalo Waterfront to show his {{commitment}} to its development. Before {{the end of the}} year, restoration on the original point where the Erie Canal met the Great Lakes was underway. Brown presented <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> the development during subsequent tours by top state leaders, including future New York State Governors Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson.

5|$|Crawford {{announced}} <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> a sequel, Frog Fractions 2, via a Kickstarter {{campaign in}} March 2014, with a planned release in 2015. The campaign included {{a number of}} elements that pointed players towards a larger alternate reality game (ARG) that incorporated a number of web sites, social media accounts, real-life locations, and around two dozen independent video games. The ARG was solved by players around December 2016, discovering a physical box that triggered the release of Frog Fractions 2, hidden within {{the content of the}} video game Glittermitten Grove.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{previous}} season's heroics, Primus {{was not used}} regularly {{in the early part}} of Portsmouth's first Premier League season. Harry Redknapp had ditched his 3–5–2 formation in favour of the more conventional 4–4–2 and partnered new record signing Dejan Stefanović with Arjan de Zeeuw. During December, Portsmouth were in a terrible run of form and Redknapp decided to bring one of his most reliable players back into <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> the derby match with Southampton. In spite of a 3–0 loss, Primus retained his starting place for the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 Nas {{announced}} Illmatic XX, the 20th Anniversary Edition of {{the original}} album Illmatic, released April 15, 4 days prior to the 20th Anniversary {{of the original}}'s release date (April 19).

5|$|In the 1780s, Catherine {{slightly}} favored Poniatowski {{over the}} opposition, {{but did not}} support any of <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> significant reforms. Despite repeated attempts, Poniatowski failed to confederate the sejms, which would have made them immune to liberum veto. Thus, although he had {{a majority in the}} Sejms, Poniatowski was unable to pass even the smallest reform. The Zamoyski Code was rejected by the Sejm of 1780, and opposition attacks on the king dominated the Sejms of 1782 and 1786.|$|E
50|$|Hyojong of Joseon (3 July 1619 - 23 June 1659) was {{the seventeenth}} {{king of the}} Joseon Dynasty of Korea from 1649 to 1659.

5000|$|However, {{as can be}} {{seen from}} the {{descriptions}} of <b>his</b> <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> the war with Austria and the war with France, <b>his</b> <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> war was very detailed and took into account thousands of variables. It is a mistake to think that Moltke thought war plans were of no use (which a simple reading of [...] "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy" [...] would seem to indicate).|$|R

5|$|Many of his {{designs were}} never {{executed}} or were subsequently demolished or altered. His competition entries for cathedrals at Lille (1854), Adelaide (1856), Colombo, Brisbane (1859), Edinburgh (1873), and Truro (1878) were all unsuccessful. He lost out to George Edmund Street {{in the competition}} for the Royal Courts of Justice (1866–67) in The Strand. <b>His</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> the redecoration of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral (1870–77) were abandoned and he was dismissed from his post. Skilbeck's Warehouse (1865–66) was demolished in the 1970s, and work at Salisbury Cathedral (1855–59), at Worcester College, Oxford (1873–79), and at Knightshayes Court had {{been lost in the}} decades before.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Professor Bernard Quatermass (Andrew Keir) is dismayed {{to learn}} that <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> the {{colonisation}} of the Moon are to {{be taken over by}} the military. He gives a cold reception to Colonel Breen (Julian Glover), who has been assigned to join Quatermass's British Experimental Rocket Group. When the bomb disposal team call for Breen's assistance, Quatermass accompanies him to the site. Breen concludes it is a V-weapon, but Quatermass disagrees. When another skeleton is found in an inner chamber, Quatermass and Roney realise that the object must also be five million years old. Quatermass suspects it is of alien origin, but Roney is certain the apemen are terrestrial.|$|E
5|$|On being {{chosen as}} chairman, Fakih began work to ensure {{there would be}} a successor, as his health was failing. On 2 October, at a joint meeting of the board at his home, he {{outlined}} <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> his three-year period of leadership; Fakih also appointed Rasjidi and Abdul Rozak Fachruddin as temporary leaders while he went abroad for medical treatment. Fakih died on 3 October 1968, only a few days after being selected, and was replaced by Fachruddin on the day of his death; Fachruddin served as chairman for 24years.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor and he would raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|This {{apparent}} {{reconciliation between}} Venice and the Pope {{did not stop}} the French from again invading the Veneto in March. Pitigliano's death in January had left Andrea Gritti {{in command of the}} Venetian forces; although Maximilian failed to reinforce Louis, the French army was nonetheless sufficient to drive the Venetians from Vicenza by May. Gritti garrisoned Padua for an expected attack by a combined Franco-Imperial army, but Louis, more concerned by the death of his advisor, the Cardinal d'Amboise, abandoned <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> a siege.|$|E
5|$|Ashe and {{the party}} journey to Pharos tower, the {{location}} of the Sun-cryst, where she decides not to take her revenge by following the Occuria's wishes, but instead destroy the Sun-cryst. The party defeats Gabranth, who reveals that he killed King Raminas, and then the party also defeats Cid, before destroying the crystal. The group later learns from Al-Cid that the Dalmascan Resistance, led by Ondore, is about to fight Archadia in Rabanastre, but the Archadian forces now include the Sky Fortress Bahamut, powered by the Mist released by the destruction of the Sun-Cryst. They infiltrate the Bahamut, and find Larsa attempting to dissuade his brother Vayne from <b>his</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> war to no avail. They defeat Vayne and Venat, and Ashe and Larsa announce the end of the conflict to the battlefield. Larsa becomes the Archadian emperor and Ashe the Queen of Dalmasca; Basch replaces his brother Gabranth as Larsa's protector; Vaan and Penelo fly an airship to meet Balthier and Fran for another adventure.|$|E
