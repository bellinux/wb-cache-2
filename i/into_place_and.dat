5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The red hue was abandoned, as {{when viewed}} on {{television}} sets it made Nimoy look dark skinned. The makeup artists tried a yellow hue instead, which lightened Nimoy {{on television and}} {{it was agreed that}} this was an improvement. Meanwhile, Chambers re-created an ear mould as the ones created earlier for Nimoy were damaged. These new moulds would be the basis of the well known Spock ears. Each time Nimoy wore the ears, they were glued <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> could only be removed with solvent. But the ears were damaged in their removal, and so each pair could only be worn once.|$|E
25|$|The first {{campaign}} against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of indentured labour to the slavery of the past. The {{campaign against}} Coolie emigration was led by Joseph Sturge, with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices. In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when {{the scale of the}} abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> severe penalties were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.|$|E
25|$|The two crews {{set to work}} {{following}} their wake up call, preparing for the first spacewalk of the mission. Swanson and Arnold exited the Quest airlock at 16:22 UTC to begin {{the installation of the}} S6 truss segment. Once Swanson and Arnold were in position, Phillips and Wakata remotely controlled the station's robotic arm, maneuvering the truss into its final position. Swanson and Arnold then bolted the truss <b>into</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> connected power and data cables, which allowed the ground team to begin remote activation of the segment. The two spacewalkers also removed launch locks, stowed a keel pin, removed and jettisoned four thermal covers, and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch. The spacewalk ended at 21:11 UTC, for a total time of 6 hours, 7 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Numerous consortia bid on the {{contract}} to construct the bridge. Hyundai made the lowest bid but were disqualified for non-compliance with the financial requirements. A Japanese bid was ruled out for being too expensive. An Anglo-Japanese joint venture, comprising Costain, Mitsui, and Trafalgar House, won the job. Construction work on the bridge began in June 1992. Gammon Construction constructed the caissons for the bridge towers. The framework for each caisson was floated <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> sunk, and then filled with concrete underwater. The two caissons on the Ma Wan side weigh 4,500 tons each, while those on the Tsing Yi side (closer to shore) each weigh about 3,000 tons. Land reclamation was carried out {{at both ends of}} the bridge. The more substantial reclamation on Ma Wan was used as a work platform for construction crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{process to}} build the SAS tower atop its {{foundation}} consisted of five phases. The first four phases each consisted of lifting four similar columns and bolting them <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> to elements connecting them, while the last phase was to lift the final top cap that will carry the crowning main cable saddle. On July 28, 2010, {{the first of four}} below-deck main tower pillars was erected, having arrived earlier in the month by barge from China. They were placed by lifting one end from a barge into a temporary scaffold, with a carriage on the barge to allow the lower end to move into place. After the columns were bolted into place, the scaffolding was then extended upward to allow the next set of above deck columns to be erected, lifted, and translated into position, a process repeated for each of the remaining phases.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II, armor plating became still thicker, with tanks such as the Tiger II being {{fitted with}} armor over 100mm in thickness, as {{compared}} to the 15mm more typical in 1939. This prompted the development of a third generation of anti-tank guns, large caliber pieces in the 57mm to 100mm range. The British Army adopted the Ordnance QF 6-pounder and Ordnance QF 17-pounder, which were then considered great advances in firepower, and the Wehrmacht fielded the even larger 7.5 cm Pak 41 and 8.8 cm Pak 43. The early 37mm anti-tank guns were easily concealed and moved; these large caliber weapons required equally large vehicles to tow them <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> were difficult to conceal, dig in, withdraw, or reposition. By 1945 large anti-tank guns had become almost impractical in their role, and their size and weight was considered a liability. They were also expensive to produce. Many were issued, at least initially, on the divisional level but gradually made their way to individual infantry battalions.|$|E

25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated <b>into</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E

From February 1914, the ship served as a accommodation hulk for the Naval High School at Heybeliada. She became a stationary training ship for naval cadets in February 1919, based in Constantinople. She returned to barracks ship duties in 1923 and was stationed at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard. She was decommissioned in 1928 and broken up in Gölcük.|$|E
