5000|$|An {{antistatic}} {{floor mat}} or <b>ground</b> <b>mat</b> {{is one of}} a number of antistatic devices designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding. Typical resistance is on the order of 105 to 108 ohms between points on the mat and to ground. [...] The mat would need to be grounded (earthed). This is usually accomplished by plugging into the grounded line in an electrical outlet. It's important to discharge at a slow rate, therefore a resistor should be used in earthing the mat. The resistor, as well as allowing high-voltage charges to leak through to earth, also prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Some ground mats allow you to connect an antistatic wrist strap to them. Versions are designed for placement on both the floor and desk.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2004 IEEEInhomogeneous ground {{can cause}} {{significant}} scattering of incident electromagnetic fields. For example, {{the introduction of}} a metallic <b>ground</b> <b>mat</b> can {{have a significant effect on}} the radiation pattern of an antenna. Several approaches to the problem have been developed and most are based on integral electromagnetic formulations such as the extinction and compensation theorems. The extinction theorem approach derives the leading order behaviour of the scattered field from the leading order behaviour of the incident field. For most practical situations, however, the field becomes extremely weak close to the ground, and higher order terms are required. The paper extends earlier work (Coleman, C. J., 1996, 1997, 1998, 2003) on the extinction theorem approach to these higher order terms. The procedure for calculating the leading order scattered field is described and it is shown how this process can be extended to the calculation of higher order terms. Finally, the procedure is used to derive an expression for the field of a general antenna in the vicinity of inhomogeneous ground. In the case of large inhomogeneous features, the theory predicts behaviour that is expected from the results of other approaches...|$|E

40|$|The undergrounding of HV subtransmission {{networks}} in urban/suburban areas {{is bound to}} increase fault currents, especially for ground faults if system neutral is solidly grounded. A parametric fault analysis based on symmetrical components is applied to a sample HV system with three lines and two EHV points of supply, based on a simple meshed Italian subtransmission network. Results are then validated by detailed three-phase ATP-EMTP simulations. Values yielded by the parametric study confirm the expected increase of all fault levels, reaching up to 36 % and 69 % for three-phase and 1 -phase-to-ground faults, and even 104 % for the ground current of phase-to-phase-to-ground faults.

40|$|Abstract—Setting up {{ground based}} antennas for {{operation}} in the HF and longer wavelength bands frequently involves clearing large areas of land for the installation of <b>ground</b> <b>mats</b> to provide a high conductivity return path for the displacement currents. In moving from the cleared area to the virgin scrubland beyond, which {{is assumed to be}} forested with bushes and small trees, there is the possibility of an abrupt change in surface properties at the boundary resulting from the discontinuity in the vegetation which at longer wavelengths can be modelled as a change in surface impedance. By modelling the trees and bushes as point dipole moments, the aim {{of this paper is to}} estimate the significance of any such effect in terms of the gross physical properties of the vegetation. The result is to show that in normal circumstances the effect can be expected to be slight. A solution to this problem has application in helping determine the environmental footprint of the antenna installation, the amount of land that needs to be cleared to satisfactorily accommodate it. 1...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} AC substations {{grounding system}} for either conventional or gas-insulated. The design of grounding systems of substations has {{the primary purpose}} of ensuring the safety and well being of personnel, who may become electrically coupled to the <b>grounding</b> <b>mats</b> during unbalanced fault conditions (El-Dessouky, El-Aziz, & Khamis, 1998), (Phan, 1990). In general, an unbalanced fault will cause a ground potential rise of the system neutral and any conductive medium electrically connected to the neutral. The approach of this design is based on the IEEE Standard 80 - 2000 which discusses the following subjects safety in grounding, tolerable body current limit, primary and auxiliary ground electrodes, grounding enclosure sizing of conductors and materials, soil characteristics, ground resistance, types of ground faults, installation of connections, pigtails, ground rods, and ground grid integrity test. In this project, general system structure as well as rules and data representations are discussed. An illustrative example is presented using 15 kv medium voltage switchgear for Tri-Met Portland Westside light rail (Thomas & Pham, 1999). The ac substations grounding system design presented in this project can assist grounding system engineer to obtain a safe grounding system which is one of most important design aspects of substations.

40|$|A DC {{high voltage}} ground fault relay (64 P), {{one of the}} feeding {{protection}} systems of DC railway substations, is a device for monitoring the voltage (the difference in potential) between the <b>grounding</b> <b>mat</b> of the substation and the return wire corresponding to the rail. If a ground fault occurs within a substation, it also detects the voltage rise and immediately sends out an open command to related circuit breakers to stop the supply of power {{to the point of}} the ground fault. However, some ground faults can cause damage to surrounding facilities as well as the point of the accident. At the same time, they could also possibly hamper ground fault protection due to contact fault with auxiliary energizing sources, spreading the damage. We have therefore conducted development of a ground fault protective relay that needs no auxiliary energizing source (DC 110 V) to drive the protection device with an aim of improving reliability of ground fault protection. 2. 1 DC Feeding System In a DC feeding system, DC 1, 500 V (standard voltage) stepped down from 66 kV special high voltage and rectified by a rectifier at substations is supplied to feeders and contact wires as shown in Fig. 1.

We had a Volkswagen microbus – a stripped-down utility vehicle that was spartan, but commodious—that had a 35 -horsepower, air-cooled engine. I readied the vehicle for the trip by having the middle of the three seats removed and a wooden platform built that went from the rear seat {{to the back of the}} front seat. We packed all my teaching equipment under the platform, plus a tent, camping gear, field clothes, waders, boat oars, and my fishing rods. <b>Ground</b> <b>mats</b> and the sleeping bags were placed on top of the platform.
