5|$|Under the {{influence}} of C. S. Peirce and William James, Putnam also became convinced {{that there is no}} fact–value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) <b>judgments</b> often have a factual basis, while scientific <b>judgments</b> have a normative element.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, <b>judgments</b> handed down by the courts are {{considered}} a source of law. <b>Judgments</b> may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, the <b>judgment</b> {{creditor}} {{is entitled}} to enforce the <b>judgment</b> 30 years past the <b>judgment</b> date. In California and Saskatchewan, the <b>judgment</b> creditor {{is entitled to}} enforce the <b>judgment</b> 10 years past the <b>judgment</b> date subject to exceptions that allow the <b>judgment</b> creditor to renew the enforcement for an additional 10 years.|$|R
40|$|Applied {{research}} on <b>judgment</b> formation, e. g. in education, {{is interested in}} identifying the underlying <b>judgment</b> rules from empirical <b>judgment</b> data. Psychological theories and empirical results on human <b>judgment</b> formation support the assumption of compensatory strategies, e. g. (weighted) linear models, as well as non compensatory (heuristic) strategies as underlying <b>judgment</b> rules. Previous research repeatedly demonstrated that linear regression models well fitted empirical <b>judgment</b> data, leading {{to the conclusion that}} the underlying cognitive <b>judgment</b> rules were also linear and compensatory. This simulation study investigated whether a good fit of a linear regression model is a valid indicator of a compensatory cognitive <b>judgment</b> formation process. Simulated <b>judgment</b> data sets with underlying compensatory and noncompensatory <b>judgment</b> rules were generated to reflect typical <b>judgment</b> data from applied educational research. Results indicated that linear regression models well fitted even <b>judgment</b> data with underlying non compensatory <b>judgment</b> rules, thus impairing the validity of the fit of the linear model as an indicator of compensatory cognitive <b>judgment</b> processes...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} Last <b>Judgment</b> is similar but unique. Various Last <b>Judgment</b> {{scenarios}} represent {{different forms of}} a general <b>judgment,</b> such as a global last <b>judgment</b> or a national last <b>judgment.</b> It {{is more concerned with}} the depictions and descriptions of particular versions.|$|R
5|$|The city paid a {{total of}} $391.5 million in {{settlements}} and <b>judgments.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ruling {{clears the}} way for the plaintiff-respondents to collect from the roughly $1.75billion bank account, which will be enough to satisfy about 70% of their {{collective}} $2.5billion in <b>judgments.</b> They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of <b>judgments</b> until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{involved}} {{more than}} 1300 {{individuals who had}} won several separate <b>judgments</b> against Iran for its supportive role in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, several other bombings, an assassination, and a kidnapping. After winning <b>judgments</b> by default, based on a clear evidentiary basis for Iran's liability, they sought writs of execution against a Citibank account in New York connected with Iran's central bank. The suits for execution against the Citibank account were consolidated into one case through various procedural mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|A vacated <b>judgment</b> makes a {{previous}} legal <b>judgment</b> legally void. A vacated <b>judgment</b> {{is usually the}} result of the <b>judgment</b> of an appellate court, which overturns, reverses, or sets aside the <b>judgment</b> of a lower court. An appellate court may also vacate its own decisions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Judgment</b> {{creditors}} {{may also}} need to investigate whether <b>judgment</b> debtors are capable of paying. Understanding whether a <b>judgment</b> debtor is capable of fulfilling the <b>judgment</b> order may affect the enforcement mechanism used to recover the money or property. Some steps are available in different jurisdictions to investigate or interview <b>judgment</b> creditors, and investigations may be conducted either by the <b>judgment</b> creditor or by a sheriff or bailiff.|$|R
5000|$|For example, in California, a <b>judgment</b> {{creditor}} must file an [...] "Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment" [...] {{where it}} has been paid in full by the <b>judgment</b> debtor within 15 days of the <b>judgment</b> debtor's request. This document has the effect of formally closing the case and terminating any ongoing garnishment arrangements or liens. In Saskatchewan, upon either the satisfaction or withdrawal of a <b>judgment,</b> a <b>judgment</b> debtor can seek a discharge of <b>judgment.</b> If successful, the <b>judgment</b> is removed from the <b>Judgment</b> Registry and detached from any property registered on the Personal Property registry, titles, or interests in land.|$|R
5|$|With his <b>judgments</b> on war {{pensions}} {{and his role}} in the enquiry into the Profumo Affair, Denning became possibly the best-known judge ever to belong to the English judiciary, with the public treating Lord Denning and the Court of Appeal as synonymous. He was equally well-loved and controversial, appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the common man and disliked by elements of the bar and judiciary for 'uncertainty in the law' created by his broad <b>judgments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his <b>judgments</b> were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many <b>judgments</b> stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the Better Government Association, a non-partisan {{watchdog}} group, {{reported that}} the city of Chicago had spent more than $521.3 million in the previous decade on lawsuit settlements, <b>judgments,</b> and legal fees for defenses related to police misconduct. In 2013, the most expensive year, it paid more than $83.6 million.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>judgment</b> {{creditor}} is a {{party to}} which a debt is owed that has proved the debt in a legal proceeding and that is entitled to use judicial process to collect the debt. A creditor becomes a [...] "judgment creditor" [...] when a <b>judgment</b> is rendered stating that {{they are entitled to}} recover a particular debt from a <b>judgment</b> debtor. Following a <b>judgment,</b> a <b>judgment</b> debtor may satisfy the debt voluntarily or the <b>judgment</b> creditor may need to take additional steps to enforce the <b>judgment.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{commercial}} spin-off of the Good <b>Judgment</b> Project {{started to}} operate on the web in July 2015 under the name Good <b>Judgment</b> Inc. Starting in September 2015, Good <b>Judgment</b> Inc has been running a public forecasting tournament at the Good <b>Judgment</b> Open site. Like the Good <b>Judgment</b> Project, Good <b>Judgment</b> Open has questions about geopolitical and financial events, although it also has questions about US politics, entertainment, and sports.|$|R
5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} written opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous <b>judgments</b> that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court <b>judgments</b> with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{marked a}} whole era and {{inspired}} conflicting <b>judgments</b> about his significant decisions. The {{fact that he}} was {{at the same time a}} vigorous statesman, general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment of his actions.|$|E
5|$|Self-empathy {{involves}} compassionately {{connecting with}} {{what is going on}} inside us. This may involve, without blame, noticing the thoughts and <b>judgments</b> we are having, noticing our feelings, and most critically, connecting to the needs that are affecting us.|$|E
50|$|Particular <b>judgment,</b> {{according}} to Christian eschatology, is the Divine <b>judgment</b> that a departed person undergoes immediately after death, in contradistinction {{to the general}} <b>judgment</b> (or Last <b>Judgment)</b> of all people {{at the end of}} the world.|$|R
5000|$|Vacated Judgment: a <b>judgment</b> of an {{appellate court}} whereby the <b>judgment</b> under review is set aside {{and a new}} trial is ordered. A vacated <b>judgment</b> is {{rendered}} where the original <b>judgment</b> failed to make an order {{in accordance with the}} law and a new trial is ordered to ensure a just outcome. The process of vacating a <b>judgment</b> is sometimes referred to as vacatur. The result of a vacated <b>judgment</b> is a trial de novo.|$|R
5000|$|General <b>judgment</b> is the Christian {{theological}} {{concept of}} a <b>judgment</b> of the dead by nation and as a whole. It is related closely to <b>Judgment</b> Day and often is just another phrase for the Last <b>Judgment</b> or Final Judgement, but is not necessarily part of any eschatology. It is generally contrasted with a particular <b>judgment</b> right after death.|$|R
5|$|The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the <b>judgments,</b> remanding the cases for entry of <b>judgments</b> {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel was}} {{regarded}} as a difficult work upon its release, and its experimental stylistic, structural, and thematic idiosyncrasies have often provoked emotional <b>judgments</b> from critics, ranging from fascination to repulsion.

50|$|In 1909 under Pennsylvania law, a <b>judgment</b> debtor {{is not a}} {{party to}} a {{garnishment}} proceeding to condemn a claim due the <b>judgment</b> debtor from a third person, nor is the <b>judgment</b> debtor bound by a <b>judgment</b> discharging the garnishee.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, the <b>judgment</b> debtor {{may be able}} {{to obtain}} a [...] "satisfaction and release of judgment" [...] {{document}} from the <b>judgment</b> creditor. This document affirms that the <b>judgment</b> debtor has fulfilled any obligations relating to the <b>judgment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A key {{aspect of}} actors {{decision}} making in generalized game theory {{is based on the}} concept of <b>judgment.</b> Several types of <b>judgment</b> could be relevant, for instance value <b>judgment,</b> factual <b>judgment,</b> and action <b>judgment.</b> In the case of action <b>judgment,</b> the actor seeks to take the course of action offered by {{the rules of the game}} which most closely fit the values held by the actor (where the values are a sub-rule complex of the game).|$|R
5|$|Accounting {{ethics is}} {{primarily}} a field of applied ethics and is part of business ethics and human ethics, the study of moral values and <b>judgments</b> as they apply to accountancy. It {{is an example of}} professional ethics. Accounting introduced by Luca Pacioli, and later expanded by government groups, professional organizations, and independent companies. Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training accountants and auditors.|$|E
5|$|Customs, {{traditions and}} moral {{principles}} based on Buddhism {{were used as}} the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. Samantapasadika, a 5th-century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief judicial officer was known as viniccayamacca and there were several judicial officers under him, known as vinicchayaka. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue <b>judgments.</b> The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all cases against {{members of the royal}} family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power with care and after consulting with his advisers. Udaya I recorded <b>judgments</b> that were regarded as important precedents in the royal library in order to maintain uniformity in judicial decisions.|$|E
5|$|During Straits Settlements times, cases {{pertaining}} to Singapore appeared in various privately produced and official series of law reports such as Kyshe's Reports (covering cases decided between 1808 and 1939), the Straits Law Journal (1839–1891) and the Straits Settlements Law Reports (1867–1942). From 1932 until 1992, Singapore cases appeared {{regularly in the}} Malayan Law Journal (MLJ), the only local series of law reports published continuously since the 1930s, except during World War II. The MLJ is still consulted for Singapore cases decided prior to full independence in 1965. Since 1992, <b>judgments</b> of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore {{have appeared in the}} Singapore Law Reports (SLR), which is published by the Singapore Academy of Law under an exclusive licence from the Supreme Court of Singapore. The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore's full independence in 1965 that appeared in the MLJ in special volumes of the SLR, and {{is currently working on a}} reissue of this body of case law. Cases published in the SLR as well as unreported <b>judgments</b> of the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts are available on-line from a fee-based service called , which is also managed by the Academy.|$|E
50|$|If the Defendant {{fails to}} reply within 14 days of service, the Claimant {{can apply for}} <b>Judgment</b> in Default, either by simply {{requesting}} the court's administrative staff enter <b>judgment</b> filing a request for <b>judgment</b> (which is sufficient for routine cases), or by making a formal application to the Procedural Judge. The <b>judgment</b> is known as <b>Judgment</b> in Default of Acknowledgment of Service.|$|R
40|$|The federal {{registration}} statute, codified at 28 U. S. C. § 1963, {{permits a}} <b>judgment</b> creditor to register {{his or her}} <b>judgment</b> in another state by simply filing {{a copy of the}} <b>judgment</b> with the clerk of the registering court. Registration is permitted when the <b>judgment</b> becomes final by appeal, when the time to appeal expires, or when the court that entered the <b>judgment</b> orders registration for good cause shown. The majority of courts have interpreted good cause as a showing that the <b>judgment</b> debtor lacks assets in the forum jurisdiction to fulfill the <b>judgment,</b> but possesses substantial assets in the registering jurisdiction. District courts are split, however, on whether there must be a pending appeal before registration can be ordered. Registration gives the <b>judgment</b> creditor power to create a lien on the <b>judgment</b> debtor’s property in another district. The effect of the registered <b>judgment</b> depends on a state’s laws regarding liens. Liens in some states may reach personal property, creating the potential for a registered <b>judgment</b> to have harsh effects on the debtor’s livelihood and placing restrictions on the alienability of real property. The posting of a supersedeas bond can stay the enforcement of a <b>judgment</b> and alleviate the need for registration. This Note argues that a <b>judgment</b> creditor should be permitted to register her <b>judgment</b> without waiting for the <b>judgment</b> debtor to file an appeal. However, a court should have discretion to consider whether permitting registration when the <b>judgment</b> debtor has not yet posted a supersedeas bond would cause irreparable harm to a good faith debtor, and if so, grant the debtor time to post a bond...|$|R
