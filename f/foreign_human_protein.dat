40|$|In mice, lactic {{dehydrogenase}} virus (LDV) {{acts as an}} immunologic adjuvant in that it {{enhances the}} capacity of infected animals to produce antibody to a <b>foreign</b> <b>protein</b> (<b>human</b> y-globulin) (1). However, attempts to demonstrate neutralizing antibody to the virus {{in the blood of}} mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs have been unsuccessful (1 - 4). Testing for antiviral antibody in mice was particularly difficult because of the lifelong viremia and the consequent presence of infectious virus in the sera of chronically infected animals (1). 1 The experiments reported herein show that (a) if measures are first taken to inactivate the infectious virus in the chronic sera, neutralizing antibody can be demonstrated, and (b) the infectious virus which persists in the circulation of chronically infected mice after the appearance of anti-LDV exists {{in the form of an}} infectious virus-antibody complex which is relatively resistant to further neutralization.

40|$|The <b>Human</b> <b>Protein</b> Interaction Database ([URL] was {{designed}} (1) to provide <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> interaction information pre-computed from existing structural and experimental data, (2) to predict potential interactions between proteins submitted by users and (3) {{to provide a}} depository for new <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> interaction data from users. Two types of interaction {{are available from the}} pre-computed data: (1) interactions at the protein superfamily level and (2) those transferred from the interactions of yeast proteins. Interactions at the superfamily level were obtained by locating known structural interactions of the PDB in the SCOP domains and identifying homologs of the domains in the <b>human</b> <b>proteins.</b> Interactions transferred from yeast proteins were obtained by identifying homologs of the yeast <b>proteins</b> in the <b>human</b> <b>proteins.</b> For each <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> in the database and each query submitted by users, the protein superfamilies and yeast proteins assigned to the protein are shown, along with their interacting partners.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{availability}} of suitable recombinant protein {{is still a}} major bottleneck in protein structure analysis. The Protein Structure Factory, part of the international structural genomics initiative, targets <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> for structure determination. It has implemented high throughput procedures for all steps from cloning to structure calculation. This article describes the selection of <b>human</b> target <b>proteins</b> for structure analysis, our high throughput cloning strategy, and the expression of <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> in Escherichia coli host cells. Results and Conclusion Protein expression and sequence data of 1414 E. coli expression clones representing 537 different proteins are presented. 139 <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> (18 %) could be expressed and purified in soluble form and with the expected size. All E. coli expression clones are publicly available to facilitate further functional characterisation of this set of <b>human</b> <b>proteins.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>protein</b> {{complexes}} play crucial {{roles in}} various biological processes as the functional module. However, the expression features of <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> complexes at the transcriptome cascade are poorly understood. Here, {{we used the}} RNA-Seq data from 16 disparate tissues and four types of human cancers to explore the characteristics and dynamics of <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> complexes. We observed that many individual components of <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> complexes can be generated by multiple distinct transcripts. Similar with yeast, the <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> complex constituents are inclined to co-express in diverse tissues. The dominant isoform of the genes involved in protein complexes tend to encode the complex constituents in each tissue. Our {{results indicate that the}} protein complex dynamics not only correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} complexes, but may also be related to the major isoform switching for complex subunits. Between any two cancers of breast, colon, lung and prostate, we found that only a few of the differentially expressed transcripts associated with complexes were identical, but 5 - 10 times more protein complexes involved in differentially expressed transcripts were common. Collectively, our study reveals novel properties and dynamics of <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> complexes at the transcriptome cascade in diverse normal tissues and different cancers...|$|R

40|$|Since ancient times, even in today’s modern world, {{infectious}} diseases cause {{lots of people}} to die. Infectious organisms, pathogens, cause diseases by physical interactions with <b>human</b> <b>proteins.</b> A thorough analysis of these interspecies interactions is required to provide insights about infection strategies of pathogens. Here we analyzed the most comprehensive available pathogen–human protein interaction data including 23, 435 interactions, targeting 5, 210 <b>human</b> <b>proteins.</b> The data {{were obtained from the}} newly developed pathogen–host interaction search tool, PHISTO. This is the first comprehensive attempt to get a comparison between bacterial and viral infections. We investigated <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> that are targeted by bacteria and viruses to provide an overview of common and special infection strategies used by these pathogen types. We observed that in the <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> interaction network the proteins targeted by pathogens have higher connectivity and betweenness centrality values than those proteins not interacting with pathogens. The preference of interacting with hub and bottleneck proteins is found to be a common infection strategy of all types of pathogens to manipulate essential mechanisms in human. Compared to bacteria, viruses tend to interact with <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> of much higher connectivity and centrality values in the human network. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> targeted by pathogens indicates crucial clues about the infection mechanisms of bacteria and viruses. As the main infection strategy, bacteria interact with <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> that function in immune response to disrupt human defense mechanisms. Indispensable viral strategy, on the other hand, is the manipulation of human cellular processes in order to use that transcriptional machinery for their own genetic material transcription. A novel observation about pathogen–human systems is that the <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> targeted by both pathogens are enriched in the regulation of metabolic processes...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} much progress in computational modelling for protein subcellular localization. However, the existing sequence-based predictive models demonstrate moderate or unsatisfactory performance, and the gene ontology (GO) based models {{may take the}} risk of performance overestimation for novel <b>proteins.</b> Furthermore, many <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> have multiple subcellular locations, which renders the computational modelling more complicated. Up to the present, there are far few researches specialized for predicting the subcellular localization of <b>human</b> <b>proteins</b> that may reside in multiple cellular compartments. In this paper, we propose a multi-label multi-kernel transfer learning model for <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> subcellular localization (MLMK-TLM). MLMK-TLM proposes a multi-label confusion matrix, formally formulates three multi-labelling performance measures and adapts one-against-all multi-class probabilistic outputs to multi-label learning scenario, based on which to further extends our published work GO-TLM (gene ontology based transfer learning model for protein subcellular localization) and MK-TLM (multi-kernel transfer learning based on Chou’s PseAAC formulation for protein submitochondria localization) for multiplex <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> subcellular localization. With the advantages of proper homolog knowledge transfer, comprehensive survey of model performance for novel protein and multi-labelling capability, MLMK-TLM will gain more practical applicability. The experiments on <b>human</b> <b>protein</b> benchmark dataset show that MLMK-TLM significantly outperforms the baseline model and demonstrates good multi-labelling ability for novel <b>human</b> <b>proteins.</b> Some findings (predictions) are validated by the latest Swiss-Prot database.
