A phase diagram of the pseudoternary system isopropyl myristate, caprylocaproyl macrogolglycerides, polyglycerol oleate and water was established. All compounds {{used in this study}} were pharmaceutically acceptable and biocompatible. The area in the phase diagram containing optically isotropic, monophasic systems was designated as the microemulsion region. Systems within this region were identified as water-in-oil (w/o), bicontinuous and oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsions with viscosity, conductivity, differential scanning calorimetry and self-diffusion NMR. The size distributions of the resulting nanoparticles prepared by interfacial polymerisation from selected microemulsions using <b>ethyl</b> (2) <b>cyanoacrylate</b> and butyl (2) cyanoacrylate were unimodal but template- and monomer-dependent and ranged from 160 to 400 nm. Entrapment and release of insulin were also studied. Entrapment ranged from 11. 5 to 20. 9 % and a near zero-order release was observed after an initial burst. Release of insulin was monitored for 6 h. Insulin-loaded nanoparticles were 320 - 350 nm in size. The microemulsion-structure was retained during the polymerisation process as determined by NMR. This study showed that these microemulsions with flexible formulation possibilities for the solubilisation of peptides and proteins depending on their microstructure could serve well as a platform for designing encapsulation processes for oral delivery of insulin.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of Histoacryl and other two homologue ethyl cyanoacrylates, Super Bonder and Ultrabond, on cultured fibroblasts, using the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The cyanoacrylates were applied to round glass coverslips, which were placed in contact with NIH 3 T 3 cells. After 0, 6, 12 and 24 h (short-term assay; viability) and 1, 3, 5 and 7 days (long-term assay; survival), the cells were examined under phase light microscopy and counted. The data were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test. In the short-term experiments, only the cultures of the Ultrabond group (GIV) presented significant smaller percentages of cell viability than the cultures of the other groups (GI: control; GII: Super Bonder; GIII: Histoacryl).

40|$|The {{effect of}} several {{formulation}} variables {{on some of}} the physico-chemical characteristics of poly (<b>ethyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate)</b> (PECA) nanocapsules prepared by the interfacial polymerisation of biocompatible water-in-oil microemulsions was investigated. In all cases, yields were high (> 90 %) and the polydispersity in size of nanocapsules was narrow. The molecular weight of the nanocapsules formed was influenced by the pH of the aqueous component of the microemulsion, increasing with increasing pH. The size of the nanocapsules formed (ranging from around 130 to 180 nm) was a function of the ratio of the mass of monomer used to the water weight fraction of the microemulsion, increasing as this ratio was increased. This is due to the formation of a thicker polymer wall resulting from the increased mass of monomer available per unit interfacial area as this ratio is increased. The rate of release of insulin from nanocapsules was also influenced by this ratio, in agreement with its effect on wall thickness. This study demonstrates that many pharmaceutically relevant physico-chemical properties of poly (alkyl cyanoacrylate) (PACA) nanocapsules prepared by interfacial polymerisation of microemulsions can readily be manipulated by changing either the pH of the aqueous component, the water weight fraction of the microemulsion or the mass of monomer used for polymerisation...|$|E

Thirty-four human maxillary central incisors were divided in two groups: Group 1 (n= 17), without flaring, and Group 2 (n= 17), with flaring with LA Axxess burs.

They are commonly used for light load structural and non structural applications. They are mainly used as particle boards, for fencing post, roofing tiles, for interiors of car and aircrafts among other usages. This material once cracked by impact forces cannot be repaired using traditional repair methods for engineering materials such as metals or other composites that can be repaired by welding or by patch repair methods respectively, thus a method of repair of rice husks fibre {{reinforced polypropylene}} composites by refilling the damaged volume by injection of various healing agents has been investigated.

The aim {{of this study was to}} prepare and characterize poly-(methyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate)</b> (PMECA) particles containing 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA). PMECA particles were prepared using the inverse emulsification polymerization technique. The effects of various formulationparameters such as dispersed phase volume, polymer to drug weight ratio, and surfactant concentration on loading efficiency and size of the prepared particles were investigated. The amount of drug was determined by UV spectrophotometery at 331 nm. Morphologicalcharacteristics of particles and particle size analysis were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Laser Light Scattering techniques, respectively. The results showed that there was no linear relationship between the dispersed phase volume (DPV) and loading efficiency of 5 -ASA in the range of 20 - 50 %. Increasing polymer/drug weight ratio in the range of 1 - 15, enhanced the loading efficiency from 11. 4 to 78. 2 % in a linear mode (r= 0. 987). Increasing the surfactant concentration in the range of 1 - 3 % did not increase the loading efficiency of the prepared particles, and increasing the concentration to 5 % even decreased the loading efficiency of particles. Laser light scattering and SEM evaluations showed that in all prepared formulations, particles were in a mixture of micro and nanospheres and micro and nanocapsules and 50 percent of particles had mean sizes in the range of 6. 4 - 10. 1 micrometer. Although our results showed significant differences in the mean particle size between some of the prepared formulations, this variation was not practically important.

This research involves the study of the hydrolytic and photolytic stabilities of two important new photoinitiator bis (2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO) and (2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) diphenyl-phosphine oxide (TPO). BAPO is a new member in the group of well-known α-cleavable photoinitiators among which monoacylphosphine oxide (MAPO) is most recognised. These α–cleavable photoinitiators are characterised by low volatility and high solubility in acrylate monomers and they are very widely applied as curing agents for white and pigmented coatings including furniture coatings. Novel analytical methods were developed in order to characterise these compounds and to understand their modes of action and breakdown. The stability of BAPO in different solvents, such as acetonitrile and a cyanoacrylate ester, was studied and the effect of storage of BAPO in light and dark conditions was evaluated. The effects of stabilisers (ferrocene, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and hydroquinone (HQ)), acids (methyl sulphonic acid (MSA) and boron trifluoride dihydrate (BF 3 ∙ 2 H 2 O)) and water present in the solvent were also investigated. These studies were monitored over time using LC-UV and CE-UV methods. Mass spectrometry was employed for the first time to investigate the pathways and photodegradation products for both of the photoinitiators BAPO and TPO. NMR spectroscopy and computational studies were used as complementary experimental and theoretical techniques respectively for the elucidation of the photochemistry of these products.

40|$|Metal objects have {{traditionally}} not been repaired or constructed by adhesives, but primarily by soldering, welding, and mechanical assemblies.

Bonding of historical metal objects with adhesives is here examined. A literature survey is done. Another goal with the work is to get {{an indication of the}} suitability of various adhesives by means of simple test methods. Two test objects (candle holders) of tin, were chosen as basis for the investigation. Six adhesives were selected for testing: Paraloid B- 72, (a thermoplastic acrylic copolymer), two different epoxies, (Araldite 2011 A + B and Bostik Epoxy Rapid) an <b>ethyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> product, (Loctite Super Glue Precision), Bostik contact, a contact adhesive based on polychloroprene rubber, Dana limstänger, (a hot melt adhesive consisting of an EVA copolymer). These adhesives were subjected to simple tests, a pH test, a so-called Oddy test and a simple tensile test with specimens of tin to investigate strength. In addition, a test for removability of the adhesive and a very simple contact test were carried out. pH tests showed that many of the adhesives are quite acidic when wet. After curing the pH of the epoxies are about pH 9 - 10. The others were more neutral after curing. Oddy test showed that all but Paraloid B- 72 affected lead slightly. ”Epoxy Rapid” affected silver and copper with a dark colour. The results of strength tests were somewhat difficult to interpret. The strength differed greatly between the adhesives. For example the specimens bonded by the hot-melt adhesive fell apart by themselves. The cyanoacrylate was so strong that in one sample the joint was not broken at all, instead the tin specimen broke. When the tests were done the two candlesticks were treated.

40|$|Chromatographic techniques, {{such as high}} {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ion chromatography (IC), have traditionally been employed {{in the analysis of}} a variety of analytes, such as inorganic anions, organic acids and pharmaceuticals. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods have recently been developed for their determination and can be ideal methods due to low sample and material consumption, reduced analysis times and increased separation efficiencies. A HPLC method was developed and successfully applied to the analysis of the photoinitiator, bis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) phenyl-phosphine oxide. A comparison of its stability in samples, which were both kept in the dark and exposed to the light, was performed using the optimised HPLC-UV method. From this it was determined that complete degradation of the Irgacure had occurred by 60 min. for the samples exposed to the light. The curing mechanism of the Irgacure was determined using HPLC-MS, and it was determined that the Irgacure undergoes a free radical cunhg reaction. There are a wide range of inorganic and acidic anions that may be present at different stages of the cyanoacrylate adhesive production process. A highly efficient CE separation was developed and applied to the simultaneous determination of inorganic and acidic anions, which are present in <b>ethyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> adhesive samples. The CE method developed was compared with IC, the method traditionally employed for their analysis. CE offers advantages over the IC method, namely reduced sample volumes and waste and also more rapid separation. From this investigation, CE was demonstrated to bc an effective method for their quantification, as it enabled the sensitive monitoring of the cyanoacrylate production process. A CE method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of the anthracyclines, daunombicin, doxorubicin and epirubicin. Ultra-violet (UV), electrochemical (EC) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection coupled to CE were investigated. Improved detection limits (150 - 1400 ng ml- 2 ̆ 7) were obtained with LIF detection, which were capable of monitoring the therapeutic levels (5 - 50, 000 ng ml- 2 ̆ 7) of anthracyclines. For the real time monitoring of anthracyclines in plasma, it was preferred that minimal sample pre-treatment was carried out. The feasibility of analysing plasma samples without sample pre-treatment was demonstrated. The degree of plasma protein binding of anthracyclines was determined using microdialysis, and the potential of this technique for the real time monitoring of plasma samples with on-line microdialysis coupled with CE was demonstrated. Microdialysis is suitable for coupling to CE as it generates sample volumes that are ideal for CE...|$|E
40|$|Strong {{underwater}} {{bonds between}} polycarbonate sheet {{and various other}} substrates were achieved using ethyl 2 -cyanoacrylate gel cured with an anionic photoinitiator (dibenzoylferrocene). The gel reacts quickly with water on contact and forms a protective polyethyl cyanoacrylate (PECA) skin. This provides a diffusion barrier that protects the inner monomer from further reaction with or polymerisation by water (hydroxide ions). The PECA skin is, however, permeable to water and the inner monomer slowly reacts as water diffuses through the PECA skin. The application procedure for this adhesive is critical because of the fast reaction with water. The adhesive should be applied at {{the centre of the}} bond area {{in such a way as}} to cover the smallest exposed surface area and that it should not be spread out over the entire surface area. The PECA skin will rupture when the substrates are pressed together, exposing unreacted monomer to the fresh new surface between the two substrates. The adhesive displaces water as it propagates towards the joint edges. In this way it is able to form a strong underwater bond. Without a photoinitiator, <b>ethyl</b> <b>cyanoacrylate</b> adhesives will form strong bonds to smooth underwater surfaces. The addition of a photoinitiator (dibenzoylferrocene), however, increases the rate at which the bond strength develops. Photo differential scanning calorimetric (photo-DSC) analysis was used to determine the optimum photoinitiator concentration. A concentration of between 0. 3 % (m/m) and 0. 1 % (m/m) was found to be optimum for adhesive films between 0. 5 and 1. 2 mm thick. Epoxy-based underwater adhesives have the disadvantage that the cure rate is very slow at low water temperatures. In contrast, the current system features a negative temperature dependence. Therefore, the curing rate is faster at lower water temperatures, making it highly suitable for very cold environmental conditions. The underwater bonding properties of cyanoacrylate adhesive were measured on a wide range of metallic and non-metallic materials. Bond strengths ranged from 1 to 5 MPa respectively. Bond strength (0. 2 mm film thickness) develops in a very short time (less than a minute) using a 5 mW/cm 2 blue LED light source as trigger for the photo initiator. Water temperatures between 1. 5 and 40 °C did not influence the ultimate bond strength achieved following 50 seconds of illumination. The reduction in bond strength due to the ethyl cyanoacrylates reacting with water was measured in artificial sea water and potable water. A 20 % reduction in bond strength was found after 10 minutes of water exposure. The underwater bond should therefore be made as soon as possible following exposure to water. Bond ageing studies on both steel and polycarbonate showed an initial decrease in bond strength (during the first 50 hours); thereafter the bond strength stabilises.
