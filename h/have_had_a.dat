5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E

The analysis also showed that the Act <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant impact on the probability of moving from unemployment to inactivity. In addition, it appeared that the Act <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> negative impact on the probability of job-to-job mobility.|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of the Big Four is generally seen to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> positive impact on tennis, making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention.
