5|$|Poltava {{was named}} for the victory at the 1709 Battle of Poltava when Peter the Great {{defeated}} King Charles XII of Sweden. Delayed by shortages of skilled workmen, design changes and late delivery of the main armament, the ship was laid down on 19 May 1892 at the Galernii Island shipyard and launched on 6 November 1894. Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899 and she was then briefly assigned to the Baltic Fleet. Together with her sister ship , Poltava had a radio installed in September 1900, the first ships in the Imperial Russian Navy to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> equipment. On 15 October the sisters set sail for Port Arthur and later had to unload much of their ammunition, coal and other stores to reduce their drafts enough {{to pass through the}} Suez Canal. Poltava arrived at Port Arthur on 12 April 1901, the day before her sister.|$|E
25|$|In July 1777 Cook {{was named}} one of the {{associate}} justices of the new State Supreme Court. Before he was allowed to take office, however, the appointment was blocked and David Finney, the cousin of Thomas McKean, was given the seat. At the height of the American Revolution, no one lukewarm to the cause would be able to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a position easily.|$|E
25|$|The 2015 {{regional}} election {{was the first}} to produce a majority for openly separatist parties. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insisted that Spain's constitution does not allow a region to secede. Spain's Basque Country unsuccessfully tried to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a move approved in Parliament in 2008. Catalan president Artur Mas instead scheduled an independence referendum for 2014, which was downgraded to being a more informal ballot after further intervention by the Constitutional Court. The dispute remains unresolved, as of March 2015.|$|E

25|$|The PPACA {{also made}} some changes to Medicare enrollee’s’ benefits. By 2020, it will close the {{so-called}} “donut hole” between Part D plans’ coverage limits and the catastrophic cap on out-of-pocket spending, reducing a Part D enrollee’s’ {{exposure to the}} cost of prescription drugs by an average of $2,000 a year. This lowered costs for about 5% of the people on Medicare. Limits were also placed on out-of-pocket costs for in-network care for public Part C health plan enrollees. Most of these plans had such a limit but ACA formalized the annual out of pocket spend limit. Beneficiaries on traditional Medicare do not <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a limit but can effectively arrange for one through private insurance.|$|E
25|$|The coffee {{companies}} of Houston formed the Greater Houston Coffee Association in fall 2000. The industry {{then tried to}} make Houston a major coffee shipping port. Coffee sold through futures contracts may only be shipped to a New York Board of Trade-certified port, and Texas's ad valorem tax on warehouse inventories {{made it impossible for}} Houston to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a certification. The tax was written into the Constitution of Texas, so the Greater Houston Coffee Association asked State Representative Joe E. Moreno and State Senator Mario Gallegos to present a constitutional amendment bill to exempt cocoa and coffee stored in Harris County warehouses from the tax. Voters approved the amendment in 2001. Since then Houston's role as a coffee port increased. After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, much of the traffic switched to Houston.|$|E
25|$|Buck {{was elected}} Governor of Delaware in 1928, {{defeating}} Democrat Charles M. Wharton. During this term the New York Stock Market crashed, signaling {{the beginning of}} the Great Depression. Fortunately, about the same time, Alfred I. du Pont had begun an effort to provide financial relief to those in the most need. Having failed to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> relief enacted by the Delaware General Assembly, on November 1, 1929 du Pont began mailing out personal checks of sixteen dollars to some eight hundred people. After spending some $350,000 of his own money, du Pont, appointed by Buck as Chairman of the Old Age Welfare Commission, persuaded the General Assembly to take over the program in late 1930. As the economic situation continued to worsen, Buck called the General Assembly into session in November 1932 and also persuaded them to pass a $2 million emergency relief measure.|$|E

500|$|Tolkien's {{correspondence}} and publisher's {{records show that}} he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable {{correspondence and}} fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: [...] "In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would <b>get</b> <b>such</b> scrupulous attention." ...|$|E

Johnson sought to authorize man's animalistic qualities during a state of disaster. Reilly contacted showrunner Glen Mazzara via cell phone, and wanted to add the scene to the episode's script. [...] "That was an incredible scene," [...] reflected Lincoln. [...] "We were so lucky to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> cracking actors.

500|$|Descending to {{the actual}} site made both Cameron and crew want [...] "to {{live up to that}} level of reality.... But there was another level of {{reaction}} coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn't just a story, it wasn't just a drama," [...] he said. [...] "It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one – maybe a documentarian." [...] Due to this, he felt [...] "a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it – to do that part of it right, too".|$|E
500|$|He {{earned his}} first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a {{friendly}} on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as I never thought I would <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E

500|$|Other critics {{offered a}} more {{positive}} impression of the piece. The Examiner celebrated Etty's having [...] "outdone his former self, {{and most of his}} contemporaries". A reviewer in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction said that [...] "few pictures have attracted or deserved more attention than this masterly production," [...] describing the figures as [...] "graceful and elegant". The Athenaeum thought it [...] "decidedly the most attractive picture in the whole Exhibition", noting that their review was delayed because in the opening week of the exhibition, [...] "the crowds which continually stood in front of it rendered it quite impossible to <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a view of it as would enable us to do it justice". Colburn's New Monthly Magazine considered it [...] "another instance of the rapid advances which this rising artist is making towards perfection." [...] The most effusive praise was offered in poetic form by [...] John Taylor, who in September 1828 imagined that if Milton and Nicolas Poussin were both alive to see the painting, Milton would view it with [...] "proud delight", while Poussin would suffer an [...] "envious thorn" [...] with the realization that Etty's abilities had surpassed his own.|$|E
500|$|Since its airing, [...] "The Injury" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from television critics. The scene featuring Dwight crashing his car received specific attention. IGN ranked {{the scene with}} Dwight getting {{in a car accident}} as its seventh-best moment in the first two seasons, noting that [...] "he fact that this show can <b>get</b> <b>such</b> inspired and unusual comedy from what is essentially a puke joke is a testament to how clever The Office is." [...] Rolling Stone named the same scene as the twentieth-funniest in The Offices first three seasons. TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea said that [...] "The Injury" [...] was [...] "another solid episode" [...] and that the [...] "show gets better with each and every week." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A–". Francis Rizzo III from DVD Talk wrote positively of the episode and praised the performance of Rainn Wilson as Dwight and wrote that [...] "nothing he does compares" [...] to his performance in [...] "The Injury". He called Wilson's performance as Dwight [...] "flat-out strange" [...] and noted that the episode, along with several others, [...] "wouldn't be nearly as entertaining" [...] without his character. Mindy Kaling later stated in an interview that it was her favorite episode of the show that she had written. She later expanded that the entry's [...] "full-on loopy" [...] quality made it humorous. She noted that the episode was [...] "so funny to me, because what happened to [...] is so stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} critical acclaim from critics. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode calling it [...] "A super-sweet {{end to a}} super-sweet series!" [...] Mrs. Northman of television website, TV Fanatic said [...] "Overall, [...] "Hello Goodbye" [...] did wrap up each of our beloved characters lives in a nice pretty bow", they added [...] "We wanted MORE!" [...] The day after the episode's U.S. airing, {{a reporter for the}} British newspaper Daily Mail praised Betty's transformation saying [...] "Gone were the thick-rimmed glasses and braces that once defined America Ferrera's character, and in its place a professional career woman signalling the completion of a four-year metamorphosis." [...] However, some critics felt the ending of the episode was not enough. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the episode a mixed review saying it was [...] "like one long hug with loved ones you don't want to leave," [...] but added the conclusion was [...] "unsatisfying". New York magazine said [...] "The cast of Ugly Betty damn well earned a happy ending — and that's exactly what creator Silvio Horta gave them last night on the series finale". However, they also found the conclusion to be unsatisfying saying [...] "The one-hour finale easily could have been longer, meaning some plotlines went unresolved." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post said [...] "Last night, Ugly Betty attempted to earn a place in TV history, but I fear their last episode will be quickly forgotten by the fans". Wieselman also added [...] "On a show that always favored high drama and cool camp, I was saddened to see everyone <b>get</b> <b>such</b> an expected ending". Wieselman, however, did enjoy the final scene calling it [...] "pitch-perfect".|$|E

500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would <b>get</b> <b>such</b> a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E
