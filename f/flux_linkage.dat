In contrast to a linear (or non-linear) resistor the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage including a memory of past voltages or currents. Other scientists had proposed dynamic memory resistors such as the memistor of Bernard Widrow, but Chua attempted to introduce mathematical generality.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Due to the {{features}} such as high efficiency and high power density Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) are becoming attractive. In high performance servo applications a rapid and accurate torque control is desired preferably {{without the use of}} motion state sensor. The use of PMSM combined with Direct Torque Control (DTC) scheme offers many opportunities to achieve this. This paper describes theoretical aspects of Direct Torque Control for PMSM drives. It is mathematically proven that the increase in electromagnetic torque in a PMSM is proportional to the increase in the angle between stator and rotor <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> and ther efore fast torque response can be obtained by adjusting the rotating speed of stator <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> as fast as possible. It is also shown that zero voltage vectors should not be used and stator <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> should be kept moving with respect to rotor <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> all the time...|$|R

In addition, the stability limits for the SynRM are studied using a suggested more accurate method. The saturation and cross-saturation effects on both direct (d) and quadrature (q) axis <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> are considered. A Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to obtain an accurate representation for the dq-axis <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> relations. In order to reduce the calculation time of the finite element analysis, a look-up table (LUT) for the dq-axis <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> is generated based on the FEM to be used for simulating the SynRM characteristics. It is found that the magnetic saturation in the adopted motor results in an enlarged region of stable operation of the SynRM by about 200 % compared with the unsaturated case. The results show the importance of including the saturation factors on the performance of the SynRM and its stability limits. Hence, the magnetic saturation effect will not only reflect on the stability of the motor but also on the whole drive system...|$|R

Williams argued that MRAM, phase change memory and RRAM were memristor technologies. Some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood and skin fit the definition. Others argued that the memory device under development by HP Labs {{and other forms of}} RRAM were not memristors but rather part of a broader class of variable resistance systems and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored HP's memristor patents.|$|E

500|$|Operation of {{the motors}} above rated {{nameplate}} speed (base speed) is possible, but {{is limited to}} conditions {{that do not require}} more power than the nameplate rating of the motor. This is sometimes called [...] "field weakening" [...] and, for ACmotors, means operating at less than rated V/Hz and above rated nameplate speed. Permanent magnet synchronous motors have quite limited field-weakening speed range due to the constant magnet <b>flux</b> <b>linkage.</b> Wound-rotor synchronous motors and induction motors have much wider speed range. For example, a 100HP, 460V, 60Hz, 1775RPM (4-pole) induction motor supplied with 460V, 75Hz (6.134V/Hz), would be limited to 60/75 = 80% torque at 125% speed (2218.75RPM) = 100% power. At higher speeds, the induction motor torque has to be limited further due to the lowering of the breakaway torque of the motor. Thus, rated power can be typically produced only up to 130-150% of the rated nameplate speed. Wound-rotor synchronous motors can be run at even higher speeds. In rolling mill drives, often 200-300% of the base speed is used. The mechanical strength of the rotor limits the maximum speed of the motor.|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{identification of}} <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> and inductances {{play a vital}} role in developing high-performance control methods for synchronous motors (SMs). In this thesis, the identification of flux maps of SMs at constant speed is done. The aim of this thesis is to achieve look-up tables of <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> as a function of machine currents. Simulation are performed on a 6. 7 -kW synchronous reluctance motor (SyRM). The current controlled SyRM, operating at constant speed, is fed with current sequences and the corresponding voltages are calculated. By using these calculated voltages, the motor <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> are identified and stored in the form of look-up tables. The iron losses and stator resistance variation are compensated during the identification process. Theses linkage look-up tables can be used as a benchmark for testing different saturation models of synchronous motors. From these look-up tables, the information about motor inductances can be obtained which can be used to fully exploit the motor torque and speed range by determining various control strategies such as the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) and maximum torque per volt (MTPV) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of the Finite Element Method (FEM) to the numerical solution of electromagnetic field and force distributions inside electric machinery and transformers requires a priori knowledge {{of the distribution of}} current density. This information is typically unavailable when these devices are voltage-fed through external drive circuitry, thus making the coupling of field and circuit equations nontrivial. Methods thus far described in the literature for the solution of coupled field-circuit problems are based on either an indirect coupling approach via a set of lumped circuit parameters, or on a direct coupling methodology wherein the field and circuit equations are solved simultaneously. Direct coupling of field and circuit equations can be accomplished either via winding currents or <b>flux</b> <b>linkages.</b> The flux-linkage-based approach leads to the so-called inverse finite element problem, wherein the field equations are reformulated to accept <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> as inputs with currents as outputs. Thus far, all methods proposed in the literature for solving the inverse problem do so by repeatedly solving the forward problem with different values of supply current(s), each such solution being iterative if material nonlinearities exist, thus resulting in a doubly-iterative loop. While both current-based and flux-linkage-based approaches possess superior convergence properties to indirect coupling methods, the current-based approach is more widely used {{due to the lack of}} efficient methods for solving the inverse finite element problem. ^ In this thesis, a new approach to the solution of the inverse finite element problem is set forth, which permits the direct evaluation of winding currents from <b>flux</b> <b>linkages,</b> iterating only at a single layer in the presence of nonlinear materials, thus offering a definite computational advantage over previous methods. This approach permits a natural coupling of field equations to circuit equations in state-space form with <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> as state variables. In addition to the elimination of an iterative loop, this method produces a state model with superior eigenstructure and improved convergence properties for nonlinear systems compared with existing current-based models. This methodology has been applied to the transient simulation of a switched-reluctance machine, and to a toroidal-core inductor operated under heavy saturation. Results obtained with this method have been validated numerically against commercial FE packages and are in excellent agreement with experimentally measured data. ...|$|R
40|$|Current source {{inverter}} (CSI) fed drives {{are employed}} in high power applications. The conventional CSI drives suffer from drawbacks such as harmonic resonance, unstable operation at low speed ranges, and torque pulsation. CSI fed drives with Direct Torque Control (DTC) has drawn {{the attention of the}} motor drives designers because its implementation requires no position sensor. Crucial to the success of this scheme is the estimation of electromagnetic torque and stator <b>flux</b> <b>linkages</b> using the measured stator voltages and currents. The estimation is dependent only on one machine parameter, stator resistance. The variation of the stator resistance, deteriorates the performance of the drive by introducing errors in the estimated <b>flux</b> <b>linkage’s</b> magnitude and its position and hence in the electromagnetic torque. Resistance change also skews the torque linearity thus making the motor drive a less than ideal torque amplifier. Parameter compensation using stator current phasor error has been proposed in literature. To obtain the stator current phasor error, the stator current reference is required which is not usually available in direct torque control schemes. An analytical derivation of the stator current phasor reference is derived systematically from the reference electromagnetic torque and <b>flux</b> <b>linkages.</b> The error between the stator current phasor reference and its measured value {{is a measure of the}} stator resistance variation from its set value. For the first time, it is demonstrated in this paper that DTC motor drive system can become unstable when the set value of the stator resistance in the controller is higher than the stator resistance in the machine. Hence parameter adaptation is not only important for torque linearity but also for stability of the system is shown in this paper. </p...|$|R
