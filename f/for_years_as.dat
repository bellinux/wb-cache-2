Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.|$|E
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Gates Lloyd {{described}} the variety rochesterensis in 1909, originally {{as a new}} species, Phallus rochesterensis. It was found in Kew, Australia. A form with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by Vincenzo de Cesati in 1879 as Hymenophallus roseus, and later called Dictyophora indusiata f.rosea by Yosio Kobayasi in 1965; it is synonymous with Phallus cinnabarinus. A taxon described in 1936 as Dictyophora lutea and variously known <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> Dictyophora indusiata f.lutea, D.indusiata f.aurantiaca, or Phallus indusiatus f.citrinus, was formally transferred to Phallus in 2008 as a distinct species, Phallus luteus.|$|E

5|$|Two fumbles deep in New England Patriots {{territory}} overcame {{a stubborn}} Buccaneer effort. The Patriots’ 260 rushing yards stood <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> the most allowed {{in a game}} by the Buccaneers, while their total of four pass completions remains the least by a Tampa Bay opponent. New England came from behind twice on Andy Johnson touchdown runs, and took the lead for good on Sam Hunt’s 58-yard return of a Steve Spurrier interception. Johnson’s first touchdown run was a 69-yarder that set a club record. Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan set an NFL record with four seconds left, rushing for his 12th touchdown of the year. The Buccaneers also set an NFL record, by becoming the only team to go winless in a 14-game season.|$|E
5|$|The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton is {{a luxury}} {{residential}} skyscraper in Center City in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At , the 48-story skyscraper is the twelfth-tallest building in Philadelphia, and the tallest residential tower in the city. The building was erected on the former site of One Meridian Plaza which was seriously damaged by a deadly fire in 1991. One Meridian Plaza was demolished in 1999 and the property was sold by E/R Partners to the Arden Group the next year. Development of the site by the Arden Group, which owns the adjacent Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, was delayed <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of a}} feud with rival developer Mariner Commercial Properties. Mariner owned the property 1441 Chestnut Street, which sits south of the Residences at The Ritz-Carlton site and intends to build its own residential tower. The feud began after Arden Group's lead partner Craig Spencer blocked approval of 1441 Chestnut Street because he felt the tower's design would be detrimental to the planned Residences at The Ritz-Carlton tower. This led to several years of dispute between the developers trying to block construction of each other's towers.|$|E

Limited food supply probably causes these migrations, although the exact causes are unknown. In Stratford, white squirrels, a local variant of the species, had been seen <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> of 2010 in different sections of town. Many had some light gray or reddish color and black eyes, indicating they were not albinos.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, it became the {{practice}} that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common-law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at common law (as opposed to equity)) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of equity, administered by the Lord Chancellor, in the courts of chancery. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>as</b> one court countermanded the other, {{even though it was}} established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.|$|E
