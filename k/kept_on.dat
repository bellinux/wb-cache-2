5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E

Later, on 20 June, she escorted transports off the Mariana Islands. Meanwhile, the carrier task force destroyed the Japanese carrier {{force at the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. Later, she escorted troop transports to the naval base of Eniwetok. On 9 July, she sailed to guard escort carriers until 12 July.

5|$|It was {{designed}} to be carried in a coat pocket or <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> a night-stand, and many have survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E
5|$|Normally, Palestinian {{municipalities}} with populations over 20,000 {{and that}} serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor.

Makki resigned in November 2013, but was <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> as interim mayor until April 2014. He was replaced by deputy mayor Nizar Hijazi.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese Air Force had {{purchased}} 12 Merlins under a €446 million contract, {{the first of}} which was delivered on 22 December 2004. The type has been used to conduct transport, search and rescue, and maritime surveillance missions, progressively replacing the Aérospatiale Puma previously tasked with these missions. The main role of Portuguese AW101s is to perform search and rescue missions within Portugal's maritime zone.

5|$|The {{peoples of}} eastern Asia use bears' body parts and {{secretions}} (notably their gallbladders and bile) {{as part of}} traditional Chinese medicine.

Trade in bear products is prohibited under CITES, but bear bile has been detected in shampoos, wine and herbal medicines sold in Canada, the United States and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> {{farms in the}} countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost.

Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E

5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their {{depictions of the}} dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate depictions of the dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above.|$|E

5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E
