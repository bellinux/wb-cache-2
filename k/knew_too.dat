5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who <b>Knew</b> <b>Too</b> Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|The siege was the {{inspiration}} for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's original 1934 version of The Man Who <b>Knew</b> <b>Too</b> Much; the whole story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street. The siege was also the fictional inspiration for two novels, The Siege of Sidney Street (1960) by F Oughton and A Death Out of Season (1973) by Emanuel Litvinoff.|$|E
5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who <b>Knew</b> <b>Too</b> Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E

5|$|The film {{opened in}} Italy in August 17, 1963 {{under the title}} I tre volti della paura which {{translates}} to The Three Faces of Fear. Black Sabbath grossed 103.5 million Italian lira on its initial theatrical release in Italy. American International Pictures released the English version of Black Sabbath in May 6, 1964 as a double bill with Bava's The Girl Who <b>Knew</b> <b>Too</b> Much then titled The Evil Eye. The English title of Black Sabbath was chosen to connect it with Bava's previous film Black Sunday. The film opened in France on 17 November 1965 under the title Les trois visages de la peur.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the revolt, Treblinka II {{continued}} to function and remained a top priority for the SS for another year. Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel <b>knew</b> <b>too</b> much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, {{there would have been}} little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.|$|E

Over the course of the year, he was removed from the CC's politburo and permanent presidium; from the deputy premiership; and from his officer's rank, being downgraded to a common soldier in the reserves. However, he suffered no further consequences, perhaps because he <b>knew</b> <b>too</b> much compromising information.|$|E

Ochoa plays now with an eight-stringed guitar (a self-designed hybrid of an acoustic six-string and the Cuban trés). Cuerteto Patría includes his brother Humberto Ochoa on guitar, son Eglis Ochoa on maracas, William Calderón on bass, Anibal Avila on claves and trumpet, and Roberto Torres on congas.|$|E

Citadel Records reissued {{the same material}} in 1997 and just like the previous release, this CD also contained a suite of music from Baron Blood, another Bava film which also received a new score by Baxter for its American version. Baxter's complete score to Black Sunday was released in 2011 by Kritzerland, whose CD contains the music in chronological order.|$|E
25|$|Flaccus was a {{perceptive}} politician, {{who looked}} for young and emergent men to support him. He had observed Cato's martial spirit and heard his eloquent tongue. He {{knew how much}} courage and persuasiveness were valued at Rome. He also knew that distinction achieved on the battlefield opened the way to achievements in the higher civil offices. Finally, Flaccus <b>knew</b> <b>too</b> that for a stranger like Cato, {{the only way to}} the magisterial honors was success in the Roman Forum. For that reason, he suggested to Cato that he shift his ambition to the fruitful field of Roman politics. The advice was keenly followed. Invited to the townhouse of Flaccus, and ratified by his support, Cato began to distinguish himself in the forum, and became a candidate for assuming a post in the magistracy.|$|E

25|$|Even when storyboards were made, {{scenes that}} were shot {{differed}} from them significantly. Krohn's extensive {{analysis of the}} production of Hitchcock classics like Notorious reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of The Man Who <b>Knew</b> <b>Too</b> Much, whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including Strangers on a Train and Topaz. While Hitchcock did do {{a great deal of}} preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.|$|E
25|$|The Allied march south finally recommenced on {{the morning}} of 23 September 1854, but there was as yet no {{definite}} plan of action; it was not until they had passed the River Katcha in sight of Sevastopol itself, that the Allied commanders discussed their options. The original plan had envisaged a move across the River Belbek before attacking the north side (the Severnaya) of Sevastopol harbour, defended by the Star Fort; but recent naval intelligence had revealed that the position was much stronger than had first been realised. John Burgoyne, the British Army's most experienced engineer, advocated an attack on Sevastopol from the south which, from all reports, was still an imperfectly entrenched position. This was a view shared by Saint-Arnaud who, having received his own intelligence of Russian reinforcements, had refused to agree to an attack from the north. Burgoyne's proposed 'flank march' required the Allies to go round the city to the east in order to attack the harbour from the south where the defences were weakest. Raglan was inclined to agree, arguing that he had always been disposed to such an operation; he <b>knew,</b> <b>too,</b> that the problem of re-supply would be eased with the seizing of the southern ports on the Chersonese Peninsula.|$|E
