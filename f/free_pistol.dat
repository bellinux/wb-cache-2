5000|$|In {{addition}} to {{a wide selection of}} trigger/firing modes, the USP has an ambidextrous magazine release lever that is shielded by the trigger guard from inadvertent actuation. The rear of the USP grip is stepped, and combines well with the tapered magazine to allow for rapid reloading. Finger recesses in the grip frame also aid in magazine removal. On 9 mm and [...]40 caliber USPs, magazines are constructed of polymer reinforced with stainless steel. Magazines on the USP [...]45 are all-metal. All USP magazines will drop <b>free</b> of the <b>pistol</b> frame when the magazine release is depressed. Also, the USP does not have a magazine lockout feature (also known as a magazine disconnector). Thus, it is possible to fire a chambered round even with the magazine removed. An extended slide release lever is positioned to allow easy operation without changing the grip of the shooting hand.|$|R
