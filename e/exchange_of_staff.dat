50|$|By 1944, {{it became}} {{standard}} practice to rotate SS members {{in and out}} of the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members who could no longer serve at the front.

This <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> in particular refutes the claim that the Waffen-SS had no connections with the SS guards of the concentration camps.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the two major {{components}} of the mental health delivery system in one state in an attempt to understand the relationship between the public mental hospitals and the community mental health centers. The study was designed to elicit information on (1) levels of cooperation between the community mental health centers and the public mental hospitals being studied and (2) factors which might be associated with those of levels of cooperation. ^ Data was obtained through survey questionnaires. The sample consisted of all thirteen public mental hospitals in Pennsylvania and twenty six community mental health centers. Information on levels of cooperation was obtained through questions on implementation of affiliation agreements, problem solving mechanisms, <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> training, patient information, and a number of joint committees. For the most part, affiliation agreements were implemented with little difficulty except for emergencies and unplanned discharges. Community mental health centers used more informal means to attempt to solve problems which arose over the formal agreements than did the public mental hospitals. Analysis of data on the exchange of patients and patient information indicates that coordination efforts have improved greatly when contrasted with a similar national study completed more than a decade earlier. Exchange of training, <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and joint committees between the two types of organizations continue to be areas of minimal interaction. ^ A total cooperation score for each public mental hospital and community mental health center was calculated. Information on factors which might influence cooperation scores was elicited and formed the basis for the testing of four hypotheses: (1) There is a positive relationship between cooperation and the organizational structure of the community mental health center. (2) There is a positive relationship between cooperation and geographical proximity. (3) There is a negative relationship between cooperation and competition. (4) There is a positive relationship between cooperation and complementary rather than similar goals. Hypotheses 1 and 4 were not supported. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were partially supported. ...|$|E

Approximately 200, 000 chicks per week are hatched in the unit. Regular bacteriological analysis is performed on eggshell, fluff, blood and faeces found in the hatchery. This has, in the past, revealed periodic salmonella infection; usually S typhimurium and S enteritidis. Routine bacteriological monitoring of chicken feed had proved negative.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} put forward that effective uptake {{of research in}} policy or practice must be built upon a foundation of active knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement during the research. However, what is often lacking is a systematic appreciation of the specific practices of knowledge exchange and their relative merits. The paper reports on a 2009 survey of 21 research projects within the UK Research Councils' Rural Economy and Land Use Programme regarding the involvement and perceived impact of over a thousand stakeholders in the research. The survey reveals that most stakeholders were involved as research subjects or as event participants. Large numbers were also engaged in the research process itself, including involvement in shaping the direction of research. Stakeholder engagement is perceived as bringing significant benefits {{to the process of}} knowledge production. A close relationship is found between mechanisms and approaches to knowledge exchange and the spread of benefits for researchers and stakeholders. Mutual benefits are gained from <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> or where stakeholders are members of research advisory groups. Different stakeholder sectors are also associated with different patterns of engagement, which lead to contrasting impact patterns. Any efforts to alter knowledge exchange processes and outcomes must overcome these differing engagement tendencies. Overall, much greater attention should be given to early processes of knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement within the lifetime of research projects. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades an {{increasing}} interest in academic cooperation has been evident in library and information science (LIS) education in Europe. This growing interest of internationalisation is mainly motivated by a strong desire to respond to the challenges of globalisation, to improve and strengthen the LIS curricula as well as teaching and research, and to explore ways and means by which international as well as intercontinental cooperative schemes can best be utilized. However, recently European LIS schools have started to participate more actively in joint activities enabling them to take a broader European approach to themes of mutual interest. Several cooperation models exist; for example, the European Association for Library and Information Education and Research (EUCLID) seeks to facilitate <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and students among members, to develop cooperation on research projects, to encourage support from stronger to weaker members, and to encourage mutual recognition of curricula or parts of curricula. The Nordic Research School in Library and Information Science (NORSLIS) intends to achieve synergic effects, effectiveness and efficiency in doctoral education and research of LIS by collecting the scattered scientific expertise, often in small-size research educational units, throughout the Nordic and Baltic countries. The BOBCATSSS network seeks to enhance cooperation and communication between LIS students and professionals at an international level. The authors of this paper will analyse the models of academic cooperation of LIS education in Europe in general and further examine these issues through the literature review and two case studies - the University of Parma and the Tallinn University...|$|E

Quality assurance is the responsibility of all staff involved in dental education and involves three levels: internal, institutional and external.

The goal of an effective assessment strategy should be that it provides the starting point for students to adopt a positive approach to effective and competent practice, reflective and lifelong learning. All assessment methods should be evidence based or based upon research. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications means that qualifications gained in one country (the home country) are recognized in another country (the host country). It empowers movement of skilled workers, which can help resolve skills shortages within participating countries.

40|$|Objective: In 2016, the Department of Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University (CMU) in Thailand and the Department of Occupational Therapy, College of Allied Medical Professions, Angeles University Foundation (AUF), Angeles City in Philippines {{created a}} Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the 2016 2021 {{academic}} year. As {{part of the}} MOU, initial visitations were conducted by both AUF and CMU OT faculty members last August 2016 and November 2016, respectively. Last February 2017, the international internship exchange program commenced where five AUF students with two accompanying faculty members visited CMU for two weeks. This paper aims to explore and analyze the MOU between two universities. Methods: Using the documentary form of the signed MOU between the universities, a contents analysis summary method was carried out. Results: The results revealed both universities agree to promote and develop this academic collaboration through the following means: a) <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> members and students; b) staff development; c) visiting professorship; d) executive of joint research projects; e) provision of lectures and seminars; and f) exchange of data, documents, research materials and academic information. Furthermore, the experience gained from these initial exchanges confirms the basic assertion that, on an international level, a major role of an academic collaboration is to support this program. It can be assumed from discussions held between staffs of the two institutions that in both Thailand and Philippines the BS Occupational Therapy curriculum evolves in response to reforms on campus and to changing trends within the higher education system. It was also determined that the modes of occupational therapy program in both countries may be prompted to change based on ongoing international exchange program and pace of cultural change within each country’s academia. Participants in the exchange discovered that there are strengths and weaknesses in both institutions, which allows for mutual learning from one another and adoption of good practices from the other exchange partner. Conclusion: Furthermore, this could create a global occupational therapy education network within and beyond CMU and AUF through a more structured exchanges of ideas, international activities, and research collaborations. status: accepte...|$|E
