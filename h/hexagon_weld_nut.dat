40|$|One of {{the fatigue}} design {{processes}} {{of a car}} body is stress-based sheet metal fatigue near <b>nuts</b> <b>welded</b> to thin sheets (<b>weld</b> <b>nuts).</b> In this investigation, the influence from nut geometry and dimension, as well as sheet material and thickness on sheet metal fatigue life was studied by fatigue experiments and numerical analyses. The fatigue experiments were force-controlled and carried out on a <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> specimen which, during the reversed loading that was applied, was designed to result in bending fatigue loading conditions of the sheet metal near the <b>weld</b> <b>nut.</b> The results from the experiments were Fa–N curves for various combinations of nut geometry and dimension, sheet material and thickness. Numerical analyses of the experiments were carried out by linear elastic finite element (FE) analyses, in order to transform the Fa–N curves to Wöhler (sig_a–N) curves. A simplified FE model of the <b>weld</b> <b>nut,</b> which is suitable for structural analysis of car body structures, was used. The structural stresses calculated using the FE model showed good agreement with the structural stresses calculated using an analytical model {{that is based on}} plate theory. The conclusion was that the simplified representation of the <b>weld</b> <b>nut,</b> and the mesh density used in the FE model, was appropriate for computation of the stress response near a <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> subjected to bending fatigue loading conditions. Finally, ra–N curves were computed for each <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> configuration using its experimental data set. A sig_a–N curve fitted to all data sets resulted in the relation sig_a = 9888 N^ 0. 312. The sig_a–N curves for the 21 <b>weld</b> <b>nut</b> configurations tested were gathered within a factor of three in fatigue life from this curve...|$|R

50|$|Form {{countersink}}ing, {{also known}} as dimpling, is a countersink that is formed into sheet metal to increase {{the strength of a}} structure as the countersinks of multiple pieces nest together. There are two processes for producing formed countersinks: coin dimpling and modified radius dimpling. Such dimples in fairly thick sheet can even be tapped to yield a threaded hardpoint on the sheet without the bother and expense of <b>welding</b> a <b>nut</b> to the sheet. This style of construction is often seen in modern household appliance design, because it allows the product to be lower-priced, and the quality can still be good as long as the sheet is thick enough.|$|R

Heat is concentrated at the projections, which permits the welding of heavier sections or the closer spacing of welds. The projections can also serve as a means of positioning the workpieces. Projection welding is often used to <b>weld</b> studs, <b>nuts,</b> and other screw machine parts to metal plate. It is also frequently used to join crossed wires and bars. This is another high-production process, and multiple projection welds can be arranged by suitable designing and jigging.|$|R

PT X {{has a lot of}} suppliers which is spread out to its products. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the supply chain to produce an efficient and effective production process. The aim of this research was to analyze the implementation of supply chain management of diesel muffler components. Supply chain performance was measured by the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model. Performance factors of supply chain consist of master schedule, quality, and price. The criteria and sub criteria for supplier selection include the master schedule (timeliness, capacity, and distance), quality (quality certification, practice, and the percentage of disability); price (bid, the potential savings, and costs of purchase). The weighting process produce five main suppliers of many major component suppliers for steel plate, pipe, and CKD components such as pipes, <b>welding</b> <b>nut,</b> and bracket and ring. Performance level was summarized from several metrics using gap analysis. In this case, the best in class performance level consists of delivery performance, fill rate, perfect order fulfillment, order fulfillment lead time, supply chain management cost, warranty cost of return processing cost, cash to cash cycle time, inventory days of supply, asset turns. Advantage performances level consist of supply chain response time, production flexibility, cost of goods sold, and value added productivity. Based on these metrics can be concluded that supply chain performance of PT X is in the best in class position and the company capable to maintain its further improvement and development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProjection <b>welding</b> of <b>nuts</b> to sheets is {{a widely}} {{utilized}} manufacturing process in the automotive industry. The process entails challenges due the necessity of joining different sheet thicknesses and nut sizes made from dissimilar materials, and {{due to the fact}} of experiencing large local deformations ranging from room temperature to above the melting point. Heating is facilitated by resistance heating and is highly influenced by the contact area resulting from the amount of deformation, which is also temperature dependent due to material softening and frictional conditions. Resort to new materials and applications require a new level of understanding of the process by combining finite element modelling and experimentation. This paper draws from the challenge of developing a three-dimensional computer program for electro-thermo-mechanical modeling of resistance welding and presents, as far as the authors are aware, the first ever three-dimensional simulation of the projection <b>welding</b> of square <b>nuts</b> to sheets by means of finite element analysis. Results are compared with experimental observations and measurements produced by the authors with the aim and objective of assessing the accuracy, reliability and validity of the theoretical and numerical developments. Numerical simulations support the evaluation of the experiments by providing detailed information on the process like the initial heating location and the following temperature development, and allowing to analyze the weldability of the square nut to the sheet under different operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe goods made of light-gage metal blocks {{providing}} for threaded attachment of different components have currently been {{widely used in}} mechanical engineering. The problem of ensuring strength of such connections consists in achieving a sufficient screwing length {{providing for}} three-five thread turns. Such methods as plate bending, <b>welding</b> of <b>nuts,</b> molding of plugs and deformation of metal blocks in closed press tools are applied to increase the screwing length. All these methods are insufficiently advanced and require application of additional equipment and consumables. This problem can be solved by forming tap holes by thermal drilling, when the material of the hole is not removed with chips but used for flanging, thus, ensuring sufficient screwing length. This article considers the mechanism of flanging formation by the rotating punch, interconnection between geometrical dimensions of flanging and process simulation by means of ANSYS software package...|$|R
