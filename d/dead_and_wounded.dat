5|$|As {{the night}} wore on, {{reinforcements}} arrived {{from a nearby}} British hill fort which had as yet been ignored by the Pashtun forces. At 4:15pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded.</b> The British had lost {{a large number of}} officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.|$|E
5|$|Four U.S. {{soldiers}} were killed within the first 20 minutes of the battle, another died later, and at least three others were wounded. Three times teams of soldiers from the main base ran through Taliban fire to resupply the observation post and carry back the <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{the number}} of <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> was {{relatively}} low compared {{to the extent of}} the fire, the cultural losses were huge. In addition to several private book collections, 35,000 texts including a large number of unique works were lost with the University of Copenhagen library, and at the observatory on top of Rundetårn, instruments and records made by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|With {{the second}} {{objective}} only partially captured, {{the remnants of}} the 9thBrigade, battered by artillery and machine gun fire, were forced to relinquish their position and retreat back to their own lines. All that remained on the Passchendaele ridge of the 9thBrigade was the <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded,</b> among whom was Clarence Jeffries, who was later counted among those with no known grave.|$|E
5|$|A {{new problem}} confronted the Confederates. The <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> of Grant's army {{lay in the}} heat of Mississippi summer, the odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wars}} between 1912 and 1949, the {{regiment}} suffered 35 officers <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 35 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 224 other ranks <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 647 <b>wounded,</b> {{as well as}} 41 missing in action.|$|R
50|$|The battle {{lasted only}} 15 minutes, but left 40 Spanish <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 16 <b>wounded</b> or captured, <b>and</b> 16 Argentine <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 22 <b>wounded.</b> The Argentine force also seized two cannons.|$|R

5|$|The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was {{exhausted}} and nearly as damaged {{at the end}} of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies observed an informal truce and collected their <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded.</b> Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison along the Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the turning point of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrate}} {{also made}} {{a survey of the}} spared parts of town from which it appears that 8,749former residents of the parts touched by fire had found new lodgings. It is estimated that as many as 15,000 had become homeless. This is about 20% of the population, which is estimated at 70,000. However the number of <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> is unknown. It is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources, but the number remains uncertain. It is probably low in comparison with the extent of the fire, though.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 20 May, {{the smell}} of rotting corpses in no man's land and the {{numerous}} wounded still located between the lines convinced the New Zealand and Australian Division staff to suggest an armistice. Soon an informal truce began under the flags of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Turkish stretcher-bearers headed into no man's land to collect the <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded.</b> Just after 19:00 {{it appeared that the}} Turks were massing troops for an attack while gathering their wounded, so the 9th Battalion opened fire on them. The Turks responded with their artillery bombarding the Australian trenches.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese {{losses from}} January 1 - April 30 {{and from the}} initial assault {{landings}} on May 5/6, were about 900 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 1,200 <b>wounded,</b> while the defenders suffered 800 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 1,000 <b>wounded.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was a Pyrrhic {{victory for}} Villars. French losses were high: 1,703 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 2,601 <b>wounded,</b> whereas the Imperial forces lost 3,000 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 742 <b>wounded.</b> Villars was also {{prevented}} from joining the Bavarians.|$|R
50|$|That evening 50 {{civilian}} volunteers {{arrived to}} reinforce Perry, but the Nez Perce were gone.

5|$|With {{the string}} of French victories, Lieutenant Field Marshal Klenau {{provided}} the only ray of hope in a campaign fraught with losses. At Ulm-Jungingen, Klenau had arranged his 25,000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, an over-confident General of Division Dupon de l'Étang attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000 men. The French lost 1,500 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded,</b> 900 captured, 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons captured, but possibly of greater significance, the Imperial Eagles and guidons of the 15th and 17th Dragoons were taken by the Austrians.|$|E
5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|French privateering {{attacks against}} American vessels, begun a year prior, caused the {{conflict}} between the United States and France. An American squadron under Commodore Thomas Truxtun had been sent to patrol the Caribbean waters between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. While Truxtun was sailing independently of his squadron in Constellation, his flagship, he met and engaged L'Insurgente. After chasing the French ship through a storm, Constellation forced L'Insurgente into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes before the French frigate surrendered. The French sustained heavy casualties in the action, while the numbers of American <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> were low.|$|E
25|$|After halting the American advance, the Spanish {{resumed their}} ongoing {{withdrawal}} towards Santiago's outer defenses {{according to their}} original plans.

5|$|The {{casualties}} {{of the battle}} were staggering: according to French General Staff Inspector P. Denniee, the Grande Armée lost approximately 28,000soldiers: 6,562 (including 269officers) were reported as dead, 21,450 as wounded. But according to French historian Aristid Martinien, at least 460 French officers (known by name) were killed in battle. In total, the Grande Armée lost 1,928officers <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded,</b> including 49generals. The list of slain included French Generals of Division Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt, Louis-Pierre Montbrun, Jean Victor Tharreau and Generals of Brigade Claude Antoine Compère, François Auguste Damas, Léonard Jean Aubry Huard de Saint-Aubin, Jean Pierre Lanabère, Charles Stanislas Marion, Louis Auguste Marchand Plauzonne, and Jean Louis Romeuf.|$|E
5|$|The now-isolated Rangers fended off {{numerous}} counter-attacks {{from the}} German 914th Grenadier Regiment. The {{men at the}} point became isolated and some were captured. By dawn on D+1, Rudder had only 90 men able to fight. Relief did not arrive until D+2, {{when members of the}} 743rd Tank Battalion and others arrived. By then, Rudder's men had run out of ammunition and were using captured German weapons. Several men were killed as a result, because the German weapons made a distinctive noise, and the men were mistaken for the enemy. By the end of the battle, the Rangers casualties were 135 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded,</b> while German casualties were 50 killed and 40 captured. An unknown number of French collaborators were executed.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} was resumed at 4.00 a.m. on 19 September after a {{night of}} heavy shelling. The operation involved the British 77th and 65th Brigades, the 2nd French Zouaves Regiment, along with the Serres and 14th Greek Divisions. Following five hours of intense fighting the Allies managed to overrun the town of Dojran, mount Kala Tepe and Teton Hill, with the Pip Ridge and mount Dub remaining in Bulgarian hands. In the aftermath of the engagement the Allied command found itself to be unable to make any further offensive operations on the Doiran sector as it no longer possessed an adequate reserve of manpower. Bulgaria lost a total of 518 dead, 998 wounded, and 1,210 captured. Greek casualties amounted to 503 killed, 2,286 injured and 615 missing,with the British suffering 3,871 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, B Company {{succeeded in}} holding their hastily {{constructed}} defensive positions {{throughout the night}} and until 05:00 on 8 October when the Chinese finally gave up. In order to preserve its remaining strength, the Chinese 191st Division was forced to pull back by , surrendering the control of Hill 217 without a fight. At first light more than 120 Chinese <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> lay around the Australian defences and {{in contrast to the}} savage fighting during the night, Chinese stretcher parties were allowed to come forward and collect their wounded under a flag of truce. The Australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 6 October, 9 Platoon C Company—under {{the command}} of Lieutenant Arthur Pembroke—moved forward to Sierra, using the heavy mist to conceal their movements. Under-strength and not expecting the feature to be occupied, instead the Australians found {{a large number of}} Chinese in well {{prepared}} defensive positions. Without fire support and outnumbered, the Australians immediately conducted a quick attack and, using grenades and bayonets, they inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese before forcing the survivors to withdraw. Although subjected to constant shelling, 9 Platoon continued to hold the knoll, repelling several counterattacks over the next 13 hours, cutting down each assault through the tree-line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine-gun fire, forcing the Chinese to withdraw leaving their <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> behind. One Australian was killed in the initial assault on Sierra, while a number were later wounded during the defence. Chinese casualties included 19 killed, 30 wounded and seven captured. Pembroke was later awarded the Military Cross.|$|E
5|$|At {{first light}} Air America {{helicopters}} hovered over Lima Site 85 {{to start the}} evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the U.S. technicians that help was coming. In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi. While U.S. fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight. Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead U.S. personnel on Lima Site 85, along {{with a number of}} wounded Hmong soldiers. By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14March when they withdrew from the area.|$|E
50|$|On October 22, the Golani Brigade and Sayeret Matkal commandos recaptured the outpost on Mount Hermon, after a hard-fought {{battle that}} {{involved}} hand-to-hand combat and Syrian sniper attacks. An unsuccessful attack two weeks prior had cost the Israelis 23 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 55 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> the Syrians 29 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 11 <b>wounded,</b> while this second attack cost Israel an additional 55 <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> 79 <b>wounded.</b> An {{unknown number of}} Syrians were also killed and some were taken prisoner. An IDF D9 bulldozer supported by infantry forced {{its way to the}} peak. An Israeli paratroop force, landing by helicopter took the corresponding Syrian Hermon outposts on the mountain, killing more than a dozen Syrians while losing one <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> four <b>wounded.</b> Seven Syrian MiGs and two Syrian helicopters carrying reinforcements were shot down as they attempted to intercede.|$|R
