50|$|The typical 500 volts {{between the}} {{backside}} of the last MCP and the anode cannot be fed into the preamplifier. Therefore, the inner or the outer conductor needs a DC-block, that is, a capacitor. Often it is chosen to only have 10-fold capacitance compared to the MCP-anode capacitance and is implemented as a plate capacitor. Rounded, electro-polished metal plates and the ultra high vacuum allow very high field strengths and high capacitance without a dielectric. The bias for the center conductor is applied via resistors hanging through the waveguide (see bias tee). If the <b>DC</b> <b>block</b> {{is used in the}} outer conductor, it is in parallel with the larger capacitor in the power supply. Assuming good screening, the only noise is due to current noise from the linear power regulator. Because the current is low in this application and space for large capacitors is available, and because the DC-block capacitor is fast, it is possible to have very low voltage noise, so that even weak MCP signals can be detected. Sometimes the preamplifier is on a potential (off ground) and gets its power through a low-power isolation transformer and outputs its signal optically.|$|E

In {{order to reduce}} thermal demands on a mechanical cooler, the mixer was designed to operate {{with a minimum of}} local oscillator (LO) power. That is, since the LO had to be cooled to reduce phase noise, it was desirable to minimize the LO drive. Novel embedding circuit strategy was responsible for nearly theoretical performance. The signal-matching circuit simultaneously provided a reactive termination to the image, sum, and first, second, and third LO harmonic frequencies. A conversion loss of 3. 2 dB at 77 K with an LO drive of + 1 dBm was measured. This loss included IF filter, <b>dc</b> <b>block,</b> and hybrid coupler losses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an active module using a ferroelectric coplanar waveguide (CPW) phase shifter for a Ku-band active phased array antenna (APAA). This active module performs roles such as amplifying an RF signal with low noise coming from an antenna and changing the phase of a received RF signal. This module is composed of a 3 -stage low-noise amplifier (LNA), a high-voltage <b>dc</b> <b>block</b> with an RF choke (RFC), and a ferroelectric phase shifter, whose structure is a CPW transmission line based on a (Ba, Sr) TiO 3 (BST) thin film. The ferroelectric BST thin film is deposited on an MgO substrate by using pulsed laser deposition. Both ends of the CPW are continuously tapered to obtain good impedance matching without degrading the phase tuning property of the ferroelectric CPW phase shifter. The active module using a ferroelectric CPW phase shifter attains a phase-controllable range of 360 ◦ while retaining a return loss of better than – 15 dB at Ku-band.

The trans- mitter, suited to non-standardized low data rate applications, is prototyped in a 130 nm RFCMOS technology and includes analog control signals for frequency and bandwidth tuning. Center fre- quency is linearly selected with voltage supply, 0. 5 V for the range 0 - 960 MHz and 1. 1 V supply for the higher 3. 1 - 5 GHz range.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the area of}} microfabrication technologies, has enabled the fabrication of many radio frequency/microwave components with better performance and lower cost than possible with semiconductor based fabrication technology. Many of these microfabricated RF components such as switches and phase shifters, popularly known as RF MEMS, are aimed at reducing the insertion loss and improving other performance parameters such as linearity. For these devices size miniaturization is not necessarily important, as in practical subsystems, these components are integrated with RF front-ends on a laminate. This thesis deals with concepts of a low cost passive phase shifter fabricated in-situ on a microwave laminate. The operation of this Mesoscale Electrostatically actuated Phase shifter on microwave Laminate (MEPL) {{is similar to that of}} a micromachined distributed MEMS transmission line (DMTL) phase shifter. In spite of advantages of low losses, wide bandwidth, low DC power consumption and high linearity over semiconductor/MMIC technology, microfabricated phase shifters are often not used in field because of issues related to fabrication reliability, packaging and integration. On the other hand, the proposed MEPL will have all the advantages of conventional MEMS phase shifters with additional benefit of lower cost. Furthermore, these are integrable to form a monolithic phased array. A MEPL phase shifter of 50 -bridges periodically distributed on the co-planar waveguide (CPW) transmission line is demonstrated in this thesis. MEMS air bridges are electrostatically actuated to vary the capacitance of the transmission line, which changes the phase velocity of the propagation RF signal, consequently phase at the output port. The realized MEPL is characterized for electromagnetic as well as electromechanical performance. The electromechanical characterization of this device is performed using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). The measured data showed good agreement with the analytical data [...] Major application of a phase shifter is in a phased array antenna system. MEPL is particularly suited for a monolithic phase array antenna. The proposed monolithic phased array antenna system fabrication approach utilizes extremely simple and economical modern printed circuit board technology to pattern the conventional microwave laminate and copper foil. A complete monolithic phased array antenna system is fabricated on a microwave laminate using an embedded phase shifter operating with electrostatic principles. Other components such as <b>DC</b> <b>block</b> and bias tee are integrated into the CPW-microstrip transitions to optimize the space and performance. Integrated phased array antenna is fabricated and tested to demonstrate the beam steering capability. Measured S 11 is better than - 15 dB at the operating frequency of 9. 8 GHz. The beam steering capability is shown as proof of concept by showing the beam scan angle of 10 deg with bias voltage of 125 V. The mesoscale phase shifter demonstrated in this thesis has several advantages compared to micromachined phase shifters. The proposed fabrication approach does not use metal deposition/patterning process, which removes the need of high cost clean room and sophisticated films deposition equipments. Secondly, as there are no thin films used, stiction is not expected on phase shifters fabricated with this approach. Since this approach uses thicker metal films, the power handling capability is expected to be significantly higher than micromachined phase shifters. Since conventional phased array antenna system components are fabricated on a microwave laminate, micro machined phase shifters realized on semiconductor substrates are required to be packaged separately before integrating with such phased array circuits. Packaging of the micro-machined RF-MEMS/MEMS devices is still a major issue and contributes to a substantial part of the total cost. Unlike micromachined phase shifters which are required to be packaged and then embedded in phased array applications, device presented in this thesis is packaged in-situ. Compared to similar monolithic phased array antenna reported on silicon substrate which are limited by wafer size, these arrays can be easily extended for larger arrays on microwave laminate as these are available in large size. To summarize, the proposed fabrication approach for phase shifters overcomes many limitations of micromachined components for microwave applications while retaining most of their advantages compared to other existing approaches based on ferrites or semiconductor technologies...|$|E
