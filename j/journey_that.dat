5|$|For {{his service}} to the Allies in World War I, White was created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order by George V {{on behalf of the}} British Empire. Following his relief from active {{military}} service in Europe, White embarked upon a global <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> consisted of Egypt, Palestine, India, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, Java, China, Japan, and the Philippines. He returned to the United States in June 1920 and soon thereafter resumed his law practice in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|From the lake, Cortés {{continued}} {{south along}} the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> took 12 days to cover , during which he lost {{more than two-thirds of}} his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} night of the voyage, the General stays at Facatativá with his entourage, which {{consists}} of José Palacios, five aides-de-camp, his clerks, and his dogs. Here, as throughout the <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> follows, the General's loss of prestige is evident; the downturn in his fortunes surprises even the General himself. His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish embassy he {{eventually}} collected at Norham had been delayed, {{and it was}} on the return <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> the Duke of Somerset with Lords Roos and Hungerford, Sir Richard Turnstall, and Sir Thomas Findern and the bulk of the Lancastrian army (approximately 5,000 men) ambushed Montagu at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April 1464. The assault failed, and left Sir Ralph Percy dead on the field.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated <b>journey,</b> <b>that</b> of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1909 Muller {{travelled}} through Asia, a <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> produced {{several books}} and articles after his return, including a two-part report of his travels (Azië gespiegeld; Asia mirrored). Muller also published a scientific source publication on Cambodia and the earliest Dutch presence in French Indochina. The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the Légion d'Honneur for the latter. The French colony Annam made Muller a knight in the Order of the Dragon for his contributions {{to the history of}} Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo {{had many}} {{friends who are}} now renowned either in their fields or for their {{historical}} significance. They included the mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book De divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella {{that appears to have}} been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's only {{subsequent}} {{fiction of}} any substance was his 1932 novella The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God, written {{during a visit}} to South Africa in 1932. The eponymous girl, intelligent, inquisitive, and converted to Christianity by insubstantial missionary teaching, sets out to find God, on a <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> after many adventures and encounters, leads her to a secular conclusion. The story, on publication, offended some Christians and was banned in Ireland by the Board of Censors.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Shaman King {{revolves}} around Yoh Asakura, a shaman, a medium between {{the worlds of}} {{the living and the}} dead. Yoh seeks to become the Shaman King, the one who is able to contact the Great Spirit, and will gain the ability to reshape the world in any way they wish, and for this purpose he must to win the Shaman Fight, a battle held once every 500 years between competing shamans. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh's fiancée, soon enters the scene and prescribes a brutal training regimen to prepare him for the tournament. Thus begins the plot that will lead Yoh on a <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> will lead him to befriend Ryu, Tao Ren, Horohoro, Faust VIII, Lyserg Diethel, and Joco McDonnell (known as Chocolove McDonnell).|$|E

5|$|Cortés {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} Aj Kan Ek', {{the king of the}} Itza, to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén. From the lake, Cortés continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Słowacki left Switzerland and {{embarked}} on a <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> started in Italy. In Rome he met and befriended Zygmunt Krasiński, the third of the Three Bards. Krasiński is also considered the first serious literary critic of Słowacki's work. Słowacki would dedicate several of his works, including Balladyna, to Krasiński. From Rome, Słowacki went to Naples and later, to Sorrento. In August he left for Greece (Corfu, Argos, Athens, Syros), Egypt (Alexandria, Cairo, El Arish) and the Middle East, including the Holy Land (Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Jericho, Nazareth) and neighboring territories (Damascus, Beirut). It was a journey Słowacki described in his epic poem Podróż do Ziemi Świętej z Neapolu ("Travel to the Holy Land from Naples"); his other works of that period inclucded the poem Ojciec zadżumionych (The Father of the Plague-stricken), Grób Agamemnon (Agamemnon's Grave), Rozmowa z piramidami (A talk with the pyramids), Anhelli and Listy poetyckie z Egiptu (Poetic Letters from Egypt). In June 1837 he returned to Italy, settling briefly in Florence, and moved back to Paris in December 1838.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{stage left}} Porto-Vecchio {{and ended in}} Bastia, with next two stages ending in Ajaccio and Calvi respectively. The race then moved to {{mainland}} France at Nice. Stages five to eight formed a four-stage <b>journey</b> <b>that</b> navigated westwards finishing at the Ax 3 Domaines ski resort in the Pyrenees. Stage nine took place between Saint-Girons to Bagnères-de-Bigorre, before a long transfer moved the race to the north-west of the country. Stage ten finished in {{the port city of}} Saint-Malo, with the next finishing at the Mont Saint-Michel island commune in Normandy. The following four stages, 11 to 15, crossed the center of the country back to the south-east finishing atop Mont Ventoux. The next five stages took place in and around the Alps, before a second long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{dropped the}} torch off in Bari at 12:30pm on 19 July. It was run north through several Italian cities before {{crossing}} the Simplon Pass into Brig, Switzerland on 23 July. From {{there it was}} run west until leaving the country at Perly-Certoux, and entering France at Saint-Julien-en-Genevois. The route then detours from the direct route to take in Luxembourg and into Belgium before re-entering France at Lille on 28 July, finally departing the country at Calais. HMS Bicester carried the torch across the English Channel to Dover, arriving at 8:25pm on 28 July. It travelled through several towns in the South East of England until it arrived at Wembley, where it arrived only thirty seconds late after the entire <b>journey.</b> <b>That</b> delay may have only been in the final few hundred yards of the relay down Olympic Way outside of Empire Stadium as {{the pressure of the}} crowds on the torch carrier and their escorts reduced the pace to walking speed. Special celebrations were held at each border crossing, and at Pierre de Coubertin's tomb in Lausanne, Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|The three escallop shells upon a fess {{were taken}} from the armorial {{bearings}} of the La Trobe family and signify the La Trobe name.
