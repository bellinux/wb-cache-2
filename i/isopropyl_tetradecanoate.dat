40|$|We {{analyzed}} the spontaneous volatile emission of different aerial {{parts of the}} caper (Capparis spinosa L.) by HS-SPME-GC/MS. We identified 178 different compounds of which, in different proportions based on the sample type, the main ones were (E) -β-ocimene, methyl benzoate, linalool, β-caryophyllene, α-guaiene, germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, germacrene B, (E) -nerolidol, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate,</b> and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone. The multivariate statistical analyses seem {{to point out that}} the parameter leading the emission patterns is the function of the analyzed sample; the flower samples showed differences in the emission profile between their fertile and sterile portions and between the other parts of the plant. The green parts emission profiles group together in a cluster and are different from those of seeds and fruits. We also hydrodistilled fully bloomed caper flowers, whose volatile oil showed significant differences in the composition from those of other parts of the plant reported...|$|E
40|$|Mosquitoes display biting {{preferences}} {{among different}} {{sites of the}} human body. In addition to height or convection currents, body odour {{may play a role}} in the selection of these biting sites. Previous studies have shown that skin emanations are important host-finding cues for mosquitoes. In this study, skin emanations were collected from armpits, hands and feet; the volatile profiles were analysed and tested for their attractiveness to the malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii. Skin emanations collected from armpits were less attractive to An. coluzzii compared to hands or/and feet. The difference may have been caused by deodorant residues, which were found in the armpit samples and not in those of hands and feet. In a subsequent experiment, volunteers were asked to avoid using skincare products for five days, and thereafter, no differences in attractiveness of the body parts to mosquitoes were found. The detected deodorant compound <b>isopropyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> inhibited mosquito landings in a repellent bioassay. It is concluded that the volatiles emanated from different body parts induced comparable levels of attraction in mosquitoes, and that skincare products may reduce a person' s attractiveness to mosquitoes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} with simultaneous {{flame ionisation}} and electroantennographic detection (GCEAD) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry analysis (GCMS) of abdominal extracts of adult male Dermestes haemorrhoidalis Kuster (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) revealed {{the presence of}} electrophysiologically and behaviourally active compounds to its conspecific males and females. Isopropyl dodecanoate (3), isopropyl (Z) - 9 -tetradecenoate (5), <b>isopropyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> (6), isopropyl (Z) - 9 -hexadecenoate (7) and isopropyl hexadecanoate (8) were detected in male abdominal extracts only. Analysis of collected male headspace volatiles revealed the presence of six EAD-active compounds (3), (5), (6) and isopropyl tridecanoate (4) plus two unidentified compounds (1) and (9). Synthetic compounds (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) showed EAD activity with antennae of both sexes in contrast to synthetic (8) which showed EAD activity with female antennae only. Male and female antennae of D. haemorrhoidalis reacted with high receptor potentials to isopropyl (Z) - 9 -dodecenoate (2), although this compound itself was detected in neither male nor female abdominal extracts or headspace volatiles. Petri dish bioassays indicated that male abdominal extracts and compounds (2), (3), (5) and (6) aroused and attracted conspecific male and female beetles significantly (...|$|E
40|$|Capparis spinosa L. is a {{perennial}} eremophyte shrub, widely distributed in Mediterranean Europe: in Italy {{it is commonly}} found as a ruderal species growing on and covering walls of the cities. Its highly developed root and xylem systems are the reason {{of its ability to}} survive in both cold and heat stressed environments, as they confer the plant the capability of using the groundwater resources (Yin et al., 2014) and the ability of growing on very dry spots, like walls and rocky coastal areas (Kulisic-Bilusic et al., 2010). We analysed the spontaneous volatile emission of different aerial parts of caper (Capparis spinosa L.) by means of HS-SPME-GC/MS. The samples included leaves, buds, sepals, seeds, fruits, pistils, stamens, petals and flowers; they were randomly collected from specimens growing as wild, ruderal plants on the medieval walls of Pisa (Italy). We identified 178 different compounds of which, in different proportion based on the type of sample, the main ones were (E) -β-ocimene, methyl benzoate, linalool, β-caryophyllene, α- guaiene, germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, germacrene B, (E) -nerolidol, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone. We carried the multivariate statistical analysis of the results, with both the HCA (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method. The analyses seem {{to point out that the}} parameter leading the emission patterns is the function of the studied sample: the flowers samples showed differences in the emission profile between their fertile and sterile portion, and between the other parts of the plant. The green parts emission profiles group them together in a cluster of their own and they are different from those of seeds and fruits. Furthermore, we hydrodistilled caper fully bloomed flowers and analysed its composition. Literature reports analyses of the essential oil of caper seeds (Ara et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2014), fruits (Afsharypuor et al., 1998; Yin et al., 2014), roots (Afsharypuor et al., 1998), leaves (Afsharypuor et al., 1998) and floral buds (Kulisic-Bilusic et al., 2010). The bloomed flowers essential oil volatile profile significantly differs from those of the essential oils obtained from other parts of Capparis spinosa reported in the literature: it is the only volatile oil rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (mainly (E) -nerolidol and (E) -nerolidol acetate) and oxygenated monoterpenes (mainly linalool) ...|$|E
40|$|Consequently, {{specific}} parts or the whole plant {{can be used}} for various treatments. The aim {{of this study was to}} extract, isolate and characterize the biologically active volatile and non-volatile compounds from Tagetes minuta and Rauvolfia caffra respectively. Tagetes minuta plant was considered for extraction of essential oils using hydrodistillation method. Cis-β-ocimene (38. 03 %), caryophyllene oxide (18. 04 %), alloocimene (25. 35 %), <b>isopropyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> (17. 02 %), cis-ocimene (38. 14 %) and trans-β-ocimene (37. 03 %) were the major components of essential oil analyzed from fresh stem, dried stem, fresh leaf, dried leaf, fresh flower and dried flower respectively. The volatile compounds were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography (GC). Essential oil of dried stem leaf and flower parts of T. minuta exhibit antioxidant activity as demonstrated by the DPPH and FRAP bioassays. Crude extracts were extracted from R. caffra stem bark using sequence of solvents namely n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol and ethanol. A white powder, a β-sitosterol (non-volatile compound) was isolated by column chromatography from ethyl acetate fractions of R. caffra stem bark and identified on various spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR and (1 D and 2 D) NMR. Melting point was also determined to be a sharp 129 - 130 ºC. DCM, EA, MetOH and EtOH fractions as well as β-Sitosterol (compound SM/ 01), showed antioxidant activity when tested on DPPH, FRAP, total phenolic and flavonoid bioassays. This antioxidant activity might be due to the presence of hydroxyl groups in the compound and crude fractions. On the other hand, T. minuta’s essential oil showed high antioxidant activity when evaluated on the DPPH and FRAP bioassays, which can be attributed to the presence of oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes known to act as free radical scavenging and reducing agents. The use of R. caffra stem bark extracts against hypertension and other diseases by traditional healers could be attributed to the presence of phytochemicals (polyphenols and flavonoids) with known health benefits. Thus, it is recommended that the plant should be exploited further using modern techniques involving separation and purification of compounds that {{can be used for}} drug formulation. This study supports the use of T. minuta and R. caffra as the potential natural antioxidant source to manage various diseases including hypertension...|$|E
