5|$|In the {{multiplayer}} mode, players {{compete in}} multiplayer matches online or over a {{local area network}} (LAN), <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> band together to complete cooperative missions, or split up into teams to battle against one another. At the time the game was released, online gameplay was free over the services offered by Parallax Online, which also kept track of players' statistics and rankings, while Voice chat is available, although reviewers advised it to be used only on broadband or LAN.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs. All of the {{characters}} have their own special items which are unique to them, like Mario and Luigi with Fireballs, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong with Giant Bananas, Bowser and Bowser Jr. with Bowser Shells, Yoshi and Birdo with Eggs, Peach and Daisy with Hearts, Wario and Waluigi with Bob-ombs, Koopa Troopa (who previously appeared in Super Mario Kart) and Paratroopa with Triple Shells, Toad and Toadette with Golden Mushrooms, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi with Chain Chomps. Petey Piranha and King Boo have the unique ability to use {{any of the other}} characters' special items excluding Luigi's Green Fireball and Birdo's Pink Egg. There are 21 karts in all and the character's weight class (light, middle, or heavy) determines the kart <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> ride as well as their speed, acceleration, and weight attributes.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|E
50|$|It is {{currently}} believed that C. exigua are not harmful to humans unless picked up alive, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> bite.|$|R
5000|$|Eggs {{are also}} used to provide moisture, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be {{substituted}} with 1/4 cup of water, milk, fruit juice or fruit puree per egg.|$|R
5000|$|FMians, AMians, UMAs, and Wizards from Megaman Starforce {{which also}} {{have the ability to}} merge with a human <b>in</b> <b>which</b> form <b>they</b> <b>can</b> go between energy and physical.|$|R
5|$|We earnestly {{recommend}} a longer recess from labour at noon, {{and a more}} early dismission from it in the evening, {{to all those who}} work in the cotton mills: but we deem this indulgence essential to the present health, and future capacity for labour, of those who are under the age of fourteen; for the active recreations of childhood and youth are necessary to the growth, vigour, and the right conformation of the human body. And we cannot excuse ourselves, on the present occasion, from suggesting to you, who are the guardians of the public weal, this further very important consideration, that the rising generation should not be debarred from all opportunities of instruction at the only season of life <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be properly improved.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend {{the length of the}} snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area {{more than twice as}} large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E
50|$|However, web {{applications}} and services {{can be implemented}} in almost any language, as long as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> return data to standards-based web browsers (possibly via intermediary programs) <b>in</b> formats <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use.|$|R
50|$|The Portuguese fishing {{industry}} is fairly large and diversified. Fishing vessels classified {{according to the}} area <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> operate, <b>can</b> be divided into local fishing vessels, coastal fishing vessels and long-distance fishing vessels.|$|R
60|$|This plan is {{proposed}} by the French in the way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> propose all their plans,--and in the only way <b>in</b> <b>which,</b> indeed, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> propose them, {{where there is no}} regular communication between his Majesty and their republic.|$|R
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclave}} {{also provided}} for the cardinals a space <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> hear mass, and <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> eat, sleep, and pass time attended by servants. From 1455, conclaves have been held in the Vatican; until the Great Schism, they were held in the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Since 1996, John Paul II's Apostolic Constitution Universi Dominici gregis requires the cardinals to be lodged in the Domus Sanctae Marthae during a papal conclave, but to continue {{to vote in the}} Sistine Chapel.|$|E
25|$|In a confrontational situation, {{although}} the ultimate intention {{may be to}} apply the handcuffs to the rear in the back-to-back position, officers are often forced to settle for the first position <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get both of the suspect's wrists.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{passengers}} are {{not satisfied with}} the answer of railway companies or passengers do not receive any answer in one month, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> seek the assistance of the Federal Public Service Mobility and Transport.|$|R
25|$|Credit unions {{must make}} enough surplus to cover expenses, otherwise, {{like any other}} business, <b>they</b> cannot continue, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> become {{insolvent}} and cease to exist; the effect on those with funds deposited varies between jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|There are (at least) three {{slightly}} different methods called Borel summation. <b>They</b> differ <b>in</b> <b>which</b> series <b>they</b> <b>can</b> sum, but are consistent, meaning that if {{two of the}} methods sum the same series they give the same answer.|$|R
25|$|Like horses, {{they have}} a simple stomach, but a large cecum, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> digest tough plant matter. In general, their {{intestines}} have a typical length of about 45 meters, which is unusually long for animals of their size.|$|E
25|$|MEMS {{resonators}} require cavities <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> move freely, and for frequency references {{these cavities}} must be evacuated. Early resonators were built {{on top of}} silicon wafers and tested in vacuum chambers, but individual resonator encapsulation was clearly needed.|$|E
25|$|Perreault, Jean M. 2004. The Thematic Catalogue of the Musical Works of Johann Pachelbel. Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Md. A {{complete}} {{index of}} Pachelbel's compositions, the manuscripts {{in which they}} survive, and publications <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be found today. Includes an exhaustive bibliography.|$|E
50|$|If a 4 is played, {{the next}} player in {{sequence}} must miss a go, {{unless they have}} a 4, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> add this to the original 4 and the next player in sequence miss 2 goes.|$|R
5000|$|The words {{diaphoresis}} and hidrosis {{both can}} mean either perspiration (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> sense <b>they</b> are synonymous with sweating) or excessive perspiration (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> sense <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be either synonymous with hyperhidrosis or differentiable from it only by clinical criteria involved in narrow specialist senses of the words).|$|R
50|$|A {{defeated}} player may {{be killed}} outright or simply ‘downed’ <b>in</b> <b>which</b> state <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be killed {{off with an}} execution move, revived by a teammate or choose to respawn. As with most aspects of the game each choice is a risk/reward scenario.|$|R
25|$|Related to {{metacognition}} {{and abstract}} thought, perspective-taking involves {{a more sophisticated}} theory of mind. Adolescents reach a stage of social perspective-taking <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> understand how the thoughts or actions of one person can influence those of another person, even if they personally are not involved.|$|E
25|$|While tetrachromatic {{vision is}} not {{exclusive}} to birds (insects, reptiles, and crustaceans are also sensitive to short wavelengths), some predators of UVS birds cannot see ultraviolet light. This {{raises the possibility}} that ultraviolet vision gives birds a channel <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> privately signal, thereby remaining inconspicuous to predators. However, recent evidence does not appear to support this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|A {{registered}} charity, as of 2007 the Trust had on {{its board}} individuals {{from a range}} of backgrounds, including both Christians and Pagans, archaeologists, a biologist, and a landscape architect. The Trust has engaged with the Pagan community from the start, and allows Pagan groups to book slots <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> perform ceremonies at the site.|$|E
50|$|If a 2 is played, {{the next}} player in {{sequence}} must pick up 2 cards {{unless they have}} a 2, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> add this to the original 2 and the next player in sequence must pick up 4 cards and so on.|$|R
50|$|Permanent punctal plugs {{are usually}} made of silicone. These are {{available}} in various sizes. For maximum effectiveness, the largest size that fits should be used. These are more effective than collagen plugs. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> sometimes become loose and fall out, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be replaced.|$|R
50|$|Discolysis is an {{alternative}} medicine <b>in</b> <b>which</b> practitioners believe <b>they</b> <b>can</b> treat a herniated disc by injection with an O2-O3 (ozone) solution.|$|R
25|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, {{the queen}} {{produces}} both male wasps and fertile female wasps. These progeny then mate with wasps from other colonies, and then the females find secure locations <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> reside during the winter. At this point, the colonies begin to deteriorate, and the females start their own colonies the following spring.|$|E
25|$|Like other hamsters, {{members of}} Phodopus have a round body shape, short tails and cheek pouches <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> store food. They {{all live in}} dry {{conditions}} with extreme temperatures. They inhabit the forests, steppes and semi-deserts of Mongolia, Siberia, China and Kazakhstan. Fossils of Phodopus {{have been found in}} Pleistocene and Pliocene deposits in Europe and Asia.|$|E
25|$|Travelers {{utilizing}} {{this scheme}} are only authorized to visit certain municipalities or provinces listed below, cannot leave the municipalities or provinces and must {{depart from the}} same port of entry, except for travelers who enters through ports of entry marked with # below, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also depart from any port of entry marked with # within the certain municipalities or provinces.|$|E
50|$|Knowing these {{fees and}} the {{circumstance}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are charged <b>can</b> help travellers avoid them and thus lowers {{the chances of}} severe debt-lag upon return.|$|R
50|$|Balises must be {{deployed}} in pairs {{so that the}} train can distinguish the direction of travel 1→2 from direction 2→1, unless they are linked to a previous balise group <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> contain only one balise. Extra balises can be installed if the volume of data is too great.|$|R
50|$|These {{types of}} home runs are {{characterized}} by the specific game situation <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> occur, and <b>can</b> theoretically occur on either an outside-the-park or inside-the-park home run.|$|R
