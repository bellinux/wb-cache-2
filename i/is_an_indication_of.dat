5|$|Ivan Sratsimir {{began to}} mint his own coinage {{to show his}} {{legitimacy}} {{as early as the}} 1360s. The abundance of coin treasure troves found in the territory of the Tsardom of Vidin <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the wealth and the well developed trade in the region {{during the second half of}} the 14th century. The Brașov Charter, the only surviving document made by Ivan Sratsimir, grants the merchants of the Transylvanian town of Brașov free access and the right to trade in his realm.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence in itself <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the peace that prevailed {{and that the}} Persians stopped being {{a threat to the}} Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as an indication of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E

25|$|This type of resin is {{typically}} used post-1930s and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> modern conservation work. Generally epoxy {{is very hard}} but unlike shellac is not brittle. The color of epoxy resin can range from yellow/green to a dark yellow/brown. Yellowing of the resin <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> aging. Warm to hot water or acetone {{are known to be}} the solvents of this adhesive.|$|E

25|$|In most countries, {{scholars}} {{agree that}} a coat of arms <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> nobility, but that (in times past) simply assuming a coat of arms did not ennoble the armiger. In certain countries (viz. the Italian states pre-1860), armorial heraldry was not strictly regulated, while titles of nobility were.|$|E

This includes the Voyager probes and the Galileo probes, among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} seed plants {{is a problem}} that still remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle Devonian. The {{description}} in 2004 of the proto-seed Runcaria heinzelinii in the Givetian of Belgium <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> that ancient origin of seed-plants. As with modern ferns, most land plants before this time reproduced by sending spores into the air, that would land and become whole new plants.|$|E
25|$|Jet quenching. In {{the heavy}} ion {{collision}} event, scattering {{with a high}} transverse pT {{can serve as a}} probe for the hot QCD matter, as it loses its energy while traveling through the medium. Experimentally, the quantity RAA (A is the mass number) being the quotient of observed jet yield in A+A collisions and Nbin×yield in p+p collisions shows a strong damping with increasing A, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the new properties of the hot QCD matter created.|$|E

25|$|It is {{agreed that}} the present church was built under Pope Sixtus III (432–440). The dedicatory {{inscription}} on the triumphal arch, Sixtus Episcopus plebi Dei, (Sixtus the bishop {{to the people of}} God) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> that Pope's role in the construction. As well as this church on the summit of the Esquiline Hill, Pope Sixtus III is said to have commissioned extensive building projects throughout the city, which were continued by his successor Pope Leo I, the Great.|$|E
25|$|Following the complaint, {{policeman}} {{arrived at}} Alliance Francaise and Jagriti in Bangalore, venues where Ms. Primlani was performing her shows, {{to take her}} into custody. Ms. Primlani claims that {{she was to be}} taken into custody by a male policeman, after dark, which is against the law. She says that a dozen policemen had arrived at the venue though they did not disrupt her show. She claims to be harassed by Thimmakka's lawyers with written threats, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> extortion.|$|E
25|$|Porter's easy {{acquiescence}} in {{the plans}} of the commanding general <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> his military maturity. In the view of his biographer Chester Hearn, {{the failure of the}} Steele's Bayou expedition at an earlier time in his career would likely have resulted in recriminations against his subordinates, superiors, and colleagues. As it happened, however, he recognized that all the others had given their best. He also saw that success was most likely to be achieved if the Army and Navy were to collaborate fully.|$|E

25|$|Total {{forest cover}} is about 56 {{percent of the}} total land area of the {{province}} while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 {{percent of the total}} land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, an {{exhibition}} {{opened at the}} Grand Palais in Paris that sought {{to shed light on}} the complexity of his masterpieces, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the richness of Hopper's oeuvre. It was divided chronologically into two main parts: the first section covered Hopper's formative years (1900–1924), comparing his work with that of his contemporaries and art he saw in Paris, which may have influenced him. The second section looked at the art of his mature years, from the first paintings emblematic of his personal style, such as House by the Railroad (1924), to his last works.|$|E
25|$|Various breeds {{are often}} mistaken for Vizslas, and Vizslas are often mistaken for other breeds. Redbone Coonhounds, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks {{are some of}} the most {{commonly}} confused breeds. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are larger than Vizslas. The nose of the Vizsla will always have a reddish color that blends with the coat color. Black, brown, light pink, or another color nose <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> another breed. A Vizsla's eye and nail color should also blend with the coat color.|$|E

25|$|The D {{has been}} a {{difficult}} money-making venture for some time. Originally constructed as a coal hauling route and when that business declined it proved difficult to turn a profit. It operates {{in some of the}} most rural areas of New York State, and very few industrial customers between Binghamton and Rouses Point remain. The railroad's current prognosis is arguably better than it has been in a long time. Along with the NYC connection, haulage agreements with other railroads are greatly increasing traffic. CP has been steadily using their high power AC traction locomotives on their road trains that run on the line, instead of their aging SD40-2 models. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the increasing importance of reliable service. There are also major signal and track projects underway to modernize the former D lines.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{routines}} in trampolining {{involve a}} build-up phase {{during which the}} gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum {{at the highest levels}} of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the average height of the jumps. In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. This is followed by a final routine which is optional. Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals, other add the final score to the preliminary results.|$|E
25|$|Research on the Lady's spine {{located a}} smooth lateral curve on the lumbar region (lower spine), with a {{convexity}} towards the left. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> lumbar scoliosis. The {{limits of the}} curve have been determined. The upper limit is between the twelfth thoracic vertebra and the first lumbar vertebra. The lower limit is between {{the fourth and fifth}} lumbar vertebrae. The center of the curve is between the second and third lumbar vertebrae. The scoliosis of the Lady is mild, with a Cobb angle of less than 20°. Researchers found no evidence of structural abnormalities in the vertebrae, no fractures, and no congenital anomalies (birth defects). The researchers suspect that the Lady may not have actually suffered from scoliosis while still alive. The curved spine of the mummy may be a postmortem condition, resulting from the position of the body during the mummification process.|$|E
