Oxygen lances and other custom made torches {{do not have a}} {{separate}} pressure control for the cutting oxygen, so the cutting oxygen pressure must be controlled using the oxygen regulator. The oxygen cutting pressure should match the cutting tip oxygen orifice. Consult the tip manufacturer's equipment data for the proper cutting oxygen pressures for the specific cutting tip.|$|E
25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, <b>flowrate</b> or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..|$|E

Parametric studies were made in which {{the center of the}} impeller was offset from the design center of the volute. The rig was also designed such that the impeller was allowed to synchronously orbit by a fixed amount about any center. The studies indicate that decreasing the tongue clearance decreases the head at low <b>flowrates</b> and increases the head at high <b>flowrates.</b> Also, decreasing the volute area {{in the first half of}} the volute and holding the tongue clearance the same, resulted in a decreased head for low <b>flowrates</b> but performance at high <b>flowrates</b> was not affected.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of horizontally opposed water jets {{in the absence}} and presence of an impinging air jet are investigated visually with high speed camera and quantitatively using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA). In the absence of air jet, {{the size of the}} circular water sheet variation with water jet Reynolds number and Weber number is in agreement with previous findings. The average droplet diameter is found to scale with Weber number and density ratio. Breakup phenomena are captured and described for various combinations of water and air <b>flowrates,</b> which indicate the significant role the air jet plays in promoting water jets atomization. Quantitative measurements using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) reveals the effects of water <b>flowrates</b> on the generated droplets’ size, velocity and root mean square (RMS) distributions and air mass <b>flowrates</b> on the droplets’ size distribution along the vertical axis. At various combinations of water <b>flowrates</b> and air mass <b>flowrates,</b> the droplet Sauter mean diameter (D 32) along the centerline of the spray, first decreases {{as a result of the}} breakup and then increases slight possibly due to the coalescence of droplets or preferential dispersion of different droplet sizes after break was complete. Larger water <b>flowrates</b> result in larger D 32, while larger air mass <b>flowrates</b> lead to smaller D 32 values. Variation of D 32 /d, where d is the pipe diameter, against the air liquid momentum ratio reveals that the horizontally opposed impinging jet arrangement leads to better atomization than the one with liquid jet impingement angle of 90 °...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of an FID to CF 4, C 2 F 6, c-CgF 12 and c-C 7 F 1 4 was determined {{over a wide}} range of operating conditions. The high carbon number fluorocarbons showed response values {{similar to those of the}} corresponding hydrocarbons and their relative response values were almost independent of operating conditions and near to unity, provided higher H 2 <b>flowrates</b> than usual for hydrocarbons were employed. For the light fluorocarbons, in addition to their much lower response, it was difficult to find suitable operating conditions for the FID due to the high dependence upon <b>flowrates,</b> etc. From the data it was also concluded that different mechanisms determining the height of the response were operating. For low carbon numbers and/or low H 2 <b>flowrates</b> the main governing factor seemed to be the flame temperature, whereas at high carbon numbers and/or high H 2 <b>flowrates,</b> the temperature became of little importance...|$|R

40|$|In {{wastewater}} management big variations in <b>flowrates,</b> caused by precipitation, leads to high peak loads forcing treatment facilities to maintain large over capacity. Wastewater management is a capital-intensive industry, meaning that new investments are costly and {{should therefore be}} avoided. But as peak load levels increase and stricter regulations are imposed it becomes increasingly hard to maintain sufficient reduction rates and facilities are likely to face new investments if the highest <b>flowrates</b> can’t be reduced. One way to reduce <b>flowrates</b> is to charge higher prices for the peak loads through an efficient tariff design. This thesis includes a literature review to define what constitutes an efficient tariff and then moves on to develop a model including marginal cost pricing and increasing block tariff design that examine how the marginal cost price is affected by constructing the tariff in different ways. The {{results show that the}} marginal price can be significantly increased by adapting this approach compared to a two part tariff with one fixed and one variable part which is commonly used by wastewater utilities today.

40|$|Most {{two-phase}} geothermal wells {{are located}} in fractured rocks and intersect a few major feedzones. It {{is well known that}} internal wellbore flow between feedzones often occurs during warmup or pressure recovery periods. The internal flow can occur even when the reservoir is initially in pressure equilibrium, because of the different phase composition that develops within the wellbore. Internal flow can cause large apparent pressure drawdowns and significantly affect pressure and temperature surveys as well as pressure buildup tests. This paper presents an analytic method for using static pressure surveys to calculate internal <b>flowrates</b> between two zones when the reservoir characteristics are known.

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of hydraulically actuated machine systems {{could be improved}} {{with the use of}} valves that have high bandwidth and high <b>flowrates</b> under low pressure drops. Although high <b>flowrates</b> can be achieved using very large spool strokes and/or diameters, the overall bandwidth of the valve will be reduced. Research has therefore been undertaken on a prototype valve design incorporating the Hörbiger plate principle, which utilizes multiple metering edges to allow high <b>flowrates</b> to be obtained at low pressure drops and small poppet displacements. The valve is directly activated using a piezoelectric actuator to achieve a fast dynamic response. Valve performance is assessed using a mathematical model that includes the piezoelectric actuator and power amplifier, the supply flow, fluid squeeze forces, end stop response, and valve mechanical components. The steady state relationship between valve flow, force and pressure drop, and the fluid inertance, were determined using computational fluid dynamics software. The simulation model has been validated using test data obtained from experimental tests undertaken on a prototype valve. Good agreement is obtained between the predicted and measured results and it is shown that the valve is capable of opening or closing fully in less than 1. 5 ms, and can pass a flow of 65 l/min at a pressure drop of 20 bar...|$|R
