5000|$|Quantities having {{dimension}} 1, habitually called dimensionless quantities, regularly {{occur in}} sciences, and are formally treated {{within the field}} of dimensional analysis. In the nineteenth century, French mathematician Joseph Fourier and Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell led significant developments in the modern concepts of dimension and unit. Later work by British physicists Osborne Reynolds and Lord Rayleigh contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics. Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, Edgar Buckingham proved the [...] theorem (independent of French mathematician Joseph Bertrand's previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities. Numerous other dimensionless numbers, mostly ratios, were coined in the early 1900s, particularly in the areas of fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Measuring ratios in the (derived) unit <b>dB</b> (<b>decibel)</b> finds widespread use nowadays. In the early 2000s, the International Committee for Weights and Measures discussed naming the unit of 1 as the 'uno', but the idea of just introducing a new SI-name for 1 was dropped.|$|E

The paper presents the scope of the measurement problem, describes the measurement process, examines how instrumentation technology development has been affected by NASP program evolution, discusses the national effort to define measurement requirements and assess status of NASP technology; and summarizes the measurement requirements.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>db</b> (<b>decibel)</b> is a {{relative}} unit of measurement commonly used in communications for providing a reference for input and output levels. This tutorial {{provides an overview of}} the use of the dB in communication systems. The tutorial also includes a table of standard dB terms. I. dB Tutorial The term dB or decibel is {{a relative}} unit of measurement used frequently in electronic communications to describe power gain or loss. Decibels are used to specify measured and calculated values in audio systems, microwave system gain calculations, satellite system link-budget analysis, antenna power gain, light-budget calculations and in many other communication system measurements. In each case the dB value is calculated with respect to a standard or specified reference. The dB value is calculated by taking the log of the ratio of the measured or calculated power (P 2) with respect to a reference power (P 1). This result is then multiplied by 10 to obtain the value in dB. The formula for calculating the dB value of two ratios is shown in equation 1. Equation 1 is commonly referred to as the power ratio form for dB...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{signals are}} often {{produced}} or {{received in the}} presence of noise, which is known to degrade the performance of a speech recognition system. In this paper, a perception- and PDE-based nonlinear transformation was developed to process spoken words in noisy environment. Our goal is to distinguish essential speech features and suppress noise so that the processed words are better recognized by a computer software. The nonlinear transformation was made on the spectrogram (short-term Fourier spectra) of speech signals, which reveals the signal energy distribution in time and frequency. The transformation reduces noise through time adaptation (reducing temporally slowly varying portions of spectra) and enhances spectral peaks (formants) by evolving a focusing quadratic fourth-order PDE. Short-term spectra of speech signals were initially divided into three (low, mid and high) frequency bands based on the critical bandwidth of human audition. An algorithm was developed to trace the upper and lower intensity envelopes of signal in each band. The difference between the upper and lower envelopes reflects the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of each band. Constant, low SNR signals in each band were adaptively decreased to reduce noise. Then evolution of the focusing PDE was used to enhance the spectral peaks, and further reduce noise interference. Numerical results on noisy spoken words indicated that the transformed spectral pattern of the spoken words was insensitive to noise for SNR ranging from 0 to 20 <b>dB</b> (<b>decibel).</b> The spectral distances between noisy words and original words decreased after the transformation. A numerical experiment was performed on 11 spoken words at SNR D 5 dB. A noisy word is recognized numerically by computing the closest L 2 spectral distance from the clean template. The experiment reached...|$|E

50|$|As in all EW, {{the issue}} with sonar is passive versus active. Modern active sonar is limited to 250 <b>dB</b> (<b>decibels),</b> but this level of noise can be {{detected}} at about ten times the range that is useful to the operator, acting as a beacon to any submarine in 100-190 km. So a target needs to be nearby and preferably {{on the same side}} of the layer to be detected by active sonar, which amounts to a favorable attack position for the submarine.|$|R

Knowing that the sound source level was fairly low (it was only 226 <b>dB</b> (<b>decibels)</b> @ 3 kHz which is low compared to an operational sonar) would have made the damage mechanism even more puzzling.|$|R
