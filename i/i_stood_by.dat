2500|$|Valenti later {{attacked}} {{film director}} Oliver Stone for the 1991 movie JFK. Valenti called the movie a [...] "monstrous charade" [...] and said, [...] "I owe where I am today to Lyndon Johnson. I {{could not live}} with myself if <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> mutely and let some filmmaker soil his memory." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{four days}} in Durban WS 4B sailed again. A few miles out Duchess of Atholl broke down and {{returned}} to port. One of the soldiers aboard her recalls [...] "We quickly transshipped to Andes which set off to catch up the convoy. A new ship, she strained every bolt and rivet. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> the rail at night and felt the power vibrating through her." [...] WS 4B spent Christmas 1940 at sea in the Indian Ocean and reached Suez on 28 December.|$|E

60|$|I {{go to all}} the Modern Exhibitions every season, and {{of course}} I revere the Royal Academy. <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> its forty Academical {{articles}} almost as firmly as <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> the thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. I am convinced that in neither case could there be, by any rightful possibility, one article more or less.|$|R
60|$|Silent <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> {{the fairy}} window, while {{these things were}} being told.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} gone, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> my study table, my arms folded {{and my eyes}} fixed upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|They sat {{and smoked}} and drank whisky and water, and <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> the fire also smoking {{and looking at}} them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> {{this man}}. <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> this man because {{he stands for}} things. Not only for things, he stands on things. Things like {{aircraft}} carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong message, {{that no matter what}} happens to America, she will always rebound - with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.|$|R
5000|$|No, but <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> the {{original}} version of the movie, and <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> the edited version. ... There has to be conflation of events. The most obvious problem any dramatist faces is that of sheer length. I had to collapse the events of {{eight and a half}} years into five hours. I don't know any other way to do it except collapse, conflate, and condense.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No threats, brother. As a {{daughter}} of Ribaumont and a mother of the Church will <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> you,' said the Abbess with dignity.|$|R
60|$|I protested, {{but she was}} firm. So <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> {{the gate}} and watched her slim young figure {{disappear}} in the gathering shadows.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> yon roofless tower, [...] Where the wa'flower scents the dewy air, [...] Where the howlet mourns in her ivy bower, [...] And {{tells the}} midnight moon her care.|$|E
60|$|It was stupefying. Well, {{although}} {{through his}} course <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> him, with {{something of the}} sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled child; and he always saved himself--just by miracle, apparently.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall not}} be withdrawn. Do not let that feeling actuate you. Answer me out of your heart, and however your heart may answer, {{remember}} this, that my friendship and support shall be the same. If you will take me for your husband, as your husband will <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> you. If you cannot,--then <b>I</b> will <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> you as your father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His only {{hopes are}} in Heaven," [...] said the Scot, [...] "but {{wherever}} {{you wish to}} go, <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> your side, a determined guide and guard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Stand by? ’Tis old fat Louis <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by,</b> an’ trouble enough it’ll be. We’re at the beginnin’ iv things, I’m tellin’ ye, {{the bare}} beginnin’ iv things.” ...|$|R
60|$|Dolly {{was carried}} off immediately, as I expected. The doctor and Worthington and Fitzhugh were already there, and waiting. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> Mr. Carvel's chair, {{receiving}} the guests, and presently came Mr. Swain and Patty.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> {{him to the}} end, and at last {{came the}} hour of parting. I grasped his hand in silence: silently he {{mastered}} a becoming emotion. And in silence he went from me unto the New Life.|$|E
60|$|In {{all this}} time I had said nothing to Captain Croker, nor he to me; but about seven o'clock, it being at that time pretty dark, {{he came to me}} where <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> the rail of the poop-deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I am {{nearer the}} truth," [...] she replied, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> the established, than you are, raging around like an iconoclastic South Sea Islander." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can share}} your fate," [...] the girl {{answered}} with generous enthusiasm. [...] "They shall not injure you while <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by,</b> if {{in my power}} to prevent it--besides--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite likely. So {{it is with}} me and Stephen Spike. I fancy a {{man whom}} other folk despise and condemn. Why <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> him is my own secret; but <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> him <b>I</b> do and will." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{he shook}} my hand off with an irritated movement, {{and for a long}} time <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> his side in silence. Maud was looking on, her face awed and frightened. What had {{happened}} to him we could not imagine.|$|E
6000|$|ROBERTS. [Reading the paper, {{and turning}} on the men. They shrink back from him, all but ROUS, who stands his ground. With deadly stillness.] Ye have gone back on me? <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> ye to the death; ye waited for that to throw me over! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> {{the fence}} for several minutes, {{my eyes and}} ears on the alert to catch {{anything}} worthy of notice. I judged it was near midnight, and hardly had I thought of the matter before the distant town bells tolled the hour of twelve.|$|E
6000|$|LUCREZIA. I {{know it was}} {{a horrible}} thing to do. But I couldn't help it. How could <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> and see you being carried off by that silly little creature? ...|$|R
60|$|But {{not again}} would <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> as <b>I</b> had <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> {{in the case}} of Falcone, and let her cruel, pietistic will be done. I had grown since then, and I had ripened more than I was aware. It {{remained}} for this moment to reveal to me the extent. Besides, the subtle influence of sex--all unconscious of it as I was--stirred me now to prove my new-found manhood.|$|R
5000|$|Roosh {{started his}} writing career with pickup tips, but says, [...] "My current work {{features}} it much less so I don’t presently identify as a 'PUA,' artist though <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> my older work." ...|$|R
60|$|He seized {{his soft}} round hat, {{and it was}} on this cold word we parted. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> the window, with hand {{stretched}} out to summon him back. But no word of comfort or hope came to my aid, and I watched him out of sight.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not return}} to my study. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> the side of the house, with my fists clenched and my eyes set. Then, suddenly, I ran to the garden wall; looking over it, I saw, far down the shaded village street, two gray figures walking away.|$|E
60|$|These {{were not}} {{exactly the kind of}} words best {{calculated}} to give a lad courage, and I realized that by listening to her many seconds I should become cowardly. Even as <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>by</b> her side my determination grew fainter; in five minutes more timorousness might overcome me.|$|E
60|$|But {{this was}} too much. I could not curse her in my own heart, and still less could <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> and hear another man do it; not though it was my oldest friend.|$|R
5000|$|On March 17, Khalaf {{submitted}} her resignation to Mr Guterres. [...] "I resigned {{because it}} is my duty not to conceal a clear crime, and <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>by</b> all the conclusions of the report," [...] she stated.|$|R
