5000|$|Lime re-absorbs {{the carbon}} dioxide (CO2) emitted by its {{calcination}} (firing), thus partially offsetting the large amount emitted during its manufacture. The more hydraulic a lime, the less CO2 is reabsorbed during set, for example, 50% of CO2 is reabsorbed by NHL 3.5 during the set, compared to 100% of CO2 being reabsorbed by pure calcium hydroxide (<b>fat</b> <b>lime</b> putty).|$|E
50|$|The {{wall was}} built during two periods, the 13th and the 14th century. It {{is made from}} locally quarried {{limestone}}, rubble limestone filling, <b>fat</b> <b>lime</b> mortar and clay mortar. The first wall was lower than at present and constructed as two thin walls of solid limestone with rubble used {{to fill the gap}} between them. When the height of the wall was increased during the second building phase, solid limestone stabilized with lime mortar was added on top of the first wall. Due to this, most of the weight of the wall is carried by the two thinner outer stone layers of the first wall. The joints of lime mortar in these layers were reinforced with stronger cement during 20th century restorations.|$|E

After a month at sea, the boat was befouled with algae and barnacles. It was taken to dry dock, scraped, and coated with chunam, a mixture of goat <b>fat</b> and <b>lime.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In the 14th century humorism book Health Regime, squab was {{regarded}} as a [...] "hot and moist" [...] food, whereas the meat of older pigeons {{was regarded}} as hot, dry, and [...] "barely edible". The Roman cookbook Apicius recommended sauces with a combined sweet and sour flavor to accompany roasted or braised squab. In 1607, a recipe book from a monastery [...] suggested cooking squab with pork <b>fat</b> or bitter <b>limes.</b> There is less information about traditional recipes incorporating squab or pigeon used by commoners, but there is evidence they were [...] "handed down from generation to generation". In the 15th century, the Italian friar Luca Pacioli wrote a book of [...] "culinary secrets" [...] which included [...] "How to Kill a Squab by Hitting with a Feather on the Head". In 18th century France, pigeons à la crapaudine ("toad-like squab") was a popular [...] "dish of skill" [...] for both rich and poor, in which the squab was arranged so that it looked like a frog, with the breast forming the frog's [...] "face". Religious dietary laws once prohibited meat on fast days, but allowed frog's meat, as it was a water dweller. Pigeons à la crapaudine played with that convention, and is still part of French traditional cuisine.|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} {{acidulation}} by lime (Citrus aurantifolia) and grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) juices to the heated cow’s milk (82 ºC) and called lime cheese and grapefruit cheese. The average yield of cheese made by lime juice (15 %) {{was lower than}} the average yield of cheese made by grapefruit juice (17 %). The {{results indicated that the}} protein content of lime cheese stored in the refrigerator was higher (19. 45 %) than the same cheese stored in whey at room temperature (16. 28 %). Similarly, the protein content of grapefruit cheese stored in the refrigerator was significantly (P= 0. 001) higher (17. 03 %) than that stored in whey at room temperature (13. 76 %). Protein content of lime cheese stored in whey at room temperature during storage periods decreased significantly (P< 0. 001) from (18. 13 %) at week one to (16. 30 %) at week four. However, it was increased from (19. 40 %) at week one to (24. 20 %) at week four for cheese stored in the refrigerator. Also, it decreased sharply in grapefruit cheese stored in whey at room temperature from (17. 07 %) at week one to (16. 30) at week four. The samples kept in refrigerator increased from (15. 97 %) at week one to (21. 67 %) at week four. <b>Fat</b> content of <b>lime</b> and grapefruit cheeses stored in the refrigerator were higher (15. 25 %) and (11. 67 %) than those of cheeses stored in whey at room temperature (14. 58 %) and (10. 50 %) respectively. Total solids content of lime cheese stored in whey at room temperature and the refrigerator increased significantly (P< 0. 001) from (45. 50 %) at week one to (66. 94 %) at week four and from (42. 77 %) at week one to (43. 79 %) at the fourth week respectively. However the TS decreased significantly in grapefruit cheese stored in whey at room temperature from (48. 01 %) at week one to (30. 67 %) at Please purchase PDFcamp Printer on [URL] to remove this watermark. ix week four, and to the contrary the TS increased significantly in cheese stored in the refrigerator from (55. 12 %) at week one to (73. 26 %) at week four. The ash content of lime and grapefruit cheeses stored in whey at room temperature was significantly higher (0. 64 %) than those stored in the refrigerator (0. 50 %). The ash content of grapefruit cheese stored in the refrigerator were significantly (P< 0. 001) higher (0. 74 %) than those of cheese stored in whey at room temperature (0. 42 %). Acidity of both lime and grapefruit cheeses stored in whey at room temperature and refrigerator increased significantly (P< 0. 001) with the increase of storage time. Statistical analysis of sensory evaluation showed that the use of lime and grapefruit juices as coagulants has altered the content of Gibna Bayda...|$|R
