40|$|Abstract. Tucker’s lemma {{states that}} if we triangulate the unit disc {{centered}} at the origin and color the vertices with { 1,− 1, 2,− 2 } in an antipodal way (if |z | = 1, then {{the sum of the}} colors of z and −z is zero), then there must be an edge for which the sum of the colors of its endpoints is zero. But <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to find such an edge? We show that if the triangulation is exponentially large and the coloring is determined by a deterministic Turing-machine, then this problem is PPAD-complete which implies that there is not too much hope for a polynomial algorithm. ...|$|E

In particular, solving a system of bilinear equations is reduced by a suitable transformation of its columns to solving a homogeneous system of bilinear equations. In turn, the latter has a nontrivial solution if and only if there exist two invertible matrices that, when applied to the tensor of the coe cients of the system, zero its rst column. Matlab code is given to manipulate three-dimensional tensors, including a procedure that nds one solution to a bilinear system often, but not always...|$|E

We {{introduce}} and study this simple curve embedding problem for piecewise linear curves and surfaces in R^ 2 and R^ 3, under Hausdorff distance, weak Frechet distance, and Frechet distance as similarity measures for curves. Surprisingly, while several variants of the problem turn out to have polynomial-time solutions, we show that in R^ 3 the simple curve embedding problem is NP-hard under Frechet distance even if S is a plane, as well as under weak Frechet distance if S is a terrain. Additionally, these results give insight into the difficulty of computing the Frechet distance between surfaces, and they imply that the partial Frechet distance between non-planar surfaces is NP-hard as well...|$|E

We demonstrate that this is surprisingly hard: the problem is non-recursive in general. On the practical side, we show how we can extract finite models M from a set S of clauses representing π, automatically, in two ways. We then define a model-checker testing M| = S, and show how we can instrument it to output a formally checkable proof, e. g., in Coq. This was implemented in the h 1 tool suite.

40|$|The undecidability of first-order logic {{implies that}} there is no computable bound on the length of {{shortest}} proofs of valid sentences of first-order logic.

The polynomial time tractability of this problem would imply the fixed-parameter tractability of the parameterized problem that, given a natu-ral number n in unary as input and a first-order sentence ϕ as parameter, asks whether ϕ has a proof of length ≤ n. As the underlying classical problem has been considered by Gödel we denote this problem by p-GÖDEL. We show that p-GÖDEL is not fixed-parameter tractable if DTIME(hO(1)) 6 = NTIME(hO(1)) for all time constructible and increasing functions h. Moreover we analyze the complexity of the con-struction problem associated with p-GÖDEL. 1...|$|E
