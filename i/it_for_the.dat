The Reverend Monsignor Giustino Meniconzi, who was the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Ferentino, Italy, blessed the statue of Christ and the American flag.|$|E
5|$|A {{public meeting}} in February 1919 {{established}} a consensus {{to create a}} monument and a fund {{for the families of}} wounded servicemen. The meeting agreed to commission Lutyens to design the monument. His design for a bridge over the River Roch was abandoned after a local dignitary purchased a plot of land adjacent to Rochdale Town Hall and donated <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> site of the memorial. Lutyens revised his design and Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, unveiled the memorial on 26 November 1922. It is a Grade I listed structure, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection.|$|E

5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between May and July 1996, it references the symbiote {{invasion in}} Planet of the Symbiotes as a symbiote-eating alien (the Xenophage) arrives {{on earth to}} hunt the remaining symbiotes. Scream returns as an anti-hero after the events of Venom: Separation Anxiety to protect the hosts of the invasion symbiotes. Venom is hunted by the police, who blame <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murders committed by the Xenophage. Venom and Scream kill the Xenophage and escape their police pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably. However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that approximate the real situation {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> diver.|$|E

5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chapel.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein {{produced}} a similar substance, {{but could not}} identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Boinik (German name of Bajmócska) village of Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia). Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in 1777, Kościuszko {{composed}} a polonaise and scored <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> harpsichord. Named for him, and with lyrics by Rajnold Suchodolski, it later became popular with Polish patriots during the November 1830 Uprising. Around that time, Kościuszko was assigned a black orderly, Agrippa Hull, whom he would treat as an equal and a friend.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use the tower to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of the parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in four movements: a duet for soprano (S) and alto (A), a recitative for tenor (T), a chorus, and {{a closing}} chorale.

5|$|Barbauld's {{pedagogy}} was fundamentally {{based on}} John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), {{the most influential}} pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain.
