Epoxiconazole works as an <b>eradicant</b> by encapsulating fungal haustoria, which are then cut off from their nutrient supply and therefore die. Some fungicide interactions can actually lead to increased production of mycotoxins, which are normal metabolic products of fungi, {{and it has been}} found that the inclusion of triazoles, like Epoxiconazole, in the fungicide mix may be necessary to limit mycotoxin levels.|$|E
50|$|Clearing or {{ploughing}} in the stubble, grass {{weeds and}} volunteer cereals reduce inoculum as does crop rotation (Diehl et al., 1982). Reis et al. (1998) indicate that <b>eradicant</b> fungicide {{treatment of the}} seed and crop rotation with non-host crops can control spot blotch. In the rice-wheat system of South Asia, little {{work has been done}} on the epidemiology of HLB and how management of the rotation crops affects spot blotch and tan spot, except as noted earlier. More quantitative information is required on the role of alternate rotations, soil and plant nutrition, inoculum sources and climate. In the rice-wheat system, {{there is a need for}} timely planting of wheat, better stand establishment and root development, increased soil organic matter, sufficient levels of macro- and micronutrients, and water and weed management (Hobbs et al., 1996; Hobbs and Giri, 1997). Crop rotation and organic manures will play a major role in HLB. This should favour beneficial soil organisms as well as better plant nutrition. In the rice-wheat system, it will be necessary to break the rotation with other crops to make it more sustainable, and this should help reduce disease problems in general. The use of oilseed rape in South Asia is common in mixture with wheat or in rotation. Since rape is known to have some fungitoxic effects upon decay, its effects on HLB would need research (Dubin and Duveiller, 2000). In the HLB complex, rotations would need to be sufficiently long to reduce the amount of soil inoculum. Cook and Veseth (1991) note that the kind of rotation crop may not be so important to root health as the length of time out of wheat. The rotation crops and length of rotation would have to be studied in relation to HLB.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments {{were carried}} out in a growth chamber and {{laboratory}} to quantify the curative and <b>eradicant</b> actions of fungicides in Asian soybean rust control. The experiments were conducted with the CD 214 RR cultivar, assessing the following fungicides, separately or in association, chlorothalonil, flutriafol, cyproconazole + trifloxystrobin, epoxiconazole + pyraclostrobin, cyproconazole + azoxystrobin, and cyproconazole + picoxystrobin. The fungicides were applied at four (curative) and nine days after inoculation (<b>eradicant</b> treatment). Treatments were evaluated according to the density of lesions and uredia/cm 2, and the <b>eradicant</b> treatment was assessed based on the necrosis of lesions/uredia and on uredospore viability.

The ethanol extracts of garlic and Landolphia owerrience gave a wider spectrum of activity against the pathogens {{compared to that of}} petroleum ether and water. The combination of the extracts of Garlic (Alium sativum) and Garcinia kola demonstrated a remarkable inhibition of the pathogens after 16 days in storage with 2 % rot, while that of Garlic and Landolphia owerrience roots exhibited little or no activity unlike the individual extracts.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Root rot {{caused by}} Armillariella mellea creates roughly {{circular}} disease centers of infected dead and dying {{trees in the}} younggrowth ponderosa pine forest under study. Research objectives concerning chemical control of the disease were: 1) to test the effectiveness of certain chemicals in protecting living pines adjacent to disease centers from lethal attack at the root collar by A. mellea and 2) to test the effectiveness of chemical fumigants in eradicating A. mellea from infected stubs and snags of trees killed by the fungus within disease centers. The literature revealed the inadequacy of trenching, ringbarking, uprooting, and biological control involving antagonistic organisms in effectively controlling Armillaria root rot in the field, but control with persistent and highly volatile fungicides used as protectants and <b>eradicants</b> holds promise for controlling this disease. Among seven root collar protectant chemicals tested in vitro, benomyl and copper sulfate were most toxic to A. mellea while captan, copper metal, and iron sulfate were less toxic. Vorlex and chloropicrin were also highly effective in reducing the growth of A. mellea at the concentration tested. One of three isolates of A. mellea tested was more tolerant of the chemicals than the other isolates. Protectants tested on potted seedlings showed that captan significantly promoted A. mellea infection. Chloropicrin, Vortex, and high dosages of copper sulfate were phytotoxic to the pine seedlings. Viability of A. mellea within alder inoculum segments and production of rhizomorphs was also differentially affected by the applied chemicals. The A. mellea isolate least inhibited in vitro was significantly more pathogenic than the other isolates. The seven chemicals under test as root collar protectants in the forest showed no conclusive differences because disease severity was too low for evaluation of the treatments at this time. In a preliminary study of A. mellea distribution in unfumigated stumps, the fungus was most frequently isolated from yellow stringy decay and from sound appearing wood primarily within the taproot (lower portion) of the stump. Mycelial fans beneath the bark also frequently yielded A. mellea. A. mellea was most frequently isolated from stumps lacking visible decay in fresh transverse cuts at the ground line. Isolation frequency declined as the proportion of decay to sound wood on these cuts increased. Recovery was poorest in stumps which were barely intact. Five chemical fumigants were tested on stumps of ponderosa pine killed by A. mellea in typical disease centers. Methyl bromide, Vorlex, chloropicrin, carbon disulfide, and Vapam apparently eradicated A. mellea from the treated stumps. The hyphomycete, Trichoderma, appeared to be unaffected by fumigants other than methyl bromide and Vorlex. With these, Trichoderma incidence increased over the controls. Differences in the effectiveness of fumigation method {{and the influence of}} stump size or degree of decay could not be determined at the concentrations of fumigants used. Because of the apparent effectiveness of all fumigants tested, reductions in amounts and simplification of application should reduce costs of both materials and treatment, bringing costs into the realm of economic feasibility, at least in special cases. Fumigation of A. mellea in the infected root residues of disease centers should eliminate disease development at the epidemic level by reducing the inoculum potential. This change should enable further pine production in reasonable safety...|$|R

40|$|Hylobius abietis, a {{major problem}} for {{seedling}} survival on forested land, develops under the bark of stumps of felled conifers. We investigated the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and fungi (EPF) applied to stumps to suppress adult emergence. We performed five field trials over three years and assessed results through destructive sampling and emergence trapping. We used two strategies in application: <b>eradicant,</b> where treatments were applied after weevil colonisation and prophylactic, where treatments were applied prior to colonisation. At prophylactic sites no treatment significantly reduced weevil emergence. At all <b>eradicant</b> sites, treatments including nematodes were more efficacious than those not. EPF-only treatment did not significantly reduce weevil emergence compared to controls, but there was a non-significant (P = 0. 058) numerical reduction at one site. The effects of EPF and EPN were additive. There was evidence of mortality due to native Beauveria sp. at all three <b>eradicant</b> sites, identified as Beauveria caledonica at one. A proportion of weevils at depths of up to 18 cm in the soil were infected by the applied Beauveria bassiana showing that applied fungi can reach this cryptic pest.

40|$|Strobilurins {{have made}} {{a major impact on}} wheat {{production}} in the UK since their introduction in 1997. In addition to broad-spectrum protectant fungicidal activity, there have been striking effects on green canopy retention and reports of direct physiological effects on crops. In experiments with very low incidence of disease, yields from azoxystrobin were greater than from epoxiconazole or kresoxim-methyl plus epoxiconazole. The mechanism responsible for the yield increases could not be found in differences in green canopy amount or retention. There was some evidence that strobilurin treatment resulted in higher chlorophyll concentration in older green leaves, which may allow increased light absorption. Because strobilurins have little, if any, <b>eradicant</b> activity, mixture with a triazole is needed to ensure optimum disease control and yield. Epoxiconazole was superior to other triazoles as the mixture partner for azoxystrobin, and mixtures of these two fungicides gave better disease control and greater yield increases than would be expected if the effects in mixture were additive...|$|E
