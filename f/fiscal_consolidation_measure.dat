30|$|The {{analysis}} is complemented {{with the use}} of “top-down” <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures.</b> To this purpose, data on the change in the primary structural balance, structural revenues, primary structural expenditures from the DG ECFIN AMECO database are used, which are available for all EU countries (starting from 1995 only for countries having acceded the EU in 2004 or afterwards). Budgetary data are purged from the impact of the cycle and, for years after 2002, from one-off measures. To address the issue of reverse causation, these top-down fiscal policy measures are instrumented using the variables normally used in the estimation of fiscal policy determinants by means of ”fiscal reaction functions” (e.g., Bohn, 1998; Gali and Perotti, 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{implementation}} of the areas of <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> is particularly relevant {{in terms of the}} accumulation of public deficits and public debt in such amounts when the country {{is on the verge of}} insolvency. A clear policy to gradually reduce these deficits is necessary, since the budget deficit and quasi-fiscal deficits are rapidly increasing. This will help stabilizing public debt dynamics, and facilitating resolving the shortterm financial difficulties. The situation in Ukraine is complicated by the very low possibility to eliminate external shocks, since foreign exchange reserves and financial reserves are at their minimum, and continuing to show a downward trend. In addition, Ukraine’s economy is experiencing a phase of economic recession. Although the causes of these adverse events are complex and represent a number of external and internal factors, a path to immediate macroeconomic stabilization in Ukraine is possible. Reducing these macroeconomic imbalances should be the main task for the government in the near future, because otherwise there is no real opportunity to achieve sustainable economic growth. Further structural fiscal reforms in public spending are mandatory to maintain macroeconomic stability and economic development in the medium term. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> will reduce external imbalances, help restoring fiscal space lost due to the crisis, and reduce the financial needs of the state budget and premium for sovereign risk. There are good reasons to conduct <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures</b> largely by public spending because their level relative to GDP is very high. Furthermore, it is the running costs should be subject to consolidation as capital expenditures have been already reduced to historically low levels. It is proven that there are very limited opportunities for consolidation on the basis of public revenues, because the concentration of GDP in the budget is already high and it would be difficult to raise revenues substantially without compromising growth prospects. The possibility of using the mechanisms <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> in Ukraine and foreign countries, their characteristics and problems are defined. In this respect, special attention is paid to the nature of <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> and its types, characteristics of <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures</b> in a crisis, measures of active debt policy as part of financial stability and opportunities to stabilize Ukraine’s public finances in the medium term...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 2008 {{many nations}} of the world enacted fiscal {{stimulus}} plans in response to the Great Recession. These nations used different combinations of government spending and tax cuts to boost their sagging economies. Most of these plans were based on the Keynesian theory that deficit spending by governments can replace some of the demand lost during a recession and prevent the waste of economic resources idled by a lack of demand. The International Monetary Fund recommended that countries implement fiscal stimulus measures equal to 2% of their GDP to help offset the global contraction.

40|$|The <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures</b> {{adopted in}} many euro area {{countries}} over 2010 - 13 reduced excessive domestic fiscal imbalances, but {{came at the}} cost of short-term output losses. This simultaneous tightening of fiscal policy raised concerns that such output losses might be exacerbated by negative spillovers from other countries. This paper presents some model-based simulations for the euro area with a view to gauge the cross-country impact of the fiscal measures adopted over 2010 - 13. The paper finds that the output effects of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> were heterogeneous across countries, reflecting the different amounts and composition of fiscal measures adopted. We find that the trade channel is able to generate sizeable cross-border fiscal spillovers in the euro area. However, once the analysis takes into account the remaining channels (e. g. monetary policy reaction, exchange rate, and risk premium) total spillovers are estimated to be relatively small. In general, when compared to the growth fallout of domestic fiscal policies, negative fiscal spillovers do not seem to have added much to the economic growth woes of vulnerable countries...|$|R

40|$|This policy brief reexamines {{the effects}} of the Greek {{austerity}} experiment on its economy via a counterfactual analysis. We combine the fiscal multipliers from the meta regression analysis in Gechert and Rannenberg (2014) to the <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures</b> that have been implemented in Greece between 2010 and 2014. We estimate that austerity explains almost the entire collapse of Greek GDP after 2009. This result suggests that-ceteris paribus-, in the absence of austerity, the Greek economy would have entered a prolonged period of stagnation, rather than a depression. At the same time the path of the government debt-to-GDP ratio would have been only somewhat higher. Furthermore, we estimate that if the consolidation would have been postponed until after the recovery of the Greek economy and implemented gradually, almost 80 percent of the cost in terms of lost output could have been avoided. Our results suggest that the period 2010 - 2014 was the wrong time to implement frontloaded spending cuts due to their strong multipliers in downturns. Implementing only the revenue components of the Greek <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> would have strongly reduced the output contraction as compared to the actual path of GDP, but would have been much more effective at lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio than the actual <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation.</b> A more cautious consolidation would thus have been in the interest of international creditors as well...|$|R
30|$|Fiscal {{conditions}} are controlled for {{by means of}} the general government budget balance. The expectation is that, in the case of reforms that are costly to the budget, a larger fiscal space favours reforms. The spread with respect to Germany of real interest rates on 10 year government bonds is also included as a measure of markets’ perception of fiscal conditions 11. The expected effect of such a variable is not obvious. On the one hand, higher spreads may signal stronger market pressure to reform. On the other hand, they are associated with a reduced fiscal space to accommodate reforms with an impact on the budget. Another hypothesis that has often been put to the test is that <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> makes reforms less likely by reducing the political capital available to governments. We have not pursued that route as, in our sample, <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures</b> raise a strong suspicion of endogeneity, especially with reform measures with an impact on the budget, but also with those reforms that were triggered during the crisis in a context of capital flight, revenue losses linked to deep recessions, and bond market tensions, where governments had to respond simultaneously by tightening the budget and stepping up the reform agenda.|$|R
40|$|Up {{until the}} first half of 1980 s, {{policy-makers}} in several countries, including those in the SEACEN region, were reluctant to reduce budget deficit for fear of adversely affecting economic growth through the Keynesian multiplier effect. As a result, high and rising budget deficit was prevalent as government spending was increasing at a much faster rate than government revenue, partly contributing to a sharp reduction in economic growth in some of the SEACEN countries in the mid- 1980 s. This study aims to assess the <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures</b> undertaken by the SEACEN countries in response to the above problem. Based on the consolidated central government data of the SEACEN countries (except for Myanmar and Nepal), the study finds that the measures had been generally successful in reducing fiscal deficits without adverse impact on economic growth. In fact, several countries experienced exceptionally high growth for an extended period after this adjustment. The study suggests that bold and decisive <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures</b> can create favourable environment for higher growth by instilling confidence in the private sector. This supports the view of Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) that sharp reduction in budget deficits may help improve the growth performance of an economy not only in the long run, but also during the <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> period. Where success is defined as improving fiscal balance as well as achieving sustainable debt to GDP ratio, the study finds that <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> through cutting expenditure is more likely to succeed than by raising revenue. In addition, the bulk of expenditure cutback should come from the current or operating expenditure side. This is also in line with the views of Alesina and Periotti (1996), and McDermott and Wescott (1996) in their studies on <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> and its macroeconomic consequences in the OECD countries. Further, the study finds that the budget cuts have also resulted in a substantially reduced capital expenditure, with adverse implications on the investment of necessary infrastructure. This implies that <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> through budget cuts alone may not be sustainable in the long run. Further effort would require measures to enhance government revenue. The generally low tax pressure ratio in the SEACEN region suggests that there is scope for increasing tax revenue by tax-reform measures such as broadening the tax base, expanding the tax net by identifying other possible sources, strengthening revenue- collection administration, and reducing concessions and rent-seeking, etc. It may not be advisable for a country to go against the global trend by increasing the tax rates. While the success of fiscal adjustments may to some extent depends on the timing of the implementation, our study finds that the dominating factor is in fact the size and composition of the adjustments. This implies that a country which is having a serious debt/ deficit problem may not need to wait until the difficult time is over before embarking on a <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> programme. While data on the consolidated central government operations forms a backbone of the fiscal position of a country, it would have been more accurate to include data on the extra-budgetary operations and other quasi-fiscal activities. It is hoped that as data and information on the latter become available, a follow-up study could be conducted to better assess the fiscal positions of the SEACEN countries. ...|$|R
30|$|During {{the last}} few years, a large sample of EU {{countries}} have undergone <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> processes of different degrees aimed at controlling increasing fiscal deficits stemming from the financial crisis. In this regard, measures focused on restraining the government wage bill played a significant role, with actions on this front being adopted by several countries. We showed in Table 1 that wage gaps in some countries were reduced during the crisis/consolidation period, while in others they remained constant or even increased. Thus, in this section, we study whether the change observed in the gap during this period {{can be linked to}} changes in the determinants of the previous section or to the effect of <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>measures.</b> Before we proceed, we raise a flag in interpreting the results of this section, given our small sample size, the turbulent times associated with the financial crisis, and the different set of austerity measures undertaken in each country, which may introduce additional noise in the estimations. Moreover, it must be stressed that the pay gap reflects wage developments in both the public and the private sector. Fiscal retrenchment may squeeze public sector wages, while, in parallel, labor market deregulation can reduce wages in the private sector. Hence, differences in labor market developments may result in heterogeneous cross-country outcomes in wage growth and eventually may bring about wage gap increases or decreases.|$|R
