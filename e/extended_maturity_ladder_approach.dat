40|$|This paper studies early {{refinancing}} {{activities in}} the corporate bond market and its impli-cations for debt maturity structure. In additional to interest rate reduction, speculative-grade firms constantly <b>extend</b> <b>maturity</b> through early refinancing. Moreover, they take advantage of accommodating credit market conditions to <b>extend</b> <b>maturity</b> on a large scale, leading to pro-cyclical debt maturity structure. The evidence is consistent with precautionary maturity management, where speculative-grade firms <b>extend</b> <b>maturity</b> in order to hedge against future refinancing risk, as the longer maturity reduces {{the possibility of being}} forced to refinancing at high yield rates. In contrast, investment-grade firms do not appear to manage their maturity similarly, as they are less exposed to refinancing risk...|$|R

40|$|This article posits two {{approaches}} to blues tonal space: the networked <b>approach</b> and the <b>laddered</b> <b>approach.</b> The first is underpinned by the cyclical potential of equal temperament and is characterised by descending chromatic motions. The second is underpinned by the harmonic series and is characterised by microtonal shaping of pitch content {{within the framework}} of a ladder that approximates an equally-tempered major minor-seventh chord. 	Having explained the detail of these approaches to tonal space with reference to an early blues recording of Alberta Hunter and Fats Waller, the article goes on to examine Muddy Waters’ use of the <b>laddered</b> <b>approach</b> to tonal space, but also develops novel ways of referencing the networked approach and of finding synergies between networked and <b>laddered</b> <b>approaches.</b> Analysis of key songs from Waters’ repertoire offers insight into the interchange between networked and laddered tonal space in blues music. This interchange holds the major minor-seventh chord to be structurally significant due to the weight afforded by the sonority of the minor third and the affinity between microtonal and semitonal melodic motions...|$|R

40|$|Both borrowers and {{creditors}} {{often have}} an implicit option to <b>extend</b> debt <b>maturity</b> as the debtor approaches financial distress. This implicit "extension option" {{is associated with}} the possibility for debtors and creditors to renegotiate the debt contract in the hope that <b>extending</b> debt <b>maturity</b> may allow the debtor to overcome temporary liquidity problems. This paper analyses and evaluates such "extension" option in a time independent setting with constant nominal capital structure and in a time dependent setting with not constant nominal capital structure. The "extension option" is shown to significantly increase the value of equity and has a non-negligible impact on debt credit spreads. The "extension option" can also increase the short-term credit spreads of outstanding debt and, in this respect, it ameliorates the shortcoming typical of structural models of credit risk, i. e. the under-prediction of short term credit spreads. The value of the extension option is very sensitive to different possible exercise policies. Four such policies are illustrated, encompassing cases in which the debtor extorts concessions (to <b>extend</b> debt <b>maturity)</b> from creditors and cases in which creditors make self interested concessions (to <b>extend</b> debt <b>maturity).</b> In general, when default is triggered by the "worthless equity" condition, the value of the extension option is much higher than when default is triggered by a liquidity shortage. The option to renegotiate debt maturity is of interest because <b>extending</b> debt <b>maturity</b> can decrease debt value even without cutting promised coupon payment, i. e. without giving up part of the tax shield associated with coupon payments.

40|$|Previous {{research}} in organisational sociology {{has focused on}} how organisational forms are evolved, transformed and sustained. This paper continues in this line of enquiry and tests the role of IT in organisational transformation. The transformation of an organisation can be gauged by observing key organisational attributes {{that are likely to}} feature in transformed (new) organisations. Following a review of previous literature, three major factors, that is, business strategy, IT strategy, IT strategic alignment were hypothesised to influence the dimensions of new organisational forms (NOFs). To test this model, data were collected from a survey of 312 Australian businesses. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the research hypotheses. Results from this study uncovered that the level of strategic alignment was significantly associated with the attributes of NOFs. This implies that organisations that have progressed well in the IT-business alignment <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> are likely to change their structure and control mechanisms.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research on}} project maturity in organisations. The {{purpose is to}} {{develop an understanding of}} what project maturity is and to investigate the level of project maturity in organisations today. The hypothesis is that project maturity develops through a <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder</b> where the ladder steps are proposed to be project management, program management, and portfolio management. Maturity itself is measured along three dimensions. They are knowledge (capability to carry out different tasks), attitudes (willingness to carry them out), and actions (actually doing them). The different dimensions of maturity are further divided into sub-concepts, which should provide a good understanding of the project maturity of an organisation. A questionnaire is developed based on a preliminary understanding of project maturity, and an initial survey has been conducted. The survey gives some support to the ladder construct, and shows that attitudes and knowledge are stronger than the actions taken. Further work on the questionnaire and surveys are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Because {{publicly}} available measures of deposit runoff risk are scarce, regulators’ models to measure {{interest rate risk}} in the banking book are based on very coarse assumptions about the allotment of non-maturity deposits within the regulatory <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder.</b> Using well-established statistical approaches, we address this issue by developing a methodology that considers deposits’ actual behavior {{in terms of both}} price sensitivity to changes in market rates and volume stability over time. Our model extends the current knowledge of public measures of interest rate risk and can be applied to {{publicly available}} data in a manner replicable by those outside of banking institutions. We find that the use of different allotment criteria affects not only the size of the risk indicator but also the nature of banks’ risk exposure, determining the risk inversion phenomenon—that is, banks exposed to an increase in interest rates can experience a reduction in their equity economic value if interest rates decrease. Overall, our results confirm the importance of accurate non-maturity deposits modeling for estimating interest rate risk in the banking book...|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of demand loans and deposits {{is crucial in}} measuring a bank’s actual exposure to the interest rate risk in the banking book. The repricing gap model, the most popular approach to measure this kind of risk, {{is based on a}} maturity/repricing schedule, according to which interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions are allotted into different time bands, based on their maturity or time remaining to their next repricing. Due to the possibility for the depositor (borrower) to withdraw (drain) the money without any notice, these accounts should be allotted in the “at sight” time band. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that bank interest rates are characterized by a sluggish and sometimes asymmetric reaction to changes in the market rates. To overcome this limit, we first develop an error correction model to study the interest rate pass-through for the Italian banking system, with specific regard to the retail bank interest rates on the sight deposits and on the overdraft accounts; then, we translate the response dynamic of the interest rates of these two items into coefficients that we use to allot them in the regulatory <b>maturity</b> <b>ladder,</b> thus making the distribution process much more realistic...|$|R
