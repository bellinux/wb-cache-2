How'd she happen to mention me?" [...] I was pretty excited. I really was.I don't know, <b>for</b> <b>Chrissake.</b> Lift up, willya? You're on my towel," [...] Stradlater said. I was sitting on his stupid towel."Jane Gallagher," [...] I said. I couldn't get over it. [...] "Jesus H. Christ." ...|$|E
5000|$|There were clashes {{on the set}} between {{actors and}} the director. Both of the leading players began work on the film miserable at having to leave their loved ones back in the United Kingdom; Olivier missed his fiancée Vivien Leigh and Oberon had {{recently}} {{fallen in love with}} film producer Alexander Korda. Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier also apparently detested each other. Witnesses recall Oberon scolding Olivier for accidentally spitting on her during a particularly romantic balcony scene. Oberon shouted back to Wyler, [...] "Tell him to stop spitting at me!" [...] Olivier retorted by shouting, [...] "What's a little spit <b>for</b> <b>Chrissake,</b> between actors? You bloody little idiot, how dare you speak to me...?" [...] Oberon ran crying from the set after the outburst, and Wyler insisted Olivier apologize to her, which upset Olivier greatly.|$|E
5000|$|An unusual {{incident}} occurred during a 1948 broadcast, as documented in Tune in Tomorrow (1968), the memoir by Mary Jane Higby, who portrayed Cynthia Carter on the program. As Gil attempted to convince Helen {{of his love}} for her, Helen again demurred and hesitated. Suddenly, a voice came over the airwaves, saying, [...] "Ah, <b>for</b> <b>chrissakes,</b> lay the dame {{and get it over}} with!" [...] As crew members tried to locate the voice inside the studio, the man proceeded to give sexually graphic examples of what Gil should do with Helen. In spite of the shock, there were few protests from listeners.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Stones David Wild commented that, {{compared}} to Spice, Spiceworld is [...] "a masterful effort; at its best, it reaches creative heights that are downright Bananaramian." [...] In a mixed review, Craig D. Lindsey of the Houston Press expressed, [...] "Anyone expecting a maelstrom of artistic evolution from these women ought to relax a little; it's only music, <b>for</b> <b>chrissakes.</b> And the Spice Girls and their handlers deserve bonus points for showing a little common sense. After all, {{if this were}} seven years ago, they might have taken their precious time releasing Spiceworld, while the group's hype was irreversibly extinguished." ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the thirteenth}} season, Vulture writer, Maggie Fremont spoke {{positively}} about the character: [...] "It’s never {{easy for a}} long-running series to introducea new character, especially when that character is meant to immediately {{fit in with the}} rest of the ensemble. But when Maggie Pierce arrived in season ten, that’s exactly what Grey’s Anatomy did. It could’ve been easy to dislike her — she showed up to take over cardio as Cristina Yang was leaving, <b>for</b> <b>chrissakes!</b> She was yet another one of Meredith’s long-lost sisters. The cards were really stacked against Maggie Pierce. Yet, thanks to the writers and Kelly McCreary’s terrific performance, Maggie was immediately endearing. She is weird and neurotic and cheerful. She is nothing like Cristina, but she fills a void that Meredith needs filled in order to function. Can you really imagine Grey’s without Maggie Pierce?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In naming Weezer the 26th best {{album of}} the 1990s, Pitchfork summed up the albums {{critical}} recognition: An album so substantial the band misguidedly attempted to tap into its resonance through cover graphics a mere two releases later. In 1994, 70s rock had come to mean either a bastardized version of Led Zeppelin or a bullshit reconstruction of punk rock. As guitar nerds, Weezer sought influence there but found true inspiration in forgotten bubblegum power-pop like Cheap Trick, Raspberries, 20/20, and The Quick. Most impressively, Rivers Cuomo rescued the thrilling guitar solo from finger-tapping metal and disregarding grunge/punk. A decade later air-guitaring to the album feels far less embarrassing than singing along. With the help of Spike Jonze, Weezer kept joy alive in arena rock, making the critical repositioning of Weezer as some emo touchstone even more absentminded. They called themselves Weezer, knowingly, <b>for</b> <b>chrissakes.</b> - Brent DiCrescenzo ...|$|R
