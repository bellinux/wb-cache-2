F-RAN enables storing popular files at the network edge (i. e., BS caches), which empowers local communication and alleviates traffic congestions at the core/backhaul network.

In contrast, disruptive or dazzle patterns protect moving targets and have been suggested as an evolutionary force in shaping the dorsal patterns of animals. Dazzle patterns, such as stripes and zigzags, are thought to reduce the probability with which moving prey will be captured by impairing predators' perception of speed. We investigated how different patterns of stripes (longitudinal-i. e., parallel to movement direction-and vertical-i. e., perpendicular to movement direction) affect the probability with which humans can hit moving objects and if differences in <b>hitting</b> <b>probability</b> are caused by a misperception of speed. A first experiment showed that longitudinally striped objects were hit more often than unicolored objects. However, vertically striped objects {{did not differ from}} unicolored objects. A second study examining the link between perceived speed and <b>hitting</b> <b>probability</b> showed that longitudinally and vertically striped objects were both perceived as moving faster and were hit more often than unicolored objects.

40|$|Abstract Background Introduction of spaced speeds {{opened a}} way of {{sensitivity}} improvement in homology search without loss of search speed. Since then, the efforts of finding optimal seed which maximizes the sensitivity have been continued today. The sensitivity of a seed is generally computed by its <b>hit</b> <b>probability.</b> However, the limitation of <b>hit</b> <b>probability</b> is that it computes the sensitivity only at a specific similarity level while homologous regions usually distributed in various similarity levels. As a result, the optimal seed found by <b>hit</b> <b>probability</b> is not actually optimal for various similarity levels. Therefore, a new measure of seed sensitivity is required to recommend seeds that are robust to various similarity levels. Results We propose a new probability model of sensitivity hit integration which covers a range of similarity levels of homologous regions. A novel algorithm of computing hit integration is proposed {{which is based on}} integration of <b>hit</b> <b>probabilities</b> at a range of similarity levels. We also prove that hit integration is computable by expressing the integral part of hit integration as a recursive formula which can be easily solved by dynamic programming. The experimental results for biological data show that hit integration reveals the seeds more optimal than those by PatternHunter. Conclusion The presented model is a more general model to estimate sensitivity than <b>hit</b> <b>probability</b> by relaxing similarity level. We propose a novel algorithm which directly computes the sensitivity at a range of similarity levels. </p...|$|R

We find that the problem can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem if the inter-request distribution has a non-increasing hazard rate function. We provide explicit optimal solutions for some inter-request distributions, and compare the solutions to the hit-rate based (HRB) and hit-probability based (HPB) problems. We also propose distributed algorithms that not only can adapt to changes in the system with limited information but also provide solutions in a decentralized way. We find that distributed algorithms that solve HRB are more robust than distributed HPB algorithms.
