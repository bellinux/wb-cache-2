40|$|Many {{empirical}} studies of banking crises have employed "banking crisis" (BC) indicators constructedusing primarily information on government actions undertaken {{in response to}} <b>bank</b> <b>distress.</b> Weformulate a simple theoretical model of a banking industry which we use to identify and constructtheory-based measures of systemic bank shocks (SBS). Using both country-level and firm-level samples, we show that SBS indicators consistently predict BC indicators based on four major BCseries that {{have appeared in the}} literature. Therefore, BC indicatorsactually measure lagged government responses to systemic bank shocks, rather than the occurrence of crises per se. We re-examine the separate impact of macroeconomic factors, bank market structure, deposit insurance, andexternal shocks on the probability of a systemic bank shocks and on the probability of governmentresponses to <b>bank</b> <b>distress.</b> The impact of these variables on the likelihood of a government responseto <b>bank</b> <b>distress</b> is totally different from that on the likelihood of a systemic bank shock. Disentangling the effects of systemic bank shocks and government responses turns out to be crucial inunderstanding the roots of bank fragility.

40|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis, {{a large number of}} banks worldwide either failed or received financial aid thus inflicting substantial losses on the system. We contribute to the early warning literature by constructing a dynamic competing risks hazard model that explores the joint determination of the probability of a <b>distressed</b> <b>bank</b> to face a licence withdrawal or to be bailed out. The underlying patterns of distress are analysed based on a broad range of bank-level and environmental factors. We find that institutions with inadequate capital, illiquid and risky assets, poor management, low levels of earnings and high sensitivity to market conditions have a higher probability to go bankrupt. Bailed out banks, on the other hand, face both capital and liquidity shortages, experience low earnings, and are highly exposed to market products; however, neither the managerial expertise, nor the quality of assets are relevant to the odds of bailout. We further document that large and complex banks are less likely to fail and more likely to be bailed out and also that authorities are more prone to provide support to a <b>distressed</b> <b>bank,</b> which is well-connected with politicians and political parties and less prone to let it go bankrupt.

We as-semble an exhaustive and unique set of <b>bank</b> <b>distress</b> events, and model <b>bank</b> <b>distress</b> {{as a function of}} accounting-based fundamentals, while controlling for country-year fixed effects, and the type of resolution in the distressed entity. The analysis of our <b>bank</b> <b>distress</b> models reveals a substantial cross-country variation in the ability of accounting fundamentals to discriminate between <b>distressed</b> and non-distressed <b>banks</b> within countries.

We show that the association between accounting fundamentals and <b>bank</b> <b>distress</b> is attenuated in jurisdictions with relatively lax bank disclosure laws and their implementation. Accounting ratios, whose information value is the most sensitive to the quality of regulatory disclosure include regulatory capital ratios, loan loss provisions, and unreserved loan losses. The evidence in this paper supports the oft-voiced concern that excessive flexibility in financial reporting undermines the ability of accounting signals to accurately capture the underlying financial health of banks.

40|$|Financial {{distress}} {{has long}} been known to alter incentives of firms. Distressed firms have incentives to increase risk and gamble for survival since the cost of failure can be forced on to creditors. Past theoretical work and anecdotal evidence has suggested that when faced with financial distress and increased competition banks may gamble by raising deposit rates to attract funds and invest the funds in riskier assets. The gambling problem in <b>distressed</b> <b>banks</b> can be potentially made worse by deposit insurance which allows banks to generate funds at rates not commensurate with risk. This aggravation of moral hazard caused by deposit insurance has implications for bank deposit pricing in the sense that gambling banks may not need to bid up deposit rates as much. Past empirical evidence has found evidence that troubled banks raise deposit rates and attributed this to either gambling incentives or to market discipline enforced by uninsured depositors. This paper further examines deposit pricing strategy of <b>distressed</b> <b>banks</b> by examining multiple dimensions of deposit pricing. It provides fresh evidence for the gambling hypothesis and suggests that deposit insurance affects deposit pricing strategy of <b>distressed</b> <b>banks.</b> But I also find that deposit insurance is not the only factor; the evidence suggests that segmentation between various types of depositors also plays a significant role. The results imply that moral hazard is increased not only by deposit insurance but also by the convenience orientation of certain types of depositors...|$|R

If the government takes over the state-owned bank directly or re-capitalizes and privatizes it immediately, then signaling leads to excessive liquidation. Delay in privatization allows delegating the signaling and can be beneficial because the signaling distortion can be shifted across "types". The analysis assumes a political constraint to sell the state-owned bank to a domestic investor (shallow pockets), but shows also that a Pareto improvement can typically be achieved if a buyer with a deep pocket can be found (foreign investor), Policy implications concerning timing and scope of bank privatization are discussed. bad loans, delegated signing, delayed recapitalization...|$|E

40|$|Banking crises {{are usually}} {{followed}} by a decline in credit and growth. Is this because crises tend to take place during economic downturns, or do banking sector problems have independent negative effects on the economy? To answer this question we examine industrial sectors with differing needs for financing. If banking crises have an exogenous detrimental effect on real activity, then sectors more dependent on external finance should perform relatively worse during banking crises. The evidence in this paper supports this view. Additional support {{comes from the fact}} that sectors that predominantly have small firms, and thus are typically bank-dependent, also perform relatively worse during banking crises. The differential effects across sectors are stronger in developing countries, in countries with less access to foreign finance, and where banking crises have been more severe.
