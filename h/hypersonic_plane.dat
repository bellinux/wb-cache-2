40|$|Hydrogen is the {{foremost}} candidate as a fuel {{for use in}} high speed transport. Since any aircraft moving at hypersonic speeds must have a very slender body, means of decreasing the storage volume requirements below that for liquid hydrogen are needed. The total performance of the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>plane</b> needs {{to be considered for}} the evaluation of candidate fuel and storage systems. To accomplish this, a simple model for the performance of a <b>hypersonic</b> <b>plane</b> is presented. To allow for the use of different engines and fuels during different phases of flight, the total trajectory is divided into three phases: subsonic-supersonic, hypersonic and rocket propulsion phase. The fuel fraction for the first phase is found be a simple energy balance using an average thrust to drag ratio for this phase. The hypersonic flight phase is investigated in more detail by taking small altitude increments. This approach allowed the use of flight profiles other than the constant dynamic pressure flight. The effect of fuel volume on drag, structural mass and tankage mass was introduced through simplified equations involving the characteristic dimension of the plane. The propellant requirement for the last phase is found by employing the basic rocket equations. The candidate fuel systems such as the cryogenic fuel combinations and solid and liquid endothermic hydrogen generators are first screened thermodynamically with respect to their energy densities and cooling capacities and then evaluated using the above model...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the structures group is to provide quality aerospace research with the Center for Aerospace Research - A NASA Center for Excellence at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. The group includes dedicated faculty and students who have a proven record {{in the area of}} structures, in particular space structures. The participating faculty developed accurate mathematical models and effective computational algorithms to characterize the flexibility parameters of joint dominated beam-truss structures. Both experimental and theoretical modelling has been applied to the dynamic mode shapes and mode frequencies for a large truss system. During the past few months, the above procedures has been applied to the hypersonic transport plane model. The plane structure has been modeled as a lumped mass system by Doctor Abu-Saba while Doctor Shen applied the transfer matrix method with a piecewise continuous Timoshenko tapered beam model. Results from both procedures compare favorably with those obtained using the finite element method. These two methods are more compact and require less computer time than the finite element method. The group intends to perform experiments on structural systems including the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>plane</b> model to verify the results from the theoretical models...|$|E

40|$|The {{desire to}} achieve orbit-on-demand access to space with rapid {{turn-around}} capability and aircraft-like processing operations {{has given rise}} to numerous <b>hypersonic</b> aerospace <b>plane</b> design concepts which would take off horizontally from a conventional runway and employ air-breathing scramjet propulsion systems for acceleration to orbital speeds. Most of these air-breathing hypersonic vehicle concepts incorporate an elongated fuselage forebody to act as the aerodynamic compression surface for a scramjet combustor module. This type of airframe-integrated scramjet propulsion system tends to be highly sensitive to inlet conditions and angle-of-attack perturbations. Furthermore, the basic configuration of the fuselage, with its elongated and tapered forebody, produces relatively low frequency elastic modes which will cause perturbations in the combustor inlet conditions due to the oscillation of the forebody compression surface. The flexibility of the forebody compression surface, together with sensitivity of scramjet propulsion systems to inlet conditions, creates the potential for an unprecedented form of aeroelastic-propulsive interaction in which deflections of the vehicle fuselage give rise to propulsion transients, producing force and moment variations that may adversely impact the longitudinal flight dynamics and/or excite the elastic modes. These propulsive force and moment variations may have an appreciable impact on the performance, guidance, and control of a <b>hypersonic</b> aerospace <b>plane.</b> The objectives of this research are to quantify the magnitudes of propulsive force and moment perturbations resulting from elastic deformation of a representative hypersonic vehicle, and to assess the potential impact of these perturbations on the vehicle's longitudinal flight dynamics...|$|R
5000|$|Boscombe Down airbase {{has been}} {{associated}} with rumours concerning United States black projects. An incident is reported to have occurred there on 26 September 1994, although evidence is scarce, and both the British and American Governments have refused to comment on it. [...] According to witnesses, an aircraft crashed on landing due to nosewheel collapse. The Special Air Service (SAS) were scrambled to set up a perimeter around the airfield, and a C5 Galaxy was redirected to the station.

40|$|The proper {{design of}} the inlet system is of great {{importance}} {{for the performance of}} air-breathing <b>hypersonic</b> space <b>planes.</b> One of the dominating flow phenomena inside such a hypersonic inlet is the mutual interaction of oblique shocks with boundary layers, forcing the boundary layer to separate from the inlet wall.

40|$|For the {{performance}} of air-breathing <b>hypersonic</b> space <b>planes,</b> {{the proper design of}} the inlet system is of great importance. One of the dominating flow phenomena inside such hypersonic inlets is the mutual interaction of oblique shocks with boundary layers, often leading to a separation of the boundary layer from the inlet wall. In this work, several methods to manipulate shock / boundary layer interactions (for example boundary layer bleed or wall contouring) are investigated with regard to an application in hypersonic inlets. By means of analytical methods for the pre-dimensioning, computational fluid dynamics using a finite element method and experiments in the hypersonic wind tunnel facilities of the DLR (German aerospace center), favorable design parameters for these manipulation methods are presented. Finally, the most qualified methods are implemented in a hypersonic inlet model and the obtainable gain in inlet efficiency is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|A new upwind, parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) code {{has been}} {{developed}} to compute two- and three-dimensional (3 -D) chemically reacting, turbulent flows with hydrogen-air chemistry. The code is a modification of the 3 -D upwind PNS (UPS) airflow code. The code solves the PNS equations using a finite-volume, upwind, TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) method based on Roe 2 ̆ 7 s approximate Riemann solver that has been modified to account for nonequilibrium effects. The fluid medium {{is assumed to be}} a chemically reacting mixture of thermally perfect (but calorically imperfect) gases in thermal equilibrium. Two turbulence models have been incorporated into the code including an algebraic model, that has the ability to account for internal flows with multiple walls, and a two-equation ([kappa]-[epsilon]) turbulence model. For the two-equation turbulence model option, the code solves the turbulence transport equations in an uncoupled manner from the fluids equations. With these enhancements, the UPS code is now capable of computing the chemically reacting flow in scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engines. Various component test cases have been used to validate the code. The computed results are in good agreement with the available numerical and analytical solutions and experimental data. Finally, the full capabilities of the new code have been demonstrated with a 3 -D tip-to-tail numerical calculation of the integrated aerodynamic and propulsive flowfields of a generic <b>hypersonic</b> space <b>plane.</b> Two test cases, one with power-off and one with power-on, were considered to study the flow structure around such a configuration. Both tip-to-tail cases were successfully computed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{performed}} {{in the area of}} computational modeling and application of hypersonic, high-enthalpy, thermo-chemical nonequilibrium flow (Aerothermodynamics) problems.

Computational modeling involved developing appropriate numerical schemes for the flows on interest and developing, applying, and validating appropriate thermochemical processes. As part of improving the accuracy of the numerical predictions, adaptive grid algorithms were explored, and a user-friendly, self-adaptive code (SAGE) was developed.

25|$|In August 2015, the 60th-year {{anniversary of}} the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works {{revealed}} they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, {{referred to as the}} UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and improving upon them. Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to the Air Force several times but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics. The Air Force has no requirement or timeframe for a next-generation High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early. Having the option of an onboard pilot is considered a deterrent because it can be used in peacetime situations where unmanned aircraft would more likely be engaged, since there is no possibility of killing a person. The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the RQ-3 DarkStar, which never made it past flight testing and was canceled. Plans for a U-2 replacement would not conflict with development of the SR-72, another project by the company to create a <b>hypersonic</b> unmanned surveillance <b>plane,</b> as it would be suited for missions that require greater speed for time-sensitive targets.|$|R
40|$|Model kinetic {{equations}} {{are often}} used to describe rarefied gas flows in {{the broad range of}} flow regimes. Accurate model kinetic equations were proposed by Shakhov [1] for monatomic gases and by Rykov [2] for diatomic gases. The main advantage of these model equations over other models reported in the literature is that the model collision integral contains expressions for heat fluxes and ensures their correct relaxation, e. g. correct Prandtl number for the monatomic gas. Developing conservative numerical methods for kinetic equations is a demanding task due to the nonlinear character and very high dimension of these equations. These methods are defined as methods from which the discrete conservation laws for the mass, momentum and energy follow. Non-conservative methods produce non-physical source terms in the conservation equations and may fail to converge to the proper solution as the Knudsen number is decreased unless the velocity grid is constantly refined. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the kinetic equation, both exact and model ones, the conservation property is very difficult to satisfy. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a direct approach for ensuring conservation in the numerical methods for model kinetic equations, including Shakhov and Rykov models. The approach is based on the approximation of the conditions which are used in deriving these model equations. We construct a nonlinear system of equations defining the macro parameters in collision integrals. This system can be easily solved numerically. The resulting numerical methods do not require prohibitively fine meshes and ensures correct relaxation of heat fluxes in the continuum limits. We apply the proposed method to a <b>plane</b> <b>hypersonic</b> flow over a plate. The obtained results illustrate the robustness and accuracy of the method...|$|R
