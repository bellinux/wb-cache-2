40|$|We {{describe}} deep exponential families (<b>DEFs),</b> a {{class of}} latent variable models that are inspired by the hidden structures used in deep neural networks. <b>DEFs</b> capture a hierarchy of dependencies between latent variables, and are easily generalized to many settings through exponential families. We perform inference using recent "black box" variational inference techniques. We then evaluate various <b>DEFs</b> on text and combine multiple <b>DEFs</b> into a model for pairwise recommendation data. In an extensive study, we show that going beyond one layer improves predictions for <b>DEFs.</b> We demonstrate that <b>DEFs</b> find interesting exploratory structure in large data sets, and give better predictive performance than state-of-the-art models...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} seven years, we have {{developed}} static-analysis methods to recover a good approximation to the variables and dynamically allocated memory objects of a stripped executable, and to track the flow of values through them. It {{is relatively easy to}} track the effects of an instruction operand that refers to a global address (i. e., an access to a global variable) or that uses a stack-frame offset (i. e., an access to a local scalar variable via the frame pointer or stack pointer). In our work, our algorithms are able to provide useful information for close to 100 % of such “direct ” uses and <b>defs.</b> It is much harder for a static-analysis algorithm to track the effects of an instruction operand that uses a non-stack-frame register. These “indirect” uses and <b>defs</b> correspond to accesses to an array or a dynamically allocated memory object. In one study, our approach recovered useful information for only 29 % of indirect uses and 33 % of indirect <b>defs.</b> However, using the technique described in this paper, the algorithm recovered useful information for 81 % of indirect uses and 90 % of indirect <b>defs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Entropy {{drives the}} phase {{behavior}} of colloids ranging from dense suspensions of hard spheres or rods to dilute suspensions of hard spheres and depletants. Entropic ordering of anisotropic shapes into complex crystals, liquid crystals, and even quasicrystals {{has been demonstrated}} recently in computer simulations and experiments. The ordering of shapes appears to arise from the emergence of directional entropic forces (<b>DEFs)</b> that align neighboring particles, but these forces have been neither rigorously defined nor quantified in generic systems. Here, we show quantitatively that shape drives the phase behavior of systems of anisotropic particles upon crowding through <b>DEFs.</b> We define <b>DEFs</b> in generic systems, and compute them for several hard particle systems. We {{show that they are}} on the order of a few kT at the onset of ordering, placing <b>DEFs</b> on par with traditional depletion, van der Waals, and other intrinsic interactions. In experimental systems with these other interactions, we provide direct quantitative evidence that entropic effects of shape also contribute to self-assembly. We use <b>DEFs</b> to draw a distinction between self-assembly and packing behavior. We show that the mechanism that generates directional entropic forces is the maximization of entropy by optimizing local particle packing. We show that this mechanism occurs in a wide class of systems, and we treat, in a unified way, the entropy-driven phase behavior of arbitrary shapes incorporating the well-known works of Kirkwood, Onsager, and Asakura and Oosawa.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the association of dental caries and BMI-for-age in preschool children and whether BMI-for-age is similar or different between Severe Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC) and caries free children. Materials and Methods: Four hundred preschool children aged 30 - 70 months were entered into this study. The parameters examined in this study were weight, height, BMI-for-age and number of decayed, extracted and filled surfaces of deciduous teeth (<b>defs).</b> Based on dental caries, the subjects were also divided into S-ECC and caries-free groups. Then data was analyzed by t-test, one-way ANOVA, multiple regression and logistic regression tests. Results: The mean and SD of <b>defs</b> index was 8. 37 ± 11. 2. In the underweight, normal-weight, at risk of overweight and overweight groups, these values were 4. 89 ± 10. 8, 8. 84 ± 11. 8, 8. 68 ± 10. 6, and 10. 39 ± 10. 2, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed a statistically a significant direct association between BMI-for-age and <b>defs</b> index (P = 0. 001) after adjusting for gender and age. The percentage of subjects who were caries free and S-ECC was 44. 8 % and 51. 2 %, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that there was statistically a significant inverse association between BMI-for-age scores and the frequency of caries-free (P = 0. 001) and a significant direct association with S-ECC children (P = 0. 001). Conclusions : The findings of this study demonstrated that there was an association between higher <b>defs</b> scores and severe early childhood caries with overweightness...|$|R
5|$|NWOBHM bands {{had been}} touring {{steadily}} in the United States, {{but had not}} yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts. <b>Def</b> Leppard remedied that, releasing Pyromania {{at the beginning of}} 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music. The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US, where Pyromania peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made <b>Def</b> Leppard superstars. The overwhelming international success of Pyromania induced both American and British bands to follow <b>Def</b> Leppard's example, giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.|$|E
