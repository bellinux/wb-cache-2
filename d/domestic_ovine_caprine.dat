40|$|International audienceThe discovery, at Sidon, of a {{group of}} burials dated to the Middle Bronze Age – most of which {{contained}} animal remains together with human burials – presents a new corpus of funerary offerings and animal sacrifices. The analysis of the animal remains was undertaken in the field {{at the time of the}} excavations at Sidon in July 2001. There is little in the way of archaeozoological data on the practices of burying animals and providing food offerings for the dead in the northern Levant and more generally in the Near East; in the southern Levant, however, a larger number of Middle Bronze Age sites have provided data on the animal remains found in burials. For a true understanding of burials and funerary rites it is essential that the animal remains are studied, in addition to and in parallel with the study of the other grave goods found in burials. Of the three types of burials found in the part of the necropolis of Sidon that has been excavated: simple inhumations, jar burials and burials in constructed graves, it is the last which are the richest in animal remains. Very few such remains accompanied the burials in the sand and the jar burials. Altogether, fifteen burials of the twenty excavated contained skeletal material, mainly of mammals, although some fishbones, some fragments of the plastrons of turtles and tortoises and a few shells that have not yet been positively identified were recovered. Among the species of mammals identified, only domestic animals are represented. Given the difficulty, in certain cases, of distinguishing the bones of sheep from those of goats, those remains that could not be precisely determined have been placed in the category 'ovi-caprines'. Also, the terms sheep(Ovis aries), goat (Capra hircus), cow (Bos taurus) and pig (Sus scrofa) are used generically to describe <b>domestic</b> <b>ovines,</b> <b>caprines,</b> bovines and suiforms. The ovi-caprines, that is the sheep and the goats, were found in quantity, whereas the bovines and the pigs were far less numerous. No wild species were found, except for one bone of a small carnivore, which can probably be attributed to a mustelid. Cutmarks were found on some of the bones. Some were burnt...|$|R

The differences in ash content were relatively small, but <b>ovine</b> and <b>caprine</b> WPC were quite different from bovine WPC in terms of calcium and potassium. Important differences in protein content have also been observed; ovine WPC showed the highest concentration in the protein bgr -lactoglobulin, bovine WPC the highest concentration in the protein agr - lactalbumin and caprine the highest concentration in the protein immunoglobulin G. No significant differences existed in terms of denaturation onset temperature between {{the three types of}} WPC; however, differences were found within WPC types between those cases where NaCl was present or absent. The gel maturation at 85 °C was characterized by storage moduli that were close to one another for <b>ovine</b> and <b>caprine</b> WPC, but these were far from those of bovine WPC. The decrease in temperature from 85 to 20 °C had a strong effect on the viscoelastic moduli of WPC gels, but the initial structure could be recovered by reheating the gels from 20 to 85 °C...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Q fever is a {{ubiquitous}} zoonosis {{caused by}} Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular rickettsial organism that caused abortion and stillbirth in ruminants. Approach: The prevalence of Coxiella burnetii in Iran is essentially unknown. Its traditional diagnosis {{is based on}} culture, serology and conventional PCR. In this present study, for more sensitive and accurate detection and prevalence's determination of Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses, the nested and real-time PCR methods are recommended. Results: About 98 (12. 53 %) and 122 (16. 39 %) out of 782 and 744 <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> aborted fetuses, were positive for presence of Coxiella burnetii by nested PCR, respectively. After LSI Taqvet Coxiella burnetii real-time PCR, it was recognized that 121 (15. 47 %) and 152 (20. 43 %) samples were positive for Coxiella burnetii in <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> aborted fetuses, respectively. Results indicated that the real-time PCR was 7 times more sensitive than the nested PCR. Statistical analysis showed significant differences about P Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses by both nested and real-time PCR assays and P Coxiella burnetii. The Ct values which obtained from real-time PCR had significant differences about P Coxiella burnetii between aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses. Our results indicated that Caprine is more sensitive than Ovine to Coxiella burnetiis abortion Khozestan and Gilan have the highest and Khorasan and Sistan va Baluchistan provinces have the lowest prevalence of Coxiella burnetii, respectively. Conclusion: To our knowledge, {{this study is the}} first prevalence report of direct identification of Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses by evaluation of nested and real-time PCR assays in Iran.
