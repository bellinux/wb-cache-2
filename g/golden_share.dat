However, he was personally involved in defusing tensions between the company and its pilots, warned the airline to cut costs, and made public his advice to the airline to divest from its subsidiary companies.|$|E
25|$|In early 2007, the Portuguese conglomerate, Sonae's {{takeover}} offer for Portugal Telecom failed. PT's board rejected an initial bid, worth EUR 11.1 bn, in February 2006. Sonae.com's takeover bid opposed Belmiro de Azevedo (founder and historical chairman of Sonae holding company) {{and his son}} Paulo Azevedo (then the head officer of Sonae.com telecommunications operator) to the investor José Berardo and PT's administrators Zeinal Bava and Henrique Granadeiro. In April 2007 the European Commission gave an ultimatum to the Portuguese government ordering it {{to give up on}} the 500 golden shares pack that it owned on the company and that enable special veto powers to the government on vital issues. This could give the government a decisive role in the bid by any company to buy Portugal Telecom. In November 2007, Portugal Telecom spun off its media assets (PT Multimédia), that included TV Cabo and Lusomundo Cinemas. In January 2008, the European Commission began legal proceedings against the Portuguese government over its 'golden share' in incumbent telecoms operator Portugal Telecom. The 500 golden shares with extended voting rights, allowing it to block potential takeover bids, were the reason for the Commission's legal action. Similarly, in November 2005, the Commission had forced the Spanish government to give up its <b>golden</b> <b>share</b> in the other telecommunications' major player in the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 {{service to}} Asia was {{expanded}} as Continental introduced daily nonstop service between Newark and New Delhi, India. The {{success of this}} Newark-New Delhi route presaged establishment of a second gateway in India with the announcement of daily nonstop service to Mumbai. With the establishment of Mumbai service, Continental offers the most nonstop flights by any carrier from the United States to India. By May 2006, the carrier's passenger traffic surpassed that of Northwest Airlines, and Continental became the fourth-largest U.S. carrier. The Wall Street Journal reported on December 12, 2007 that Continental was in merger discussions with United Airlines. Of issue would be Continental's <b>golden</b> <b>share</b> held by Northwest Airlines and the divestiture of Continental's Guamanian hub. A deal was not [...] "certain or imminent", with the talks being of a preliminary nature. In April 2008, {{at the height of}} oil prices, Northwest announced a merger with Delta Air Lines. This allowed Continental to buy back the <b>golden</b> <b>share</b> from Northwest Airlines, which it did. Continental then renewed merger talks with United Airlines, but Continental ended the merger talks that same month.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{exactly a}} decade ago, the Court of Justice {{delivered}} its first judgments on <b>golden</b> <b>shares</b> granting Member States special rights in privatized companies. Since then, the Court {{has dealt with}} the problem of <b>golden</b> <b>shares</b> at regular intervals. However, in spite of the growing body of case law, clear principles to determine when special rights of public shareholders constitute a restriction on the free movement of capital have not yet emerged. The case law of the Court of Justice develops on an ad hoc basis, and the Court seems to be guided by a general conviction that State involvement in private enterprises should be confined, rather than by discernible legal principles. This article seeks to rationalize the <b>golden</b> <b>shares</b> case law and assess the delimiting criteria proposed by the Court. In order to examine the case law in a structured way, the article draws a distinction between two types of State intervention in the control of companies: "regulatory acts" and "shareholder acts"...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} change in {{government}} control of privatized firms in OECD countries. Results indicate that governments typically transfer ownership rights without relinquishing proportional control. Control is commonly retained by leveraging state investments through pyramids, dual-class <b>shares,</b> and <b>golden</b> <b>shares.</b> Indeed, {{at the end of}} 2000, after the largest privatization wave in history, governments retain control of 62. 4 % of privatized firms. In civil law countries, governments tend to retain large ownership positions, whereas in common law countries they typically use <b>golden</b> <b>shares.</b> However, when we combine these two mechanisms, we find no association between a country’s legal tradition and the extent of government control. Rather, we document more prevalent government influence over privatized firms in countries with proportional electoral rules and with a centralized system of political authority...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of federal state {{shareholdings}} {{on the performance of}} Russian companies. It differs from most similar studies in two respects. Firstly, it focuses on mixed ownership companies rather than conventional state enterprises. Secondly, it distinguishes between several types of federal state shareholdings, namely elected blocks, residual blocks (which may be held by two bodies with different functions – the Ministry for State Property and the Russian Fund for Federal Property) and <b>golden</b> <b>shares.</b> The paper describes the origin of federal state shareholdings and discusses their possible implications for company performance. Econometric analysis shows that companies with state ownership generally perform worse than the average firm in terms of labour productivity and profitability. However, there are remarkable differences in the performance of companies with different types of state shareholdings. Companies with residual blocks held by the Property Fund are the worst performers, followed by companies with residual blocks held by the Ministry for State Property. Companies with elected shareholdings as well as with <b>golden</b> <b>shares</b> do not differ from the average enterprises in the respective industries. These differences in performance are explained by the different degrees of control the federal state has over enterprises with various types of shareholdings – greater control is associated with better performance. The paper concludes that the government should avoid keeping equity stakes in companies unless there is a good reason to retain them. If the state wants to keep an ownership stake in a company, reliable control structures must be created. Finally, the issue of <b>golden</b> <b>shares</b> in strategically important companies seems to be a reasonable alternative to retaining some control over them through equity ownership.
