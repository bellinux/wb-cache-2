After several days, the invading queen begins ejecting host larvae from their brood cells and eating host eggs and then begin to lay her own eggs into host-constructed wax cells after another few days.

These invasions are usually successful if they occur before the second batch of workers has been produced. The invading queen eats the eggs or larvae of the host queen, although they will frequently let more-developed larvae and existing workers survive {{to allow for a}} sufficient workforce.

Here, we explore temporal and inter-individual patterns in pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation of Dianthus sylvestris by Hadena moths, within and among three sex morphs. We scored plants that started flowering at different periods in 2001 and 2003 and found that fruit set decreased and predation rates increased over one season, {{and most of the}} other season, <b>granting</b> <b>a</b> female reproductive <b>advantage</b> to early flowering plants, though, we found no morph-specific temporal patterns. Female plants set more fruits, and more of their fruits escaped predation in one year, but this did not <b>grant</b> them <b>a</b> reproductive <b>advantage</b> since they produce fewer flowers per plant than the other morphs. Instead, mixed plants showed a clear female reproductive advantage. We also examined predation types by Hadena and seed production in attacked and intact fruits of individually marked flowers. Though female Hadena moths laid eggs preferentially into perfect flowers, flower sexes suffered similar predation by itinerant caterpillars. Attacked fruits contained fewer and lighter seeds than un-attacked ones. We conclude that pre-dispersal seed predation by Hadena may select on flowering onset of this sexually polymorphic species...|$|R

40|$|Patent boxes {{have been}} heavily debated for {{their role in}} {{corporate}} tax competition. This paper uses firm-level data for the period 2000 - 2011 for the top 2, 000 corporate research and development (R&D) investors worldwide to consider the determinants of patent registration across a large sample of countries. Importantly, we disentangle the effects of corporate income taxation from the tax advantage of patent boxes. We also exploit a new and original dataset on patent box features such as the conditionality on performing research in the country, and their scope. We find that patent boxes have a considerable effect on attracting patents, mostly because of their favourable tax treatment, especially for high-quality patents. Patent boxes with a large scope in terms of tax base definition also have stronger effects on the location of patents. The size of the tax advantage offered through patent box regimes is found to deter local innovative activities, whereas R&D development conditions tend to attenuate this adverse effect. Our simulations show that, on average, countries imposing such development conditions tend to <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> tax <b>advantage</b> that is slightly greater than optimal from a local R&D impact perspective...|$|R
