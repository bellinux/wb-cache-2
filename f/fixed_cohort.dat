40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of metabolic syndrome (MS), MS individual components and 32 kinds of MS specific component combinations on all-cause mortality risk in a <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort</b> of MJ check-up population. We observed the events of death in a <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort,</b> where the population was composed of 45, 542 individuals aged 35 - 74 who were examined at MJ Health check-up Center in 1997 as baseline examination, and were followed up to 2005. Median duration of follow-up was 7. 44 years. MS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Educational Program (the revised NCEP-ATPIII for Asian in 2004), the prevalence of MS was standardized according to China's fifth census data. We constructed common Cox regression model, simultaneously adjusting the classic risk factors (such as age, sex, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, family history, etc.) {{to examine the relationship}} between MS, MS individual components and 32 kinds of MS specific component combinations on the occurrence of death with the <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort.</b> The standardized prevalence of MS was 29. 75 % (male: 30. 36 %, female: 29. 51 %). There were 1, 749 persons who died during the median 7. 44 -years follow-up, the mortality rate was 46 per 10, 000 person years. The mortality rates were 71 and 35 per 10, 000 person years for those with and without MS, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex and classical risk factors, compared with subjects without MS, the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality was 1. 26 (95 % CI: 1. 14 - 1. 40). The all-cause mortality were more highly significant than other combinations (P < 0. 05) when the following combinations exist: "elevated blood pressure", "elevated fasting plasma glucose + low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol", "elevated blood pressure + elevated triglyceride + elevated fasting plasma glucose", "elevated fasting plasma glucose + low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol + elevated blood pressure + elevated triglyceride". After adjusting age, sex and classical risk factors, the HRs for those with 0 to 5 components were 1, 1. 22, 1. 25, 1. 33, 1. 66, and 1. 92, respectively. There was a significant dose-response relationship (P for liner trend < 0. 001) between the number of MS components and the risk of all-cause mortality in the overall <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort</b> sample. In a large scale middle-aged Taiwan check-up population, MS may be associated with a much higher risk for all-cause mortality. These results may underline the fact that MS is a non-homogeneous syndrome and have a significant impact on detecting high-risk individuals suffering from metabolic disorders for preventing and controlling death...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{previous}} studies have found seasonal patterns in birth outcomes, but with little agreement about which season poses the highest risk. Some of the heterogeneity between studies {{may be explained by}} a previously unknown bias. The bias occurs in retrospective cohorts which include all births occurring within a fixed start and end date, which means shorter pregnancies are missed {{at the start of the}} study, and longer pregnancies are missed at the end. Our objective was to show the potential size of this bias and how to avoid it. Methods To demonstrate the bias we simulated a retrospective birth cohort with no seasonal pattern in gestation and used a range of cohort end dates. As a real example, we used a cohort of 114, 063 singleton births in Brisbane between 1 July 2005 and 30 June 2009 and examined the bias when estimating changes in gestation length associated with season (using month of conception) and a seasonal exposure (temperature). We used survival analyses with temperature as a time-dependent variable. Results We found strong artificial seasonal patterns in gestation length by month of conception, which depended on the end date of the study. The bias was avoided when the day and month of the start date was just before the day and month of the end date (regardless of year), so that the longer gestations at the start of the study were balanced by the shorter gestations at the end. After removing the <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort</b> bias there was a noticeable change in the effect of temperature on gestation length. The adjusted hazard ratios were flatter at the extremes of temperature but steeper between 15 and 25 °C. Conclusions Studies using retrospective birth cohorts should account for the <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort</b> bias by removing selected births to get unbiased estimates of seasonal health effects. </p...|$|E

40|$|Scholars {{have been}} {{examining}} {{the relationship between}} fertility and unemployment {{for more than a}} century. Most studies find that fertility falls with unemployment in the short run, but it is not known whether these negative effects persist since women may simply postpone child bearing to better economics times. Using over 140 million U. S. birth records for the period 1975 to 2010, we analyze both the short and long-run effects of unemployment on fertility. We follow <b>fixed</b> <b>cohorts</b> of U. S. born women defined by their own state and year of birth, and relate their fertility to the unemployment rate experienced by each cohort at different ages. We focus on conceptions that result in a live birth. We find that women in their early 20 s are most affected by high unemployment rates in the short-run and that the negative effects on fertility grow over time. A one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate experienced between the ages of 20 and 24 reduces the short-run fertility of women in this age range by 6 conceptions per 1, 000 women. When we follow these women to age 40, we find that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate experienced at 20 to 24 leads to an overall loss of 14. 2 conceptions. This long-run effect is driven largely by women who remain childless and thus do not have either first births or higher order births...|$|R
30|$|Thus, I {{investigate}} {{the first stage}} estimates reported in Panel B of Table 6. These estimates show that the reform is strongly and positively correlated {{with the number of}} years of parental schooling and that its t statistic is above 2.7 even when conditioning on country and <b>cohort</b> <b>fixed</b> effects. One notable exception, however, is the model that includes the country-specific trends (column 5), in which the first stage estimate is not statistically different from zero, with the t statistic of approximately 1.3. Panel A of Table 6 also reports the corresponding first stage F-test statistic for each specification that accounts for the clustering of the standard errors at the parents’ country and cohort level. When subsequently including country <b>fixed</b> effects and <b>cohort</b> <b>fixed</b> effects for children (columns 3 and 4), this statistic falls to approximately 7.5, which is below the cutoff value of 10 suggested by Bound et al. (1995) and Staiger and Stock (1997), but this value is substantially higher than the first stage F-test statistic produced by the model that incorporates the country-specific trends (column 5). Because of the lack of power in my identification strategy after controlling for country-specific trends, I choose the specification that does not allow for country-specific trends (see column 4 of Table 6, Panel A) as my preferred one. In this model, my results reveal that parental education appears to have a large causal effect on children’s education: I find that an additional year of parental education will raise a child’s educational attainment by 0.44 of a year.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how consumption inequality {{within a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort</b> grows with age using Japanese household microdata. Following the method developed by Deaton and Paxson (1994), we obtain the following results. First, consumption inequality starts to increase {{at the age}} of 40. Second, younger generations face a more unequal distribution from the beginning of their life-cycle. Third, half of the rapid increase in the economy-wide consumption inequality during the 1980 s was caused by population aging. while one-third was due to the increasing cohort effect. The paper compares the above results with those of Deaton and Paxson. Older households are not uniform in terms of economic welfare; individual history up to old age is idiosyncratic, thereby generating a dispersion of individual economic status. For example, the wealth of older households reflects their history of health, opportunities of human capital formation, employment relations within firms, family background, human network, individual luck, and so forth.

40|$|Three methodological {{problems}} are commonly faced by researchers investigating relationships between severity {{and duration of}} illness among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). (1) Linear regression techniques yield biased estimates when measures of severity are continous but range between and include limiting values such as 0 and 3. (2) Data from the same patient over time are typically pooled together with data from different patients {{at the same time}} and over time. Models are then used that do not account for the statistical problems that can result from pooling. (3) Persons with varying years of duration of disease are typically combined and analyzed without any special attention to cohort effects. Changes in severity over time for cohorts of patients with fewer than 10 years of duration may be different from changes in severity of patients with more than 20 years of duration from the onset of the disease. In this study, severity is measured by the 0 - 3 disability scale in the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Duration is measured by self-report of the onset of symptoms by subjects.

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the change}} in the causal effect of {{education}} on labor market earnings in the United States between 1979 and 2000. In absence of valid instrumental variables for schooling, a causal model for earnings and schooling that incorporates heterogeneity in absolute and comparative advantage across individuals is used to impose some structure on the observed relationship between schooling and earnings. A simple intuition arises from the model: if individuals with higher returns to schooling acquire more schooling, the relationship between log earnings and schooling will be convex in the population. Likewise, for a <b>fixed</b> <b>cohort</b> of individuals, the degree of convexity will rise over time if the causal return to education rises. Differences across cohorts in the mapping between schooling and ability will lead to permanent differences in the profiles of the earnings-schooling relationship. Changes in the observed relationship between schooling and earnings can therefore be decomposed into year-specific and cohort-specific factors corresponding to causal and confounding components. Using CPS data for cohorts of men born between 1930 and 1970, I find that the causal return to education increased by 30 % between 1979 and 2000, after controlling for the confounding effects of time-varying ability and comparative advantage biases across cohorts...|$|E

Estimates from a <b>cohort</b> <b>fixed</b> effects model {{are found to}} be sensitive to the choice of survey years. This is due to the mis-specification of the fixed effects model which is rejected when tested against a model allowing for separate year-since-migration effects by arrival cohort. The estimates from the more general model provide little evidence of higher receipt of these benefits, ceteris paribus, for more recent cohorts or that immigrants assimilate toward greater receipt of these benefits.

In the first part, we quantify these changes and describe differences in educational attainment in Taiwan across birth cohorts. In the second part, we use regression analysis to describe changes in Taiwan’s wage structure, decomposing the wage return to education into two components, a <b>fixed</b> birth <b>cohort</b> component and a variable time component. We find evidence for general equilibrium effects reducing the wage return to higher education for better-educated cohorts. In the third part, we present estimates of the elasticities of complementarity between skilled and unskilled labor in Taiwan and evidence that these elasticities have changed over the time period studied {{in step with the}} new technology. We conclude that both general equilibrium effects and structural changes in production are needed to account for the observed changes in Taiwan’s wage structure. ...|$|R

We estimate the relationship between the entry rate into self-employment and previous (long-term) unemployment on the basis of pseudo-panel data for Germany in the period 1996 - 2002. The estimation method accounts for <b>cohort</b> <b>fixed</b> effects and measurement errors induced by the pseudo panel structure. We find that previous (long-term) unemployment significantly increases entry rates into self-employment for both men and women. These effects are quantitatively important, both in absolute terms and compared to other potential determinants of self-employment transitions, such as age, the level of vocational qualification and certain household characteristics. self-employment, entrepreneurship, entry rate, start-ups, unemployment, pseudo-panel, age and cohort effects...|$|R
