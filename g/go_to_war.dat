5|$|With the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated, {{other nations}} were {{encouraged}} to join the Second Coalition and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with France. Portugal, the Kingdom of Naples, the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean. The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the Adriatic Sea while the Portuguese joined the Siege of Malta, which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in Naples. Nelson, who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile, became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged King Ferdinand to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with France, resulting {{in the loss of}} his mainland kingdom. In the Western Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent, who commanded the Mediterranean fleet from off Cadiz, deployed forces against Menorca, rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council {{responsible}} for decisionmaking in the Austrian armed forces.

5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were {{kept in the dark}} about Egyptian intentions to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> Instead, on October 2, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, it became clear to the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was complete. This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E

At first, Éowyn refused his advances, only desiring to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> to find honour in death. But soon Éowyn realized that she had come to love him in return.|$|E

5|$|An origin myth {{from the}} Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, {{describes}} how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood {{in order to save}} drowning people. He {{fell in love with a}} woman he thus saved, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.|$|E

Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular at court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms {{on the eve of}} the war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies, rather than three battalions of six companies. Austrian cavalry was considered the best in Europe, and one of the best of the time anywhere.|$|E

From a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was stolen and hidden inside the statue.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact {{stipulated that}} any country, with the {{exception}} of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E

Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise {{to wait for the}} anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} Czech {{government}} and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid-1938. They achieved little result; Sudeten leader Konrad Henlein was under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement. On 3 August, Walter Runciman (by now Lord Runciman) travelled to Prague as a mediator sent by the British government. Over the next two weeks, Runciman met separately with Henlein, the Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš and other leaders, but made no progress. On 30 August Chamberlain met his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing—with only First Lord of the Admiralty Duff Cooper dissenting against Chamberlain's policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions, {{on the ground that}} Britain was then in no position to back up any threat to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when {{people living in the}} area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> This is {{because they believe that}} taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
5|$|While The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig {{appears to}} be the quintessential Ulster Cycle story in theme and narrative, there are certain unusual {{elements}} of the extant forms which suggest it may have a more satiric quality, parodying the heroic genre of the Ulster Cycle. The eponymous pig of Mac Da Thó may be mythic in origin, but its highly exaggerated size may also be satiric. In the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the Ulaid and Connachta <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> over a mythic best, the finest bull in Ireland, whereas here they come to blows over a dog.|$|E
