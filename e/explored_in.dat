5|$|The Japanese paper-folding art of origami {{has been}} {{reworked}} mathematically by Tomoko Fusé using modules, congruent {{pieces of paper}} such as squares, and making them into polyhedra or tilings. Paper-folding was used in 1893 by T. Sundara Rao in his Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding to demonstrate geometrical proofs. The mathematics of paper folding has been <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> Maekawa's theorem, Kawasaki's theorem, and the Huzita–Hatori axioms.|$|E

5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} games, God of War: Ascension {{is set in}} an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original God of War (2005); Chains of Olympus (2008) takes place some time between Ascension and God of War. The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth week) and past (the preceding three weeks), while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of the Damned and some real-world locations—including the village Kirra, the city Delphi, and the island Delos—are <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Russian paleontologists began {{excavating}} Psittacosaurus {{remains at}} a locality {{near the village}} of Shestakovo in the oblast of Kemerovo in Siberia. Two other nearby localities were <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s, one of which produced several complete skeletons. This species was named P. sibiricus in 2000 in a scientific paper written by five Russian paleontologists, but credit for the name is officially given to two of those authors, Alexei Voronkevich and Alexander Averianov. The remains were not completely described until 2006. Two nearly complete, articulated skeletons and a variety of disarticulated material from other individuals of all ages are known from the Ilek Formation of Siberia, which ranges from the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E
5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, Shulgin was {{introduced}} to MDMA by {{a student in the}} medicinal chemistry group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1912 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never <b>explored</b> <b>in</b> its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had had four children.|$|E
