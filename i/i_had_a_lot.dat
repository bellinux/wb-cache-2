5|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{theories}} I {{was working with}} when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't {{want to have a}} scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E

I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. And I want to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E

I was feeling very dizzy, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just broke my heart. So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2014, Gaga {{revealed}} on The Howard Stern Show {{that she}} was raped at age 19 by a producer twenty years older than her. During her conversation with Stern, the singer recalled, [...] "I went through some horrific things. I'm able to laugh now because I've gone {{through a lot of}} mental, physical and emotional therapy [...] I wasn't even willing to admit that anything had even happened [...] I saw him one time in a store, and I was paralyzed by fear." [...] She confirmed that the incident further inspired [...] "Swine", saying, [...] "I wrote a song called 'Swine'; the song is about rape. The song is about demoralization. The song is about rage and fury and passion, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of pain that I wanted to release." ...|$|E
500|$|As a small child, Minaj and {{a sibling}} {{lived with her}} {{grandmother}} in Saint James. Her mother, who had moved to The Bronx, New York to attend Monroe College, brought the family to Queens, New York, when Minaj was 5. By then the family had a house on West 147th Street. Minaj recalled, [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household." [...] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to LaGuardia High School in Manhattan, which focuses on visual and performing arts. After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play In Case You Forget in 2001. At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, {{she worked as a}} waitress at Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers. She said she was fired from [...] "at least fifteen jobs" [...] for similar reasons. She also worked as an administrative assistant, in customer service and as an office manager for a Wall Street business.|$|E
500|$|On 24 August 1992, Mexican {{newspaper}} El Siglo de Torreón {{reported that}} Miguel had begun collaborating with David Foster and Juan Carlos Calderón on some compositions, along with English-speaking composers, and selecting cover versions for the album. He also received assistance from Cuban composer Rudy Pérez and Dominican singer-songwriter Juan Luis Guerra with the songwriting. Recording began on 4 July 1992. Miguel had difficulty finding a suitable producer for the record; he initially worked with American audio engineer Bruce Swedien, {{but decided to}} re-record the whole album after disagreements with Swedien's direction. Unable to find a producer, he decided to co-produce the album with his long-time associate Kiko Cibrian. Recording the album took almost a year and was affected by several complications, including its high budget of over US$1.5 million, his father's death, and an appendectomy. Miguel announced that {{the name of the}} album would be Aries during a presentation at the 1993 Festival Acapulco. About the naming of the album he said, [...] "This album expresses my personal self. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to do. I produced everything and wanted {{to have a lot of}} fun, take what I like, and what better than the zodiacal sign representing what one is." ...|$|E

500|$|The ancient {{language}} {{used by the}} elves in Eragon is based [...] "almost entirely" [...] on Old Norse, German, Anglo Saxon, and Russian myth. Paolini commented: [...] " [...] did a god-awful amount of research into the subject when I was composing it. I found that it gave the world a much richer feel, a much older feel, using these words that had been around for centuries and centuries. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun with that." [...] Picking the right names for the characters and places was a process that could take [...] "days, weeks, or even years". Paolini said: [...] "if I have difficulty choosing the correct moniker, I use a placeholder name until a replacement suggests itself." [...] He added that he was [...] "really lucky" [...] with the name Eragon, [...] "because it's just dragon with one letter changed." [...] Also, Paolini commented that he thought of both parts of the name [...] "Eragon" [...] - [...] "era" [...] and [...] "gone" [...] - as if the name itself changes the era in which the character lives. [...] He thought the name fit the book perfectly, {{but some of the}} other names caused him [...] "real headaches".|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Burton {{regularly}} {{thought about}} the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights. He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director. Disney {{was looking forward to}} Nightmare [...] "to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit." [...] Nightmare marked Burton's third film in a row to have a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns and {{he did not want to}} be involved with [...] "the painstakingly slow process of stop motion". To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs. Elfman found writing Nightmares eleven songs as [...] "one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in common with Jack Skellington." [...] Caroline Thompson still had yet to be hired to write the screenplay. With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, [...] "there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually." ...|$|E
500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
5000|$|Director Carlos Saldanha {{has kept}} the {{possibility}} for a Rio 3 open. He has stated, [...] "Of course, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stories to tell, so we're to prepare for it." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked by}} Ryan Seacrest in 2013 the {{favourite}} people he's produced for he said [...] "Definitely The Saturdays. Without a doubt. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun {{working with them}} and was really impressed with their voices. They were very down to earth and I like that a lot in an artist. I wish them all the best in America and think they could end up as big as The Spice Girls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Winter {{was born}} to John Winter II and Edwina Winter on December 28, 1946, in Beaumont, Texas. Both he {{and his older brother}} Johnny were born with albinism, and both were {{required}} to take special education classes in high school. Winter states, [...] "In school <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of friends. I wore a lot of white shirts to, like, blend in I guess. No one really gave me a hard time about being albino or taking special education classes. Then again, I wasn't really popular." ...|$|E

5000|$|David also {{commented that}} the album title could be looked at in two {{different}} ways: [...] "On the one hand, it's coming across like I'm arrogant. On the other hand, it's saying <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more composure on the album."" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, Science Fiction Chronicles Don D'Ammassa {{reviewed}} {{the novel as}} [...] "Okay, these aren't great art, but for all its simple mindedness, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more fun in this universe than in the one created by Star Trek." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Most agents {{would avoid}} {{me because they}} knew what I wanted to do—what agent wants to book their big client in a no pay, $800-a-day, two-day shoot?" [...] he said. [...] "The truth is, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of friends who were in this movie. And if they didn't say yes, this movie wouldn't have gotten made." [...] In the end, most of the actors {{were willing to take}} part because the film only {{required}} a few days of their time and often allowed them to play a character outside of their wheelhouse.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian comedian Rick Miller first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of blending The Simpsons and Shakespeare in 1994. At the time, Miller was performing in a production of Macbeth, playing the minor role of Murderer No. 2. He said, [...] "That's a small role, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time to sit backstage and concoct ideas, one of which was to make fun of our production. By then, The Simpsons had become a big part of pop culture, so I decided to do the voices of those cartoon characters in my mangled version of the play." [...] He performed a skit at that night's closing party, which was well received.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2016 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty {{with the future}} of No Doubt. [...] "I don't know what's {{going to happen with}} No Doubt. When Tony [...] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [...] And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all waited that long to put something out and it didn't get heard." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2017, Moore {{announced}} her intentions {{to return to}} music with People, stating: [...] "I {{want to return to}} music. ... <b>I</b> don’t <b>have</b> <b>a</b> record label, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of music written.

2500|$|.....<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{time for}} Norling as an {{international}} referee. The Welshman and New Zealander David Bishop {{would be the best}} I've seen during my years of Test match rugby. And the common factor linking Norling and Bishop was that both played the advantage rule very well, they had a real empathy for the game and its players, and they seemed to enjoy letting the game flow. Rarely could either official be accused of whistling for a stoppage prematurely... Norling {{was also one of the}} more flamboyant referees. The crowd always knew when he was out there. At the same time, he was a top drawer referee and perhaps could get away with a bit of the showmanship because his decisions were generally spot-on.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{break-up}} of Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler has shown {{no interest in}} reforming the band and {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Oh, I don't know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again," [...] and telling reporters that [...] "I would only do that for a charity. I'm glad I've experienced it all – <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun with it – but I like things the way they are." [...] However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, and Danny Cummings has frequently contributed, notably to three of Knopfler's most recent solo album releases All the Roadrunning (with Emmylou Harris), Kill to Get Crimson and Get Lucky.|$|E
2500|$|Bassist Tony Lombardo, some 20 {{years his}} bandmates' senior, wrote songs expressing {{his desire for}} {{stability}} and individuality. [...] "I'm Not a Punk" [...] reflected his disinterest in {{being part of the}} anarchic, destructive aspect of the punk scene: [...] "That whole thing turned me off. I just wanted to play the music and do it as best I could and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun doing that [...] It's like 'I'm Not a Punk'. I want to be my own person." [...] "Suburban Home" [...] was quite literal, expressing his desire for [...] "a house just like mom and dad's": [...] "I definitely wanted a home. I couldn't live in a place where all the people are cool. I don't like dysfunctionality. I have an abhorrence of dysfunctionality because my mother was an alcoholic, my parents are divorced, I just don't need that assault on my emotions and psyche." ...|$|E
