5|$|Development of an Ant-Man film {{began as}} early as the late 1980s, when Ant-Man co-creator Stan Lee pitched the idea to New World Pictures, Marvel Comics' parent company at the time.

5|$|Monk's court {{soon became}} a {{gathering}} place, where Zionsville <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> kids from the surrounding areas would hold pickup games.

40|$|We {{examined}} spindle morphology and chromosome alignment in vertebrate cells after simultaneous perturbation of the chromokinesin <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> either NuMA, CENP-E, or HSET. Spindle morphology and chromosome alignment after simultaneous perturbation of <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> either HSET or CENP-E were {{no different}} from when either HSET or CENP-E was perturbed alone. However, short bipolar spindles with organized poles formed after perturbation of both <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA {{in stark contrast to}} splayed spindle poles observed after perturbation of NuMA alone. Spindles were disorganized if <b>Kid,</b> NuMA, <b>and</b> HSET were perturbed, indicating that HSET is sufficient for spindle organization in the absence of <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA function. In addition, chromosomes failed to align efficiently at the spindle equator after simultaneous perturbation of <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA despite appropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions that generated chromosome movement at normal velocities. These data indicate that a functional relationship between the chromokinesin <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> the spindle pole organizing protein NuMA influences spindle morphology, and we propose that this occurs because NuMA forms functional linkages between kinetochore and nonkinetochore microtubules at spindle poles. In addition, these data show that both <b>Kid</b> <b>and</b> NuMA contribute to chromosome alignment in mammalian cells...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether two low stage {{offers for}} depression, Kurs iDepresjonsmestring (<b>KiD)</b> <b>and</b> Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), can reducesick leave rates.

5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy <b>Kids</b> <b>and</b> Figure It Out. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E

5|$|Before its UK debut, Thunderbirds was {{distributed}} to 30 other countries including the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. Pre-sales revenue totalled £350,000 (approximately £ million today). In the year following the series' first appearance, {{the number of}} countries increased to 66. In Japan, where it was first broadcast by NHK, Thunderbirds attracted a sizeable fan following and influenced series such as Ultraman, Mighty Jack, Himitsu Sentai Gorenger, Super Rescue Solbrain and Neon Genesis Evangelion. In the US, the 25-minute format entered first-run syndication, to modest success, in 1968. Other overseas broadcasters have included TechTV and Family Room HD (US), BBC <b>Kids</b> <b>and</b> YTV (Canada), Nine Network and Foxtel (Australia), TVNZ (in the 1980s) and later TV3 (New Zealand), MediaCorp TV12 Kids Central (Singapore) and RTÉ Two (Republic of Ireland).|$|E

Tasmanian Digital Television, affiliated to Network Ten, was initially available only in Hobart, before expanding to Launceston and, by early 2009, the remainder of the state. The introduction of this fifth channel resulted in significantly higher digital television takeup in Tasmania than other parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian <b>kids,</b> <b>and</b> the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E

5|$|Cristina is re-hired and Owen {{asks for}} a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile.

5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for {{products}} such as the Cabbage Patch <b>Kids</b> <b>and</b> Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E
