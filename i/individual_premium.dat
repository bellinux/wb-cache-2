As far as we know, Doherty-Garven (1986) appears to be the only model that incorporates all the three components. Their model provides a solution for the “fair ” rate of return of an insurer or the aggregate premium of an insurer. Their study has some important implications in terms of “excessiveness ” and “adequacy ” of the aggregate premium. In this paper, we developed a pricing model with which a premium can be assigned to an insurance contract.

40|$|Objective: The main {{objective}} was to assess how group premiums can help poor people in the informal economy prepay for health care services. Methods: A comparative approach was adopted to study four groups of informal economy operators (cobblers, welders, carpenters, small scale market retailers) focusing on a method of prepayment which could help them access health care services. Two groups {{with a total of}} 714 operators were organized to prepay for health care services through a group premium, while the other two groups with a total of 702 operators were not organized to prepay through this approach. They prepaid through <b>individual</b> <b>premium,</b> each operator paying from his or her sources. Data on the four groups which lived in the same city was collected through a questionnaire and focus group discussions. Data collected was focused on health problems, health seeking behaviour and payment for health care services. Training of all the groups on prepaid health care financing based on individual based premium payment and group based premium payment was done. Groups were then free to choose which method to use in prepaying for health care. Prepayment through the two methods was then observed over a period of three years. Trends of membership attrition and retention were documented for both approaches. Results: Data collected showed that the four groups were similar in many respects. These similarities included levels of education, housing, and social services such as water supplies, health problems, family size and health seeking behaviour. At the end of a period of three years 76 % of the members from the two groups who chose group premium payment were still members of the prepayment health scheme and were receiving health care. For the two groups which opted for <b>individual</b> <b>premium</b> payment only 15 % of their members were still receiving health care services at the end of three years. Conclusion: Group premium is a useful tool in improving accessibility to health care services in the poorer segments of the population especially the informal economy operatorsUMASID...|$|E

40|$|In {{determining}} premiums in {{non-life insurance}} {{there is no}} universal method. In this paper is applied Bühlmann-Straub model for determining credible premium in third-party vehicle insurance. Loss ratio is the ratio of total losses incurred in claims divided by the total premiums earned. This is an indicator of how well an insurance company is doing. This ratio reflects if companies are collecting premiums higher than the amount paid in claims {{or if it is}} not collecting enough premiums to cover claims. Loss ratios for vehicle insurance usually range from 40 % to 60 %. Companies that have high loss claims may be experiencing financial trouble. The overall loss ratio in the Slovak market of third-party vehicle insurance in 2011 increased slightly to 57. 13 %. High loss ratio showed AXA – 83. 21 %, Generali – 69. 41 % and KOOPERATIVA VIG – 65. 69 %. These three together have insurance in 2011, a significant proportion of insurance in the Slovak Republic, to 45. 06 %. These facts are the reason why we decided to assess the adequacy of the insurance premium in seven companies which in 2011 had a market share of 94. 35 % in the Slovak insurance market. Credible premium is determined as a linear combination of premiums, determined from the data on their own risk and premium determined on the basis of information from similar risks. Credible premium is a compromise between the <b>individual</b> <b>premium,</b> i. e. premium determined solely from its own data on the risk premium and the collective, determined from data on collective risk.

The benefit package included free access to all first line health care services (except for a small co-payment), free paediatric care, free emergency surgical care and free obstetric care at the district hospital. Also included {{were part of the}} cost of emergency transport to the hospital. In 1998, the MHO covered 8 % of the target population, but, by 1999, the subscription rate had dropped to about 6 %. In March 2000, focus groups were held with members and non-members of the scheme to find out why subscription rates were so low. The research indicated that a failure to understand the scheme does not explain these low rates. On the contrary, the great majority of research subjects, members and non-members alike, acquired a very accurate understanding of the concepts and principles underlying health insurance. They value the system's re-distributive effects, which goes beyond household, next of kin or village.

The main contribution of this paper is the use of the NPML estimator for the construction of confidence intervals for the premium rates derived by updating the posterior mean claim frequency.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} wage growth and labour mobility on a panel of Italian dependent workers observed between 1986 and 1991. We use an employer-employee linked panel of 30167 workers, built from Italian Social Security (INPS) administrative sources. In order to investigate the impact of individual vs. firm characteristics on wage dynamics, we decompose individual wage change 1986 - 91 in two parts: the mean wage growth observed across firms of origin and firms of destination (the two coincide for the stayers), and the wage premium gained over the mean wage change by movers attributable to their own personal characteristics. Our main findings may be summarized as follows: 1 In general, movers do better than stayers at young age (20 - 30), but the difference tends to vanish as age progresses; 2 mover-stayer differentials are larger among white-collars than blue-collars, {{in line with the}} higher variance of earnings of the former; 3 total wage growth is driven by the wage - firm size positive correlation only for the blue-collars: job-switches from small to large firms often yield substantial pay improvements relative to stayers; job switches from large to small size often end up in wage cuts. For the white-collars, however, job changes in either direction tend to improve onÈs position relative to stayers; 4 there is a quasi-reverse pattern on the <b>individual</b> <b>premiums</b> of the blue-collars (switches from small to large carry negative premiums, from large to small positive). This {{is likely to be a}} consequence of firm-based wage policies, the impact of which by far exceeds that attributable to individual characteristics; 5 personal characteristics contribute, instead, to determine the white-collars' <b>individual</b> <b>premiums.</b> Job changes of adult and mature workers, presumably endowed with skills and experience, result in sizeable wage gains; 6 all workers employed at firms that either close down or go through drastic employment cuts during the observation period suffer wage losses; 7 prolonged unemployment spells have somewhat of a negative impact on the wage growth of white-collar employees (up to 5 p. p.), almost none on the blue-collars; 8 a certain amount of job-switching has a positive effect on the wage growth of the younger white-collars. If job changes become too frequent, however, its positive impact vanishes; 9 we find a rather strong effect of initial conditions on the wage profile of blue-collar employees, and almost none on the white-collars'; 10 there is evidence of a trade-off between job security and pay in concomitance with a job-to-job switch. When adverse shocks are in sight - as was the beginning of the Nineties - it is reasonable that people may leave their current position, if it is perceived at risk, giving up some pay for longer expected tenure, or may choose to accept a higher pay with a less reliable (i. e. more exposed to short-term fluctuations) employer.
