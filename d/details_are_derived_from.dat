Wheresas oxygen-atom transfer prevails in {{the reaction of the}} oxide complex [OTiH] + with CO 2, generating [OTi(OH) ] + under the elimination of CO, insertion of CO 2 into the metal-hydrogen bond of the cyclopentadienyl complex, [Cp 2 TiH] +, gives rise to the formate complex [Cp 2 Ti(O 2 CH) ] +. DFT-based methods were employed to understand how the ligand controls the observed variation in reactivity toward CO 2. Insertion of CO 2 into the Ti-H bond constitutes the initial step for the reaction of both [Cp 2 TiH] + and [OTiH] +, thus generating formate complexes as intermediates. In contrast to [Cp 2 Ti(O 2 CH) ] + which is kinetically stable, facile decarbonylation of [OTi(O 2 CH) ] + results in the hydroxo complex [OTi(OH) ] +. The longer lifetime of [Cp 2 Ti(O 2 CH) ] + allows for secondary reactions with background water, as a result of which, [Cp 2 Ti(OH) ] + is formed. Further, computational studies reveal a good linear correlation between the hydride affinity of [LTi] 2 + and the barrier for CO 2 insertion into various [LTiH] + complexes. Understanding the intrinsic ligand effects may provide insight into the selective activation of CO 2...|$|E

Other well-established spectroscopic techniques in the visible range, like Colorimetry and Integrating Sphere Photometry are surely well suited to the same aim: Colorimetry is helpful and easy in interpretation of colour changes, while a contact spectrophotometer gives surely the most reliable quantitative spectral measurements. Nevertheless, quantitative Image Spectroscopy has some peculiar advantages in the conservation field: 	it performs measurements on each pixel of the whole acquired image and not on sampling points; 	it requires no contact with the investigated surface and, as a last relevant issue, 	spectral data analysed by multivariate techniques are much more sensitive to faint alterations than three-coordinate colorimetry is.

Results: One thousand thirty-seven surveys were mailed to New South Wales-based chiropractors, with 192 (21 %) returning a completed survey. The prevalence of shoulder pain symptoms as reported by the practitioners was 12 % of the total weekly patients, with the major cause of symptoms related to overuse (32 %). The most prevalent working diagnosis of shoulder pain was shoulder impingement syndrome (13 %), followed by impingement syndrome with rotator cuff tendinosis (17 %), impingement syndrome without rotator cuff tendinosis (14 %), and chiropractic shoulder subluxation (12 %). Shoulder pain is managed with a combination of manipulation, mainly diversified technique (81 %), peripheral joint manipulation (82 %), and various soft tissue strategies used by 92 % of practitioners. Rehabilitation strategies were also used by 89 % of practitioners with a main emphasis placed on rotator cuff strengthening. Conclusion: The results suggest a moderate prevalence of shoulder pain in clinical practice with the most prevalent structure involved being the rotator cuff tendon.

In addition, a few special cases are formulated at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. Numerical and empirical results suggest that these special cases perform satisfactorily and aggregate to realistic macroscopic behavior. By ensuring model coupling and modeling consistency, the proposed approach is able to establish the theoretical foundation for traffic modeling and simulation at multiple scales seamlessly within a single system...|$|R

40|$|It is {{difficult}} and frustrating to create complex organic shapes using the current set of computer graphic programs. One reason is because the geometry of nature {{is different from that}} of our tools. Its self-similarity and fine <b>detail</b> <b>are</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> growth processes that are very different from the working process imposed by drawing programs. This mismatch makesit difficult to create natural looking artifacts. Drawing programs provide a palette of shapes that may be manipulated in a variety ways, but the palette is limited and based on a cold Euclidean geometry. Clouds, rivers, and rocks are not lines or circles. Paint programs provide interesting filters and effects, but require great skill and effort. Always, the <b>details</b> must <b>be</b> arduously managed by the artist. This limits the artist's expressive power. Fractals have stunning visual richness, but the artist's techniques are limited to those of choosing colours and searching the fractal space. Genetic algorithms provide a powerful means for exploring a space of variations, but the artist's skill is limited by the very difficult ability to arrive at the correct fitness function. It is hard to get the picture you wanted. Ideally, the artist should have macroscopic control over the creation while leaving the computer to manage the microscopic details. For the result to feel organic, the <b>details</b> should <b>be</b> rich, consistent and varied, cohesive but not repetitious. For the results to be reproducible, the system should be deterministic. For it to be expressive there should be a cause-effect relationship between the actions in the program and change in the resulting picture. Finally, it would be interesting if the way we drew was more closely related to the way things grew. We present a simple drawing program which provides this mixture of macroscopic control with free microscopic detail. Through use of an accretion growth model, the artist controls large scale structure while varied details emerge naturally from senstive dependence in the system. Its algorithms are simple and deterministic, so its results are predictable and reproducible. The overall resulting structure can be anticipated, but it can also surprise. Despite its simplicity, it has been used to generate a surprisingly rich assortment of complex organic looking pictures. ...|$|R
