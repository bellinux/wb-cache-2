In addition to gender and generation, Iroquois kinship also distinguishes 'same-sex' and 'cross-sex' parental siblings: the brothers of <b>Ego's</b> (the subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) father, and {{the sisters of}} <b>Ego's</b> mother, are referred to by the same parental kinship terms used for <b>Ego's</b> Father and Mother. The sisters of <b>Ego's</b> father, and the brothers of <b>Ego's</b> mother, on the other hand, are referred to by non-parental kinship terms, commonly translated into English as [...] "Aunt" [...] and [...] "Uncle".|$|R

40|$|The Spitzer GLIMPSE survey has {{revealed}} {{a number of}} "Extended Green Objects" (<b>EGOs)</b> that display extended emission at 4. 5 Î¼m. These <b>EGOs</b> are potential candidates for high-mass protostellar outflows. We used high-resolution (< 1 â�³) H 2 1 - 0 S(1) line, K-, and H-band images from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope to study 34 <b>EGOs</b> to investigate their nature. We found that 12 <b>EGOs</b> exhibit H 2 outflows (two with chains of H 2 knotty structures, five with extended H 2 bipolar structures, three with extended H 2 lobes, and two with pairs of H 2 knots). Of the 12 <b>EGOs</b> with H 2 outflows, three exhibit similar morphologies between the 4. 5 Î¼m and H 2 emission. However, the remaining nine <b>EGOs</b> show that the H 2 features are more extended than the continuum features, and the H 2 emission is seldom associated with continuum emission. Furthermore, the morphologies of the near-infrared continuum and 4. 5 Î¼m emission are similar {{to each other for}} those <b>EGOs</b> with K-band emission, implying that {{at least part of the}} IRAC-band continuum emission of <b>EGOs</b> comes from scattered light from the embedded young stellar objects.

40|$|We have {{produced}} a catalog containing 98 newly identified massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates associated with ongoing outflows (known as extended green objects, or <b>EGOs).</b> These have been identified from the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) II data set and our new identifications {{increase the number of}} known <b>EGOs</b> to similar to 400 in our Galaxy, adding to the similar to 300 previously identified <b>EGOs</b> reported by Cyganowski et al. from the GLIMPSE I survey. The high detection rate (similar to 70 %) of 95 GHz class I methanol masers achieved in a survey toward 57 of these new <b>EGOs</b> with the Mopra 22 m radio telescope demonstrates that the new <b>EGOs</b> are associated with outflows. Investigations of the mid-infrared properties and physical associations with other star formation tracers (e. g., infrared dark clouds, class I and II methanol masers, and millimeter Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey sources) reveal that the newly identified <b>EGOs</b> are very similar in nature to those in the sample of Cyganowski et al. All of the observational evidence supports the hypothesis that <b>EGOs</b> correspond to MYSOs at the earliest evolutionary stage, with ongoing outflow activity, and active rapid accretion...|$|R

The replication data include 4 files: 1. EgoAlterProfiles (<b>egos</b> are randomly selected Twitter users; alters are the followers and followees of the <b>egos)</b> 2.
