40|$|Oxygen {{was added}} at 820 and 990 C at an oxygen {{pressure}} of about. 0003 torr. The technique permitted predetermined and reproducible oxygen doping of the tantalum alloy (T- 111). Based on the temperature dependency of the doping reaction, {{it was concluded}} that the initial rates of oxygen pickup are probably controlled by solution of oxygen into the T- 111 lattice. Although <b>hafnium</b> <b>oxides</b> are more stable than those of tantalum or tungsten, analyses of extracted residues indicate that the tantalum and tungsten oxides predominate in the as-doped specimens, presumably because of the higher concentrations of tantalum and tungsten in the alloy. However, high-temperature annealing promotes gettering of dissolved oxygen and oxygen from other <b>oxides</b> to form <b>hafnium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Small amounts of tantalum and tungsten oxides were still present after high temperature annealing.

These alloys were subjected to thermogravimetry test in air at 1, 200 A degrees C for 46 h. Such exposure at this high temperature did not significantly modify the characteristics of the bulk HfC carbides. In contrast the presence of hafnium led to non-parabolic oxidation kinetics and fast mass gain rates, by comparison with similar Hf-free ternary alloys. The scales formed all over the samples' surfaces were never composed exclusively of chromia and iron oxides or (iron, chromium) oxides were present in significant quantities. Some particles of <b>hafnium</b> <b>oxides</b> were also present in the external scales.

40|$|<b>Hafnium</b> based <b>oxides</b> and silicates are {{promising}} high-κ dielectrics to replace SiO₂ as gate material for state-of-the-art semiconductor devices. However, integrating these new high-κ materials into the existing {{complementary metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) process remains a challenge. One particular area of concern {{is the use of}} large amounts of HF during wet etching of <b>hafnium</b> based <b>oxides</b> and silicates. The patterning of thin films of these materials is accomplished by wet etching in HF solutions. The use of HF allows dissolution of hafnium as an anionic fluoride complex. Etch selectivity with respect to SiO₂ is achieved by appropriately diluting the solutions and using slightly elevated temperatures. From an ESH point of view, it would be beneficial to develop methods which would lower the use of HF. The first objective {{of this study is to}} find new chemistries and developments of new wet etch methods to reduce fluoride consumption during wet etching of hafnium based high-κ materials. Another related issue with major environmental impact is the usage of large amounts of rinsing water for removal of HF in post-etch cleaning step. Both of these require a better understanding of the HF interaction with the high-κ surface during the etching, cleaning, and rinsing processes. During the rinse, the cleaning chemical is removed from the wafers. Ensuring optimal resource usage and cycle time during the rinse requires a sound understanding and quantitative description of the transport effects that dominate the removal rate of the cleaning chemicals from the surfaces. Multiple processes, such as desorption and re-adsorption, diffusion, migration and convection, all factor into the removal rate of the cleaning chemical during the rinse. Any of these processes can be the removal rate limiting process, the bottleneck of the rinse. In fact, the process limiting the removal rate generally changes as the rinse progresses, offering the opportunity to save resources. The second objective of this study is to develop new rinse methods to reduce water and energy usage during rinsing and cleaning of hafnium based high-κ materials in single wafer-cleaning tools. It is necessary to have a metrology method which can study the effect of all process parameters that affect the rinsing by knowing surface concentration of contaminants in patterned <b>hafnium</b> based <b>oxides</b> and silicate wafers. This has been achieved by the introduction of a metrology method at The University of Arizona which monitors the transport of contaminant concentrations inside micro- and nano- structures. This is the only metrology which will be able to provide surface concentration of contaminants inside <b>hafnium</b> based <b>oxides</b> and silicate micro-structures while the rinsing process is taking place.

50|$|Doped {{polysilicon}} was preferred earlier as gate {{material in}} MOS devices.

Also at the interface with gate dielectric, Polysilicon forms an SiOx layer. Moreover, there remains a high probability for Fermi level pinning to occur. So the effect with doped poly is an undesired reduction of threshold voltage that wasn't taken into account during circuit simulation. In order to avoid this kind of variation in vth of the MOSFET, at present metal gate is preferred over Polysilicon.|$|E

The variations in the k-values up to megahertz frequencies for both CexHf 1 −xO 2 and LaxZr 1 −xO 2 are simulated based on the Curie-von Schweidler (CS) or Havriliak-Negami (HN) relationships. Concerning the lightly doped CexHf 1 −xO 2 and LaxZr 1 −xO 2, the data extracted are best modeled by the HN law, while LaxZr 1 −xO 2 with doping level from x= 0. 22 to 0. 63 are best modelled based on the CS law...|$|R
40|$|The XPS {{spectra of}} {{thermally}} grown oxide layers on Si, Al, W and Hf substrates {{have been recorded}} while the samples were subjected to external d. c. voltage bias.

These bias induced shifts are attributed to differential charging between the oxide layer and the substrate, which in turn is postulated {{to be related to the}} capacitance and inversely to the dielectric constant of the oxide layer. Accordingly, silicon dioxide with the smallest dielectric constant undergoes the largest differential charging, aluminium oxide is in the middle and no appreciable charging can be induced in the high-k tungsten and <b>hafnium</b> <b>oxides,</b> all of which are ∼ 6 nm thick.

5000|$|The term {{is often}} used when {{describing}} field effect transistors which rely on an electrically insulating pad of material between a gate and a doped semiconducting region. Device performance has typically been improved by reducing the thickness of a silicon oxide insulating pad. As the thickness approached 5-10 nm, leakage became a problem and alternate materials were necessary to increase the thickness while retaining the switching speed. Materials having larger dielectric constants enable thicker films {{to be used for}} this purpose while retaining fast reaction of the transistor. For example, a high-k material with dielectric constant of 39 (compared to 3.9 for silicon oxide) can be made ten times thicker than silicon oxide which helps to reduce the leakage of electrons across the dielectric pad, while achieving the same capacitance.
