40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} Tolman <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> for P-donor and other ligands in accounting quantitatively for steric effects {{in a wide}} variety of physicochemical processes is contrasted with the variability of <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> obtained from crystallographic studies. It is maintained that the latter are not relevant in describing steric effects for reactions in solution. Problems with <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> for ligands with conformational uncertainties are best dealt with by systematic measurement of deviations of data for those ligands from trends defined by ligands with less ambiguous <b>cone</b> <b>angles.</b> In fact a body of <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> for all ligands could be obtained by adjusting <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> to give perfect fits to individual steric profiles and then averaging the values obtained from a large number of such studies. In this way a set of <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> could be obtained that are divorced from their origins in Tolman’s models and justified solely by their successful quantitative application. Although it is tempting to relate these <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> to some Platonically perfect set, consideration given here to even a small number of sets of data of this sort suggests that there may always be some ligands with uncertain <b>cone</b> <b>angles.</b> Thus, a combination of eight sets of data that include P(OMe) 3 as a ligand suggests that it should have its Tolman <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> increased by ca. 108.

Seven different diphosphine (PP) ligands were selected to allow variation of the electronic properties of the ligand substituents, the <b>cone</b> <b>angles,</b> and the natural bite angles (NBAs). Oxidative addition of H_ 2 to [Rh(PP) _ 2]^+ complexes is favored by diphosphine ligands with large NBAs, small <b>cone</b> <b>angles,</b> and electron donating substituents, with the NBA being the dominant factor.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Historical PerspectivesSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe vast majority of past and proposed planetary atmospheric probes, landers and sample return vehicles have been blunted <b>cones</b> with <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> ranging from 45 to 70 deg. The objective here is to explain the large variation of <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> choices by examining the parameters that determine the configuration. The primary parameter is {{the manner in which the}} payload is housed, which depends on the atmospheric environment that it must withstand to meet the mission objectives. If the goal is to perform measurements under high pressures and temperatures, the instruments are housed in a spherical pressure vessel, typically. For a sphere the most compact, although not necessarily the lightest, blunted conical heat shield is a 45 deg cone. The blunted 45 deg cone also has the aerodynamic stability advantage of having a lift curve slope () that is essentially zero. If a pressure vessel is not needed, the use of larger <b>cone</b> <b>angles,</b> producing higher drag, will permit using lighter heat shields by reducing the length of the heating pulse and the heat conduction time. Although it is desirable to maximize the drag, aerodynamic stability and heat transfer considerations effectively limit the <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> to values that retain a straight shock, with the attendant thin shock layer, on the frustum. The thin shock layer requirement becomes especially important as a means of limiting radiative heating. However, when convective heating dominates, the largest practical <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> that comes close to meeting the above requirements is used, generally, The maximum <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> depends on the atmospheric composition. The more degrees of freedom that the dominant atmospheric gas component has, the larger the <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> that can support a straight shock on the frustum. For Earth return (diatomic gas), cones of at least 60 deg will retain straight shocks, while in the triatomic, CO 2, Martian atmosphere, the angle extends to at least 70 deg. Therefore, a <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> of 60 deg was used for the Stardust sample Earth return capsule. To achieve the maximum deceleration in the low-density Martian atmosphere, <b>cone</b> <b>angles</b> of 70 deg have been used.

The physical properties of five diesel/palm olein blends, namely B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and B 25 were measured and their spray characteristics were tested at injection pressures of 0. 8 MPa, 1. 0 MPa, and 1. 2 MPa under ambient atmospheric condition. The results were compared to spray established using petroleum diesel fuel. The SMD was measured using a phase Doppler analyzer (PDA).

At long standoff, a shaped charge {{with small}} <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> {{will produce a}} jet with a high tip {{velocity}} and a low tail velocity, causing it to stretch and break up, so its penetration ability into multilayer metal targets is very weak, while the penetration depth of explosively formed projectiles is too low to penetrate into multilayer metal targets.

The sensitivity of penetration effect into targets to the <b>cone</b> <b>angle</b> of the liner is investigated by experiment.
