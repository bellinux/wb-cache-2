5000|$|<b>Hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> - This {{is easily}} {{identifiable}} as a [...] "slump" [...] or {{decrease in the}} gamma zone. It is normal in infants. It is found in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. IgA deficiency occurs in 1:500 of the population, as is suggested by a pallor in the gamma zone. Of note, hypogammaglobulinema {{may be seen in}} the context of MGUS or multiple myeloma.|$|E
5000|$|The {{immunoglobulins}} or antibodies {{are generally}} the only proteins {{present in the}} normal gamma region. Of note, any protein migrating in the gamma region will be stained and appear on the gel, which may include protein contaminants, artifacts, or certain medications. Depending on whether an agarose or capillary method is used, interferences vary. Immunoglobulins consist of heavy chains, (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE and IgD) and light chains (kappa and lambda). A normal gamma zone should appear as a smooth 'blush,' or smear, with no asymmetry or sharp peaks. [...] The gamma globulins may be elevated (hypergammaglobulinemia), decreased (<b>hypogammaglobulinaemia),</b> or have an abnormal peak or peaks. Note that immunoglobulins may be {{also be found in}} other zones; IgA typically migrates in the beta-gamma zone, and in particular, pathogenenic immunoglobins may migrate anywhere, including the alpha regions.|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{acquired}} <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> {{usually have}} near normal numbers of B cells and normal T cell function. When <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> occurs {{in association with}} thymoma, then B cell numbers have been reported as low, and distinctive T cells are present which inhibit immunoglobulin production by normal cells. It {{has been suggested that}} these T cells are responsible for the observed <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> We report a patient with thymoma and <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> who lacks these distinctive suppressor cells and has normal B cell numbers. It is therefore incorrect to propose a single pathogenic mechanism for <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> in association with thymoma...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocytes from {{patients}} with primary immunodeficiency were tested histochemically for ecto 5 '-nucleotidase (5 'N) and alpha-naphthyl (non-specific) esterase. More {{than half the}} patients with 'common variable' <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> all those with X-linked <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> {{and some of those}} with selective IgA deficiency had a very low percentage of lymphocytes staining for 5 'N as compared to controls. A lack of B cells probably explains the finding in X-linked <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> but does not fully explain the results in the other groups. Most patients with 'common variable' <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> had a very low percentage of lymphocytes with granular staining for alpha-naphthyl (non-specific) esterase in contrast to normal numbers in those with X-linked <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and most of those with selective IgA deficiency. Granules containing non-specific esterase are characteristically found in 'mature' T lymphocytes. The enzyme abnormalities in the T and B cells of 'common variable' hypogammaglobulinaemic patients could be explained by 'immature' cell types...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} flora {{and some of}} its metabolites and enzymes in the stomach were compared in patients with achlorhydria, pernicious anaemia, and primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and in patients with dyspepsia with normal gastric acidity. Detailed analysis of the flora of the gastric juice and of the mucosa from the antrum, body, and fundus in six patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (mean pH 8. 2), seven patients with pernicious anaemia (mean pH 7. 3), and five patients with dyspepsia (mean pH 1. 9) yielded 22 different genera of bacteria, mainly from the patients with achlorhydria, the most common being streptococci, micrococci, staphylococci, veillonella, and lactobacilli. A similar flora was found associated with the mucosa at all three sites. Various metabolites were also looked for. beta Glucoronidase and C 14 lipase were found in patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> but not in those with pernicious anaemia or dyspepsia. Volatile fatty acids were not found. Relatively high concentrations of ethanol were found in the patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> compared with those with pernicious anaemia (p = 0. 02). Similar concentrations of dimethylamine were found in all three groups, but the concentrations of trimethylamine were much higher in patients with pernicious anaemia and <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> The high concentrations of some microbial enzymes and ethanol differentiated the group with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> from the rest, and these may bear some relation to the high incidence of gastric cancer in patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Circulating non-T {{lymphocytes}} {{had higher}} activities of 5 'nucleotidase (plasma membrane), neutral alpha-glucosidase (endoplasmic reticulum) and basal leucine amino-peptidase than did T lymphocytes. Activities of catalase (peroxisomes), malate dehydrogenase (mitochondria), lactate dehydrogenase (cytosol) and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase (lysosomes), {{were similar in}} the lymphocyte subfractions. Lymphocyte 5 'nucleotidase (plasma membrane) in patients with common variable <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> is much lower than normal. However, the decrease is less marked in X-linked <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> chronic lymphatic leukaemia or protein loosing enteropathy or in lymphocytes isolated from cord blood. Cells from patients with nephrotic syndrome had normal levels of 5 'nucleotidase. Other plasma membrane marker enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transferase, leucine amino-peptidase) were normal in lymphocytes from patients with common variable <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> There is a selective reduction of mitochondrial (malate dehydrogenase) and cytosolic (lactate dehydrogenase) enzymes, with normal activities of lysosomal, peroxisomal and endoplasmic reticulum enzymes, in patients with common variable <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> The lymphocyte subcellular organelles in normal subjects and patients with common variable <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> have similar properties on sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It is suggested that lymphocytes from patients with common variable <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> show a specific enzymopathy {{and that this is}} not simply a reflection of cellular immaturity...|$|E

40|$|Endocrinological and {{immunological}} {{studies were}} performed in five patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, two patients with sex-linked non-lymphopenic <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> one patient with sex-linked lymphopenic <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> and two patients with hypopituitary dwarfism. One of five patients with ataxia-telangiectasia had deficient growth hormone responses to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia but normal responses to arginine infusion. One pubertal ataxia-telangiectasia patient had increased gonadotropin secretion. Patients with hypopituitary dwarfism {{failed to respond}} to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and arginine infusion with increased growth hormone secretion. The patients with sex-linked lymphopenic and non-lymphopenic <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> had normal endocrine function. Immunological studies indicated defects in humoral and cellular immunity in the patients with ataxia-telangiectasia and sex-linked lymphopenic and non-lymphopenic <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> whereas normal immunological function was demonstrated in the patients with hypopituitary dwarfism. No relationship between endocrinological and immunological function could be demonstrated in these patients...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we present four {{patients}} with reversible <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> who required immunoglobulin substitution for several years. One patient had documented {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE), the other three patients had primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> without known cause. Whereas the cessation of azathioprine therapy {{may have contributed to}} the recovery in the patient with SLE, the restoration of the immunoglobulin production in the other three patients occurred spontaneously. All four patients were IgA deficient when the <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> was first detected and remained so after IgM and IgG production had recovered. Two of the three patients who also had anti-IgA antibodies started to produce anti-IgA again after stopping the immunoglobulin substitution. We conclude that recovery of <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> is possible but rare. When recovery is suspected, we recommend that immunoglobulin substitution is stopped and the antibody response to vaccination is tested...|$|E

40|$|Here we {{describe}} {{a case of}} a secondary bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), which was associated with repeated respiratory infections caused by carbamazepine (CBZ) - induced <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> A 49 -year-old woman had been treated with CBZ (400 mg/day). Two and a half years later, she developed of dyspnea with productive cough and high-grade fever. Chest roentgenogram and computed tomography showed bilateral infiltrates in lower lung fields. Her laboratory findings revealed severe <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> suggesting that an immune system disorder caused pulmonary infection. Histological examination by trans-bronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) demonstrated that many foamed alveolar macrophages were obstructing the alveolar ducts and adjacent alveoli, suggesting BOOP. After cessation of CBZ, the <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and chest roentgenogram findings markedly improved. The present case suggests that CBZ may have some adverse effects on the immune system and cause frequent airway infections, and that secondary BOOP could be induced by repeated infections caused by CBZ-induced <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Twelve patients, ten {{with common}} {{variable}} <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and two with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> secondary to {{chronic lymphocytic leukaemia}} (CLL), have been taught to self-infuse their intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Follow-up of these patients has shown that regular self-infusion at home is feasible and safe. There have been no anaphylactic or other serious reactions. Excellent patient compliance results from greater convenience and {{control over their own}} lives, in addition to time and money saved by the hospital...|$|E
40|$|Normal {{levels of}} {{lymphocyte}} cyclic AMP {{were found in}} fourteen of fifteen patients with primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> One patient with adult-onset <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> had low cyclic AMP levels with a very poor rise after prostaglandin E 1 stimulation. Five of the patients had severely depressed thymidine uptake by their phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes {{but there was no}} significant difference between their lymphocyte cyclic AMP levels and those of patients with normal lymphocyte responses. Removal of monocytes from concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocyte cultures from three of these patients did not affect the severe depression of leucine uptake. These findings indicate that the depression of lymphocyte response to mitogens seen in some patients with late-onset primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> is not due to raised levels of lymphocyte cyclic AMP; and not usually due to prostaglandins released by monocytes in the cultures...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis that stimulate human B {{lymphocyte}}s, but not T lymphocytes, {{were used}} to study the B lymphocyte function in patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> Lymphocytes from two patients with no circulating B cells were not stimulated to increased DNA synthesis by these bacterial mitogens. The lymphocytes of six patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and normal numbers of circulating B cells responded to the bacterial mitogens but in five patients the response was decreased in comparison with healthy controls...|$|E
40|$|A case is {{reported}} of primary late-onset <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> {{associated with a}} chronic seronegative, nonerosive arthritis, which was complicated by an episode of septic arthritis due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The patient had subcutaneous nodules which have not been regarded previously as {{a feature of the}} chronic arthritis associated with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> The diagnosis of septic arthritis was delayed for 2 months until synovial fluid was specifically cultured for mycoplasmas. This delay resulted in considerable joint destruction. The importance of searching for mycoplasmas in similar cases is emphasised...|$|E

Although both died of their encephalitis, {{the course of the}} brain disease in one of them may have been prolonged by treatment with specific antibody. These cases, together with another briefly mentioned case in an adult with congenital <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and echovirus infection, indicate that these patients are particularly susceptible to echoviruses...|$|E
40|$|The Kappa chain {{variable}} region subgroup {{restriction of}} immunoglobulin (Ig) from patients with acquired <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> agammaglobulinaemia and drug-induced immunosuppression has been studied. The percent of K chain-containing Ig which expresses the VK IIIb variable region sub-subgroup was determined with a previously characterized murine monoclonal anti-VK IIIb antibody. The VK IIIb sub-subgroup percent was increased in sera from patients with idiopathic <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> {{as well as}} patients who became hypogammaglobulinaemic following immunosuppression. The implications of the results to the regulation of the human immune and autoimmune response are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Antibody {{responses}} after immunisation with pneumococcal polysaccharide did not {{correlate with}} the severity {{and frequency of}} infections in 22 patients with severe <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> when these were measured by a Farr radioimmunoassay. Five "healthy" patients with severe <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> not only failed to make antipneumococcal polysaccharide antibody, when measured by radioimmunoassay, but also had very low or unrecordable antibody responses to Escherichia coli and failed to produce antibody when immunised with tetanus toxoid. Some of these subjects, however, did make small amounts of IgM antipneumococcal polysaccharide antibody when this was measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, while others retained some ability to produce IgM or IgA or both in their saliva. These findings show that the measurement of serum antibody responses after immunisation, {{with the possible exception}} of IgM antibodies to polysaccharides, is unlikely to be helpful in assessing the requirement for gammaglobulin replacement therapy in patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hypogammaglobulinaemias are {{the most}} common primary {{immunodeficiency}} diseases. This group of diseases is very heterogeneous, and little is known about these diseases in children. In the Pediatric Predominantly Antibody Deficiencies (PedPAD) study, we analysed data from the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) online database to gain more insight into the characteristics of children with hypogammaglobulinaemia; 46 centres in 18 different countries agreed to participate. Data from 2076 of the 3191 children who were registered at the time of data extraction with a diagnosis of <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (this excludes agammaglobulinaemia and defects in class-switch recombination) were available for analysis. The data set showed several limitations. Because of country-related differences in diagnostic criteria used for the classification of different types of primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia,</b> further analysis of the data was performed in the combined data set. The most striking observation is the strong majority of male patients in the group of children with primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (n = 1292, 63 %). This male predominance was observed in each of the 18 countries involved. The boys were younger at diagnosis (mean age males 5. 3 years; mean age females 5. 8 years). Moreover, one or more complications were more frequently reported in boys (12 %) compared to girls (5 %). The male predominance suggests that patients with an undetected or unknown X-linked genetic cause are included in this group of children registered as primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia...</b>|$|E
30|$|Adults {{with severe}} sepsis from community-acquired infections without {{documented}} immunosuppression were enrolled. <b>Hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> and absolute lymphopenia {{were defined as}} IgG < 6.1, IgM < 0.4, IgA < 0.8 g/L and lymphocytes < 1.2 × 109 /L, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Serum {{neopterin}} {{levels were}} analysed in 43 patients with primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (25 common variable immunodeficiency (CVI), 12 congenital <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (CH), six X-linked <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (XLH)), and in 33 healthy controls. The neopterin values were correlated to lymphocyte subset counts in peripheral blood, lymphocyte mitogen responses and clinical and histological manifestations {{in the study}} group. Serum neopterin levels were significantly elevated in all subgroups of patients {{and particularly in the}} CVI groups where the highest concentrations were found (P less than 0. 001, CVI versus controls). Furthermore, in CVI and CH patients elevated neopterin levels were strongly correlated to decreased number of CD 4 + lymphocytes (rs = - 0. 61, P less than 0. 005 and rs = - 0. 83, P less than 0. 001, respectively). In the CVI group high neopterin levels were also significantly correlated to low number of circulatory B (CD 19 +) lymphocytes (rs = - 0. 58, P less than 0. 05). Both patients with moderately and those with severely depressed lymphocyte mitogen responses had significantly higher neopterin levels than those with normal responses. In addition, high neopterin levels were significantly associated with the occurrence of splenomegaly and nodular intestinal lymphoid hyperplasia. The immunological findings were consistently observed in longitudinal testing, and appeared to be characteristic for the individual patient. High serum neopterin levels are thought to be a marker for hyperactivity in monocytes/macrophages, and dysfunction of these cells may therefore be associated with fundamental immune pathology in some subgroups of primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{shedding}} {{of human}} rhinovirus (HRV) after an acute, naturally acquired infection {{has not been}} described in detail. We determined the duration of HRV shedding in immunocompetent children and adults, and in patients with primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia.</b> Subjects with symptoms of respiratory tract infection, and their household contacts, were screened for HRV by reverse transcription PCR. They were followed by serial, self-collected nasal swab specimens until negative for HRV or infected by another HRV type. We followed 62 HRV infections in 54 subjects. The mean (95 % CI) duration of HRV shedding was 11. 4 (8. 2 – 14. 7) days in children, 10. 1 (7. 4 – 12. 9) days in adults, and 40. 9 (26. 4 – 55. 4) days in patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> (p < 0. 001). The duration of respiratory tract symptoms correlated with the duration of virus shedding (p 0. 002). A new infection by another HRV type soon after the first episode was common. We conclude that the shedding times of HRV are relatively short in otherwise healthy individuals. In contrast, prolonged shedding over 28 days is frequent in patients with <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> despite immunoglobulin replacement therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} report of {{low levels of}} purine 5 '-nucleotidase activity in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (lymphocytes and monocytes) from patients with non-familial adult onset `variable' primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> has been confirmed and the observation extended to include patients with other types of primary immunodeficiency. Patients with sex-linked congenital <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> have values for mononuclear cell 5 '-nucleotidase activity which are in the normal range, whereas most cases of non-familial adult onset `variable' primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> have clearly subnormal values. The three patients with isolated IgA deficiency who were tested also had subnormal values. Evidence that the measured enzyme activity is in fact 5 '-nucleotidase and independent of interfering phosphatase activities is presented. No significant or consistent alterations in the activities of the following enzymes were detected in mononuclear cells or erythrocytes: adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside (inosine) phosphorylase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase. The erythrocyte PRPP content and the mononuclear cell PRPP amidotransferase activity were normal in the small number of patients in which they were measured. These findings are discussed {{in the light of the}} current interest in the inter-relationship between some disorders of purine metabolism and the immunological deficiency syndromes...|$|E
40|$|The partial {{deficiency}} of 5 '-nucleotidase activity {{found on the}} circulating mononuclear cells of many patients with 'common variable' or 'X-linked' <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> was not due to abnormal compartmentalisation of the enzyme, altered enzyme kinetics, or {{the presence of a}} regulatory factor. Isolation of subpopulations of mononuclear cells from normal adult blood showed that B-lymphocytes, have about four times more 5 '-nucleotidase activity per cell than T-lymphocytes, and that monocytes have very little activity. Thus the absence of circulating B-lymphocytes in patients with X-linked <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> contributed to the low activity in these patients, but some patients also had a low level of T-cell 5 '-nucleotidase activity. The low enzyme level in 'common variable' <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> was due to one or more of three factors: a low T-cell activity, a reduced percentage of B-cells, and a low activity on the B-celis. The ability of circulating mononuclear cells to migrate out of capillary tube cultures in vitro was unimpaired, and inhibition of the 5 '-nucleotidase activity of normal cells did not affect their migration. Inhibition of the 5 '-nucleotidase activity also had no effect on the transformation or immunoglobulin production of tonsil lymphocytes in vitro. However, changes in the enzyme activity on tonsil lymphocytes were observed during cell transformation. Comparison of the 5 '-nucleotidase activities of the circulating mononuclear cells from normal adults, cord blood, patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia, and from patients with hypogammagiobulinaemia has led to the hypothesis that the low level of the enzyme on the lymphocytes of patients with 'common variable' and 'X-linked' <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> is not the cause of the disease but reflects a stage of maturation arrest in these cells. <p...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} serendipitous case of {{clinically}} significant pan-hypogammaglobulinaemia, diagnosed after routine serological testing for possible coeliac disease led first to identification of IgA deficiency (discovered as a low background in IgA-based routine serological screening), and subsequently to confirmed pan-hypogammaglobulinaemia (antibody immunodeficiency). <b>Hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> {{is a relatively}} rare diagnosis (estimated at 1 in 36, 000), in which delayed diagnosis and treatment are associated with chronic organ damage including bronchiectasis.

Nineteen patients (73 %) had raised urine mercury concentrations, but no correlation was found between urine mercury {{and the age of}} the patient, the IgG dose, or the duration of treatment.

40|$|There are {{two ways}} to find the cause of primary {{immunodeficiency}} diseases. One approach is to start with the immune defect and work backwards, using in vitro techniques to define where the primary abnormality lies in the immune response. Immunologists favour this approach for obvious reasons; and it is not without virtue since, for example, it has shown that the defect in most cases of primary <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> is due to a failure of B lymphocyte maturation. The alternative approach is to screen empirically for defects in biochemical pathways in the hope of finding a clue which will eventually lead to the underlying disorder. This is a sensible approach in diseases which are clearly inherited (e. g. X-linked <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia)</b> but is less attractive in a disease such as late onset <b>hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> which is not obviously inherited. In practice, such procedures involve screening the urine for abnormalities in the quality or quantity of excreted compounds. Another way is to screen for abnormalities in organelle integrity by measuring the activity of various enzymes in subcellular fractions. In reality, the clue to the metabolic defect is usually discovered by accident, the prime example in our field being the discovery of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency...|$|E
