5|$|Gods were {{assumed to}} be present {{throughout}} the world, capable of influencing natural <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> course of human lives. People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines, for personal reasons {{as well as for}} larger goals of state rites. Egyptians prayed for divine help, used rituals to compel deities to act, and called upon them for advice. Humans' relations with their gods were a fundamental part of Egyptian society.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cultures}} have attached importance to astronomical <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.

The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E

5|$|After {{ownership}} of the Meridian Main Street {{was transferred to the}} Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.|$|E

5|$|Although The Volcano is {{estimated}} to have last erupted 150years ago, {{it is one of}} the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985. Others include Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four <b>events)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds both with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|Combined (or multi-discipline) {{events are}} {{competitions}} in which athletes {{participate in a}} number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten <b>events)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce {{published}} a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement {{to write a book}} refuting their version of <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. However, for more than a century, Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books. Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Windle retired, {{but made}} a {{comeback}} {{to compete in}} the shorter distances after being persuaded by Talbot. In 1968, Windle anchored Indiana's 880yd freestyle relay to victory at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, sealing what would be the first of six consecutive men's team titles for the university. He then competed in the Australian Championships {{for the first time in}} four years. Although he did not win any individual events, he was part of New South Wales' winning quartets in the 4×100m and 4×200m freestyle relays. Windle was appointed the captain of the men's Olympic swimming team, gaining selection for the 100m and 200m freestyle <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> respective freestyle relays. He was not selected for the 1500m freestyle, ending the defence of his Olympic title before the team had reached Mexico City.|$|E
5|$|Note 2. The fencing {{programme}} included six individual {{events and}} four team events, though the team events were {{a different set}} than were held in 2004.

Voting is conducted to determine the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and sabre events and men's épée were automatically selected. Men's sabre was chosen over foil by a 45–20 vote.|$|E
5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors.

5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm {{is one of}} numerous seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have experienced volcanic earthquakes include Mount Meager (seventeen events), Mount Cayley (four events), Mount Garibaldi (three events), Silverthrone Caldera (two events), Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events), The Volcano (five <b>events),</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes {{with a history of}} significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
