5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis– rupturing a large gland <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E

25|$|Allium tricoccum is a bulb-forming {{perennial}} with broad, smooth, {{light green}} leaves, often with deep purple or burgundy tints {{on the lower}} stems, and a scallion-like stalk and bulb.

25|$|Thanks to the {{considerable}} {{economies of scale}} Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could {{be left in the}} ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site - indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory - and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.|$|E

40|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} {{has been}} orbiting Jupiter since 7 December 1995, and encounters {{one of the}} four galilean satellites—Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto—on each orbit. Initial results from the spacecraft's magnetometer, have indicated that neither Europa nor Callisto have an appreciable internal magnetic field, in contrast to Ganymede and possibly Io. Here we report perturbations of the external magnetic fields (associated with Jupiter's inner magnetosphere) in the vicinity of both Europa and Callisto. We interpret these perturbations as arising from induced magnetic fields, generated by the moons in response to the periodically varying plasma environment. Electromagnetic induction requires eddy currents to flow within the moons, and our calculations show that the most probable explanation is that there are layers of significant electrical conductivity <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> of both moons.

[...] In The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell gave high praise to the film, calling it [...] "a monumental treat", and stated, [...] "Atlantis is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove." [...] Internet film critic James Berardinelli wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars. He wrote, [...] "On the whole, Atlantis offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment, once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies, they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division."

To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something.

[...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} upper ocean apparent optical properties (AOP's) {{is essential for}} the vicarious calibration of the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) instrument and the validation of the derived data products. To evaluate the role that data analysis methods have upon values of derived AOP's, the first Data Analysis Round-Robin (DARR- 94) workshop was sponsored by the SeaWiFS Project during 21 - 23 July, 1994. The focus of this intercomparison study was the estimation of the downwelling irradiance spectrum <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>surface,</b> E(sub d) (0 (sup -), lambda); the upwelling nadir radiance <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>surface,</b> L(sub u) (0 (sup -), lambda); and the vertical profile of the diffuse attenuation coefficient spectrum, K(sub d) (z, lambda). In the results reported here, different methodologies from four research groups were applied to an identical set of 10 spectroradiometry casts in order to evaluate the degree to which data analysis methods influence AOP estimation, and whether any general improvements can be made. The overall results of DARR- 94 are presented in Chapter 1 and the individual methods of the four groups are presented in Chapters 2 - 5. The DARR- 94 results do not show a clear winner among data analysis methods evaluated. It is apparent, however, that some degree of outlier rejection is required in order to accurately estimate L(sub u) (0 (sup -), lambda) or E(sub d) (0 (sup -), lambda). Furthermore, the calculation, evaluation and exploitation of confidence intervals for the AOP determinations needs to be explored. That is, the SeaWiFS calibration and validation problem should be recast in statistical terms where the in situ AOP values are statistical estimates with known confidence intervals...|$|R
