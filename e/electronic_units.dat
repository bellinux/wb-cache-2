500|$|For {{the most}} part, audio systems both {{professional}} and domestic, have their components interconnected with low impedance outputs connected to high impedance inputs. [...] These impedances are poorly defined and nominal impedances {{are not usually}} assigned {{for this kind of}} connection. [...] The exact impedances make little difference to performance as long as the latter is many times larger than the former. [...] This is a common interconnection scheme, not just for audio, but for <b>electronic</b> <b>units</b> in general which form part of a larger equipment or are only connected over a short distance. [...] Where audio needs to be transmitted over large distances, which is often the case in broadcast engineering, considerations of matching and reflections dictate that a telecommunications standard is used, which would normally mean using 600 Ω nominal impedance (although other standards are sometimes encountered, such as sending at 75 Ω and receiving at 600 Ω which has bandwidth advantages). [...] The nominal impedance of the transmission line and of the amplifiers and equalisers in the transmission chain will all be the same value.|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} suggest that an external factor, which could be the different position of the Sun relative to the satellite, still influences both the VFM <b>electronic</b> <b>unit</b> temperature and the VFM magnetic measurements which nonlinearly and chaotically respond to this external disturbance. One possible scenario is that the VFM responds nonlinearly to <b>electronic</b> <b>unit</b> temperature variations, which {{are related to the}} position of the Sun, so that to produce biased measurements. Another possible scenario is the one according to which VFM measuring process is perturbed by external temperature variations through some mechanical deformation whose effect could manifest in terms of a spurious magnetic field. In both cases due to the nonlinear response to the external forcing, the complexity of the magnetic measurements is increased with respect to those of the inducing <b>electronic</b> <b>unit</b> temperature changes, and therefore, they are characterized by a higher number of IMFs.|$|R
