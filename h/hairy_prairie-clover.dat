Therefore, the objective of this research was to study the relationship between habitat configuration and <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> occurrence in order to predict suitable and unsuitable bare sand habitat across the study site. Bare sand patches were extracted from a land cover classification of the study site and several patch scaled metrics were calculated to characterize habitat spatial structure. Binary logistic regression was used to determine which metrics were significantly correlated with <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> occurrences. The logistic regression equation was subsequently used to predict suitable and unsuitable bare sand habitat for <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> based on the probability of occupancy. Results showed that about 29 % of the variation in bare sand patch occupancy could be explained by the size, shape, and degree of isolation of a sand patch as well as the amount of vegetation on a sand patch in the early growing season. Based on these variables, 18. 8 % of bare sand patches in the study site were predicted to be unsuitable <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> habitat, 45. 7 % were predicted to be marginally unsuitable, 32. 7 % were predicted to be suitable, and 2. 8 % were predicted to be marginally suitable...|$|E
40|$|In 1998, <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> {{was listed}} as {{threatened}} by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and subsequently afforded protection under the Species at Risk Act in 2004. <b>Hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover,</b> being a habitat specialist species confined to areas of sparsely vegetated to bare sand, may provide {{an indication of the}} loss of a once viable natural mixed-grass prairie and sand dune landscape indicative to southern Saskatchewan. Therefore, critical habitat identification for <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> is of particular concern, not only to provide conservation efforts for this particular species, but also for bare sand and sand dune environments which {{are some of the most}} sensitive landscapes on the prairies. The goal of this thesis is to identify and spatially delineate areas of critical habitat for <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> within the range of a known metapopulation in the Dundurn sand hills south of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This research was divided into two specific objectives: 1) to investigate the spatial relationship between bare sand habitat for <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> and other land cover classes, and 2) to study the relationship between habitat configuration and <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> occurrence. 	To achieve the first objective, the desired output was a land cover classification of the study site at an appropriate spatial and temporal resolution. Wavelet analysis revealed that the optimum spatial resolution for bare sand identification and delineation in the study site was between 2 - 5 m. Analysis of field spectroradiometer measurements throughout the growing season concluded that the early and late growing seasons were best for spectrally discriminating between land cover classes. A multi-resolution, multi-temporal land cover classification using object-oriented methods resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 79 % with a user’s and producer’s accuracy of 85 % for bare sand. Grassland comprised the matrix of the area covering 45. 5 % of the study site. Aspen and shrub were the most dominating landscape elements comprising 25. 5 % and 19. 2 % of the study site respectively. Bare sand made up only 6. 0 % of the study site while juniper was the least persistent class comprising only 2. 7 % of the study site. 	The desired output from objective two was a critical habitat landscape mosaic for <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover.</b> Patch scaled metrics were calculated for bare sand patches identified in the land cover classification from objective one. Binary logistic regression was used to identify which metrics could explain and predict <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> occurrences. Results showed that almost 29 % of the variation in bare sand patch occupancy could be explained by the size, shape, and degree of isolation of a sand patch as well as the amount of vegetation on a sand patch in the early growing season. Based on these variables, 18. 8 % of sand patches in the study site were predicted to be unsuitable <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> habitat, 45. 7 % were predicted to be marginally unsuitable, 32. 7 % were predicted to be suitable, and 2. 8 % were predicted to be marginally suitable. Overall prediction accuracy was about 61 % with 80 % of occurrences and 54 % of non-occurrences being correctly predicted...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> [Dalea villosa (Nutt.) Spreng. var. villosa] is a {{threatened}} Canadian wildflower. To facilitate {{the efforts of}} conserving this threatened plant, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was applied to assess genetic diversity in a remnant <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> population in the Canadian Prairie. Three AFLP primer pairs were employed to genotype 610 individual plants from the population and 15 plants from a North Dakota composite population, and 100 polymorphic AFLP bands were analyzed. The assayed plants displayed 23 % AFLP variation present between the remnant population and the North Dakota composite population, but maintained a high level (91 %) of AFLP variation within patches of the remnant population. The individual genetic distinctiveness measured by average AFLP dissimilarity was positively associated with latitude and negatively with elevation. The among-patch AFLP variation {{was significantly related to}} inter-patch distance, indicating local genetic differentiation within the remnant population. However, the proportions of within-patch AFLP variation were not associated with any patch characteristics assessed (i. e., patch size, perimeter, nearest neighbor distance, mean inter-patch distance). No fine-scale genetic structure was found within three large patches, suggesting little genetic correlations present for plants five meters apart. Some genetically distinctive and diverse patches were also identified. These findings indicate that the genetic risk of the remnant <b>hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> population in the Canadian Prairie is low...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>prairie-clover</b> (Dalea villosa Nutt. (Spreng) var. villosa), a rare plant species, {{grows in}} the Canadian Prairies. Populations of Dalea in Canada are {{threatened}} {{by the loss of}} sand dune habitat because of changes in land use and altered ecological processes such as grazing and fire. Local populations of Dalea are further threatened by one or more specific threats, including herbivory from native and domestic ungulates and invasion of habitats by exotic plants. The overall objective of this thesis was to gain more knowledge about Dalea and to determine the impact of threats and management practices to the Saskatchewan populations and their habitats. Observational studies were conducted at each of two sites in Saskatchewan supporting Dalea. First, at the Dundurn Sandhills site, structural equation modeling was used to examine landscape, ecological, and management factors associated with high rates of herbivory on Dalea and with reductions in the long-term survival and productivity of Dalea. The conditions which deer (Odocoileus hemionus and Odocoileus virginianus) or cattle (Bos taurus) were responsible for the most intense rates of herbivory to Dalea plants and patches were determined. Generally, deer appeared responsible for the most herbivory, whereas cattle grazing on Dalea increased with stocking densities. At the same time, new hypotheses about ecological processes affecting Dalea productivity in the Dundurn Sandhills were explored. In particular, it appeared that deer may be responding to cattle grazing in Dalea habitat by avoiding those areas, and that mid-season germination and recruitment of many Dalea plants may occur following precipitation events. Second, at the Mortlach site, {{the costs and benefits of}} using grazing management to control leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L. var. esula) were assessed, especially in consideration of the potential negative effects of intense herbivory on Dalea productivity. Aspects of the grazing regime including stocking density and the livestock species influenced herbivory on Dalea and its reproductive output, but there were no apparent links between the abundance of leafy spurge abundance and the reproductive output of Dalea. The findings of these two studies are relevant for the conservation and management of Dalea in Saskatchewan...|$|E
