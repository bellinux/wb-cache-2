Advantages {{such as high}} deposition rates, high quality and smooth weld metals and easy automation make cored wires preferable in these industries. In this study, low carbon steel materials with web and flange thicknesses of 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm were welded with conventional GMAW and double channel <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (DMAG) method to form double fillet T-joints using metal cored wire.

These are the cause of the roller fracturing，which the tension of the belt is great, and the roller itself is not strong enough, and welding process of steel plate is poor, and welding quality is not high.

Suuri lämmönjohtavuus, lämpölaajeneminen, pehmeneminen ja kuparin taipumus liuottaa kaasuja sulaan asettavat hitsaukselle haasteita. Kuparia on perinteisesti hitsattu kaasuhitsaamalla ja kaasukaarihitsausprosesseilla, mutta uudemmat menetelmät kuten laserhitsaus, elektronisuihkuhitsaus ja FSW-hitsaus tarjoavat uudenlaisia käyttökohteita korkealla laadulla. ISO 3834 - 2 asettaa noudatettavat vaatimukset hitsaustoiminnalle laatuvaatimusten ollessa kattavia. Ydinvoimalaitoksella hitsauksessa tulee lisäksi noudattaa Säteilyturvakeskuksen YVL-ohjeita, joissa on määritetty lisävaatimuksia liitosten materiaalivalinnoille, pätevöittämiselle ja tarkastamiselle.
