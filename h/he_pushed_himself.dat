2500|$|Adams' {{retirement}} in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as [...] "daunting", {{but it was}} something he looked forward to: [...] "Taking the responsibility on my shoulders is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well." [...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with L'Équipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt [...] "burned out": [...] "I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Arsène. He must give me time off to relax." [...] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: [...] "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> very hard and that explains why he was so tired." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are beaten, Halleck," [...] said Atherton sorrowfully. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> {{back in his}} chair, and {{clasped his}} hands {{together}} behind his head, as his habit was in reasoning with obstinate clients. [...] "What do you propose to do?" ...|$|E
60|$|WINSOR. Not a bit. I like Jews. That's {{not against}} him--rather the {{contrary}} these days. But <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>himself.</b> The General tells me he's deathly keen {{to get into}} the Jockey Club. [Taking off his tie] It's amusing to see him trying to get round old St Erth.|$|R
50|$|His {{life was}} uneventful. He cared little for notoriety or even fame. Once only did <b>he</b> <b>push</b> <b>himself</b> forward. This was in 1867-8, when he {{attacked}} W. G. Ward, {{at that time}} editor of Dublin Review. His opinions on papal infallibility, according to Ryder, were a caricature, and he delivered his protest in three pamphlets. He was criticised for them.|$|R
5000|$|Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times praised West's performance: [...] "On 'Stronger,' <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>himself</b> like {{a runner}} on a treadmill, {{always on the}} verge of losing his breath." [...] Although Louis Pattison of NME criticized what he viewed as [...] "brazen theft" [...] from Daft Punk, he called the song [...] "a silicone-hearted vocoder serenade, beefed up with hoover-like synthesisers." ...|$|R
60|$|When the man {{had drawn}} this log up to the shore, he went for another; {{and he had to}} sail upon this second one a long distance, in {{bringing}} it to its place. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> along by running his pole down to the bottom, and pushing against the sand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Amen to that, my Lord," [...] I replied; [...] "there {{are others}} here I would rather fight." [...] And I gave a meaning look at Mr. Allen. I was of two minds to {{announce}} the scurvy trick he had played, but saw that I would lose rather than gain by the attempt. Up to that time the wretch had not spoken a word; now <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> forward, though well clear of me.|$|E
60|$|I ran {{out over}} the trampled grass to meet the {{approaching}} group--showman, gipsy, trembling, sweating pony. Its rider stooped forward on the saddle, clutching its pommel, as if afraid of falling. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> off, lurched unsteadily, lifted and let fall his arm {{in an attempt to}} stroke the milk-white snapping muzzle. The strings of his cloak were already broken. He edged from beneath it, and with his left hand clumsily brushed the dust and damp from his face.|$|E

Seized by a passion for flight, <b>he</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>himself,</b> {{learning}} everything <b>he</b> can about flying, until finally his unwillingness to conform results in his expulsion. An outcast, he continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his abilities as he leads a peaceful and happy life.|$|R

60|$|At the {{neighbouring}} church all was ready. The clerk {{stood at the}} door, the red drugget was down, the usual little crowd were standing all agog upon the pavement. There was one unusual feature of the proceedings: Instead of a solitary policeman, {{there were at least}} a dozen who kept clear the entrance to the church. Their presence greatly puzzled a little old gentleman who had joined the throng of sightseers. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> to the front and touched one of them upon the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be, however, no alternative; so he set himself at work, and {{in due time}} he cut off the stem of the tree, just where it entered the water. They all three then took levers, which the boatman made with his hatchet, and, by making great exertion, they got the log out of the sand, and rolled it round into the water, where it floated. The man then cut a long pole, and, {{mounting}} upon the log, <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> out {{over the surface of}} the water.|$|E
60|$|First he put {{his head}} and {{shoulders}} through, and by pulling at the under side of the flagstones tried to hitch and coax his way in. All in vain! His fat body caught between the obstinate flags and only wedged tighter and tighter. The bulging part without was so {{much bigger than the}} part within that he must have given it up at a glance, could he only have seen himself. But he worked away with wonderful patience till he knew it was of no use, when <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> out again and sat looking into his inhospitable doorway, blinking and tousled and all covered with dust and grass roots. As he sat he kept scratching the place where his ear should be, as if he were thinking.|$|E
40|$|UCI # 8. Watching {{the team}} time trials, I got to observe cyclists {{as they got}} closer to the finish line. In this photo, the cyclist {{on the far right}} has his head bent down. Maybe this is an {{aerodynamic}} strategy, but based on his body language, I also saw that he was exhausted, that <b>he</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>himself</b> to get to complete the race. I’ve really come to admire everyone’s perseverance and dedication to see things through in this sport. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Later, at a naval {{hospital}} in Philadelphia, Hoskins meets [...] "Zuggy" [...] (Ben Cooper), another amputee who lost {{an arm and}} is being honorably discharged.

With encouragement from Sue, Vice-Adm. Thomas L. Semple (Dean Jagger) reveals that by a navy code, no disabled officer can be compelled to retire.|$|R

50|$|Even though <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> to {{the limits}} he {{was known for his}} easygoing manner and humility. Prior to his death he had {{operated}} a motorcycle shop in Keith.

5000|$|Felicity Martin of Clash {{gave the}} album an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "It's a sad record, {{but one that}} envelops you in a warm hug, wipes your eyes and plays with your hair." [...] Jonah Bromwich of Pitchfork gave the album a 6.0 out of 10, saying, [...] "Alone for the First Time is the furthest <b>he's</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself,</b> and the growing pains on the album can be chalked up to the strain of trying new things, a kind of {{adolescent}} awkwardness that shows signs of maturing into something sophisticated and unique." ...|$|R

Leung had long been an opium smoker; the monk advised him to break the habit and train in the pole technique instead. But <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> too hard for his age, fell ill and died around the age of 70.|$|E
50|$|Andrews {{excelled in}} school. Perhaps {{because he felt}} the need to nullify his father's {{complete}} rejection, <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> and was valedictorian of every academic class he ever entered. His mother died in 1941 and he later said he was ashamed because part of him had always been embarrassed by the fact that his mother was an uneducated member of the ethnic and social underclass. In 1945 Andrews entered journalism school and graduated to become Liberia's most popular sports announcer. His play-by-play was so popular that there are still Liberians today who talk admiringly about his quips and speaking style.|$|E

The vayu (air) will be the prana for him. Kali will be the most cruel one, of all the six fragments." [...] Chithira Buthira also noted that Mayon had taken a 4-span body in the previous yugas, as Narasimha, Rama, and Krishna, and so Kali, in this yuga, was born with the body of same size, and <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> out of the earth.|$|E
50|$|This {{was arguably}} the strongest ever UK Superstars contest, and {{with so many}} {{competitive}} sportsmen present {{it was no surprise}} that records tumbled. Jacks was the heavy favourite, and duly won his 'banker' events, but his inability to compete in the running tests left him facing huge obstacles.His performance in the gym tests was simply astonishing, smashing his own parallel bars record in the starkly lit Wycombe sports centre with an awesome 100 in 54 seconds; had <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> {{all the way to the}} minute he could easily have added more. His innovative 'rocking' technique (like Budd's sliding squat thrusts) was widely copied, but none of his rivals could get anywhere near him, and though Sherwood again pushed him close in the squats section, in reality Jacks was in a class of one here.|$|E
