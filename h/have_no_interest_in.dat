5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E

25|$|If {{multiple}} {{models of}} natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent {{and there is no}} need for parsimony to choose a preferred one.

Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.|$|E

25|$|On 13 March 1939, Hitler invited Monsignor Jozef Tiso, (the Slovak ex-prime {{minister}} {{who had been}} deposed by Czechoslovak troops several days earlier), to Berlin and urged him to proclaim Slovakia's independence. Hitler added that, if Tiso did not consent, he would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Slovakia's fate and would {{leave it to the}} territorial claims of Hungary and Poland. During the meeting, Joachim von Ribbentrop passed on a report claiming that Hungarian troops were approaching the Slovak borders. Tiso refused to make such a decision himself, after which he was allowed by Hitler to organise a meeting of the Slovak parliament ("Diet of the Slovak Land") which would approve Slovakia's independence.|$|E

25|$|The group {{decides to}} {{fight their way}} to the local marina, and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan.

They strap food and a walkie-talkie onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> him. Chips gets into Andy's store safely but a zombie follows through the dog door, ultimately biting Andy. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers and kill Andy, rescuing Nicole. They grab ammunition {{and go back to the}} mall. Along the way, Tucker breaks his legs and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the bicentenary of Berlioz's birth, his {{achievements}} and status {{were much more}} widely recognized, and his music is now viewed as both serious and original, rather than an eccentric novelty. Newspaper articles reported his colourful life with zeal, very many festivals dedicated to the composer were held, readings of his books and a one-hour French television dramatised biography all helped to {{create a lot of}} exposure to the composer's life and music– far more than the previous centenary anniversary. Numerous recording projects were begun or reissued, and broadcasts of his music increased. Prominent Berlioz conductor Colin Davis had already been in the process of recording much of Berlioz's music on the LSO Live label, and has continued this project to this date with a L'enfance du Christ recording issued in 2007. The internet was also a factor in the celebrations, with the comprehensive hberlioz.com site (which has been online since 1997) being an easily available source of information to anyone interested in the composer. The 'Berlioz 2003' celebrations, organised by French academic institutions, also had a prominent website, listing events, publications and gatherings the domain of which has now lapsed. There was also a site maintained by the Association nationale Hector Berlioz. A proposal was made to remove his remains to the Panthéon, and while initially encouraged by French President Jacques Chirac, the proposal was rejected on the basis that Berlioz was an anti-establishment figure and would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> such a ceremony, and that he was happy to be buried next to his two wives in the location he has been in for almost 150 years.|$|E
500|$|Tippett had {{intended}} The Ice Break {{to be his}} final opera, but in 1985 he began work on New Year. [...] Bowen saw this work as a summary of ideas and images that had attracted Tippett throughout his working life. Donal Henahan was dismissive of the music: [...] "...the score generally natters along in the numbing, not-quite-atonal but antimelodic style familiar from other Tippett works." [...] In Byzantium (1990), Tippett set the five stanzas of W. B. Yeats's poem, with added orchestral interludes. By {{this time he was}} professing little interest in his own work beyond its creation; performance and reception had become irrelevant to him. In 1996 he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm outside the music I've made, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> it". After the String Quartet No. 5 (1991), which connects thematically with earlier works, Tippett closed his main output with The Rose Lake (1993), described in Tippett's Daily Telegraph obituary as [...] "of luminous beauty... a worthy ending to a remarkable career." ...|$|E

I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> making a record for a major label." [...] Weiland expressed interest in exploring distribution options after the band's reformation. Commenting on his idea, he said, [...] "ther bands, they make more money doing things in an unconventional fashion as opposed to doing it... with the major labels." [...] Dean was curious about Weiland's idea but was aware that the band was contractually obligated to release two more albums. Increasing the uncertainty {{in the future of}} a new album, Weiland added, [...] "I'm proud of everything we've written. But to make another record would mean another couple of years of my life dedicated to that, and I just don't know if that's where I see myself going." ...|$|E

500|$|Comparisons between Degrassi: The Next Generation {{and other}} genre {{specific}} series {{have also been}} made throughout the run. Jake Surette, a writer with AfterElton.com, a website which focuses on the portrayal of homosexual and bisexual men in the media, reported on the portrayal of two Degrassi: The Next Generation gay characters. [...] "Degrassi features ongoing stories of real-life teen dilemmas—including intense gay and lesbian storylines—and does it without the righteous, 'On a Very Special Blossom endings that many teen dramas and sitcoms thrive on." [...] Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post said the series [...] "is told from a teenager's point of view since the writers <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> appealing to a broad-based demographic like the writers on, say, Fox's The O.C. ... it connects with teens on their level". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn also compared it with The O.C., saying that while scenes from Degrassi could be [...] "actual scenes from my actual teenage life... The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life", adding {{that it is the}} most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre.|$|E
500|$|Oblivion {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, {{and became}} a commercial success. The game had shipped 1.7million copies by April 10, 2006, sold over 3million copies by January 2007, and over 3.5 million by November 2011. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide. Reviewers praised the game for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Eurogamer editor Kristan Reed stated that the game [...] "successfully unites {{some of the best}} elements of RPG, adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin wrote that compared to Morrowind, {{which was one of the}} best role-playing games he has seen in years, [...] "Oblivion is hands-down better, so much so that even those who'd normally <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> a role-playing game should find it hard to resist getting swept up in this big, beautiful, meticulously crafted world". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile stated, [...] "All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice, but the Elder Scrolls IV takes that concept and runs with it".|$|E
500|$|The 2012 UN study {{cited by}} the Chinese People's Daily {{reported}} that in Britain 74 percent and in Japan 70 percent of all women between 25 and 29 were single. A similar feature in the People's Daily focused on the reception {{of the concept of}} sheng nu from netizens outside of China, particularly in Asia, specifically Korea, Japan, and India. One Japanese netizen noted that during the 1980s, the term [...] "Christmas cakes" [...] was commonly used to refer to women who were unmarried and beyond the national age average of married women. The actual reference to Christmas cakes is the saying, [...] "who wants Christmas cakes after December 25". Another contributor wrote, similarly [...] "a class of highly educated, independent age 27+ women who choose to live a more liberated life and put their talent/skill to good use in society" [...] is happening in India. [...] "People must make their own choices and must simply refuse others' labels and be blissfully happy," [...] she further explained.
