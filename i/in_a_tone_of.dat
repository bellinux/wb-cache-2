5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] is {{a generic}} name {{used in the}} United Kingdom for a person, usually with {{strongly}} conservative political views, who writes letters to newspapers or the BBC <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> moral outrage. [...] "Disgusted" [...] is the pseudonym of the supposed letter writer, who is {{a resident of the}} stereotypically middle-class town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in the south-east of England. The term may have originated either with the 1944 BBC radio programme Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, a regular writer to The Times or with an editor of the letters page of a local newspaper, the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a famous}} legend {{inspired}} by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, {{which is set}} during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof {{of the existence of}} God: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> perfect conviction announced this non-sequitur: [...] "Sir, =x, hence God exists—reply!" ...|$|E

500|$|A side {{benefit of}} Tchaikovsky's {{friendship}} with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov was an increased {{confidence in his}} own abilities as a composer, along with a willingness to let his musical works stand alongside those of his contemporaries. Tchaikovsky wrote to von Meck in January 1889, after being once again well represented in Belyayev's concerts, that he had [...] "always tried to place myself outside all parties and to show in every way possible that I love and respect every honorable and gifted public figure in music, whatever his tendency", and that he considered himself [...] "flattered {{to appear on the}} concert platform" [...] beside composers in the Belyayev circle. This was an acknowledgment of wholehearted readiness for his music to be heard with that of these composers, delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> implicit confidence that there were no comparisons from which to fear.|$|E

2500|$|In 1681, Anglesey wrote A Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country, as a {{rejoinder}} to the Earl of Castlehaven, who {{had published}} memoirs on the Irish rebellion defending {{the action of}} the Irish and the Roman Catholics. In so doing Anglesey was held by Ormonde to have censured his conduct and that of Charles I in concluding the [...] "Cessation", and the duke brought the matter before the council. In 1682 he wrote The Account of Arthur, Earl of Anglesey ... of the true state of Your Majesty's Government and Kingdom, which was addressed to the king <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> censure and remonstrance, but appears not to have been printed till 1694. In consequence he was dismissed on 9 August 1682, from the office of Lord Privy Seal.|$|E
2500|$|He {{viewed the}} world from outside the charmed circle of aristocratic rulers, protesting against their injustices <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> voice that has been {{described}} as having a [...] "grumpy quality redeemed by a gaunt dignity" [...] but, as stated in the biography section, he could also change to suit the audience. This ambivalence appears to underlie his presentation of human history in Works and Days, where he depicts [...] a golden period when life was easy and good, followed by a steady decline in behaviour and happiness through the silver, bronze, and Iron Ages– except that he inserts a heroic age between the last two, representing its warlike men as better than their bronze predecessors. He seems in this case to be catering to two different world-views, one epic and aristocratic, the other unsympathetic to the heroic traditions of the aristocracy.|$|E
2500|$|Brummell {{put into}} {{practice}} the principles of harmony of shape and contrast of colours with such a pleasing result that men of superior rank sought his opinion on their dress. [...] The Duke of Bedford once did this touching a coat. Brummell examined his Grace with the cool impertinence which was his Grace’s due. He turned him about, scanned him with scrutinizing, contemptuous eye, and then taking the lapel between his dainty finger and thumb, he exclaimed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> pitying wonder, “Bedford, do you call this thing a coat?” His personal habits, such as a fastidious attention to cleaning his teeth, shaving, and daily bathing exerted an influence on the ton - the upper echelons of polite society - who began to do likewise. Enthralled, the Prince would spend hours in Brummell's dressing room, witnessing the progress of his friend's lengthy morning toilette.|$|E

2500|$|The first review {{appeared}} in the New York Atlas for 25 May, followed by more than thirty others until as late as September. Only two of the thirty-three reviews and notices critic Johannes D. Bergmann read [...] "seem seriously negative." [...] Most of the others were full of praise, especially for [...] "Bartleby," [...] "Benito Cereno," [...] and [...] "The Encantadas." [...] Several reviewers singling out [...] "Bartleby" [...] and [...] "The Bell-Tower" [...] compare the stories to Edgar Allan Poe's work. Sealts saw thirty-seven reviews, five of which were [...] "preponderantly unfavorable," [...] among them the sole British review, which {{appeared in}} the London Athenaeum for 26 July. Yet the reviews showed that the book [...] "manifestly pleased his critics as no other work from his pen had done since the appearance of Redburn and White-Jacket in 1849 and 1850. Most reviews were unsigned, and not all singled out any individual story, but merely described the collection as a whole. On 9 July 1856, the Springfield Republican compared the collection to Hawthorne's best work, [...] "Marked by a delicate fancy, a bright and most fruitful imagination, a pure and translucent style and a certain weirdness of conceit." [...] "The legends themselves," [...] wrote the Athenaeum for 26 July, [...] "have a certain wild and ghostly power; but the exaggeration of their teller's manner appears to be on the increase." [...] Also taking the stories together, the United States Democratic Review for September 1856 wrote that [...] "All of them exhibit that peculiar richness of language, descriptive vitality, and splendidly sombre imagination which are the author's characteristics." [...] Praise for Melville's charming style was offered [...] "almost invariably <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> affection and respect, without a single known mention of Moby-Dick", Parker observes.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 64 is a {{great example}} of why people always say [...] "You should never let your past {{interfere}} with your present". Barret argues that sonnet 64 [...] "provides an example of past-oriented natural habitats that might interfere with the productive considerations of the future". In other words, because the speaker is letting the past overwhelm his thoughts, he therefore cannot think positively about the future due to past habits or tendencies. Unlike some of the other sonnets addressed to the young man, sonnet 64 moves toward a feeling of the lover's exposure to the risk of being destroyed. Barret also argues that the phonetic play between ruminate and ruinate is as she says an [...] "underscore a relationship inherent in the poem’s logic", [...] "Each quatrain of the sonnet open with the same construction — [...] "When I have seen" [...] — yet these statements are never met with a summational [...] "then", so the temporal ambiguity the phrase creates the remains unresolved: Does the speaker gesture toward repeated past actions ('in the instances that I have seen') or forward to a causational limit point ('once I have seen')?". When we read the lines that pertain to the waves and the shore, [...] "at times the waves are winning against the shore, and then at times the shore is winning against the waves", the speaker almost speaks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> confidence and determination to not let time control his life. Although when he goes to say Time will take my love away we begin {{to get a sense of}} uncertainty within the speaker. This uncertainty within the speaker is described by Barret when she argues [...] "The sonnet registers temporal matters in personal terms; the couplet never corrects the poem's grammatically obscured engagement with time, but instead introduces a paralyzing temporal collapse: the present moment becomes overwhelmed by an anticipation of future loss—an extreme version of 'I miss you already.'.... The ruin/ruminate pairing bespeaks a suspicion of an imagined time spent looking back".|$|E
