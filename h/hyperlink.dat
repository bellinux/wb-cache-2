The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding <b>hyperlink.</b> However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E
5|$|Against this existential {{threat and}} fraying social order, the film also explores how {{individual}} characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments {{on a cell}} line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fiancé {{to leave the city}} before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative <b>hyperlink</b> cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.|$|E

40|$|We {{increasingly}} spend a {{vast amount}} of time on the Web and much of that time is spent reading. One of the main differences between reading non-Web based text and reading on the Web is the presence of <b>hyperlinks</b> within the text, linking various related Web content and Web pages together. Some researchers and commentators have claimed that <b>hyperlinks</b> hinder reading because they are a distraction that may {{have a negative effect on}} the reader’s ability to process the text. However, very few controlled experiments have been conducted to verify these claims. In the experiments documented here we utilise eye tracking as a new methodology for examining how we read <b>hyperlinked</b> text. An eye tracker was used to observe participant’s behaviour while reading. The results showed that <b>hyperlinked</b> text did not generally have a negative impact upon reading behaviour. However, participants did show a tendency to re-read sentences that contained <b>hyperlinked</b> uncommon (low frequency) words. This suggests that <b>hyperlinks</b> highlight important information to the reader and the <b>hyperlinks</b> add additional content which for more difficult concepts, invites rereading of the preceding text...|$|R
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a <b>hyperlink</b> to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSearching for {{relevant}} webpages {{and following}} <b>hyperlinks</b> to related content {{is a widely}} accepted and effective approach to information seeking on the textual web. Existing work on multimedia information retrieval has focused on search for individual relevant items or on content linking without specific attention to search results.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{importance}} of <b>hyperlinks</b> in revealing {{the presence of the}} hypertext author and his decisive role in defining and controlling the dialogue with the user/reader through the hypertext. This is essential in order to adequately describe all the factors involved in hypertextual communication and how this communication takes place. In hypertexts and hypermedia, <b>hyperlinks</b> on the one hand define the possible directions of hypertextual communication and, on the other hand, their strategy of manifestation shapes the user's process of interpretation. Because of these two important ‘powers' <b>hyperlinks</b> have, and on the basis of John Searle's distinction between constitutive and regulative rules, <b>hyperlinks</b> can be defined as constitutive rules of hypertextual communication, set by the author, needing to be activated by the reader, and determining different utterances in the interaction happening during the navigation between the author and the user/reader. In the paper, after having described the semiotic-communicative structure of <b>hyperlinks</b> and the process of interpretation they require, the character of constitutive rules of <b>hyperlinks</b> will be illustrated by analyzing different dialogues generated by different <b>hyperlinks</b> in two particular kinds of hypermedial applications: hypertextual transpositions of classic literary texts and hyperfictio...|$|R

In this paper, we present some novel computer graphics techniques to visualize the <b>hyperlinks</b> among webpages. We propose a visual encoding scheme for five dimensional <b>hyperlinks</b> data and two constrained 3 D layout techniques for incoming and outgoing links of a single webpage. To reveal the hierarchical structure of webpages as well as the <b>hyperlinks</b> information, we extend the treemap representation. Our representations are visually appealing and can effectively reveal linkage patterns among webpages. Experimental results and a user study demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

40|$|Search, as a {{well-known}} information retrieval strategy, is widely researched and developed for academic and commercial usage. However, {{in the context}} of increasing amounts of multimedia data, search alone cannot satisfy user requirements for exploring multimedia resources. Therefore, preprocessing of multimedia resources is necessary to define potentially related documents to reduce retrieval time and improve the browsing efficiency. Using <b>hyperlinks</b> to connect relevant resources is widely used for multimedia collection. However, the definition of <b>hyperlinks</b> is usually based on textual information. For example, <b>hyperlinks</b> in Wikipedia link a term to relevant webpages. By contrast, content based multimedia retrieval provides the possibility of analysing multimedia materials on the actual content. The availability of these technologies for multimedia search suggests further investigation of content-based <b>hyperlinking</b> for multimedia collections. This thesis is dedicated to a novel topic of automatically creating <b>hyperlinks</b> within TV data collections for content-based browsing and navigation. <b>Hyperlinks</b> are created between video segments determined to be related based on their multimodal features. First, we detail the methodologies to create potentially relevant segments across the TV collection in terms of automatically detected spoken information. We present which of these approaches are more efficient to segment video streams. Next, we involve both low-level and high-level visual features to improve the <b>hyperlinking</b> quality. We detail the implementation of data fusion schemes to combine multimodal features. Finally, a novel <b>hyperlinking</b> framework associated with query enrichment, spoken data analysis, and multimodal fusion is proposed. The experiments show the effectiveness of this framework at satisfying user experience which is concluded in crowdsourcing study...|$|R
