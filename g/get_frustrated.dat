25|$|Meanwhile, Chan was {{beginning}} to <b>get</b> <b>frustrated</b> {{at the lack of}} progress. Following a round of negotiations in Cairns, Australia, in September and December 1995, between the BRA, BTG and the PNG government, in January 1996 the BRA/BIG representatives, including Kabui, were fired on by PNGDF forces after returning to Bougainville. Later, the home of the BIG's representative in the Solomon Islands, Martin Mirori, was firebombed. The BRA subsequently undertook retaliatory action in northern Bougainville and on Buka. Chan decided to abandon attempts at peace, and on 21 March 1996, approved the lifting of the ceasefire on Bougainville. In an address to the nation, he subsequently resolved to achieve a military solution.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, [...] "We R Who We R" [...] gained {{widespread}} {{support from the}} gay community. Dan Savage, the original creator of the [...] "It Gets Better" [...] campaign, which Kesha participated in, stated that she and other music artists that wrote songs addressed to the gay community were vital in helping fans {{come to terms with}} their sexualities and identities. [...] "These songs are countering a hateful message that a peer, family member, politician or a bully might be saying, I <b>get</b> <b>frustrated</b> with gay politicos who discount or undermine the importance of pop stars, They’re a huge part of this fight." [...] Singers Josh Erdman and Ben Klute began posting cover versions of various songs on YouTube, later adding a logo to their videos originally titled [...] "Legalize Gay". They later stumbled upon Kesha's song and upon doing so they changed their logo to [...] "Legalize Gay ’Cause We Are Who We Are". The duo changed the logo to represent the song stating, [...] "The lyrics obviously spoke to us, What these artists are doing means the world to the gay community." [...] In October 2011, Kesha teamed up with the Human Rights Campaign and designed a unisex T-shirt embroidered with purple zebra print – intended to represent [...] "spirit" [...] in the LGBT's pride flag. The shirt's design was titled with the writing [...] "We R Who We R" [...] and was made for that year's National Coming Out Day.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{acknowledged}} the expectations and warned, [...] "I won't be an All-Star this year." [...] He was {{appreciative of the}} support, especially from the Asian-American community, but he preferred to concentrate on his play without all the attention when he had not [...] "proven anything to anybody". Smart saw that Lin was skilled at getting to the paint, but needed to learn to pass because, he said, Lin [...] "couldn't shoot the ball at all". The coach also noticed that Lin always arrived early for practice and left late. Lin studied and rehearsed Steve Nash's and other top point guards' pick-and-roll plays. Frank Hughes of Sports Illustrated wrote that Lin spoke with the occasional [...] "seeds of self-doubt", which he said was uncommon to hear in the NBA. Hughes also found it rare when Lin compared himself to the Phoenix Suns' then-backup point guard Goran Dragić. [...] "Neither of us is a freak athlete, but we're both effective {{and know how to}} play the game," [...] Lin said. Lin and Stephen Curry, the 2009–10 runner-up Rookie of the Year, received more interview requests than any other Warrior. Team officials regularly denied requests for Lin to help him keep his focus. He was approached to be the subject of documentaries. Smart planned to take pressure off Lin since Lin had a tendency to be hard on himself and <b>get</b> <b>frustrated,</b> but the coach admitted that he once succumbed to the home crowd's wishes and put Lin into a game in the wrong situation.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} his lyrical content relatively {{similar to the}} group's prior releases: [...] "The topics are universal. There {{is a lot of}} angst that could be teen angst or it could be angst of everyday life. I still have the same emotions I had 20 years ago – I <b>get</b> <b>frustrated</b> or I get excited. I still feel like I'm falling in love with my wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E

500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often <b>get</b> <b>frustrated</b> or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E
500|$|Ninja Gaiden II was {{reviewed}} again in 2007 {{when the game}} was released for the Virtual Console and received some praise as well as criticism from reviewers. Austin Shau from GameSpot compared the game with the first Ninja Gaiden game as examples of [...] "mean-spirited games" [...] on the NES with high, unforgiving difficulty and excellent controls and gameplay. He applauds Tecmo's artistic detail in the cutscenes, saying that it enhances the storyline and offsets the tedious dialogue. He said that the visuals are better {{than those in the}} first game with the usage of [...] "dynamic environments" [...] such as speeding trains, and he praises the game's fast-paced sound. He and IGN's Lucas Thomas praised the improvement in the controls from its predecessor, more specifically Ryu's ability to freely climb up and down walls and use special weapons while on the walls. Thomas enjoyed the game's [...] "chief innovation" [...] of Ryu's ability to clone himself and use them to take care of enemies – something in which he says [...] "make progressing through levels and taking down bosses much easier and quicker". Reviewers said that the game's difficulty remains high for players as with the previous Ninja Gaiden game. Shau noted that the game is still difficult as was its predecessor but said that the sequel is slightly easier. Thomas stated that the sequel is not any easier to beat than its predecessor and that players will still <b>get</b> <b>frustrated,</b> especially with new environmental features such as blowing wind and rain and absolute darkness in which flashes of lightning illuminates the platforms. Thomas' only criticism of the game was that the storyline was not as good as its predecessor, saying that the plot seemed more predictable and that the cutscenes seemed more generic the second time around. Overall, he noted the lasting appeal of the game, saying that Ninja GaidenII is [...] "a challenging experience the likes of which gamers in the 8-bit era lived and died for".|$|E
