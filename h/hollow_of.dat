5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> the knee.|$|E
5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E

25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{original}} remains of the organism completely dissolve or are otherwise destroyed. The remaining organism-shaped hole in the rock is called an external mold.

25|$|The {{trees in}} the Topkapı Palace complex are remarkable, as many have fallen victim to a fungus that has {{completely}} hollowed out their trunks, {{over the course of}} centuries. The trees nonetheless survive and remain standing. In other cases, two trees of a different kind have grown and fused together, such as a fig tree that grew in the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> another tree and effectively grafted with it. This phenomenon {{can be seen in the}} second courtyard.|$|E
25|$|All three Buttermere Fells {{throw out}} a rocky spur toward the lake, these walls {{enclosing}} Birkness and Bleaberry Combs. Birkness Comb, also called Burtness Comb on Ordnance Survey maps, lies between the truncated and unnamed northern ridges of High Crag and High Stile. Drained into Buttermere by Comb Beck, its headwall is rimmed by crags on all sides. Sheepbone Buttress flanks High Crag, {{which also has}} a share in Comb Crags, lining the onward ridge. It is the great scooped <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> the Comb which results in the narrowness of Buttermere Edge. The northern spur also ends abruptly as High Crag Buttress, a further tier of rock lying just above the lakeshore.|$|E
25|$|Saponi and Tutelo Indians, Algonquian-speaking tribes, later {{occupied}} lands at {{the south}} end of Cayuga Lake. Dependent tributaries of the Cayuga, they had been permitted to settle on the tribe's hunting lands {{at the south}} end of Cayuga Lake, as well as in Pony (originally Sapony) <b>Hollow</b> <b>of</b> what is known as present-day Newfield, New York. Remnants of these tribes had been forced from North Carolina by tribal conflicts and European colonial encroachment. Similarly, the Tuscarora people, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe from the Carolinas, migrated after defeat in the Yamasee War; they settled with the Oneida people and became the sixth nation of the Haudenosaunee, with chiefs stating the migration was complete in 1722.|$|E

25|$|A second version {{according}} to retired police chief George W. Walling, Turner and McLaughlin {{had a more}} active role in the fight. It was McLaughlin, he claimed, who challenged Poole to a fight spitting in his face each time he refused. All three were reportedly drunk, Baker having recently been dismissed from the NYPD, and the still sober Poole was dismissive towards his taunts but offered $100 that he could beat any of the three men. Turner then pulled out a pistol to fire at Poole, using the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> his left arm as a rest, but instead shot himself in the arm. He then fired the second shot that hit Poole in the leg. Poole then staggered towards Baker who drew his own revolver and shot him twice and leaving the bar.|$|E
25|$|Five days later, on June 13, Ja'far ibn al-Baghamardi entered Mecca with {{approximately}} two hundred riders under his command. There he {{was met by}} Harun, who {{had returned to the}} city, and was reinforced with one hundred twenty horsemen, two hundred blacks, thirty Saffarid cavalrymen, and two hundred infantry from Iraq that the governor had at his disposal. After receiving further assistance from a group of Khurasani pilgrims, Ja'far decided to march out and face the troops of Ibn Tulun. The ensuing battle, which took place in the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> Mecca, ended in a victory for the government forces, who killed two hundred of Ibn Tulun's men and compelled the remainder to flee to the surrounding hills. As the Tulunid soldiers ran off their animals and money were confiscated, and al-Ghanawi's tent, which contained some two hundred thousand dinars, was seized by Ja'far.|$|E
25|$|Green Gable's eastern face {{contains}} the slight <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> Mitchell Cove, its stream joining Styhead Gill {{on the way}} to Borrowdale. At the northern corner is the ridge to Base Brown, the flat topped depression of Blackmoor Pots. The dale between the Base Brown and Brandreth ridges is Gillercomb, a classic hanging valley. Its stream, Sourmilk Gill, exits around the nose of Base Brown via a series of cascades to Seathwaite. This ensures that all of Green Gable's waters, bar those from the western face, reach the River Derwent. Brandreth connects via the narrow ridge of Gillercomb Head, site of a few small pools after wet weather. The Ennerdale side provides the gentlest slopes, at least at lower levels, with the long grassy spur of Tongue gradually rising up the fell. The topmost section however is guarded by Greengable Crags, stretching around from Stone Cove.|$|E

25|$|As the radial {{point of}} so many ridges Scoat Fell forms the head of several valleys, the major ones being the Wasdale feeders of Mosedale and Nether Beck. Mosedale begins on the eastern flanks of Scoat Fell, between Red Pike and Pillar, in the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> Black Comb. There are crags in the headwall, {{particularly}} to the south. Nether Beck has its birth at Scoat Tarn, a large pool {{to the south of}} the fell. This corrie tarn, held in place by grassy moraines is around 65ft deep. Between Steeple and Pillar to the north is Windgap Cove with Black Crag, a Hewitt at its head. Wind Gap is the col between Black Crag and Pillar, while the small Mirk Cove lies between Black Crag and the summit. Finally Mirklin Cove is the corrie between Steeple and Tewit How, drained into Ennerdale by Low Beck. All of the northern coves are home to impressive crags.|$|E

500|$|The {{specific}} epithet [...] "volemus" [...] {{is derived}} from the Latin vola, meaning [...] "the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> the hand", suggestive of Fries's reference to the large amount of latex [...] "flowing enough to fill the hand". Common names for L.volemus include the weeping milk cap, the tawny milkcap, the orange-brown milky, the voluminous-latex milky, the lactarius orange, the fishy milkcap, and the apricot milk cap. In the West Virginian mountains of the United States, the mushroom is called a [...] "leatherback" [...] or a [...] "bradley". The latter name may originate from its German name Brätling.|$|E
500|$|When he {{finishes}} writing his script, Barton celebrates by dancing at a USO show. The song {{used in this}} scene is a rendition of [...] "Down South Camp Meeting", a swing tune. Its lyrics (unheard in the film) state: [...] "Git ready (Sing) / Here they come! The choir's all set". These lines echo the title of Barton's play, Bare Ruined Choirs. As the celebration erupts into a melee, {{the intensity of the}} music increases, and the camera zooms into the cavernous <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> a trumpet. This sequence mirrors the camera's zoom into a sink drain just before Audrey is murdered earlier in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{estate of}} Forglen (Foithir Gleann, meaning [...] "the <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> the vale" [...] in Gaelic) {{was one of}} the parcels of land added to the {{property}} of the abbots at the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion prior to 1211. Charters indicate the Monymusk Reliquary or Breccbennach was probably held at Forglen and the tenants were required to ride under the standard of the Arbroath abbots if called to defend king and kingdom. Forglen remained under the Abbey's feudal superiority until the superiority passed to the Marquis of Hamilton in 1608. Thirty-nine years later, in 1641, the feudal superior was William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart and then, in 1642, it was the Maules of Panmure.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we {{determine}} parameters <b>of</b> the <b>hollow.</b> One <b>of</b> {{the characteristics}} of the proposed method is to assemble a ring part with <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> fingers. The <b>hollows</b> need to be designed to be able to assemble a ring part successfully. The hollow has three parameters as follows: width a, height b, incline angle ϕ.|$|R
30|$|Advantages <b>of</b> the <b>hollows</b> on {{fingers are}} as follows: {{prevention}} of ring deformation, geometrical restriction of a ring part, giving optimal mating force to a ring part. The first advantage is prevention of ring deformation. A ring part {{held by a}} robotic hand is deformed by grip force. This means that a clearance between a ring part and a shaft part disappears. On the other hand, a ring closed by <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> fingers does not receive grip force. Therefore, the proposed method {{can be applied to}} any material rings. The second advantage is geometrical restriction of a ring part. A position and an angle of a ring part are restricted by the <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> fingers. The successful condition of ring assembly θ<θ _m in the previous section is satisfied by the <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> fingers. This means that a ring part can be assembled without jamming.|$|R
