5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E
25|$|Gardner wrote {{papers that}} were {{primarily}} taxonomic, strategraphic or paleoecologic. Her published papers dealt mostly with coastal plain geology. Julia {{took part in}} fieldwork all over the world, including rougher locations such as those throughout Mexico. She spent weeks visiting and spending time in places that other geographers may not <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> visit. Her report on the “Mollusca from the Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Virginia and North Carolina” (Professional Paper 199-A), published in 1943, built partially {{on the work of}} Dr. W. C. Mansfield, and included work Gardner had started up to 20 years earlier. This report included systemic descriptions of over 40 families of mollusca, representing 24 superfamilies and four separate orders.|$|E

Freedom lives and through it he lives – {{in a way that}} humbles the undertakings of most men." [...] It is one of several memorials to local residents who served in the military.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth {{demanded of}} her Lieutenant-General to refrain at all cost from any decisive action with Parma, {{which was the}} {{opposite}} of what Leicester wished and what the Dutch expected of him. After some initial successes, the unexpected surrender of the strategically important town of Grave was a serious blow to English morale. Leicester's fury turned on the town's governor, Baron Hemart, whom he had executed despite all pleadings. The Dutch nobility were astonished: even the Prince of Orange would not <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> such an outrage, Leicester was warned; but, he wrote, he would not be intimidated by the fact that Hemart [...] "was of a good house".|$|E
500|$|Although A did not {{consider}} a full concert tour to promote Jackson's album, the label funded a three-week promotional tour across the United States in 13 cities following its release. In addition to the studio release, a remix album, , was released in select countries in November, 1987. Jackson's lyrical expression has been noted {{as one of the}} key elements of the album's success. Author Dave Marsh in The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made (1999) comments: [...] "Certainly, Janet must have written her own lyrics, which went after men—in particular, not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband—more venomously than another guy would <b>have</b> <b>dared.</b> Control, the resulting album, was one of the best-sellers of 1986–1987, producing five hit singles." ...|$|E
500|$|Opponents {{labelled}} Goldhagen as a [...] "anti-Catholic", as promoting an anti-Catholic agenda. Bottum {{wrote that}} its [...] "errors of fact combine {{to create a}} set of historical theses about the Nazis and the Catholic Church so tendentious that not even Pius XII's most determined belittlers <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to assert them. And, in Goldhagen's final chapters, the bad historical theses unite to form a complete anti-Catholicism {{the likes of which}} we haven't seen since the elderly H. G. Wells decided Catholicism was the root of all evil". In the Catholic News Service, Eugene J. Fisher, the Associate Director of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that Goldhagen avoided original research, as [...] "such methodological and factual considerations would definitely {{get in the way of}} the demonic portrait of the Church that he seeks to paint".|$|E

500|$|The {{author was}} well aware that his was the first {{cookbook}} in the Polish vernacular, which he made clear in the dedication. [...] "As no one before me has yet wished {{to present to the}} world such useful knowledge in our Polish language," [...] he wrote in his opening line, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>dared,</b> ... despite my ineptitude, to offer the Polish world my compendium ferculorum, or collection of dishes." [...] Polish bibliographer [...] maintained that Compendium ferculorum was preceded by Kuchmistrzostwo (Cooking Mastery), a 16th-century Polish translation of the Czech cookbook [...] (Cookery) written by [...] in 1535. However, no copies of this supposed translation have survived, except for facsimiles of two folios, published in 1891, of uncertain authenticity. Whatever the case, Czerniecki's work is without a doubt the oldest known cookbook published originally in Polish.|$|E
500|$|Three years earlier, in {{the review}} [...] "Mr. Kean's Iago" [...] in The Examiner (7 August 1814), Hazlitt had ventured to {{speculate}} that Iago's suggestions of lasciviousness in Desdemona may have had some basis in truth, as [...] "purity and grossness sometimes 'nearly are allied,/And thin partitions do their bounds divide. Although he omitted this thought from Characters of Shakespear's Plays, that did not stop an anonymous reviewer in Blackwood's Magazine from accusing him of calling Desdemona a [...] "lewd" [...] character. In [...] "A Reply to 'Z, written in 1818 but never published, Hazlitt answers his accuser: [...] "It is not true that I have insinuated that Desdemona was a lewd woman, any more than Shakespear has insinuated it, but I <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> {{to say that he}} alone could have given additional elegance and even delicacy to a female character from the very disadvantageous circumstances in which Desdemona is placed." ...|$|E
500|$|The wave of {{incorporations}} {{continued into}} 1895, with Cliffside Park gaining borough status in January. That month, Bergen County's school superintendent, John Terhune, wrote {{a report to}} Trenton, decrying that the law allowed borough petitioners to set the proposed lines to exclude opponents of incorporation, [...] "The idea of allowing a bare majority the power to accept or reject a few that <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to oppose the new fad, and for this simple expression of their rights to cut them from all school facilities is radically wrong and gross injustice. There is no defense for the injured, but they must meekly accept the situation. It is inconsistent with liberty, a term so dear to us all". Superintendent Terhune wrote that [...] "until the boroughing is done", {{it would not be}} possible to assess the many problems that the rapid subdivision had caused: [...] "I would not attempt to estimate, let alone approximate, the changes caused by the boroughs. It is simply inconceivable".|$|E

500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of Wall of Sound called Holy Wood their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. LA Weekly said that [...] "almost all [...] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they'll be terroristic in concert." [...] Hot Press praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that [...] "Holy Wood is a far better record than many would <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to expect." [...] Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they [...] "play tighter than [...] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort)... and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than the Limp Bizkits of the world." [...] The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of Rolling Stone commended him for [...] "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." [...] Billboard magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. Revolver editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: [...] "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics. Like Plastic Ono Band, Holy Wood screams with a primal fury that's evident even in its quietest moments." ...|$|E

[...] Churchill further added that while he might not <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to begin the military operation, nevertheless once having ordered it he would certainly not <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to stop it before it had achieved its objective. Without further guarantee, the Anglo-French Task Force had to finish withdrawing by 22 December 1956, {{to be replaced by}} Danish and Colombian units of the UNEF.|$|E

[...] Although once the Rebbe died, he didn’t {{see that as a}} possibility. Lamm also argued that messianists had misinterpreted Schneerson's {{statements}} to create a [...] "distortion" [...] leading to [...] "moral nihilism." [...] According to Lamm open efforts to declare Schneerson the messiah were not been tolerated before his death: [...] "When he was alive, no one would <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to discuss this. But now it is easy for the messianically-oriented to distort the Rebbe's teachings".|$|E
2500|$|Ali Abunimah, {{editor of}} the Electronic Intifada, writing in The Wall Street Journal, concludes [...] "President Carter has done what few American {{politicians}} <b>have</b> <b>dared</b> to do: speak frankly about the Israel–Palestine conflict. He has done this nation, {{and the cause of}} peace, an enormous service by focusing attention on what he calls [...] "the abominable oppression and persecution in the occupied Palestinian territories, with a rigid system of required passes and strict segregation between Palestine's citizens and Jewish settlers in the West Bank." [...] Calling Carter [...] "the most successful Arab-Israeli peace negotiator to date", Abunimah praises him for having [...] "braved a storm of criticism, including the insinuation from the pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League that his arguments are anti-Semitic." ...|$|E
