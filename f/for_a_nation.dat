5|$|Food {{power is}} an {{integral}} part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.|$|E
5|$|In March, Jinnah, {{despite his}} declining health, made his only post-independence visit to East Pakistan.

The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan strongly opposed this policy, and later in 1971 the official language issue {{was a factor in}} the region's secession to form the country of Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|From 1872 until 1879, the nationalities {{forming the}} bulk of the new {{settlers}} were composed of Portuguese (31.2%), Italians (25.8%), Germans (8.1%) and Spanish (1.9%). In the 1880s, Italians would surpass the Portuguese (61.8% to 23.3% respectively), and the Spanish would displace the Germans (6.7% to 4.2% respectively). Other, smaller groups also arrived, including Russians, Poles and Hungarians. Since nearly all European immigrants settled in the southeastern and southern areas of the Empire, ethnic distribution, already unequal before the mass immigration, became even more divergent between regions. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> that had a small, widely scattered population (4,000,000 in 1823 and 14,333,915 in 1890), the immigration of more than 1,380,000 Europeans had a tremendous effect upon the country's ethnic composition. In 1872, the year of the first reliable national census, white Brazilians represented just over a third (38.1%) of the total population; in 1890, they had increased to a little under half (44.0%) of all Brazilians.|$|E

25|$|Whatever {{residual}} fears many in England {{may have}} felt {{at the prospect of}} being ruled by a Scot, James's arrival aroused a mood of high expectation. The twilight years of Elizabeth had been a disappointment; and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> troubled for so many years by the question of succession, the new king was a family man who already had male heirs in the wing. But James's honeymoon was of very short duration; and his initial political actions were to do much to create the rather negative tone which was to turn a successful Scottish king into a disappointing English one. The greatest and most obvious of these was the question of his exact status and title. James intended to be King of Great Britain and Ireland. His first obstacle along this imperial road was the attitude of the English Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} version {{opts for}} {{a certain level of}} sovereignty, while remaining within the greater British Empire or Commonwealth. The Canadian Tories are such example. Canadian Tories were also strongly opposed to free trade with the U.S, fearing economic and cultural assimilatation. On the other hand, French Canadian nationalism has its roots as early as pre-confederation. Although a more accurate portrait of French Canadian nationalism is illustrated by such figures as Henri Bourassa {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. Bourassa advocated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> less reliant on Great Britain whether politically, economically or militarily, although he was not, at the same time, opting for a republic which was the case for the radical French-speaking reformers in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. Nor were Bourassa or others necessarily advocating for a provincial nationalism, i.e. for the separation of Quebec from Canada which became a strong component in Quebec politics during the Quiet Revolution and especially through the rise of the Parti Québécois in 1968.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> {{of eight}} million people, Canada's war effort was widely {{regarded}} as remarkable. A total of 619,636 men and women served in the Canadian forces in the First World War, and of these 59,544 were killed and another 154,361 were wounded. Canadian sacrifices are commemorated at eight memorials in France and Belgium. Two of the eight are unique in design: the giant white Vimy Memorial and the distinctive brooding soldier at the Saint Julien Memorial. The other six follow a standard pattern of granite monuments surrounded by a circular path: the Hill 62 Memorial and Passchendaele Memorial in Belgium, and the Bourlon Wood Memorial, Courcelette Memorial, Dury Memorial, and Le Quesnel Memorial in France. There are also separate war memorials to commemorate {{the actions of the}} soldiers of Newfoundland (which did not join Confederation until 1949) in the Great War. The largest are the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the National War Memorial in St. John's.|$|E

500|$|In a major address, Grant stated: [...] "The {{building}} of rail-roads and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral {{regions of the country}} is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not get on together, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations...and giving them absolute protection there." ...|$|E
500|$|The transcontinental {{railroad}} {{project was}} heavily subsidised by the government. The CPR was granted [...] of land {{along the route}} of the railroad, and $25,000,000 from the government. In addition, the government was pledged to build $32,000,000 of other railways to support the CPR. The entire project was extremely costly, especially <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> with only 4.1million people in 1881. Between 1880 and 1885, as the railway was slowly built, the CPR repeatedly came close to financial ruin. Not only was the terrain in the Rocky Mountains difficult, the route north of Lake Superior proved treacherous, as tracks and engines sank into the muskeg. When Canadian guarantees of the CPR's bonds failed to make them salable in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasury—the bill authorizing it passed the Senate just before the firm would have become insolvent.|$|E

500|$|The {{public had}} mixed {{opinions}} about Washington's Proclamation of Neutrality. Those who supported Madison and Jefferson {{were far more}} likely to be in support of the French Revolution, as they saw it as an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> to achieve liberty from tyrannical rule. However, {{there were a number of}} merchants who were extremely happy that the President decided to remain impartial to the revolution. They believed that if the government took a stance on the war, it would ruin their trade relations with the British completely. This economic element was a primary reason for many federalist supporters wanting to avoid increased conflict with the British. Hamilton supported the Proclamation of Neutrality, defending it under the pseudonym [...] "Pacificus."
