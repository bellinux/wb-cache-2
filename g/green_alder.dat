50|$|In close {{connection}} with the relief characteristics of the Parang mountains, the vegetation is clearly shaped into 3 layers. The first layer is the broadleaf forest, which starts {{from the bottom of}} the mountains and goes as high as 1200m (northern slope) and 1400m (southern slope). They are made up of pedunculate oak, european hornbeam, silver birch and, the most common, but mostly spread on the souther slope, the European beech.The second layer mostly extended on the northern and western slopes, between 1000m and 1750m, and is composed of norway spruce forests and, locally, european silver fir. In the Parang mountains, the tree line is situated between 1600m and 1800m.Above this limit are located the subalpine and Alpine grasslands. The vegetation here is made up of krummholz trees, such as swiss pine, european larch, mountain pine and net-leaved willow, but also mountain cranberry, <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> and bilberry.Also common are grass family members, such as bentgrass, tufted fescue and highland rush.

50|$|Management of mixedwoods in the Prairie Provinces in the 1990s usually used clearcutting. When aspen is {{the main}} species to be regenerated, little {{treatment}} {{is applied to the}} site, but slash piles, compaction of soil, and damage to aspen root systems are minimized as much as is feasible in order to encourage suckering. In the coniferous harvest, aspen that is not harvested is usually left standing to reduce suckering, {{as well as for the}} benefit of wildlife. Regeneration of white spruce is more difficult. In general, plantation techniques are used, with mechanical site preparation following clearcutting. Depending on site conditions and availability of equipment, disk trenching, double disking, blading, ripper, or Marttiini plowing, Bracke spot scarification, high-speed mixing, or spot mounding are used. Plantings of white spruce have come to favour the use of large container or transplant stock. In the early years after clearcutting, site preparation and planting, shade-intolerant vegetation, such as aspen, Calamagrostis canadensis, and <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> compete strongly with the young outplants, frequently causing death.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} sulphur dioxide on woody boreal forest species was {{investigated}} by Addison et al. (1984), who exposed plants growing on native soils and tailings to 15.2 μmol/m3 (0.34 ppm) of SO2 on CO2 assimilation rate (NAR). The Canadian maximum acceptable limit for atmospheric SO2 is 0.34 ppm. Fumigation with SO2 significantly reduced NAR in all species and produced visible symptoms of injury in 2-20 days. The decrease in NAR of deciduous species (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides, willow Salix, <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> Alnus viridis, and white birch Betula papyrifera) was significantly more rapid than of conifers (white spruce, black spruce Picea mariana, and jack pine Pinus banksiana) or an evergreen angiosperm (Labrador tea) growing on a fertilized Brunisol. These metabolic and visible injury responses {{seemed to be}} related to the differences in S uptake owing in part to higher gas exchange rates for deciduous species than for conifers. Conifers growing in oil sands tailings responded to SO2 with a significantly more rapid decrease in NAR compared with those growing in the Brunisol, perhaps because of predisposing toxic material in the tailings. However, sulphur uptake and visible symptom development did not differ between conifers growing on the 2 substrates.|$|E

40|$|Forest {{regrowth}} is {{an ongoing}} process in the European Alps. In the Unteralptal, a valley in central Switzerland, landscape characteristics show considerable change toward the encroachment of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus viridis (Chaix) DC. = Alnus alnobetula (Ehrh.) K. Koch). Initially, <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> was described to grow on moist, north-facing and steep slopes of high geomorphic activity. However, the recent spreading of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> described in several studies over the alpine arc questions the ecological habitat described in historic literature. Thus, a time series of aerial photographs and a digital elevation model (DEM) with a resolution of 2  m were used to find proxies for <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> encroachment. The cover of “new shrub areas” was analyzed based on relief parameter values and geomorphic landforms. The results show that <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> is spreading on more gentle slopes and well-drained areas, {{as well as on}} areas with lower geomorphic activity than anticipated. Thus, the habitat spectrum of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> is much wider than assumed and encroachment has potentially greater consequences for landscape ecology than expected...|$|E
40|$|Shrub {{encroachment}} by <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus viridis) {{has been}} an ongoing process in European mountain areas after land abandonment. The invasion of this N 2 -fixing and highly productive plant on former subalpine pastures and meadows changes the properties and interactions in the plant-soil system. In the national carbon inventory, {{it is assumed that}} <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> woodlands contain the same amount of SOC (~  69  t C ha −  1) as productive forests {{due to the lack of}} data. To explore the rarely studied change of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pools during the shrub establishment, the study used a chronosequence approach by testing pastures in a pre-encroached status and <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> stands with an age of 15, 25, 40 and 90  years, respectively. Besides the estimation of the SOC stock, the soil samples, taken in four different depth layers, were physically fractionated to characterize the quality of the SOC. While pasture grassland contained a median SOC stock (0 – 30  cm) of 100  t C ha −  1, the SOC stocks decreased to 81  t C ha −  1 for 40  years old shrub stands. The 90  years old <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> bushes showed the significantly highest C stock in the mineral soil with 174  t C ha −  1. <b>Green</b> <b>alder</b> encroachment led to an increase of the particulate organic material (POM) in the mineral soil resulting in a high concentration of unprotected carbon. By contrast, a stabilization of the SOC with the mineral soil phase was not visible during <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> establishment. The study concludes that <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> encroachment causes a significant increase of fresh and unprotected carbon in the soil system compared to subalpine pastures, resulting in a significantly higher total SOC stock (+  74  t C ha −  1) after 90  years and a doubling of the potential to leach dissolved organic carbon. At landscape level, the ingrowth and establishment of <b>green</b> <b>alder</b> on abandoned subalpine pastures can therefore influence the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Secondly, the SOC stocks of shrub forests are insufficiently represented in the current National Inventory Report...|$|E
