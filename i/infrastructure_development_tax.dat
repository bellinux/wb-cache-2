30|$|The {{research}} {{aimed at}} answering key {{questions regarding the}} use of ICTs among SMEs in their businesses with an analysis and consideration of the possible factors that enable ICTs to be valued, as drivers and the possible factors that deter them not to be recognised as business development agents to be the barriers. The research was conducted on a sample of 60 SMEs with no formal business registration and 40 SMEs with formal business registration with a response of 76.7 % and 87.5 % respectively. Results disclosed that ICTs are a major aspect in business operations, formally and informally with the major drivers happening to be the reduction in cost and ease of doing business. The major challenges were the expense at which ICTs come with and the poor ICT infrastructure. There is a relation between the investment in ICTs in businesses with the increase in productivity as 67.04 % of the respondents confirming the effect of implementation. The study recommends that Government fully implements the framework for ICTs laid in its Seventh National Development Plan (7 NDP) to make ICTs available for socio-economic <b>development</b> through <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development,</b> reduction on <b>taxes</b> laid on ICT related goods and through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) that seek to enhance the communication.|$|R

Further, the optimal <b>development</b> <b>tax</b> exceeds the (first-best) Pigouvian level, irrespective of whether or not revenues are returned lump-sum to all landowners or earmarked for urban decline mitigation. urban sprawl, <b>development</b> <b>taxes,</b> second-best policies, spatial modeling, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

The adapted gravity trade model presents associations of bilateral agro-food trade between OECD countries with traditional gravity equation variables and particularly with variables of the information and communication <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development.</b> Using the adapted gravity trade model we find a positive association between the information and communication <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development</b> and bilateral agro-food trade flows between OECD countries. This association is significantly stronger for agricultural than for food products.

The study makes use of three infrastructure indicators namely electricity production per capita, telephone mainlines density and energy consumption per capita to capture the effects of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development</b> on economic growth. The study employed the VAR approach to {{examine the impact of}} <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development</b> on economic growth. The study findings revealed that <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development</b> as measured by all three indicators has positive effect on economic growth in the short run. In the long run, the study results were mixed with electricity production and energy consumption indicators having positive effects and telephone mainlines density exhibiting negative effect.

The realization of APBDes in rural <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development</b> has three models: first, infrastructures developed by rural district, second, infrastructures developed in RT (neighborhood association-the lowest administrative unit) area under village chief coordination and third, tertiary irrigation infrastructure by P 3 A (association of farmers using water). Since 2007 - 2008, the budget allocation is effectively used more or less 16 % from the DAD (Village Allocation Budget) for <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development.</b> The DAD application shows that the improvement is lower compared to the higher DAD. Before and after the DAD enactment, <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development</b> has shown the same raising. Therefore, the raising of DAD in APBDes does not directly influence the raising of rural <b>infrastructure</b> <b>development</b> because of its little proportion and for {{it serves as a}} stimulus to the community self-supporting.
