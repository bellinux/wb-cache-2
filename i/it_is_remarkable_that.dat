5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Victoria Cross or VC is {{the highest}} and most prestigious award for gallantry {{in the face of}} the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> a village the size of Harefield is {{associated}} with three VC recipients. Two booklets in the Reference section of Harefield library give details of the three recipients of the award.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> {{two of the}} {{pioneering}} studies were on malaria. The classical studies on the Toll receptor in Drosophila fruit fly were rapidly extended to Toll-like receptors in mammals and then to other pattern recognition receptors, which play important roles in innate immunity. However, the early contributions on malaria remain as classical examples of innate resistance, which have {{stood the test of}} time.|$|E
60|$|She {{gripped the}} iron rail {{of the seat}} as if to leap from it, but checked herself {{suddenly}} and leaned back, with a set smile on her mouth that seemed stamped there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> with that smile she flung away her old affectation of superciliousness for an older and ruder audacity, and that not only the expression, but the type of her face appeared to have changed.|$|R
40|$|Circular dichroism {{studies are}} {{reported}} on the conformation of cucumber mosaic virus particles and of their isolated components. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the satellite RNA seemed to have less order than genomic RNA and also had a destructuring influence on {{the organization of the}} genomic RNA inside the virion...|$|R
50|$|In {{international}} cricket, because {{players can}} {{be taken out of}} the squad due to injuries, bad discipline, poor form, or even illegal bowling action or unfavourable conditions against certain bowlers, especially spin bowlers, even for Shane Warne or Muttiah Muralitharan, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> players to start more the 90 test matches are batsmen.|$|R
25|$|Although Tacitus {{wrote the}} Histories before the Annals, {{the events in}} the Annals precede the Histories; {{together}} they form a continuous narrative from the death of Augustus (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the Annals survived in a single copy of a manuscript from Corvey Abbey, and the second half from a single copy of a manuscript from Monte Cassino, and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> they survived at all.|$|E
25|$|Tillemont and Le Beau {{regard the}} revolt of Illus {{as an attempt}} to re-establish paganism; but for this view there seems no foundation. We do not know that Illus was a pagan, though Pamprepius was one: {{it is more likely that}} Illus was a man of no fixed {{religious}} principles, and that his revolt originated either in ambition, or in a conviction that his only prospect of safety from the intrigues of his enemies and the suspicions of Zeno was the dethronement of the emperor. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> Edward Gibbon does not mention the name of Illus, and scarcely notices his revolt.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> {{the inner}} {{heartwood}} of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since {{in many cases}} it is hundreds, {{and in a few}} instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the epidemiology, clinical aspects, and therapeutic methods of echinococcosis {{in a series}} of 21 pediatric patients, referred to a teaching hospital in Isfahan during the last 6 years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the lungs <b>were</b> more prone to echinococcosis in children (13. 21) than in adults, which show a prevalence of liver involvement...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> no one sneered at him again, and {{in these}} days of arrogance {{peculiar}} to the upper classes this was all the more noticeable, as these secret clubs were thought to be very exclusive, the resort pre-eminently of gentlemen and noblemen who were anti-Puritan, anti-Republican, and very jealous of their ranks and privileges.|$|R
6000|$|Ellangowan rode pensively home; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> he did {{not mention}} this {{interview}} to any of his family. The groom was not so reserved; he told the story at great length to a full audience in the kitchen, and concluded by swearing, that 'if ever the devil spoke by the mouth of a woman, he had spoken by that of Meg Merrilies that blessed day.' ...|$|R
25|$|The fast-growing {{broadcasting}} industry {{after the}} Second World War drove {{deeper understanding of}} the crystallography, phase transitions and the chemical and mechanical optimization of the ceramic materials. Through the complex mixture of different basic materials, the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors can be precisely adjusted. To distinguish the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors, standardization defined several different application classes (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the separate development during the War and the time afterwards in the US and the European market had led to different definitions of these classes (EIA vs IEC), and only recently (since 2010) has a worldwide harmonization to the IEC standardization taken place.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the Maya, {{who had no}} metal tools, created many {{objects from}} a very thick and dense material, jade (jadeite), {{particularly}} all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as belt plaques - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king Pakal, covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from mother-of-pearl and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of Dutch industry and agriculture was a defensive realignment in three directions. First, {{there was a}} shift in the product mix to higher value products (for instance more luxury textile products, livestock fattening instead of dairy farming). This was of necessity a self-limiting solution, as it made exporting even more difficult, so this response led to a further contraction of the sectors in question. The second response was investment in labor-saving means of production. However, this required a level of technological innovation that apparently was no longer attainable. (In this respect <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the number of patents granted in the Netherlands was remarkably lower in this period than {{in the first half of}} the 17th century.) Besides, this type of reorientation in investment was undercut by a third response: outsourcing of industrial production to areas with a lower wage level, like the Generality Lands, which solved the high-wage problem in a different way, but also contributed to deindustralization in the maritime provinces.|$|E
2500|$|Stanford University Press {{recently}} released a five-volume {{collection of the}} complete works of Robinson Jeffers. In an article titled, [...] "A Black Sheep Joins the Fold", written upon {{the release of the}} collection in 2001, Stanford Magazine commented <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that,</b> due to a number of circumstances, [...] "there was never an authoritative, scholarly edition of California’s premier bard" [...] until the complete works published by Stanford.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> {{during the}} whole interview, each had endeavoured to catch stolen glances of the other's face, and had never looked full at it. They interchanged one brief and hasty glance as Hugh went out, averted their eyes directly, and so separated. Hugh closed the double doors behind him, {{carefully}} and without noise; and Mr Chester remained in his easy-chair, with his gaze intently fixed upon the fire.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable,</b> <b>that</b> {{several of}} our very richest tradesmen of the city, in common charity, gave away shillings and sixpences to the beggars who plied {{about the church}} doors; and at a {{particular}} church in the city, a wealthy church-warden with his own hands distributed fifty twelve-penny loaves to the poor, by way of restitution for the many great and costly feasts, which he had eaten of at their expense.|$|R
500|$|Sedimentation of the Colorado River Delta {{directed}} {{water into}} the Lake Cahuilla area. Distributaries in a river delta are inherently unstable and tend to change course often. Major floods may have triggered the change in river course, {{although most of the}} flood events in the prehistoric record {{do not appear to be}} associated with diversions to Lake Cahuilla. Given that the slope toward Lake Cahuilla is steeper than the one toward the Gulf of California, once the river entered the basin it likely stabilized on that course. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> this slope difference doesn't regularly cause the river to enter the Salton Trough. The diversion occurred close to the apex of the Colorado River Delta and would have discharged water directly through the Alamo River and indirectly through Volcano Lake and the New River. The infilling of the lake may have been a catastrophic flood, considering that native people fled the Imperial Valley to the mountains. Infilling to an altitude of [...] above sea level would have taken 20–12 years. When the lake was full, the Colorado River would have entered it at the southeastern side.|$|E
500|$|Massengale argues that, {{given that}} music is so {{important}} in the Epistles, and that Bellman had more than enough musical skill to write a tune, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> all or almost all the tunes are borrowed. He suggests that this [...] "seems to indicate that Bellman wanted to preserve some vestige of the borrowing." [...] That the borrowing was not just about saving effort or making up for absent skill, Massengale argues, is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} the amount of work Bellman had to put into the melodies for Epistles 12 ("Gråt Fader Berg och spela") and 24 ("Kära Syster!") was [...] "surely tantamount to the production of new melodies." [...] Borrowing was accepted, even encouraged at the time, but that does not explain why Bellman would have done it so consistently. The [...] "poetic possibility", Massengale suggests, is that Bellman wished to exploit the humorous contrast between a melody of one type and a story of another, or between an existing image associated with the melody, and a fresh one presented in an Epistle. In addition, Bellman was able to use what his audience knew to be borrowed music to reinforce the historical flavour of the Epistles, introducing exactly the kind of ambiguity that he was seeking.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} at Chawton, Jane Austen {{published}} four generally well received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish Sense and Sensibility, {{which appeared in}} October 1811. Reviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's earnings from Sense and Sensibility provided her with some financial and psychological independence. Egerton then published Pride and Prejudice, a revision of First Impressions, in January 1813. He advertised the book widely {{and it was an}} immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. By October 1813 Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition. Mansfield Park was published by Egerton in May 1814. While Mansfield Park was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen's earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels. Unknown to Austen, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented that given the prevailing rage in France at the time was for lush romantic fantasies, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. However, King cautioned that Austen's chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of [...] "imitations" [...] than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when Persuasion was published in 1821 as La Famille Elliot ou L'Ancienne Inclination.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} dress. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the {{answering}} noise on board my ship {{together with the}} patter of feet above my head ceased suddenly. But I heard more remote guttural cries which seemed to express surprise and annoyance. Then the voice of my mate reached me howling expostulations to somebody at a distance. Other voices joined, apparently indignant; a chorus of something that sounded like abuse replied. Now and then the steam-whistle screeched.|$|R

6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> Mary {{discouraged}} all proselytising {{towards the}} Protestants of her train, and even forbore {{to make any}} open attempt on her daughter's faith. [...] "Cela viendra," [...] she said to Marie de Courcelles. [...] "The sermons of M. le Pasteur will do more to convert her to our side than a hundred controversial arguments of our excellent Abbe; and when the good time comes, one High Mass {{will be enough to}} win her over." ...|$|R
2500|$|While both {{explanations}} are probably valid to some extent, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> the first [...] "modern" [...] system of chemical nomenclature {{appeared at the}} same time as the distinction (by Lavoisier) between elements and compounds, in the late eighteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|... 'This is {{a hugely}} {{significant}} find.

60|$|That {{she hung}} her head, was certain. She {{urged him to}} go away, she {{commanded}} him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor raised <b>it.</b> Yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> she sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life. Her hands rested in one another, like {{the hands of a}} statue; and even her manner of speaking was not hurried.|$|R
60|$|Both {{men were}} awake early, silent with the premonition of trouble ahead, {{thoughtful}} {{of the fact}} that the time for the long-planned action <b>was</b> at hand. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> a man as loquacious as Euchre could hold his tongue so long; and this was significant of the deadly nature of the intended deed. During breakfast he said a few words customary in the service of food. At the conclusion of the meal he seemed to come to an end of deliberation.|$|R
60|$|In this wise they {{proceeded}} {{for a few}} minutes, {{until they}} entered a beautiful and moonlit lake. In the distance was mountainous country. Alroy examined his companion {{with a feeling of}} curiosity not unmixed with terror. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> Alroy could never succeed in any way in attracting his notice. The Afrite seemed totally unconscious of the presence of his passenger. At length the boat reached the opposite shore of the lake, and the Prince of the Captivity debarked.|$|R
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> Old Norse legend {{occasionally}} mentions certain men who, {{turning away}} in utter disgust and doubt from the heathen faith, placed their reliance {{on their own}} strength and virtue.

2500|$|Gerhard Bechtold {{proposes to}} use terra preta for soils that show, at [...] depth, a minimum {{proportion}} {{of organic matter}} over 2.0-2.5%. The accumulation of organic matter in moist tropical soils is a paradox, because of optimum conditions for organic matter degradation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> anthrosols regenerate {{in spite of these}} tropical conditions' prevalence and their fast mineralisation rates. The stability of organic matter is mainly due to the biomass being only partially consumed.|$|E
500|$|Poulton {{discusses}} {{sexual selection}} in birds, butterflies and moths, and spiders, which he treats as another process alongside but supordinate to natural selection, with arguments against {{the views of}} Alfred Russel Wallace. He notes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>remarkable</b> <b>that</b> biological research since Darwin had focussed mainly on comparative anatomy and embryology, whereas Darwin himself was interested in [...] "questions which concern the living animal as a whole", and observes that there are [...] "comparatively few true naturalists", as opposed to [...] "anatomists, microscopists, systematists, or collectors".|$|R
