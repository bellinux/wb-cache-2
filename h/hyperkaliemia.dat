25|$|Myocardial {{cells are}} exposed to {{different}} environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial ischaemia. In conditions such as myocardial ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K+ concentration, the increased external K+ concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis. When myocardial cell {{are exposed to}} <b>hyperkaliemia,</b> the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized {{as a result of}} the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mediterranean diet is {{characterized}} by low to moderate consumption of animal protein and high consumption of fruits, vegetables, bread, beans, nuts, seeds and other cereals. It {{has been associated with}} reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. However, it is not suitable for chronic kidney disease because of high potassium intake. Discussion Tunisia is an emerging Mediterranean country with limited resources, a high prevalence of chronic hemodialysis treatment and high dialysis expenditures. In order to limit dialysis cost, primary and secondary prevention of chronic renal disease are of paramount importance. In addition to drugs, secondary prevention includes diet measures (e. g. salt diet, protein diet). The aims of diet practice in chronic kidney disease are to slow chronic renal failure progression and to prevent its complications like hyperphosphatemia and <b>hyperkaliemiae.</b> A few decades ago, a Tunisian diet was exclusively Mediterranean, and protein consumption was not excessive. However, today, protein consumption is more comparable to western countries. Salt consumption is also excessive. Some Tunisian diets still include food with high potassium intake, which are not suitable for patients with chronic kidney disease. Therefore, the role of the dietician is extremely important to help calculate and create a dietary regimen tailored to each of our patients. Summary Advice about diets should be adapted to both the patient and population habits to improve adherence rate. As such, {{the purpose of this article}} is to provide our own experience regarding medical nutrition therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease in Tunisia, with some changes in food habits. Prevention is far better than treatment. In this perspective, dietary measures must be at the core of our intervention...|$|R
40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} (CHF) has kept its {{progressive}} nature despite significant advances in therapy. With more advanced disease, medical therapy is broadened. Even so, some patients re-main severely symptomatic. However, before ad-ditional action is taken, {{it should be}} regarded if therapy really fails. Often, therapy is not increased sufficiently because of assumed rather than actual intolerability. Thus, increase in serum creatinine up to 30 – 50 %, <b>hyperkaliemia</b> up to 5. 5 mmol/l, and asymptomatic hypotension and bradycardia are usually acceptable. Cautious and slow start and uptitration are the more important the more se-vere heart failure is, but these patients also profit most from this therapy. If patients remain severel...|$|E

30|$|The co-infusion of {{arginine}} and lysine solution during ERT is clinically well tolerated but {{leads to}} severe <b>hyperkaliemia</b> in {{a majority of}} patients. We have shown here that hyperkalemia is paralleled by severe metabolic acidosis most likely caused by increased hydrogen production through the infusion of cationic amino acids and potassium shift to the extracellular space. However, our data lack final proof on the sequence of these changes. Prospective clinical trials with serial measurements of electrolytes and acid-base status during the AA or placebo infusion in patients undergoing ERT are warranted to address this issue. However, we are convinced that our data back the approach to treat patients with oral or i.v. bicarbonate to correct acidosis and subsequently hyperkalemia very early during the AA infusion. Bicarbonate administration might even be considered prior to AA infusion to load bicarbonate buffer before hydrogen challenge.|$|E
40|$|Patients with end stage {{renal failure}} (ESRF) present {{a number of}} {{challenges}} to the anesthesiologist.

To safely manage these patients we need to understand the benefits and limitations of dialysis, problems related with primary disease, pathophysiological effects of ESRF, and the altered pharmacology of commonly used anesthetic agents and perioperative medications in ESRF. Problems encountered by anesthesiologist in ESRF patients include hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, anemia, metabolic acidosis, <b>hyperkaliemia,</b> hyponatremia and circulatory collapse.

40|$|Introduction. Clinical {{picture of}} severe glyphosatesurfactant {{poisoning}} is manifested by gastroenteritis, respiratory disturbances, altered mental status, hypotension refractory to the treatment, renal failure, shock. Single case report indicated possible neurotoxic sequels of glyphosatesurfactant exposure with white matter lesions {{and development of}} Parkinsonism. We described a patient with massive white matter damage which led to vigil coma and lethal outcome. Case report. A 56 -year old woman ingested about 500 mL of herbicide containing glyphosate isopropylamine salt. The most prominent manifestation of poisoning included hypotension, coma, <b>hyperkaliemia,</b> respiratory and renal failure. The patient was treated {{in intensive care unit}} by symptomatic and supportive therapy including mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The patient survived the acute phase of poisoning, but she developed vigil coma. Nuclear magnetic imagining revealed extensive bilateral lesions of the brain stem white matter and pons. Conclusion. The outcome of reported poisoning may be the consequence of glyphosate-surfactant neurotoxic effect or/and ischemia, especially in the episodes of marked hypotension during hemodialysis. Considering recommendation of early hemodialysis as the treatment of choice, even before renal failure development, we point out the importance of careful planning of dialysis modality in hemodynamically instable patient and recommend continuous dialysis methods...|$|E
40|$|Among athletic/sports animals, {{the horse}} {{has a unique}} ability to {{increase}} its oxygen uptake {{by a factor of}} 60 during heavy exercise. This is achieved by physiological adaptations of all the links in the oxygen chain. Ventilation is increased by a factor of 30. Since the horse is a compulsory nasal breather, this hyperpnea necessitates high transmural pressure changes, which may be responsible for the dynamic collapse of the airways. Blood flow is increased by a factor of 10. Since the left ventricle is not very compliant, this increase necessitates a high filling pressure in the pulmonary circulation, which may induce capillary stress failure and exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage. Lastly, oxygen transport is improved by splenic contraction which increases haemoglobinemia by 50 %. Sports horses frequently suffer from several problems, which are related either to endogenous or exogenous stresses experienced during their career. These stresses, caused by the use of the horse as a competition animal, may lead to several medical problems. At a systemic level, endogenous stresses include <b>hyperkaliemia,</b> lactacidemia, and hyperthermia; oxidative stress may induce problems at a general, and/or a pulmonary level. External factors, e. g. poor quality of inspired air, transport, hot and humid ambient conditions, and microbiological agents, may also induce abnormal body attacks, and lead to health problems.

40|$|Aldosterone-dependent {{epithelial}} sodium transport in {{the distal}} nephron is {{mediated by the}} absorption of sodium through the highly selective, amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) made of three homologous subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma). In human, autosomal recessive mutations of alpha, beta, or gammaENaC subunits cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA- 1), a renal salt-wasting syndrome characterized by severe hypovolemia, high plasma aldosterone, hyponatremia, life-threatening <b>hyperkaliemia,</b> and metabolic acidosis. In the mouse, inactivation of alphaENaC results in failure to clear fetal lung liquid at birth and in early neonatal death, preventing the observation of a PHA- 1 renal phenotype. Transgenic expression of alphaENaC driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter in alphaENaC(-/-) knockout mice [alphaENaC(-/-) Tg] rescued the perinatal lethal pulmonary phenotype and partially restored Na+ transport in renal, colonic, and pulmonary epithelia. At days 5 - 9, however, alphaENaC(-/-) Tg mice showed clinical features of severe PHA- 1 with metabolic acidosis, urinary salt-wasting, growth retardation, and 50 % mortality. Adult alphaENaC(-/-) Tg survivors exhibited a compensated PHA- 1 with normal acid/base and electrolyte values but 6 -fold elevation of plasma aldosterone compared with wild-type littermate controls. We conclude that partial restoration of ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption in this transgenic mouse results in a mouse model for PHA- 1...|$|E

We present a boy with AHC who came {{at the age of}} 25 days in a severe state due to prolonged vomiting and progressive dehydration. Laboratory studies showed prominent hyponatremia and <b>hyperkaliemia</b> but not hypoglycemia. Primary adrenal insufficiency was confirmed with low serum cortisol levels and high plasma ACTH levels. Hydrocortisone therapy combined with saline and glucose infusions was started immediately after blood collection. Two exons of the NR 0 B 1 (DAX 1) gene were impossible to amplify using the standard PCR method. Array CGH was used to confirm the putative copy-number variation of NR 0 B 1 (DAX 1) revealing a novel hemizygous deletion encompassing the entire NR 0 B 1 (DAX 1) gene together with the MAGEB genes. This genetic defect was also present in heterozygosity in the patient’s mother. We show that NR 0 B 1 (DAX 1) gene analysis is important for confirmation of AHC diagnosis and highlights the role of genetic counseling in families with AHC patients, particularly those with X chromosome microdeletions, covering more than NR 0 B 1 (DAX 1) alone.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Recent {{guidelines}} for preterm parenteral nutrition (PN) recommend an earlier and higher intake of amino acids (AA) {{and energy to}} avoid postnatal catabolism and approximate normal foetal growth. Few investigations explored how early PN may affect electrolyte and water homeostasis. We performed a prospective observational trial to assess the effect of nutrient intake on electrolyte homeostasis and balance. Methods: During 16 months all infants ≤ 32 weeks were eligible. In {{the first week of}} life we recorded daily: electrolytes (plasma and 8 -hour urine collection), nutritional intake, urine output, body weight and we calculated sodium (Na) and potassium (K) balance. Infants were divided, for analysis, into 3 groups of AA intake: Low 2 g/kg/day (HAA). Results: 154 infants were included. HAA group presented lower weight loss. Na balance was influenced by urine output and postnatal age, with little contribution of nutrition. Kalemia and K balance were mainly influenced by AA intake. K balance differed among groups: LAA - 2. 3 mol/kg/wk, MAA 1. 1 mmol/kg/wk and HAA 2. 6 mmol/kg/wk (p< 0. 0001). In the HAA group plasma and urine K were significantly lower and non-oliguric <b>hyperkaliemia</b> was reduced. Discussion: Na homeostasis was very slight modified by early nutrition, suggesting that a negative Na balance is obligatory after birth. We showed that AA intake strongly affects K balance, minimize hyperkalemia and reduces weight loss. As K balance is strictly linked to cellular metabolism, we speculate that early nutrition may inhibit cellular catabolism and reduce the contraction of intracellular water compartment...|$|E

Sofosbuvir (SOF), Daclatasvir (DCV) and Simeprevir (SMV) have been recently approved in Europe but there are limited data on the use of these drugs in the treatment of very difficult-to-treat patients with severe HCV. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with either severe HCV recurrence after LT, listed for LT or having severe extra-hepatic manifestations receiving SOF with SMV, DCV, Peginterferon (PegIFN) + ribavirin (RBV) or RBV in compassionate use or medical need in Belgium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatments. Results: 42 patients were enrolled in this data collection: 14 cirrhotics listed for LT, 17 LT recipients with severe recurrence, 8 with severe extra-hepatic manifestations, 2 decompensated cirrhotic patients, 1 cirrhotic IFN ineligible patient. 25 patients had clinical liver decompensation. SOF was administered in combination with SMV, DCV and RBV alone in 9, 17 and 5 cases, respectively. Four patients received SOF, DCV and RBV. SOF was administrated with PegIFN and RBV in 3 cases. The majority of the patients were male (72. 5 %). Median age was 55 [51. 2 - 66. 7] years. Genotype distribution was: genotype 1 (n= 34), 2 (n= 1), 3 (n= 6) or 5 (n= 1). In listed for LT and post-LT patients, median MELD and Child-Pugh scores were 13. 7 [10. 1 - 19. 5] and 8 [5. 5 - 10]. 6 patients have completed the treatment course and 31 are still on therapy. W 4 and W 12 HCV RNA undetectable was 20 % (4 / 20) and 71, 4 % (10 / 14) respectively. End of treatment response was 100 % (5 / 5) (1 viral load is ongoing) and SVR 12 was 100 % (2 / 2).

40|$|Background: Pulseless {{electrical}} activity (PEA) cardiac arrest {{is defined as}} a cardiac arrest (CA) presenting with a residual organized {{electrical activity}} on the electrocardiogram. In the last decades, the incidence of PEA has regularly increased, compared to other types of CA like ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. PEA is frequently induced by reversible conditions. The " 4 (or 5) H" & " 4 (or 5) T" are proposed as a mnemonic to asses for Hypoxia, Hypovolemia, Hypo- /Hyperkalaemia, Hypothermia, Thrombosis (cardiac or pulmonary), cardiac Tamponade, Toxins, and Tension pneumothorax. Other pathologies (intracranial haemorrhage, severe sepsis, myocardial contraction dysfunction) have been identified as potential causes for PEA, but their respective probability and frequencies are unclear and they are not yet included into the resuscitation guidelines. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the aetiologies of PEA out-of-hospital CA, in order to evaluate the relative frequencies of each cause and therefore to improve the management of patients suffering a PEA cardiac arrest. Method: This retrospective study was based on data routinely and prospectively collected for each PEMS intervention. All adult patients treated from January 1 st 2002 to December 2012 31 st by the PEMS for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with PEA as the first recorded rhythm, and admitted to the emergency department (ED) of the Lausanne University Hospital were included. The aetiologies of PEA cardiac arrest were classified into subgroups, based on the classical H&T's classification, supplemented by four other subgroups analysis: trauma, intra-cranial haemorrhage (ICH), non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NIC) and undetermined cause. Results: 1866 OHCA were treated by the PEMS. PEA was the first recorded rhythm in 240 adult patients (13. 8 %). After exclusion of 96 patients, 144 patients with a PEA cardiac arrest admitted to the ED were included in the analysis. The mean age was 63. 8 ± 20. 0 years, 58. 3 % were men and the survival rate at 48 hours was 29 %. 32 different causes of OHCA PEA were established for 119 patients. For 25 patients (17. 4 %), we were unable to attribute a specific cause for the PEA cardiac arrest. Hypoxia (23. 6 %), acute coronary syndrome (12. 5 %) and trauma (12. 5 %) were the three most frequent causes. Pulmonary embolism, Hypovolemia, Intoxication and <b>Hyperkaliemia</b> occurs in less than 10 % of the cases (7. 6 %, 5. 6 %, 3. 5 %, respectively 2. 1 %). Non ischemic cardiomyopathy and intra-cranial haemorrhage occur in 8. 3 % and 6. 9 %, respectively. Conclusions: According to our results, intra-cranial haemorrhage and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy represent noticeable causes of PEA in OHCA, with a prevalence equalling or exceeding the frequency of classical 4 H's and 4 T's aetiologies. These two pathologies are potentially accessible to simple diagnostic procedures (native CT-scan or echocardiography) and should be included into the 4 H's and 4 T's mnemonic...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{the present}} review is to collect {{information}} concerning membrane effects induced by lindane intoxication, a y isomer of hexachiorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) that has been largely used as an insecticide and disinfectant in agriculture and entered also {{in the composition of}} some lotions, creams and shampoos used against parasites (lice and scabies). Absorbed through respiratory, digestive or transcutaneous pathways, lindane accumulates within lipid rich tissues. Lindane accumulation depends on the duration of the exposure and affects tissues in the following order: adipose tissues > brain > kidney > muscle > lungs > heart > liver > blood. Whatever the mode of lindane absorption, it accumulates in blood and is distributed throughout the body. It may affect human health by exerting systemic, immunologic, teratogenic, and/or cancerogenic effects. The symptoms of lindane intoxication are different according to the mode of intoxication, acute or chronic. The absorption of high doses of gamma-HCH is particularly toxic for the central nervous system and for the female and male reproduction apparatus in mammals where lindane is considered as an endocrine disruptor. Lindane is highly lipophilic and incorporates into biological membranes according to the following sequence: mitochondria > sarcoplasmic reticulum > myelin > brain microsomes > erythrocytes. Lindane exerts a stimulating action on synaptic transmission and inhibits the chloride current activated by gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) of many muscular and nervous preparations by interacting with the receptors GABA-chloride channel complex. It seems to affect calcium homeostasis of many tissues. The similarity between lindane and inositol (1, 4, 5) phosphate (IP 3) suggested that lindane releases Ca 2 + from IP 3 -sensitive intracellular stores in macrophages and myometrial cells. Ca 2 + release from reticulum endoplasmic, mitochondria and other Ca 2 + stores has been reported in cat kidney cells. Lindane altered energetic metabolism of hepatic mitochondria and the inositol-phosphate synthesis in neuronal cells. However, lindane does not compete with the IP 3 receptor. Lindane produces a Ca 2 + influx in mice peritoneal macrophage cells responsible for the Ca 2 + induced Ca 2 + release produced by phospholipase C via IP 3 pathway and resulting in a maintained increase of the free cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. Lindane decreased the membrane erythrocyte and cerebral cell concentration of phosphatidyl inositol PI, PIP and PIP 2 in rats repetitively exposed to lindane for 3 or 6 months. Lindane induces oxidative stress; it modifies the activity of the scavenger enzymes. This effect is involved in the inhibition of intercellular gap junctions. Modifications of the electrocardiogram (ECG), sinusal rhythm alteration and negative and dysphasic variations of T wave, similar to those produced by <b>hyperkaliemia,</b> have been reported after lindane absorption. During acute lindane poisoning, the activities of serum transaminases (SGOT, SGTP), and lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) increase. Lindane produces histological alterations of cardiac tissues and a cardio-vascular dystrophy (contracture, degenerescence and necrosis) mainly in the left ventricular wall and a hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Chronic application of residual doses of lindane shortened the action potential duration in rat papillary muscle. These effects were similar to those induced by hyperthyroidism. Lindane increases the triiodothyronine (T 3) serum level in hyperthyroid rats. T 3 {{plays an important role in}} the postnatal development of the rat ventricle by increasing the density of potassium channels which contribute to action potential shortening during the development. Thyroid hormones influence the regulation and the expression of messengers ARN which encode different potassium channels involved in action potential repolarization (Kvl. 2; Kvl. 4; Kvl. 5; Kv 2. 1; Kv 4; HCN 2). The thyrotropine-releasing hormone (TRH) modulates the HERG-type rapid delayed potassium channel (IKr) encoded by the human gene ether-a-go-go in rat anterior pituitary cells GH 3 /B 6. This channel is involved in the cardiac long QT syndrome. TRH modifies the current kinetics of human HERG potassium channel co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the TRH receptor, whose activity is modulated via the protein kinase C pathway linked to a G protein-coupled receptor and is regulated by changes in the PIP 2 concentration in the membrane. IKr channels regulation is also dependent on sexual hormones. In conclusion, lindane affects the excitable membranes and the cardio circulatory system. These alterations (may) represent a potential risk for human health...|$|E
