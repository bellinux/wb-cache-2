2500|$|In 1951, {{construction}} of a new <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> required a section of the motor circuit's famous Byfleet Banking to be removed to allow Vickers Valiant V bombers to be flown out to nearby Wisley Airfield [...] which offered a longer runway and less built-up surroundings than Brooklands. This airfield opened as a flight test centre for Vickers in 1944 and used until 1972 (latterly by the BAC).|$|E

50|$|Denham Aerodrome was {{established}} during the 1930s and is sited on higher {{land to the}} north of the village. It is the base of many private and executive aircraft and helicopters and has several hangars and a <b>hard</b> <b>runway.</b>|$|E
50|$|The aerodrome is {{strategically}} important. The {{growth of}} {{commercial air transport}} at Southampton Airport some years ago left it with no capacity for general aviation (GA) aircraft. This leaves Lee-on-Solent as the only airfield in southern Hampshire with a <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> available for general aviation; the nearest alternative in Hampshire being Farnborough Airfield.|$|E
50|$|The grass {{airfield}} {{was first}} used by the Royal Air Force during 1941 and 1942 for use by Handley Page Hampden aircraft from nearby RAF Scampton, and was officially opened as a RAF Station in September 1942 as part of RAF Bomber Command with the building of three <b>hard</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1939, {{the field}} was put under the {{authority}} of the Air Ministry and turned into an RAF base. The field was improved with <b>hard</b> <b>runways,</b> hangars, and other buildings, and became one of fourteen airfields ranging from Iceland to North Yorkshire administered by No. 18 Group, RAF Coastal Command, whose headquarters was at Pitreavie, Fife.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was built}} in 1939, necessitating the demolition of Lyneham Court manor house, the buildings of Cranley Farm and the village's tennis courts. The airfield itself was initially a grass landing area although the RAF always planned to lay <b>hard</b> <b>runways.</b> Hangars and other buildings were dispersed around the site to avoid creating one large target for an aerial enemy.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> {{was laid}} in 1947. Expansion of the {{facilities}} was called for by rapid development of military and civil jet aircraft such as the Vampire and Comet. The factory was enlarged and a new flight test hangar and control tower was constructed. Additionally, a large design block was constructed alongside the administration buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1999, the aerodrome sought {{planning}} permission for a <b>hard</b> <b>runway,</b> which {{was intended to}} allow operations to continue over the winter, when the grass runways often become waterlogged. In February 2010, the final inspection of the newly completed all-weather <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> {{was carried out by}} the CAA who confirmed that it could be licensed for use. The organizations STARE (Stop The Aerodrome Runway Expansion) and CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England) campaigned against this change, arguing that it would lead to more and larger aircraft flying over the area and disturb its [...] "rural tranquility".Permission was granted for the runway on 22 November 2007 by the Department for Transport, and though campaigners vowed to fight the decision they were unsuccessful and construction of the runway began in 2008. It opened during summer 2009 and enabled safe operations during the winter of 2009/2010 and onwards.|$|E

50|$|In 1941, <b>hard</b> <b>runways</b> {{were put}} {{down with the}} main runway, 04/22, being 2,000 yards, and the subsidiaries, 12/30 at 1,300 yards and 16/34 at 1,400 yards. Another 100 yards was added to runway 16/34. Hardstands for 36 {{aircraft}} were built, along with two T-2s and a B-1 hangar. One T-2 was on the technical site, the other hangars to the east across the A1065 Mildenhall-Brandon road were reached by taxiways.|$|R

50|$|In 1916 {{the first}} <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> {{was built on}} this site (now runway 08/26), the first {{terminal}} would open at the airport {{a few years later}} in 1937. The terminal had a size 200m². In 1975 the runway was extended to its current 3,015 m. A year later in 1976 the airport had a category 3 ILS system installed.The current terminal was built in 1992.|$|E
50|$|With {{the end of}} {{military}} control Old Buckenham has largely been converted back to agriculture {{with much of the}} concrete areas being ground into aggregate and being sold in the Norwich area. Today several original buildings and concrete pads remain at the site, the majority of which form part of Old Buckenham Airport an active 126 acre airfield site with one <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> and two grass strips. Old Buckenham Airfield has recently been sold to an aviation enthusiast, Geoffrey Lynch OBE who has pledged to keep aviation at the site.|$|E
50|$|The Manila {{civilian}} Nielson Airport {{was taken}} over in October 1941 and became Nielson Field, giving the Air Force a third operational airfield on Luzon. Additional fields were constructed at Iba, Ternate, and Del Monte on Mindanao. Clark Field, 60 miles north of Manila, was the only first-class field—it was, {{as a matter of}} fact, the only first-class field in the Philippines, for Del Monte had not yet been developed. Del Monte had no <b>hard</b> <b>runways,</b> but was entirely surfaced with turf.|$|R
50|$|The airport has two <b>hard</b> surface <b>runways.</b> Felts Field is {{used for}} general {{aviation}} now, but it was Spokane's airline airport before the opening of Spokane International Airport.|$|R
50|$|The Knevichi {{airfield}} {{was designed}} {{for all types of}} aircraft and has two <b>hard</b> surface <b>runways.</b> Each runway is 3,500 meters in length and 60 meters in width.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of the aircraft industry on the village's development continued between the wars and during World War Two {{and most of the}} new aeroplanes built at Brooklands took off over the centre of Byfleet on their first flights - the most spectacular being the first flight of the pioneering Vickers VC10 in 1962. The urgent need to supply the Vickers Valiant V-bomber to the RAF led to the removal of the central section of the race track's Byfleet Banking when a new <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> was built in 1951.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 May 2012 it was {{announced}} that the owners of Redhill Aerodrome had again submitted a planning application for a <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> after the previous plan had been rejected in 2011. Opponents at the time, including local MP Sam Gyimah, argued that the runway would [...] "create an unacceptable level of noise and pollution and destroy the landscape". In June 2013 the second application was also refused.In February 2014 the aerodrome lost a planning appeal; it was appealing against the June 2013 decision to reject the planning application.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} postwar years, the {{airfield}} was managed by Universal Flying Services, which operated a flying training school and provided aircraft maintenance services. The airfield was sold by auction in 1967. Alan Mann Helicopters began operations there in 1968 after which The Alan Mann Group became the operator. The <b>hard</b> <b>runway</b> {{was constructed in}} 1979. The Alan Mann Group sold its interests in 2008 to Albermarle Fairoaks Airport Ltd which owns Fairoaks Operations Ltd, the operator. The landside buildings were owned by West Register Property until they sold their interest on the 8th December 2015 to TEREF ADP Fairoaks Limited, a company registered in Jersey number 120101 which was formed on the 27th November 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Then {{surprising}} during 1943 {{the airfield}} was re-built to the specifications {{of a heavy}} bomber station with <b>hard</b> <b>runways</b> and spectacle dispersals being built {{under the control of}} No. 4 Group RAF of Bomber Command, however the station did not receive any aircraft before being transferred to No. 7 (Training) Group Bomber Command. During 1944 the airfield was used by Handley Page Halifaxes of 1652 and 1663 Heavy Conversion Unit. [...] Also in 1944 the airfield was used by Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys of 1341 Special Duties Flight on radio and signal counter-measures work.|$|R
50|$|RAF Coningsby {{was opened}} in 1940 as a bomber station. No. 106 Squadron RAF arrived in February 1941 and No. 97 Squadron arrived in March 1941. <b>Hard</b> <b>runways</b> were laid in early 1943 in {{preparation}} for heavy bombers being stationed, part of 5 Group. No. 617 Squadron were at the station from August 1943 - January 1944. Their officers' mess was the Petwood Hotel at Woodhall Spa. 61 Squadron were stationed with Lancasters from February-April 1944. On 12 November, 61 Squadron aircraft equipped with Tallboy bombs sank the Tirpitz in Operation Catechism. 175 aircraft were lost during the war.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} the {{replacement}} of Budaörs by a larger airport had been clear since 1939. Hills surrounding Budaörs Airport, a lack of room for expansion, {{and the need for}} longer, <b>hard</b> <b>runways</b> led the development of what would become Budapest Ferihegy International Airport. Ferihegy was ready in 1943, but bombing during World War 2 caused it extensive damage, so, as Budaörs had survived the war relatively unscathed, it continued in use until repairs at Ferihegy were completed. Ferihegy was reopened on 7 May 1950, and a Lisunov Li-2 flew in from Budaörs to mark the occasion.|$|R
