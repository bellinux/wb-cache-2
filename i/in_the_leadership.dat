5|$|After {{the sudden}} death of Labour leader John Smith in May 1994, Brown did not contest the {{leadership}} after Tony Blair became favourite, deciding {{to make way}} for Blair to avoiding splitting the pro-modernising vote <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> ballot.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been rumoured a deal was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita {{restaurant}} in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to the fortunes of New Labour, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.|$|E
5|$|Sexist attitudes still prevailed across Soviet society. Men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> {{often did}} not take women or their ideas seriously, and {{excluded}} them from many discussions. Domestic violence and sexual harassment continued to exist. Yet, sociological studies at the time found that Soviet women tended not to see their inequality as a problem.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister and party leader by Chancellor John Major, who prevailed over Heseltine {{in the subsequent}} ballot. Major oversaw an upturn in Conservative support in the 17months leading to the 1992 general election and led the party to a fourth successive victory on 9 April 1992. Thatcher favoured Major <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> contest, but her support for him waned in later years.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing an active role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
5|$|Having gained {{prestige}} {{from the}} constructions in the Loggia, Cairano {{received at least}} two commissions from the nobility of Brescia. Involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the new administration, they were certainly aware of his ability. There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for the Tomb of Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, {{was placed in the}} Brunelli chapel within the Church of St Francis. During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the tomb of Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E

5|$|Tory leaders {{scheduled}} a leadership convention for December. In early November, the Suez crisis erupted. Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson {{played a major}} part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories' foreign policy critic and as the favourite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, as they said, being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded {{that it was better}} to be such a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain's will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} rebels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership,</b> Rau kept {{most of his}} positions. He {{remained}} {{a member of the}} Politburo and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. In the Politburo he continued to be responsible for the industry of the GDR. However, his position had been weakened. Bruno Leuschner, a follower of Ulbricht and Rau's successor as chairman of the National Planning Commission, now became a new candidate member of the Politburo. During the ensuing period, Leuschner, often supported by Ulbricht, gradually superseded Rau as the senior leader for the economy as a whole. The official GDR press never mentioned the dissension between Rau and Leuschner and always described their cooperation as a success story.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale {{announced}} her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30, 2010, and {{was endorsed by}} her entire caucus. While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the credentials committee. With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E

5|$|In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart {{were on a}} {{fundraising}} trip to Berlin, a mutiny {{broke out}} within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would {{mean the end of}} the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP: Opponents of Hitler <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing Drexler, by a vote of 533to1.|$|E
5|$|Lark {{received}} missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and {{constituted the}} leadership of Milorg in Trøndelag where they in practice were the same entity. Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter, and he soon {{became one of the}} most important persons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of Milorg. His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of Tirpitz, but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943. Sørli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian POWs, fearing for what in turn might happen to them if he went through with the assassination. Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with Sørli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box booby trapped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian Gestapo agent Henry Rinnan (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes. Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any further such attempts, as it was considered too risky for him. Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from Sørli in October 1943, and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested. He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in psychological warfare.|$|E
5|$|When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to {{the throne}} there were changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> on the Isle of Wight and the castle. Worsley was {{dismissed}} in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 {{for his role in}} the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen. When the Protestant Elizabeth I came {{to the throne}} in 1558, however, peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England. Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle. Worsley filled in half of the castle's courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea, and he probably also constructed the Master Gunner's House on the other side of the castle. Nonetheless, an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition. Work costing £50 was done in 1587, including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns. The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, after which further repairs were carried out on the castle. By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle, which was still considered an important defence for the Solent, needed expensive repairs.|$|E

5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions {{in the country that}} allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E
