5000|$|The {{traditional}} classification in the West, {{which goes}} back to the ancient Greeks, begins with a distinction between precious and semi-precious; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern usage the precious stones are diamond, ruby, sapphire, and emerald, with all other gemstones being semi-precious. [...] This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are translucent with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the Mohs scale. Other stones are classified by their color, translucency and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while garnets are relatively inexpensive, a <b>green</b> <b>garnet</b> called tsavorite can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald. [...] Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and archaeology is hardstone. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.|$|E

Electron-probe {{analyses of the}} following minerals are given: ilmenite, titanian hematite, rutile, magnetite, sapphirine, hyperstheue, brown and <b>green</b> biotite, <b>garnet,</b> and cordierite. Field and experimental data suggest the following para-genesis: deposition of ferruginous shales with siliceous bands, followed by burial and regional metamorphism under granulite facies conditions, and finally rapid unloading associated with re-foliation and shearing and crystallization f sapphirine and cordierite. TIlE Labwor Hills of northern Uganda consist of Precambrian metamorphic rocks of amphibolite and granulite facies. In I 963 - 4 the Uganda Geological Survey recognized the presence of sapphirine-bearing granulites that contain a wide mineralogical range of iron magnesium alumino-silicates. Of particular additional interest is the structural setting of these intriguing assemblages. The sapphirine-bearing rocks are restricted to a zone of NW-trending refoliation, 2 " 5 miles wide and 8 miles long, that forms a conspicuous photogeological feature truncating a zone of easterly-trending foliation (fig.

30|$|Although {{the model}} melts also show an {{abundance}} of heavy REEs (i.e., Y to Lu in Figure  5), these are {{lower than those of}} the observed range. The low abundances reflect the dominant involvement of garnet upon melting, because heavy REEs are preferentially absorbed into <b>garnet</b> (<b>Green</b> et al. 2000). In this model, the instantaneous melt extraction has been assumed (i.e., the chemical reactions between the melt and the solid during melt ascent have been ignored). If the melt that originated in the garnet stability field ascends with a continuous re-equilibration with the spinel peridotite at shallower depths, {{it is likely that the}} heavy REE depletion may be relaxed to some extent.|$|R
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally <b>green</b> ugrandite-series <b>garnets),</b> eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite.

40|$|Garnet megacrysts from Colorado Plateau diatremes (<b>Green</b> Knobs, <b>Garnet</b> Ridge) and the Wesselton kimberlite, South Africa, {{commonly}} {{contain a}} structural hydrous component. The Colorado Plateau samples range from 0. 0 to 0. 26 wt% H_(2) O, and the Wesselton samples contain from 0. 01 to 0. 07 %. Concentrations were measured using P_(2) O_ 5 cell coulometry, H_ 2 gas manometry, and thermogravimetry.

40|$|Mineralogical and granulometric {{properties}} of glacial-marine surface sediments of the Weddell Sea and adjoining areas were studied {{in order to}} decipher spatial variations of provenance and transport paths of terrigenous detritus from Antarctic sources. The silt fraction shows marked spatial differences in quartz contents. In the sand fractions heavy-mineral assemblages display low mineralogical maturity and are dominated by <b>garnet,</b> <b>green</b> hornblende, and various types of clinopyroxene. Cluster analysis yields distinct heavy-mineral assemblages, which {{can be attributed to}} specific source rocks of the Antarctic hinterland. The configuration of modern mineralogical provinces in the near-shore regions reflects the geological variety of the adjacent hinterland. In the distal parts of the study area, sand-sized heavy minerals are good tracers of ice-rafting. Granulometric characteristics and the distribution of heavy-mineral provinces reflect maxima of relative and absolute accumulation of ice-rafted detritus in accordance with major iceberg drift tracks {{in the course of the}} Weddell Gyre. Fine-grained and coarse-grained sediment fractions may have different origins. In the central Weddell Sea, coarse ice-rafted detritus basically derives from East Antarctic sources, while the fine-fraction is discharged from weak permanent bottom currents and/or episodic turbidity currents and shows affinities to southern Weddell Sea sources. Winnowing of quartz-rich sediments through intense bottom water formation in the southern Weddell Sea provides muddy suspensions enriched in quartz. The influence of quartz-rich suspensions moving within the Weddell Gyre contour current can be traced as far as the continental slope in the northwestern Weddell Sea. In general, the focusing of mud by currents significantly exceeds the relative and absolute contribution of ice-rafted detritus beyond the shelves of the study area...|$|R
40|$|The ultramafic amphibolites hosted in the Hercynian {{migmatite}} of NE Sardinia {{consist of}} three main compositional layers (A, B, C) {{from a few}} metres to a few decametres thick. Layer A {{is made up of}} coarse-grained olivine, chlorite, amphibole, spinel, minor pyroxene, garnet and, rarely, plagioclase. Layer B is made up of coarse-grained plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, spinel, garnet and amphibole. Layer C consists mainly of porphyroblastic garnet, pyroxene, large amphibole grains (up to 5 cm) and minor plagioclase. On the basis of mineral assemblages and microstructures, three stages of mineralogical re-equilibration can be recognised: granulite, amphibolite and greenschist. Primary igneous olivine and anorthite reacted under granulite conditions to produce coronas consisting of orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, <b>green</b> spinel and <b>garnet.</b> The amphibolite stage is characterised by the formation of brown and green clinoamphiboles (between pyroxene and corona garnet), anthophyllite, talc, Mg-rich chlorite, plagioclase and Cr-bearing spinel. Greenschist stage minerals, mostly replacing the mafic minerals, consist of tremolite, fayalite, epidote, albite, calcite, dolomite and serpentine. The history of the ultramafic amphibolites started with igneous crystallisation and continued through granulite (T = 700 – 740 jC, P=f 8 – 10 kbar), amphibolite (T = 580 – 640 jC, P= 4 – 6 kbar) and greenschist facies (T =f 330 – 400 jC, P < 2 – 3 kbar). Evaluation of P–T conditions indicated a P–T path from the protolith to granulite stage, characterised by an increase in pressure and temperature, and then from the granulite facies through amphibolite to the greenschist stage, characterised by a decrease in pressure and temperature. The petrological evolution of the ultramafic amphibolites and the P–T time path is discussed {{in the context of the}} Hercynian orogeny in Sardinia...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} pyroxenites and their {{relation}} to melt migration in the mantle have been investigated in two pyroxenite-rich zones in the Beni Bousera massif. Based on combined field, microtextural, mineralogical and geochemical observations, the pyroxenites were separated into four types. Type-I Cr-diopside websterites contain bright green diopside and have primitive bulk Ni, Cr and Mg-number. Their trace element systematics are characterized by slight light rare earth element (LREE) enrichment compared with the middle (MREE) and heavy (H) REE, and negative high field strength element (HFSE) anomalies in bulk-rock and mineral compositions suggesting that they result from melting of metasomatized mantle. Trace element concentrations of melts calculated to be in equilibrium with Type-I cpx have a subduction-like signature and show a close similarity to certain lavas erupted in the Alboran Basin. Calculated mineral equilibration temperatures of ∼ 1200 to 1350 °C {{are close to the}} basalt liquidus and higher than for other pyroxenite types in Beni Bousera, which generally yield 45 to 20 - 30 kbar. Type-III pyroxenites display strong variations of LREE and HFSE depletion and strong bulk Nb/Ta fractionation. Calculated melts in equilibrium with augitic cpx are variably enriched in incompatible trace elements similar to intraplate basalts. Type-IV pyroxenites are composed of <b>green</b> diopside, opx, <b>garnet</b> and plagioclase and/or spinel. Whole-rocks have high Na 2 O, CaO and Al 2 O 3 concentrations and high Mg-number, are HREE depleted, and have positive Eu and Sr anomalies. Garnets are characterized by low HREE/MREE and positive Eu anomalies. The absence of bulk-rock HREE enrichment indicates a metamorphic origin for this garnet, which is corroborated by the presence of Al-rich metamorphic spinels. Relict magmatic plagioclase indicates a shallower (< 10 kbar) crustal origin for these pyroxenites. Their metamorphic assemblage yields temperatures and pressures of 800 - 980 °C and 14 kbar, indicating a pressure increase during the metamorphic overprint. The whole-rock geochemistry of Type-IV pyroxenites is comparable with that of rocks from the lower crustal section of the Kohistan (northern Pakistan) paleo-arc, indicating a possible origin of these rocks as cumulates in the deeper arc crust and subsequent delamination into the underlying mantl...|$|R
40|$|A {{geological}} map on {{the scale}} 1 : 250, 000 of about 5000 sq Ian of Besham, parts of Kohistan, upper Swat areas and Malakand, Bajaur and Mohmand agencies, covering the region between river Indus {{in the east and}} Afghan border to the west has been prepared from mapping carried out on 1 : 5000 to 1 : 50, 000 scales after variably modifying and incorporating the already existing maps. This map was dovetailed into the existing maps further to the east across river Indus in Kaghan valley to produce the geological map of High Himalaya, Indus Suture Zone, parts of Kohistan and Lesser Himalaya from the Afghan border to the border areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The entire lithostratigraphic package of the mapped areas has been described, standardized and systematized replacing a plethora of local names. The lithostratographic units east of Indus river in Kaghan were correlated with the corresponding lithostratigraphic units to the west up to Afghan border. The High Himalaya package, folded into N-S trending basins and domes, was divided into a basement upper amphibolite facies predominantly pelite-psammite rocks with anatectic migmatites in the core of the domes and granitoids (Manglaur group) overlain by a lower meta-turbidite unit with volcanic derived amphibolite towards the base (Salampur formation) and an overlying upper predominantly calc-pelite and marble (Tilgram formation), metamorphosed in upper amphibolite facies. The High Himalaya is separated from the Lesser Himalaya by a crustal scale thrust, the Main Central Thrust (MCT), south of which occur E-W trending Palaeozoic marbles of Tursak formation and calc-pelites, graphitic pelites and marbles of Girari formation, metamorphosed in greenschist facies. On the basis of geology. structure and geochemistry, the rocks occurring along the Indus Suture Zone have been divided into a Tethyan MORI fore-arc basin ophiolites in Kohistan. Besham, Alpurai and Dargai and sub-arc mantle rocks overlain by crustal gabbros across the Moho at Jijal-Dubair and Spat. Kohistan. The geology and geochemistry of volcanic rocks associated with the Indus Suture Zone has been described and discussed. These rocks were formed either within a juvenile arc setting or derived from oceanic mantle that had inherited' an anomalously depleted signature from fossil subduction. In Jijal-Dubair and Spat areas of Kohistan huge outcrops of sub arc mantle. and overlying crustal gabbros with a palaeo-Moho have been described and discussed. These rocks were described in the past {{as a part of the}} Indus Suture Zone. On the basis of geology and geochemistry, the High Himalayan granitoids have been divided into peraluminous collisional granites of Proterozoic, Pan-African and Palaeozoic periods and Himalayan alkaline granites of Carboniferous-Triassic extensional regime. On the basis of geological contact relations, mineralogical (presence of pyrochlore) and geochemical criteria (REE) calc-silicate marbles and meta-limestones, some of which were described earlier as carbonatites, have been distinguished from carbonatites. Chromite associated with sutural ultramafites show limited within group variation in their chemical composition and are either refractory (AI rich) or of chemical grade (Cr-Fe rich). Geochemical signatures suggest their formation under a spreading center. The chromite deposits associated with ultramafites, mainly dunites, of the sub-arc mantle are generally AI-poor, show quite heterogeneous compositions even across single grains due to variable reconstitution and combination of melt consuming reactions coupled with ascending fluids from the subducting lithosphere. Mg # in these chromites is lower than those of sutural chromites. Manganese mineralisation associated with metacherts and greenschists has low values of Co, Ni, Cr, Zn etc and high Mn/Fe ratios and is considered to have been formed by hydrothermal rather than hydrogenous process. Emerald mineralisation is due to the influx of Be, Al and Si bearing fluids, derived from the Himalyan beryliferous granites into Cr bearing talc-carbonates derived from mantle peridotites, of the Indus Suture Zone. Exquisite peridot occurs in veins in association with talc, antigorite and magnesite and is confined to shear zones. Late stage, post-tectonic hydrothermal fluids from the host rocks are considered responsible for peridot mineralisation in Spat. Field and geochemical studies suggest that rodingite occurring in the mafic-ultramafics of the Indus Suture Zone was formed due to metasomatic alteration of gabbros, since they contain fairly high values of Al and Ca. Field relations (association with peridotites), petrography (relict olivine and pyroxene) and geochemistry (high values of Cr, Ni etc) suggest formation of huge talc deposits from ultramafites. The gem quality epidote belongs to zoisite and epidote-clinozoisite and is crystallized in altered gabbros and metabasites, which often lack penetrative deformation, suggesting their formation under greenstone (schist) and epidote amphibolite facies hydrogenous metamorphism close to the spreading center. Green beryl is crystallized generally in calc-alkaline granitoids while blue Cs rich beryl is crystallized in alkaline granitoids. Quartz-mica-beryl veins, crystallized in greisenised zones, represent fluids derived from rest pegmatitic magma due to pressure release.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Earth Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. Tanzanite, a blue/violet {{gemstone}} {{variety of}} zoisite (Ca 2 Al 2 O. AlOH[Si 2 O 7][SiO 4]) is only produced in NE Tanzania. The only known locality is an approximately 7 km 2 deposit in the Merelani area. It {{is one of}} the most sought after gemstones in the world with an industry sales value of between hundred and fifty and two hundred million dollars per year. At the current production rates and estimated resources the tanzanite deposit has a life expectancy of around 20 years. Despite the economical and scientific importance as well as the geological uniqueness of the deposit very little research has been conducted on the geology and petrology of the deposit and the characteristics of tanzanite. The primary aim of the research summarised in this dissertation was to gain an understanding of the geological conditions that led to the formation of this unique variety of zoisite. In order to achieve this, a variety of geological disciplines were addressed including the lithostratigraphic setting, the deformational history, the metamorphic history and conditions, the geochemical and isotopic composition, the mineral chemistry as well as the physical and optical properties of the tanzanite. Extensive field work was conducted over a seven year period, which included surface and underground mapping, surface trenching, surface and underground core drilling, structural measurements and an intensive sampling programme. Various analytical techniques were used in order to petrologically and mineralogically investigate both the deposit and tanzanite itself, including optical microscopy, XRF analyses, laser-ablation ICP-MS, quantitative chemical analyses by means of the electron microprobe, XRD analyses, back-scattered electron microscopy, isotope analyses, fluid-inclusion studies, Vis/UV/NIR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and EPR studies. This study revealed an intricate and complex geological history for the formation of tanzanite. The deposition of carbon-rich layers, formed during the development of a sequence of shallow shelf sediments consisting primarily of various organic carbon (δ 13 C between – 22, 85 ‰ and – 26, 74 ‰) -rich mudstone horizons and limestone beds is seen as the first phase of the mineralisation process. These Archaean sediments were deposited in a back- or fore-arc spreading basin. The organic carbon-rich mudstone layers acted as the first phase of vanadium accumulation in the stratigraphic sequence, and are intercalated with a material with a volcanic origin (metabasites), which most likely contributed to the enrichment of amongst others V. Early diagenetic processes were followed by an extended metamorphic and deformation (D 1) history, reaching upper granulite facies conditions (10 – 12 kbar and 850 oC to 1000 oC) at ca. 1000 Ma. The high-grade metamorphic history was followed by multiphase retrograde deformation events (D 2 and D 3) that developed as a result of crustal uplift. The D 2 event probably occurred between 850 and 600 Ma at P-T conditions estimated at between 8 to 7 kbar and 700 to 650 oC. A third stage of deformation (D 3) resulted in the formation of overprinting structures and occurred during the later stages of the Pan-African (550 – 500 Ma) event during amphibolite/greenschist facies conditions (7 to 6 kbar and 600 to 520 oC). The deformational history of the deposit played a critical role in the mineralisation processes. Of the four main deformation events identified, three played a critical role in the mineralisation process. The first event led to the development of early structural features as defined by F 1, S 1 and L 1. This was followed by a multiphase D 2 event consisting of three different orders of folding (F 2 a, F 2 b and F 2 c) and the formation of boudinage. The association between tanzanite and boudins as well as the stacking and multiple duplication of the boudinaged ore-zone through isoclinal folding resulted in multiple “ore-shoots”. These ore-shoots follow the plunge of the F 2 c fold closures and results in mine-able features within the ore-body. The third deformation event led to complex structural overprinting of the earlier fabric as observed in S 3 and L 3 and resulted in the deformation of the F 2 structures through crosscutting F 3 folds. Calc-silicate layers developed in the stratigraphic sequence as a result of metamorphic and metasomatic interaction between calcium enriched (boudinaged calc-silicates) and depleted horizons (graphitic gneisses) during a skarn-forming episode. V-rich <b>green</b> grossular <b>garnet</b> (tsavorite) crystallised in tension zones within and in proximity to the boudins during prograde metamorphism. Tanzanite mineralisation occurred during the retrograde stages at ca. 585 ± 28 Ma with P-T conditions estimated at ca. 5 to 6 kbar and 650 ± 50 oC. Two distinctive tanzanite-forming processes are distinguished. The first involves the formation of tanzanite as a result of retrograde reaction of grossular garnet. The second process involves the migration of V and Ca -enriched fluids along brittle shear zones to tension sites where fluids reacted with wall rock during a drop in P-T conditions to precipitate tanzanite. Fluid inclusion and stable-isotope studies concluded that the ore-forming fluids were derived from the dehydration of the metasedimentary sequence and consisted of a mixture of H 2 O, CH 4, H 2 S and N 2. Mineralogical investigation of tanzanite indicated that trace concentrations of vanadium within its crystals structure causes its blue / violet colour. It was proved that the vanadium originated from the abundant organically derived graphite within the deposit. Spectroscopic and EPR analyses revealed the importance of the Ti 4 + / Ti 3 + ratio within the crystal structure of tanzanite with regard to its colour characteristics. The heating of tanzanite results in a couple valence exchange reaction Ti 3 + + V 4 + → Ti 4 + + V 3 + which causes an increase the blue / violet colour of tanzanite. The research conducted led to the development of a successful geological model for the tanzanite mining and treatment activities in the Merelani area of NE Tanzania. As such the research contributed to the establishment of a successful tanzanite mine, based on sound geological principles, which may act as a role model for other gemstone mines worldwide...|$|R
