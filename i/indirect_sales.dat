At the time, increased global demand for tea {{was one of the}} primary reasons for a shortage of silver; this was the only currency that the Chinese, sole producers of the commodity at the time, would accept in payment. The East India Company (EIC), monopoly suppliers of tea to the English market, got around the problem by <b>indirect</b> <b>sales</b> of opium (grown on their plantations in India) to the Chinese, the proceeds from which they used to pay for tea.|$|E

For the initial launch of the Solutions Provider Program, Comcast enlisted three national master representatives—Telarus, based in Salt Lake City, Utah; Intelisys, based in Petaluma, California; and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in Chicago.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{informed}} financial intermediaries can reduce their trading competition by designing optimal incentive compatible contracts {{for the sale}} of information. With fund management contracts – <b>indirect</b> <b>sale</b> of information – banks can credibly commit to collaborate and add noise into prices. This is a way to circumvent the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) paradox: when information is costly, by commiting to add noise, the banks can recover the cost of collecting information and enter the market. By contrast, when information is costless, even with a large number of sellers of information entering the market prices are not fully informative...|$|R

5000|$|In 1663, a new gold coinage was {{introduced}} {{based on the}} 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at [...] to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds). However, {{despite the efforts of}} Sir Isaac Newton, Master of the Mint, to reduce the guinea's value, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver when compared to the valuations in other European countries. In line with Gresham's Law, British merchants sent silver abroad in payments whilst goods for export were paid for with gold. As a consequence of these flows of silver out and gold in, Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. Aggravating this outflow was the fact that silver was the only commodity accepted by China for exporting goods during this period. From the mid-17th century, around 28,000 metric tons (27,600 imperial tons) of silver were received by China, principally from European powers, in exchange for Chinese tea and other goods. In order to trade with China, Great Britain had first to trade with the other European nations to receive silver, which led to the East India Company redressing this trade imbalance through the <b>indirect</b> <b>sale</b> of opium to the Chinese.|$|R
