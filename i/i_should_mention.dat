500|$|Cresswell was not {{buried at}} Knockholt and was {{possibly}} interred in the Bridewell graveyard. Several accounts claim {{that in her}} will she left £10 for a sermon to be read that said nothing ill of her. After a long search, a young clergyman prepared to perform the funeral rites was found. Following a lengthy sermon on social morality, he intoned: [...] "By {{the will of the}} deceased it is expected that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> her and say nothing but what was well of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this– she was born well, lived well, and died well; for she was born with the name of Cresswell, lived at Clerkenwell, and died in Bridewell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{gave the}} film very mixed to {{negative}} reviews. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "This family film {{is willing to}} tackle important issues such as burgeoning sexuality, alcoholism and a troubled home life but does so in a bland and unconvincing story." [...] However, the film's technical qualities were praised. Both The Hollywood Reporter and the St. Paul Pioneer Press felt the story was slow and contrived. The Los Angeles Times called the film flawed, and placed the blame squarely on the screenplay for not knowing whether to depict a Disney-esque innocent adventure or a real world that confronted a teenager's emerging sexuality, a father's alcoholism, and the break-up of a marriage. The Deseret News called the film [...] "hokey" [...] and felt the direction {{and some of the}} performances were amateurish. The newspaper labeled the score as [...] "one of the worst musical scores in recent memory", and felt the period songs were [...] "ill-chosen". The Minneapolis Star Tribune was particularly harsh in its criticism. The newspaper felt the picture was [...] "insulting to your child's intelligence, veer wildly between broad humor (and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that there is literally not one funny scene in this whole movie), sugary nostalgia and the worst melodrama", and [...] "fraught with leaden direction and horrible acting".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> it earlier, {{but in the}} evening's {{disturbance}} it escaped my memory, I fear I {{have been}} remiss, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Intended?" [...] she said. [...] "If {{either of}} you had done your brother justice, I don't think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> him at all." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, bother! <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> Mr. Ramsay {{first of}} all. He is more {{important}} than purple or green, or even the red cranberry sauce.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{undertake}} to say that, Mr. Dockwrath. I {{think it}} will perhaps be better that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> it, and then see you afterwards." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were much}} {{together}} in those days, Monna Giuliana and I. Our intimacy had grown {{over a little}} incident that it were well <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh we make {{plenty of}} it in London!" [...] Vanderbank said. [...] "And I think it's rather in my {{interest}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that Mrs. Brookenham calls ME--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> before that, {{previous}} to the vessel's departure, {{the men had}} bartered {{away all}} the clothing they could possibly spare; but now, it was resolved to be more provident.|$|R
60|$|DUMONT (begins to help soup. Then, {{dropping}} ladle). One word: {{a matter}} of detail; Charles is not my son. (All exclaim.) O no, he is not my son. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> it before.|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Very likely. Let us {{drop the}} subject. Pardon me for {{embarrassing}} you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have <b>mentioned</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|There stood he, while deep {{attention}} [...] Held {{the judges}} round, [...] 20 --Judges able, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention,</b> [...] To detect the slightest sound Sung or played amiss: such ears Had old judges, it appears! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Speaker {{and gentlemen}} of the House," [...] he said, [...] "if I desired to arouse the enthusiasm--the just enthusiasm--of any {{gathering}} in this House, or in this city, or in this state, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> the name of the Honorable Alva Hopkins of Gosport. I think I am right." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{companion}} {{was silent}} a little. [...] "She is, by all means. Well," [...] she then added, [...] "so far as I {{may have been}} alive to the fact of any one's thinking her so, it's not out of place <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> to you the difference made in my appreciation of it by our delightful little stay at Mertle. My views for Nanda," [...] said Mrs. Brook, [...] "have somehow gone up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is still}} {{something}} I wish to say, and perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> it earlier; but {{in such cases}} one shrinks from causing pain," [...] she said. [...] "I should like {{you to believe that}} I was very sorry when I heard--about your father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's not {{the case}} with you. It would be an insult to offer you money, even if money were going. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>mention</b> this, only as money is not going, neither on our side nor on the other, no harm can be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Christine, don't dance {{too often}} with young Long--as a mere matter of prudence, I mean, as volk {{might think it}} odd, he being {{one of our own}} {{neighbouring}} farmers. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>mention</b> this to 'ee if he were an ordinary young fellow; but being superior to the rest it behoves you to be careful.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The question, however, as he {{immediately}} showed, resided in what Lord Theign himself meant [...] "It's {{more to the}} purpose," [...] he said to Mr. Bender, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> to you the leading feature, or in other words the very essence, of my plan of campaign--which {{is to put the}} picture at once on view." [...] He marked his idea with a broad but elegant gesture. [...] "On view as a thing definitely disposed of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean, sir, that if I {{were asked}} a {{straightforward}} question I {{would give a}} straightforward answer, unless it were wiser not to do so. I would tell the truth to my master, but I do not consider it necessary always to do so to others. For instance, sir, if you were my master, and questions were asked about you, there might be times when {{it would not be}} convenient for you that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> where you had gone, or what you were doing." ...|$|E
60|$|This was the act. Jana, having prodded {{his dead}} brother to his satisfaction, whether from viciousness {{or to put}} it out of pain, I cannot say, stood over the carcass in an {{attitude}} of grief or pious meditation. At this time, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention,</b> the wind, which had been rustling the hail-stripped reeds at the lake border, had died away almost, but not completely; that is to say, only a very faint gust blew now and again, which, with a hunter's instinct, I observed with satisfaction drew from the direction of Jana towards ourselves. This I knew, because it struck on my forehead, which was wet with perspiration, and cooled the skin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} man dryly. [...] "Otherwise <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have <b>mentioned</b> it to her. The {{storekeeper}} having been victimized lately, however, requires a deposit of one hundred dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{are some}} things, Madame Faragon, which one doesn't mention. And I {{do not know}} why <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> it at all. But you {{understand}} all about it now. Of course she will marry the man. It is not likely that my father should fail to have his own way with a girl who is dependent on him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, sir," [...] he said. [...] "To any one else <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never have <b>mentioned</b> it. But we were alone, and I {{thought that the}} {{circumstances}} might make it excusable." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that Isabella sent to her brother, {{some six}} weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her {{marriage}} with Heathcliff. It appeared dry and cold; {{but at the}} bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting {{that she could not}} help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon. I'll read it: for I keep it yet. Any relic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{happened}} {{a good many}} years ago {{at a time when}} I was only a young fellow fresh from college, very proud of my Plumb. B., and inclined to think that I knew it all. I had done a little monograph on Choked Feed in the Blow Torch, which had attracted attention, and I suppose that altogether I was about as conceited a young puppy as one would find in the profession. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that at this time I was not married, but had set up a modest apartment of my own with a consulting-room and a single manservant. Naturally I could not afford the services of a solderist or a gassist and did everything for myself, though Simmons, my man, could at a pinch be utilized to tear down plaster and break furniture." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that Cadell breakfasted with me, {{and entirely}} {{approved}} of my rejecting Heath's letter. There was one funny part of it, {{in which he}} assured me {{that the success of}} the new edition of the Waverley Novels depended entirely on the excellence of the illustrations--vous êtes joaillier, Mons. Josse.[261] He touches a point which alarms me; he greatly undervalues the portrait which Wilkie has prepared to give me for this edition. If it is as little of a likeness as he says, it is a scrape. But a scrape be it. Wilkie behaved in the kindest way, considering his very bad health, in agreeing to work for me at all, and I will treat him with due delicacy, and not wound his feelings by rejecting what he has given in such kindness.[262] And so farewell to Mr. Heath, and the conceited vulgar Cockney his Editor.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> that, {{previous}} to this, he {{had taken}} the doctor aside, and said something about reinstating him in the cabin with augmented dignity; beside throwing out a hint that I myself was in some way or other to be promoted. But it was all to no purpose; bent the men were upon going ashore, and there was no moving them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know I am a fool," [...] he answered. [...] "If <b>I</b> wasn't <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{not have}} <b>mentioned</b> my misfortune to you, but {{sometimes}} things are {{too much for}} one. Forget it and forgive me." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{all think}} that he behaved beautifully in that little [...] affair at the Haymarket theatre. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>mention</b> it [...] only that {{everybody}} has heard of it. Almost any other man [...] would have struck the poor fellow again; but he is one [...] {{of the very few}} who always know what to do at the moment [...] without taking time to think of it.|$|R
60|$|June 16.--Dined at Dalmahoy, {{with the}} young Earl and Countess of Morton. I like these young noble folks {{particularly}} well. Their manners and style of living are easy and unaffected, and I should {{like to see them}} often. Came home at night. The task finished to-day. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that the plan about the new edition of the novels was considered at a meeting of trustees, and finally approved of. I trust it will answer; yet, who can warrant the continuance of popularity? Old Corri,[225] who entered into many projects, and could never set the sails of a wind-mill so as to catch the aura popularis, used to say that he believed that were he to turn baker, it would put bread out of fashion. I have had the better luck to dress my sails to every wind; and so blow on, good wind, and spin round, whirligig.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> {{here that}} the book is Teuta's idea. Before little Rupert came she {{controlled}} herself wonderfully, doing only what was thought best for her under the circumstances. As I {{could see that it}} would be a help for her to have some quiet occupation which would interest her without tiring her, I looked up (with his permission, of course) all Rupert's old letters and diaries, and journals and reports--all that I had kept for him during his absences on his adventures. At first I was a little afraid they might harm her, for at times she got so excited over some things that I had to caution her. Here again came in her wonderful self-control. I think the most soothing argument I used with her was to point out that the dear boy had come through all the dangers safely, and was actually with us, stronger and nobler than ever.|$|E
60|$|It {{remained}} {{in all respects}} as I have last described it, with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention,</b> too, that this limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be {{making an effort to}} reply, but had no longer sufficient volition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible--although I endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now related all that is necessary {{to an understanding of the}} sleep-waker's state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock I left the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L--l.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed {{you shall}} do no such thing. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have <b>mentioned</b> {{it to you}} if I had not thought that {{you were one of}} the {{insolvent}} yourself. You were in debt yourself when we last talked about money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry, do {{you know}} that we have a plan?" [...] "Who is we?" [...] Harry asked; but she went on without noticing his question. [...] "I tell you, because I believe you can help us more than any one, if you will. Only for your {{engagement}} with Miss Burton <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>mention</b> it to you; and, but for that, the plan would, I daresay, be of no use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You astound me. I {{thought that}} every man in England knew {{something}} of his antecedents. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>mention</b> the {{matter if it}} were not that you are now one of ourselves, and that the facts might come to your ears in some harsher form if I were silent upon them. I always took it for granted that you knew that you were in the service of 'Devil' Bollamore." ...|$|R
