50|$|Time-correlated single-photon {{counting}} (TCSPC) {{is usually}} employed because it compensates for variations in source intensity and single photon pulse amplitudes. Using commercial TCSPC equipment a <b>fluorescence</b> <b>decay</b> curve can be recorded {{with a time}} resolution down to 405 fs.The recorded <b>fluorescence</b> <b>decay</b> histogram obeys Poisson statistics which is considered in determining goodness of fit during fitting. More specifically, TCSPC records times at which individual photons are detected by a fast single-photon detector (typically a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) or a single photon avalanche photo diode (SPAD)) {{with respect to the}} excitation laser pulse. The recordings are repeated for multiple laser pulses and after enough recorded events, one is able to build a histogram of the number of events across all of these recorded time points. This histogram can then be fit to an exponential function that contains the exponential lifetime decay function of interest, and the lifetime parameter can accordingly be extracted. Multi-channel PMT systems with 16 to 64 elements have been commercially available, whereas the recently demonstrated CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-TCSPC FLIM systems can offer even higher number of detection channels and additional low-cost options.|$|E

The <b>fluorescence</b> <b>decays</b> of lysozyme and azurin in reverse micelles were also found to be very complex and were described with Gaussian lifetime distributions.
