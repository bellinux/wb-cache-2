It is listed on schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less dangerous than many other chemical weapons, such as sarin, phosgene is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent because it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to manufacture {{when compared to the}} production requirements of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as the first-generation nerve agent tabun.|$|E
25|$|Set goals: Groups {{that set}} clear, {{challenging}} goals outperform groups whose members have {{lost sight of}} their objectives. The group's goals should be relatively challenging, instead of being too easily accomplished. The advantages of working in a group are often lost when a task <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> {{that it can be}} accomplished even when members of the group socially loaf. Thus, groups should ensure to set their standards high, but not so high that the goals are unattainable. Latham and Baldes (1975) assessed the practical significance of Locke's theory of goal setting by conducting an experiment with truck drivers who hauled logs from the woods to the mill. When the men were initially told to do their best when loading the logs, they carried only about 60% of the weight that they could legally haul. When the same drivers were later encouraged to reach a goal of hauling 94% of the legal limit, they increased their efficiency and met this specific goal. Thus, {{the results of this study}} show that performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific, challenging goal. Company cost accounting procedures indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. So this method of goal setting is extremely effective. Other research has found that clear goals can stimulate a number of other performance-enhancing processes, including increases in effort, better planning, more accurate monitoring of the quality of the groups work, and even an increased commitment to the group.|$|E

500|$|Another pivotal romantic {{relationship}} {{for the character}} occurred when Chloe began dating her best friend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). The decision to develop the friendship into a romance was debated by the writers, as it was Hendrickson and Rikaart who approached the writers wanting to work together. Due to their real-life friendship, Rikaart said of the storyline turn, [...] "The level of comfort <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy,</b> certainly for portraying the friendship part of the Kevin/Chloe relationship, that is a no-brainer. [...] So it was like, {{when are we going}} to have to start acting?" [...] The relationship is plagued with constant issues, such as interference from Kevin's mentally unstable ex-wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and mob princess Angelina Veneziano's (Diana DeGarmo) intense crush on Kevin (which leads to a brief marriage, with Angelina's mob father threatening to kill Kevin if he doesn't wed his daughter). Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples. They’re kind of battling through this struggle. He’s trying to do his best to take care of the family and morally, it just doesn’t sit well with her. Especially with what he’s been through in the past." [...] Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, [...] "We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this.

[...] The reviewer acclaimed the role of the technical department and called it [...] "a complete film". The reviewer for Indiaglitz called the film [...] "echnically this is a superb cinema", called some of the dialogues [...] "carelessly written", and opined, [...] "Yogaraj Bhat once again bank on Ganesh stardom and gives back seat to all others in the film. Sketching each character with different outlook Bhat has forgotten to write a good story for the film.

[...] Sify.com in its review echoed his view on the dialogues, yet rated the film positively calling it a film with [...] "various fabulous elements". The reviewer commended the performance on all actors highlighting those of Ganesh and Neethu. He further wrote, [...] "Yogaraj Bhat picks the similar locations with most dangerous water falls like Shivanasamudra, Kodachadri and exquisite mountains ranges of Karnataka.

2500|$|However, a {{contrary}} {{tendency is}} apparent in cultured and Greco-Latin technical vocabulary, which most Europeans see as [...] "international" [...] and therefore take into Esperanto en masse, despite the fact they are not truly universal. Many Asians consider this to be an onerous and unnecessary burden on the memory, when it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to derive equivalent words internally (for example by calquing them, which is what Chinese often does). This sparks frequent debates as to whether a particular root is justified, and sometimes results in duplicates of native and borrowed vocabulary. An example is [...] "calligraphy", which occurs both as a calqued belskribo ("writing of beauty") and as the direct borrowing kaligrafio. A similar development has also occurred in English (brotherly vs. fraternal), German (Ornithologie vs. Vogelkunde for ornithology), Japanese (beesubooru vs. yakyuu for baseball), Spanish (básquetbol vs. baloncesto for basketball), French (le week-end vs. la fin de semaine), and other languages. However, although the debates in ethnic languages are motivated by nationalism or issues of cultural identity, in Esperanto the debates are largely motivated by differing views {{on how to make}} the language practical and accessible.|$|E
2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy,</b> he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other people I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong.

[...] Referring to the rapid growth of crime in northern Kinta, Walker remarked:No wonder that the crime has increased, as increase it must, with a mining population of Chinese, a race that knows no repose, that settles only for the moment where money is to be made with the greatest ease, that would rob their best friends if they themselves should have lost their savings at the gaming table.Crime with such a population as this means progress, and although a check has been given to it by raising the Force to its utmost capacity, at the sacrifice of other parts of the state, strengthening the detective branch, and paying judiciously for information, crime must arise, and as long as a fair number of discoveries are made of crimes most difficult to detect in a country where escape <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy,</b> and a criminal can with comparative ease conceal himself, it is all that can be expected.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics.

[...] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated [...] "Keys also teams with Beyoncé, the glittery Diana Ross to Keys's [...] super-serious poetry major, for the disc's best track, 'Put It in a Love Song.' 'Love Song' is an oddly mechanical number that lurches from diva to diva but somehow doesn't fall over..." [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH called {{it one of the}} album's [...] "standout moments", describing it as having [...] "the Sasha Fierce brashness" [...] and that [...] "the always fantastic Beyoncé takes a notable backseat to Keys for a delightful and surprising change of pace". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website Allmusic chose [...] "Put It in a Love Song" [...] as one of the three best songs on The Element of Freedom and commennted, [...] "On The Element of Freedom, that elegance <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> it borders on the sleepy, with Keys' understatement undercutting livelier numbers -- chief among them the bubbly Beyoncé duet 'Put It in a Love Song' -- so they play as ballads." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin also chose the song as a highlight on the whole album. Gary Graff of Billboard magazine described the song as a [...] "girl-power anthem". A writer of The New York Times felt that the song gives the album [...] "bristle with a less regal impulse: flirting". The writer further commented that the song had a [...] "quantitatively different energy, air-lifted from somewhere else". Nick Levine of Digital Spy said, [...] "Beyoncé nearly manages to jolt Keys out of her midtempo comfort zone on 'Put In A Love Song', encouraging 'A' to show her sassy side over bootyshakin' Swiss Beatz rhythms." [...] Ron Wynn of The City Paper noted that Keys matches Knowles [...] "in force and attitude" [...] on the song.|$|E
