60|$|On this night, {{sleeping}} {{under my}} beloved shears, I was aroused by his {{footsteps on the}} deck. It was a starlight night, and I could see the bulk of him dimly as he moved about. I rolled out of my blankets and crept noiselessly after him in my stocking feet. He had armed himself with a <b>draw-knife</b> from the tool-locker, and with this he prepared to cut across the throat-halyards I had again rigged to the shears. He felt the halyards {{with his hands and}} discovered that I had not made them fast. This would not do for a <b>draw-knife,</b> so he laid hold of the running part, hove taut, and made fast. Then he prepared to saw across with the <b>draw-knife.</b>|$|E
