40|$|In the {{treatment}} planning of conformal radiotherapy, field shapes are often designed {{in such a}} way that a high-value <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> fully encompasses the target volume. Therefore, knowledge about the accuracy with which {{the treatment}} planning system calculates the position of that <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> is essential to prevent field shapes which are either too large or too small. To determine this accuracy for a conformal multi-field technique, the dose in the high-dose region must be measured with a high spatial resolution. A method is presented to reconstruct and evaluate the experimental high-dose region from a set of water phantom scans. This method, which assesses combined dose profiles for multi-field irradiation techniques, can be used for the commissioning and/or quality assurance of a 3 -D treatment planning system. For a specific conformal technique, the measured and calculated 95 % isodose positions along lines in several directions have been compared. It is shown that different dose values of single beam profiles determine the resulting 95 % isodose position, which is important to recognize for quality assurance of treatment planning calculations. It is further found that the uncertainty in the calculated 95 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> can be described by a standard deviation in dose value, which relates to a positional uncertainty through the local dose gradient. Thus the confidence region of the calculated 95 % isodose can be indicated in the treatment plan by plotting isodoses at the 95 % level plus and minus its standard deviation. Such a procedure is recommended instead of plotting the 95 % isodose with a constant width. In addition, restrictions for the cumulative dose-volume histogram of acceptable treatment plans can be formulated, based on the sensitivity of the actual target coverage on the uncertainty with which the prescribed <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> is calculate...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{advanced}} inhomogeneous dose distribution produced by a volumetric arc therapy technique (RapidArc) using 3 D gel measurements and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The TPS (treatment planning system) -calculated dose distribution was compared with gel measurements and MC simulations, thus investigating any discrepancy between the planned dose delivery and the actual delivery. Additionally, the reproducibility of the delivery was investigated using repeated gel measurements. A prostate treatment plan was delivered to a 1. 3 liter nPAG gel phantom using one single arc rotation and a target dose of 3. 3 Gy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the gel was carried out using a 1. 5 T scanner. The MC dose distributions were calculated using the VIMC-Arc code. The relative absorbed dose differences were calculated voxel-by-voxel, within the volume enclosed by the 90 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> (VOI(90)), for the TPS versus gel and TPS versus MC. The differences between the verification methods, MC versus gel, and between two repeated gel measurements were investigated in the same way. For all volume comparisons, the mean value was within 1 % and the standard deviation of the differences was within 2. 5 % (1 SD). A 3 D gamma analysis between the dose matrices were carried out using gamma criteria 3 %/ 3 mm and 5 %/ 5 mm (% dose difference and mm distance to agreement) within the volume enclosed by the 50 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> (VOI(50)) and the 90 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> (VOI(90)), respectively. All comparisons resulted in very high pass rates. More than 95 % of the TPS points were within 3 %/ 3 mm of both the gel measurement and MC simulation, both inside VOI(50) and VOI(90). Additionally, the repeated gel measurements showed excellent consistency, indicating reproducible delivery. Using MC simulations and gel measurements, this verification study successfully demonstrated that the RapidArc plan was both accurately calculated and delivered as planned...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} a method for positioning the margin required around the clinical target volume (CTV) {{to account for the}} random geometrical treatment uncertainties during conformal radiotherapy. These uncertainties are introduced by patient setup errors and CTV motion within the patient. Three-dimensional dose distributions are calculated for two four-field box techniques and a three-field technique, using rectangular fields. In addition, dose calculations are performed for four prostate cases, treated with a three-field conformal technique. The effects of random rotational and translational deviations on the delivered dose are described as a convolution of the "static" dose with the distribution of the deviations. For the rectangular field techniques, these convolutions are performed with a range of standard deviations (SDs) of the distribution of random translations (0 - 7 mm in the three directions) and rotations (0 degree- 5 degrees around the main axes). Two centers of rotation are considered: the isocenter and a position that is 3. 5 cm shifted with respect to the isocenter. For the prostate cases, the random deviations are estimated by combining the results from organ motion and setup accuracy studies. The required margin is defined as the change in the position of the static 95 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> by the convolution and it is approximated by a morphological erosion operator, applied to the static 95 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface.</b> When the center of rotation coincides with the isocenter the change in the position of the static 95 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> can accurately be described by an erosion operator. For the rectangular field techniques, the margin is equal to about 0. 7 SD of the distribution of translations, independent of the distribution of rotations. When the center of rotation does not coincide with the isocenter and rotations are considerable, the margin is strongly place dependent, and the accuracy of the approximation by an erosion operator is much lower. In conclusion, margins for random uncertainties can be approximated by a dilation operator (inverse of an erosion operator) when the center of rotational deviations coincides with the isocenter. The size of the margin is about 0. 7 SD of the distribution of translations. When rotational deviations are present and the center of rotation does not coincide with the isocenter, the margin can become strongly place dependent and the convolution computation should be incorporated in the planning syste...|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{efficacy}} of focal continuous low dose-rate brachytherapy (CLDR-BT) {{for prostate cancer}} requires that appropriate margins are applied to ensure robust target coverage. In this study we propose a method to establish such margins by emulating a focal treatment in patients treated with CLDR-BT to the entire gland. Material and methods. In 15 patients with localized prostate cancer, prostate volumes and dominant intra-prostatic lesions were delineated on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delineations and MRI were registered to trans-rectal ultrasound images in the operating theater. The patients received CLDR-BT treatment to the total prostate volume. The implantation consisted of two parts: an experimental focal plan covering the dominant intra-prostatic lesion (F-GTV), followed by a plan containing additional seeds to achieve entire prostate coverage. <b>Isodose</b> <b>surfaces</b> were reconstructed using follow-up computed tomography (CT). The focal dose was emulated by reconstructing seeds from the focal plan only. The distance to agreement between planned and delivered <b>isodose</b> <b>surfaces</b> and F-GTV coverage was determined to calculate the margin required for robust treatment. Results. If patients had been treated only focally, the target volume would have been reduced {{from an average of}} 40. 9 cm(3) for the entire prostate to 5. 8 cm(3) for the focal plan. The D- 90 for the F-GTV in the focal plan was 195 +/-. 60 Gy, the V- 100 was 94 % [range 71 - 100 %]. The maximum distance (cd(95)) between the planned and delivered isodose contours was 0. 48 cm. Conclusions. This study provides an estimate of 0. 5 cm for the margin required for robust coverage of a focal target volume prior to actually implementing a focal treatment protoco...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this pilot}} study is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of 3 D-conformal radiotherapy (3 D-CRT) in the adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy of the vaginal cuff and upper third of present vaginal tissue. Methods. The representative patient (FIGO IB; PH: squamous cell carcinoma) was referred for adjuvant post-hysterectomy radiotherapy. A whole pelvis irradiation with concomitant high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDR-ICBT) was applied. HDR-ICBT total dose of 24 Gy in four fractions/one fraction per week was delivered to the vaginal cuff using two Fletcher-Suit ovoids. The feasibility of change from HDR-ICBT to CRT was evaluated by generating of three different plans using 10 MV photon beams shaped by multileaf collimator. Results and discussion. The referent volume received HDR-ICBT prescribed dose. The maximum ICBT percentage dose to the rectum and urinary bladder was 101 % and 106 % respectively. In all 3 D-CRT plans almost 100 % of planning target volume (PTV) was covered by 95 % therapy <b>isodose</b> <b>surface.</b> From 12 - 13 % of the rectum and 1 - 3 % urinary bladder volume were covered by 100 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface,</b> with the highest maximum dose of 104 % and 101 %, respectively. Comparison of the PTV dose coverage and the maximum dose to the rectum and urinary bladder for HDR-ICBT and 3 D-CRT plans showed no major difference.

40|$|Purpose: A dosimetric margin (DM) is {{the margin}} in a {{specified}} direction between a structure and a specified <b>isodose</b> <b>surface,</b> corresponding to a prescription or tolerance dose. The dosimetric margin distribution (DMD) is {{the distribution of}} DMs over all directions.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} four techniques used for stereotactic radiosurgery, consisting of the static conformal beam, static cone-based, proton therapy, and the Gamma Knife techniques. The comparisons involved six test cases in which phantom target lesions were created {{in the center of}} the modified anthropomorphic RandoRTM head. The phantom lesions presented in the study were extreme irregular cases that ranged in shape and volume and were near a critical structure to receive minimal dose during treatment planning. The best treatment plans from each technique for all studies were selected and the extracted data was analyzed using physical and biological parameters. Correlations between integral biological effective dose (normal brain) and normal tissue complication probability were analyzed as a function of dose conformity (PITV), and correlations between tumor control probability and integral biological effective dose (tumor) as a function of dose homogeneity (MDPD) were analyzed, as well. These parameter pairings showed strong links. The static conformal beam and the proton SOBP techniques consistently provided low PITV and MDPD values for all cases, including the most irregular and complicated cases. Higher PITV and MDPD values, typically associated with static cone-based and the Gamma Knife techniques, were due to normal tissue and tumor tissue, respectively, being irradiated at higher dose levels than the prescribed dose. For these cases, as the PITV increased, the NTCP increased, as well, due to high doses created within the normal tissue found within the prescription <b>isodose</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of CyberKnife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Fifty patients with peripheral stage I NSCLC who refused surgery or were medically inoperable were treated with 48 – 60 Gy (median dose: 57 Gy) in three divided doses. Histopathology was available in 86 % of patients. Thirty patients had a T 1 tumor, and 20 patients had T 2 tumors. More than 95 % of the target volume was covered by the 72 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface.</b> Fiducials were implanted in or near the tumors in all patients to track tumor movement and breathing patterns. The median follow-up time was 35 months (3 – 45 months). Based on computed tomography scans, 40 patients achieved complete remission, six patients achieved partial remission, two patients exhibited stable disease, and two patients had progressive disease. The local control rate (CR? PR) was 92 %, and the 2 -year disease control rate (CR? PR? SD) was 96 %. Overall survival for the whole group was 86 % at 1 year and 74 % at 2 years. Grade III toxicity occurred in two patients (4 %) after marker placement. Treatment-related late grade III toxicity occurred in five patients (10 %). Toxicities greater than grade III were not observed. CyberKnife SBRT achieves a high rate of local control and long-term curative effect with acceptable toxicity for patients with inoperable stage I NSCLC.

40|$|PURPOSE: To find an {{irradiation}} {{technique for}} locoregional irradiation {{of breast cancer}} patients which, compared with a standard technique, improves the dose distribution to the internal mammary-medial supraclavicular (IM-MS) lymph nodes. The improved technique is intended to minimize the lung dose and reduce the dose to the heart. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The standard technique consists of an anterior mixed electron/photon IM-MS field. In the improved technique, an oblique electron and an oblique asymmetric photon field are combined to irradiate the IM lymph nodes. To irradiate the MS lymph nodes, a combination of an anterior electron and an anterior asymmetric photon field is used. For both the standard and the improved technique, tangential photon fields are used to irradiate the breast. Three-dimensional (3 D) treatment planning was performed for 8 patients with various breast sizes for these two techniques. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) were compared for both techniques. The field dimensions and energy of the standard technique were determined at simulation, whereas for the improved technique the fields were designed by CT-based treatment planning. RESULTS: The dose in the breast planning target volume was essentially the same for both techniques. For the improved technique, combined with 3 D localization information, an improvement in the IM-MS planning target coverage is seen. The volume within the 95 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> was on average 25 % (range, 0 - 64 %) and 74 % (range, 43 - 90 %) for the standard and improved technique, respectively. The heart generally receives less dose with the improved technique. However, sometimes a small but acceptable increase in lung dose is found. CONCLUSION: The improved technique, combined with localization information of the IM-MS lymph nodes, greatly improves the dose distribution in the planning target volume for {{a large group of}} patients without significantly increasing the dose to organs at ris...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{plans are}} usually designed, optimized, and {{evaluated}} {{based on the}} total 3 D dose distribution, motivating a total 3 D dose verification. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a 2 D transmission-dosimetry method using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) into a simple 3 D method that provides 3 D dose information. In the new method, the dose is reconstructed within the patient volume in multiple planes parallel to the EPID for each gantry angle. By summing the 3 D dose grids of all beams, the 3 D dose distribution for the total treatment fraction is obtained. The algorithm uses patient contours from the planning CT scan but does not include tissue inhomogeneity corrections. The 3 D EPID dosimetry method was tested for IMRT fractions of a prostate, a rectum, and a head-and-neck cancer patient. Planned and in vivo-measured dose distributions were within 2 % at the dose prescription point. Within the 50 % <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> of the prescribed dose, at least 97 % of points were in agreement, evaluated with a 3 D gamma method with criteria of 3 % of the prescribed dose and 0. 3 cm. Full 3 D dose reconstruction on a 0. 1 x 0. 1 x 0. 1 cm 3 grid and 3 D gamma evaluation took less than 15 min for one fraction on a standard PC. The method allows in vivo determination of 3 D dose-volume parameters that are common in clinical practice. The authors conclude that their EPID dosimetry method is an accurate and fast tool for in vivo dose verification of IMRT plans in 3 D. Their approach is independent of the treatment planning system and provides a practical safety net for radiotherap...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} {{our initial}} experience in using Elekta volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and an anatomy-based treatment planning system (TPS) for single high-dose radiosurgery (SRS-VMAT) of liver metastases. This study included {{a cohort of}} 12 patients treated with a 26 -Gy single fraction. Single-arc VMAT plans were generated with Ergo++ TPS. The prescription <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> (IDS) was selected to fulfill the 2 following criteria: 95 % of planning target volume (PTV) reached 100 % of the prescription dose and 99 % of PTV reached a minimum of 90 % of prescription dose. A 1 -mm multileaf collimator (MLC) block margin was added around the PTV. For a comparison of dose distributions with literature data, several conformity indexes (conformity index [CI], conformation number [CN], and gradient index [GI]) were calculated. Treatment efficiency and pretreatment dosimetric verification were assessed. Early clinical data were also reported. Our results reported that target and organ-at-risk objectives were met for all patients. Mean and maximum doses to PTVs were on average 112. 9 % and 121. 5 % of prescribed dose, respectively. A very high degree of dose conformity was obtained, with CI, CN, and GI average values equal to 1. 29, 0. 80, and 3. 63, respectively. The beam-on-time was on average 9. 3 minutes, i. e., 0. 36 min/Gy. The mean number of monitor units was 3162, i. e., 121. 6 MU/Gy. Pretreatment verification (3 %- 3 mm) showed an optimal agreement with calculated values; mean γ value was 0. 27 and 98. 2 % of measured points resulted with γ < 1. With a median follow-up of 16 months complete response was observed in 12 / 14 (86 %) lesions; partial response was observed in 2 / 14 (14 %) lesions. No radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) was observed in any patients as well no duodenal ulceration or esophagitis or gastric hemorrhage. In conclusion, this analysis demonstrated the feasibility and the appropriateness of high-dose single-fraction SRS-VMAT in liver metastases performed with Elekta VMAT and Ergo++ TPS.

40|$|SummaryAimBreast-conserving surgery (BCS) {{followed}} by radiotherapy (RT) {{has become the}} standard treatment {{for the majority of}} patients with early breast cancer. With regard to boost technique some disagreements are found between groups that are emphasizing the value of electron boost treatment and groups pointing out the value of interstitial brachytherapy (BT) boost treatment. We present the preliminary results in treating selected patients with early-stage breast cancer using high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) as a boost after breast conservation therapy (BCT). Materials/MethodsBetween January 2006 and August 2007, a total of 58 female patients with first and second stage breast cancer underwent BCT. This therapeutic procedure involves BCS, whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) and additional irradiation to the tumour bed (boost) using interstitial HDR-BT via flexible implant tubes. A 10 Gy boost dose was received by all patients. The treatment planning was based on CT-guided 3 D (three-dimensional) reconstruction of the surgical clips, implant tubes and critical structures localization (skin and ribs). The accuracy of tumour bed localization, the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were analyzed. ResultsThe evaluations of implant parameters involved the use of: dose volume histogram (DVH), the volume encompassed by the 100 % reference <b>isodose</b> <b>surface</b> (V 100 %), the high dose volume calculation (V 150 %, V 200 %, V 300 %), the dose non-uniformity ratio (DNR), and the conformity index (COIN). Our results were as follows: the mean PTV volume, the mean high dose volume (V 150 %; V 200 %; V 300 %), the DNR and COIN mean value were estimated at 57. 38, 42. 98, 21. 38, 7. 90, 0. 52 and 0. 83 respectively. ConclusionsCT-guided 3 D HDR-BT is most appropriate for planning the boost procedure after BT especially in large breast volume, in cases with a deep seated tumour bed, as well as in patients with high risk for local recurrences. This technique reduces the possibility of geographical miss. Moreover, better conformity could be achieved between planning the target volume and the treated volume, even at the cost of worse dose homogeneity. The irregular 3 D shape of the target volume and the normal tissue structures can be correctly localized on the basis of visual information obtained from cross-sectional CT imaging. Better local control rate with fewer side effects might be achieved with this technique based on CT imaging...|$|E
