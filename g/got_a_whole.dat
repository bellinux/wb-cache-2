25|$|After {{dealing with}} Jimmy Hart's stable the Fabulous Ones {{suddenly}} <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> different team challenging {{them for the}} gold. Luke Williams and Jonathan Boyd (The Sheepherders) had entered the CWA {{in the fall of}} 1982 and soon came head to head with the Fabulous Ones. The Fabulous Ones / Sheepherder feud stands {{as one of the most}} memorable and bloody feuds. A feud that would rage on in several promotions between 1982 and 1987. The “pretty boy”, well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made for the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started out pretty evenly with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the decisions but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In December, 1982 the Sheepherders won the Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and Mid February the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end. On March 28 the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA giving the Fabulous Ones (Kayfabe) credit for running them out of Memphis.|$|E

[...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new legion of fans." ...|$|E

Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradley Joseph {{was born}} in Bird Island, Minnesota and raised in Willmar, Minnesota, graduating from Willmar Senior High School in 1983. [...] He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench. [...] One morning his father {{taught him how to}} play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece. [...] He started playing {{classical}} piano at age eight, taking lessons {{for a year and a}} half but was self-taught thereafter. [...] While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw Buddy Rich perform. He recalls, [...] "I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked — the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and knew that it was something special, a gift to be shared." [...] Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college. [...] When he picked up the horn, he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different timbres available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras. [...] The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics. [...] After attending Moorhead State University as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs. [...] He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards. Later, he started performing with guitarist Dugan McNeill, whose U2-like group was signed to Polygram. [...] McNeill and Yanni had once played together in the technopop band Chameleon in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Independent, Cathy Pryor declared, [...] "Louis Theroux is out-oddballed {{this week}} by {{the subject of his}} latest {{documentary}} ... Astonishingly, Theroux makes you feel some sympathy for them and the price they pay for being the way they are." [...] Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent posited that viewers were [...] "... wondering, after an hour, whether the Phelps hadn't got a bit more out of it than Louis. They aren't representative of anything but themselves, after all, and they rejoice in the world's detestation. So they had nothing to lose by being held up to ridicule, and gained exactly what they want – a bigger audience for their insane rantings." [...] Writing for The Daily Record, Paul English wrote favorably, [...] "The journalist in me marvels at yet more great work from Theroux. But the human in me mourns that we gave this appalling family exactly what they want. The shiny badge of notoriety..." [...] A review in the Irish Independent was critical of giving any coverage to the group, [...] "Theroux tried to get the teenage daughters to deviate from the standard family line but they weren't budging an inch. The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend every second of their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are." [...] Mike Bradley of The Observer commented about the film, [...] "A shock doc, but an easy target for Theroux." ...|$|E

When an interviewer asked him whether he would consider returning to the role for {{the film version of}} The Hobbit, he said, [...] "I've already been asked and to be honest with you, I wouldn't. I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more." [...] He added that this time around [...] "They've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> different set of problems... because you've <b>got</b> 13 dwarves, <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> band of them...
