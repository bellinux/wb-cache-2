40|$|Research on {{facility}} {{location is}} abundant. However, this research does not typically address the particular conditions that arise when locating facilities to service large-scale emergencies, such as earthquakes, terrorist attacks, etc. In this work we first survey <b>general</b> <b>facility</b> location problems and identify models used to address common emergency situations, such as house fires and regular health care needs. We then analyze {{the characteristics of}} large-scale emergencies and propose a <b>general</b> <b>facility</b> location model that is suited for large-scale emergencies. This <b>general</b> <b>facility</b> location model can be cast as a covering model, a P-median model or a P-center model, each suited for different needs in a large-scale emergency. Illustrative examples are given {{to show how the}} proposed model can be used to optimize the locations of facilities for medical supplies to address large-scale emergencies in the Los Angeles area. Furthermore, comparison of the solutions obtained by respectively using the proposed model and the traditional model is given to show the benefits of the proposed model in reducing life-loss and economic loss...|$|R
