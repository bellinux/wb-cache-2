5|$|Professional divers may be {{required}} by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas {{to enable them to}} reach a place of safety, such as the surface, or a <b>diving</b> <b>bell,</b> based on the planned dive profile. This reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency gas supply (EGS), also known as a bailout cylinder, set or bottle. This usually also applies to professional divers using surface-supplied diving equipment.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The <b>Diving</b> <b>Bell</b> and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The <b>Diving</b> <b>Bell</b> and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E

5|$|Virgin Interactive {{produced}} an adventure {{game for the}} series named Cover-Up At Roswell, released in August 1996. Known as Escape from Quest World in development, Roswell cost $1million to make. Virgin handled all marketing, sales, and distribution; Turner cross-promoted. Developers recycled fifty minutes of footage and art from six season one episodes to construct a new story about the Quest family gathering alien artifacts and saving an extraterrestrial from autopsy at The Pentagon. Jeremiah Surd and the Men in Black of General Tyler plan to misuse the technology and try to hinder the Quests. Gameplay consists of clicking areas on images of locations to navigate paths. Players sometimes encounter minigames, such as guiding a <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> away from rocks or shooting rats with a slingshot. Virgin designed certain segments to be viewed with packaged stereostopic Chromatek plastic glasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of Kronan was {{estimated}} at 326,000 silver dalers in contemporary currency, and {{about half of the}} cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the armaments. It was therefore {{in the interest of the}} Swedish Navy to salvage as many of the cannons as possible. In the early 1660s almost all the guns from Vasa had been brought up through greatly improved technology. Commander Paul Rumpf and Admiral Hans Wachtmeister were put in charge of the salvage of Kronan's cannons. With the help of diving bells, they were able to raise 60 cannons worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. June–August) of 1679–86, beginning as soon as the war with Denmark had ended. In the 1960s, diving expert Bo Cassel made some successful descents to Vasa with a <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> made according to 17th-century specifications. In 1986, further experiments were done on Kronan. The tests proved successful and the conclusion was that the 17th-century operations must have required considerable experience, skill and favorable weather conditions. Though the conditions off Öland were often difficult, with cold water and unpredictable weather, and required a large crew, the expeditions were very profitable. Historian Björn Axel Johansson has calculated that the total cost for the entire crew for all eight diving seasons was less than 2,000 dalers, the value of one of Kronan's 36-pounder guns.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{water spider}} spins four main kinds of silk: (1) silk {{used for the}} <b>diving</b> <b>bell,</b> (2) silk to anchor the <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> to water plants, (3) silk for “walking” so as to get prey and mate, and (4) silk for the egg-cocoon. The <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> silk is “used for breathing,” that is it serves to {{oxygenate}} the <b>diving</b> <b>bell.</b> Females produce larger diving bells than males. Males build their diving bells less carefully than females do. Males also frequently make more walking threads than females.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>Bells</b> {{in which}} {{passengers}} were submerged {{into a large}} tank via hydraulic pistons. An underwater view of the tank was visible through the portholes. The ride was manufactured by Martine and this was their dual Maritime <b>Diving</b> <b>Bells.</b> Another such ride also existed in single fashion at the Long Beach Nupike and also Coney Island Astroland. The thrill of the ride occurred when the bell was allowed to [...] "surface". When the hydraulic pressure holding the bell down was released the bell would shoot {{back up to the}} surface in dramatic fashion.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} {{problems}} are avoided {{by the use of}} surface supplied breathing gas, closed <b>diving</b> <b>bells,</b> and saturation <b>diving,</b> at the cost of logistical complexity, reduced maneuverability of the diver and greater expense.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese {{water spider}} {{is unusual in}} that males are almost always larger than females. This is called sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD). When water spiders mate the male begins by approaching the female’s <b>diving</b> <b>bell.</b> He then chases {{her out of the}} <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> and they begin “courtship swimming.” They then return to the female’s <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> to mate.|$|E

25|$|In 1689, Denis Papin had {{suggested}} that the pressure and fresh air inside a <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> could be maintained by a force pump or bellows. His idea was implemented exactly 100 years later by the engineer John Smeaton who built the first workable diving air pump in 1789.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>bells</b> and [...] submersibles {{expose the}} diver to the direct {{underwater}} environment for less time, {{and provide a}} relatively safe shelter that does not require decompression, with a dry environment where the diver can rest, take refreshment, and if necessary, receive first aid in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|Saturation divers {{are lowered}} {{to the working}} depth and raised {{back to the surface}} in closed <b>diving</b> <b>bells,</b> which are {{pressurized}} to the same pressure as the dive depth. The diver is transferred to and from the hyperbaric accommodation after adjusting the bell pressure to match the storage pressure.|$|R
25|$|In surface-supplied diving, and {{particularly}} in saturation diving, the loss of weights followed by positive buoyancy can expose the diver to potentially fatal decompression injury. Consequently, weight systems for surface-supplied diving where the diver is transported to the worksite by a <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> or stage, are usually not provided with a quick-release system.|$|E
25|$|In 1775, Charles Spalding, an Edinburgh confectioner, {{improved}} on Dr. Halley's {{design by}} adding a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along {{with a series of}} ropes for signaling to the surface crew. Spalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, later suffocated off the coast of Dublin in 1783 doing salvage work in a <b>diving</b> <b>bell</b> of Spalding's design.|$|E
25|$|Closed circuit {{video is}} often fitted to the helmets of surface {{supplied}} commercial divers {{to provide information}} to the surface team of the progress of work done by the diver. This may allow the surface personnel to direct the diver more effectively to facilitate {{the completion of the}} task. This is always used with voice communication. The communications cables for these systems are part of the divers umbilical. Video may also be used to monitor the occupants of a closed <b>diving</b> <b>bell.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Diving</b> <b>bells</b> are {{deployed}} {{over the side}} of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame from which the clump weight and the bell are suspended. On dive support vessels with in-built saturation systems the bell may be deployed through a moon pool. The bell handling system is also known as the launch and recovery system (LARS).|$|R
25|$|In this {{application}} the intention {{is that the}} bailout cylinder should hold sufficient breathing gas for the diver {{to be able to}} reach a place of safety where more breathing gas is available, such as the surface or a <b>diving</b> <b>bell.</b> To achieve this the cylinder must contain enough gas to allow decompression if that is included in the planned dive profile. Cylinder volumes are generally at least 7 litres, and may in some cases be as much as twin 12 litre sets.|$|E
25|$|Surface-supplied diving is diving using {{equipment}} {{supplied with}} breathing gas using a diver's umbilical from the surface, {{either from the}} shore or from a diving support vessel, sometimes indirectly via a <b>diving</b> <b>bell.</b> This is different from scuba diving, where the diver's breathing equipment is completely self-contained {{and there is no}} link to the surface. The primary advantages of conventional surface supplied diving are lower risk of drowning and considerably larger breathing gas supply than scuba, allowing longer working periods and safer decompression.|$|E
25|$|In the Early Modern Period, diving bells {{were often}} used for salvage work. In 1658, Albrecht von Treileben was {{contracted}} by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to salvage the warship , which sank in Stockholm harbor on its maiden voyage in 1628. Between 1663-1665 von Treileben's divers were successful in raising most of the cannon, working from a <b>diving</b> <b>bell.</b> In 1687, Sir William Phipps used an inverted container to recover £200,000-worth of treasure from a Spanish ship sunk {{off the coast of}} San Domingo.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{underwater}} diving starts with freediving as a widespread means of hunting and gathering, both {{for food and}} other valuable resources such as pearls and coral, By classical Greek and Roman times commercial applications such as sponge diving and marine salvage were established, Military diving also has a long history, going back {{at least as far}} as the Peloponnesian War, with recreational and sporting applications being a recent development. Technological development in ambient pressure diving started with stone weights (skandalopetra) for fast descent. In the 16th and 17th centuries <b>diving</b> <b>bells</b> became functionally useful when a renewable supply of air could be provided to the diver at depth, and progressed to surface supplied diving helmets - in effect miniature <b>diving</b> <b>bells</b> covering the diver's head and supplied with compressed air by manually operated pumps - which were improved by attaching a waterproof suit to the helmet and in the early 19th century became the standard diving dress.|$|R
