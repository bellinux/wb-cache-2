5|$|Like so much else, this <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

25|$|Dolphins {{are often}} {{regarded}} as one of Earth's most intelligent animals, though it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just how intelligent. Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See cetacean intelligence for more details.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} indigenous {{influence on}} the Jindyworobaks was literature which had been taken down by white folklorists and anthropologists. Written, as opposed to transcribed, indigenous literature did not appear in print until the 1920s when David Unaipon, a Christian from Point McLeay mission, South Australia, published {{a large body of}} work. Unaipon was publishing into the 1950s, by which time the Jindyworobaks were in decline. Unaipon was the sole published Indigenous Australian writer during their heyday, and indeed {{it was not until the}} 1960s that a second was published - Oodgeroo Noonuccal (Kath Walker). Unaipon, despite coming from South Australia, is not mentioned in the works of the Jindyworobaks, so it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how much of an influence, Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines was.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> which planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard {{was surrounded by}} a niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a double chamber. In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity of this child remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact about it is that it cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary William Joseph Snelling, in his 1831 {{biography}} of Jackson, strongly criticizes Eaton. Of Eaton's Jackson biography, he wrote, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{which is more}} disgraced, the hero [...] or the historian. The book contains scarcely a period of good English, but makes amends by abundance of fulsome adulation, by the admission of many disgraceful acts and the palliation of others." [...] By 1831, Snelling says, he had become [...] "the laughing-stock of the nation." [...] Remini says that [...] "the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And {{it was all so}} needless." ...|$|E

[...] The song has featured in the film Charlie's Angels and the 2002 video game [...] When re-released as part of the [...] campaign in 2006, [...] "Billie Jean" [...] charted at No. 11 in the UK.

500|$|A general {{difficulty}} with {{the application of the}} model, like many game theoretic models, {{is that it does not}} easily lend itself to econometric testing and parameter estimation. As a result, the two avenues of empirical research that have been pursued in subsequent literature have been estimates of a [...] "conjectural variation" [...] parameter for particular industries, and calibration of the models using behavioral parameters from other studies. The former approach assumes that firms have a [...] "conjecture" [...] as to how the other firms will react to their own choice of output and base their decision on this belief. However, the approach is problematic, both from an analytical (it is not internally consistent) and an empirical point of view (there's no guarantee that the parameter, even if it makes conceptual sense, remains stable when a new policy – the government's subsidy – is introduced). Calibrations of models of industry structure on the other hand have generally found that most industry are neither Cournot (in which case the Brander–Spencer policy prescription would be an export subsidy) nor Bertrand (in which case the optimal policy is an export tax). As a result, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in which industries exactly the Brander–Spencer policy prescription may apply.|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{was next}} {{scheduled}} {{to play against}} Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen. [...] "Spassky predicted a tight struggle: 'Larsen is a little stronger in spirit. Before the match, Botvinnik had told a Soviet television audience:It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how their match will end, {{but it is clear}} that such an easy victory as in Vancouver [...] will not be given to Fischer. I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for , all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus, Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible. Fischer beat Larsen by the score of 6–0. Robert Byrne writes: [...] "To a certain extent I could grasp the Taimanov match as a kind of curiosity–almost a freak, a strange chess occurrence that would never occur again. But now I am at a loss for anything whatever to say... So, it is out of the question for me to explain how Bobby, how anyone, could win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen". Just a year before, Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer, and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal. Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer's [...] "incredible" [...] 12–0 score in the two matches. Chess statistician Jeff Sonas concludes that the victory over Larsen gave Fischer the [...] "highest single-match performance rating ever".|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
