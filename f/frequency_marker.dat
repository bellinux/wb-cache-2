This strategy is usually employed when pooling is used to reduce genotyping costs. When the cross progeny are asexual the extreme progeny may be selected by multiple generations of asexual reproduction and selection. In this thesis I will analyse this method of measuring phenotype in asexual cross progeny. The aim {{is to examine the}} behaviour of <b>marker</b> allele <b>frequency</b> due to selection over many generations, and also to identify statistically significant changes in frequency in the selected population. I will show that stochasticity in <b>marker</b> <b>frequency</b> in the selected population arises due the finite initial population size. For Mendelian traits, the initial population size should be at least in the low to mid hundreds to avoid spurious changes in <b>marker</b> <b>frequency</b> in the selected population. For quantitative traits the length of time selection is applied for, as well as the initial population size, will affect the stochasticity in <b>marker</b> <b>frequency.</b> The longer selection is applied for, the more chance of spurious changes in <b>marker</b> <b>frequency.</b> Also for quantitative traits, I will show that the presence of epistasis can hinder changes in <b>marker</b> <b>frequency</b> at selected loci, and consequently make identification of selected loci more difficult.

Although understanding the characteristics of this correlation {{has been the focus}} of many large-scale surveys (culminating in genomewide haplotype maps), the results of different studies have yielded wide-ranging estimates. Since understanding these differences (and whether they can be reconciled) has important implications for whole-genome association studies, in this article we dissect biases in these estimations that are due to known aspects of study design and analytic methodology. In particular, we document in the empirical data that the long-known complicating effects of allele <b>frequency,</b> <b>marker</b> density, and sample size largely reconcile all large-scale surveys. Two exceptions are an underappraisal of redundancy among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when evaluation is limited to short regions (as in candidate-gene resequencing studies) and an inflation in the extent of LD in HapMap phase I, which is likely due to oversampling of specific haplotypes in the creation of the public SNP map.

A genome wise association analysis was performed per trial, using 811 DArT® markers of known map position. At {{the first stage of}} analysis, spatially adjusted genotypic means were created per trial by fitting mixed models. At the second stage, single QTL models were fitted with correction for population substructure, using regression models. Finally, multiple QTL models were constructed by backward selection from a regression model containing all significant markers from the single QTL analyses. In addition to the association analyses per trial, genotype by environment interaction was investigated across the six trials. Landraces seemed best adapted to low yielding environments, while old and modern entries adapted better to high yielding environments. The number of QTL and the magnitude of their effects were comparable for low and high input conditions. However, none of the QTL were found within a given bin at any chromosome in more than two of the six trials. Changes in allele <b>frequencies</b> of <b>marker</b> loci close to QTL for grain yield in landraces, old and modern barley cultivars could be attributed to selection exercised in breeding, suggesting that modern breeding may have increased <b>frequencies</b> of <b>marker</b> alleles close to QTL that favour production particularly under high yield potential environments.

40|$|SummaryRelative-pair {{designs are}} {{routinely}} employed in linkage studies of complex genetic diseases and quantitative traits. Valid {{application of these}} methods requires correct specification of the relationships of the pairs. For example, within a sibship, presumed full sibs actually might be MZ twins, half sibs, or unrelated. Misclassi-fication of half-sib pairs or unrelated individuals as full sibs can result in reduced power to detect linkage. When other family members, such as parents or additional siblings, are available, incorrectly specified relationships usually will be detected through apparent incompatibilities with Mendelian inheritance. Without other family members, sibling relationships cannot be determined absolutely, but they still can be inferred probabilistically if sufficient genetic marker data are available. In this paper, we describe a simple likelihood ratio method to infer the true relationship of a putative sibling pair. We explore the number of markers required to accurately infer relationships typically encountered in a sib-pair study, {{as a function of}} <b>marker</b> allele <b>frequencies,</b> <b>marker</b> spacing, and genotyping error rate, and we conclude that very accurate inference of relationships can be achieved, given the marker data from even part of a genome scan.

40|$|The {{identification}} of genes contributing to complex diseases and quantitative traits requires genetic data of high fidelity, because undetected errors and mutations can profoundly affect linkage information. The recent {{emphasis on the}} use of the sibling-pair design eliminates or decreases the likelihood of detection of genotyping errors and marker mutations through apparent Mendelian incompatibilities or close double recombinants. In this article, we describe a hidden Markov method for detecting genotyping errors and mutations in multilocus linkage data. Specifically, we calculate the posterior probability of genotyping error or mutation for each sibling-pair-marker combination, conditional on all marker data and an assumed genotype-error rate. The method is designed for use with sibling-pair data when parental genotypes are unavailable. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we explore the effects of map density, marker-allele <b>frequencies,</b> <b>marker</b> position, and genotype-error rate on the accuracy of our error-detection method. In addition, we examine the impact of genotyping errors and error detection and correction on multipoint linkage information. We illustrate that even moderate error rates can result in substantial loss of linkage information, given efforts to fine-map a putative disease locus. Although simulations suggest that our method detects ⩽ 50 % of genotyping errors, it generally flags those errors that have the largest impact on linkage results. For high-resolution genetic maps, removal of the errors identified by our method restores most or nearly all the lost linkage information and can be accomplished without generating false evidence for linkage by removing incorrectly identified errors. ...|$|R
