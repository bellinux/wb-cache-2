5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> going.|$|E

And if our stuff wasn't together we had to pay for it with physical forfeits. We're up at five in the morning, we're doing night watches on the hour." ...|$|R

The tenfold path adds the right (liberating) insight, and liberation from rebirth.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "While this isn’t saying much, 'Nerdie' provides one of Season 12’s better shows. Both plots work well, though I prefer the childproofing side of things; it peters {{out at the}} end, but it has some good bits. The episode <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> interested and entertained." [...] Mac McEntire of DVD Verdict cited the scene in which the children imagine {{what kind of person}} the new student is as the greatest moment in the episode.|$|E

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "Other than a nice guest turn from Michael Keaton, 'Mom' doesn’t {{do much to}} {{stand out from the}} crowd. Oh, like much of Season 12, it <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> interested, but that’s not exactly a strong endorsement. 'Mom' provides a watchable show but nothing more." [...] Den of Geek critic Matt Haigh wrote that the episode [...] "starts well, but begins to feel tired and drawn out, and there just doesn't seem to be much of a story there." ...|$|E
500|$|Small Mercies {{and their}} antecedents' music was {{influenced}} by numerous artists. In January 2001 Blaik described 7th Avenue's connections, [...] "bands like Live, Counting Crows and Pearl Jam so it’s not too heavy... We mainly play covers at gigs but we add our own flavour as well. It’s a change that <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> interested and our influence comes through in the music." [...] He identified his favourite albums: August and Everything After by Counting Crows, Live's Throwing Copper, and The Joshua Tree by U2. Blaik summarised that he [...] "loves great storytellers". As blaik, the band, in June 2003 their website wrote that their sound was [...] "emotional folk pop".|$|E
500|$|Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, {{felt that}} the film was [...] "far better as an antiwar film than as a poetic tribute to flight". Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "It feels morose and unrelieved, {{despite the efforts of}} ..." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long {{to live up to its}} ambitious premise." [...] Jack Zink of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "takes a while to hook you into its story. This is one {{occasion}} we can afford the wait; Parker <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> awake by repeatedly slapping us across the face visually." ...|$|E

He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy." ...|$|E

Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> from winning this championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Enemies & Allies was {{published}} by William Morrow and Company, an imprint of HarperCollins. The novel was released as a hardcover in May2009 and as a paperback in October2010. Book reviewers had mixed reactions. The review in Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "hokey, contrived imagining" [...] of the team-up of Superman and Batman, concluding that it was [...] "a schlocky mediocrity for die-hard fans only." [...] Stacey Rottiers in Library Journal found Anderson's portrayal of Metropolis and Gotham City, {{as well as the}} [...] "imposing feel of the Soviet presence" [...] to be well done. Both the Publishers Weekly and Library Journal reviews noted flat characterization and recommended the novel to comic fans only. In Booklist, Carl Hays had a more positive review, writing [...] "Anderson <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> guessing throughout with clever plot twists and some intriguing alternate cold war history." [...] The review in Kirkus Reviews was also positive, saying, [...] "this is a refreshing diversion from the grimness of The Dark Knight or the tedious Superman Returns. Injects a welcome dose of retro exuberance into the capes-and-tights routine." ...|$|E

500|$|Chabon's {{forays into}} genre fiction {{have met with}} mixed {{critical}} reaction. One science fiction short story by Chabon, [...] "The Martian Agent," [...] was described by a reviewer as [...] "enough to send readers back into the cold but reliable arms of The New Yorker." [...] Another critic wrote of the same story that it was [...] "richly plotted, action-packed," [...] and that [...] "Chabon skilfully elaborates his world and draws {{not just on the}} steampunk worlds of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and Michael Moorcock, but on alternate histories by brilliant science fiction mavericks such as Avram Davidson and Howard Waldrop. The imperial politics are craftily resonant and the story <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> hanging on." [...] While The Village Voice called The Final Solution [...] "an ingenious, fully imagined work, an expert piece of literary ventriloquism, and a mash note to the beloved boys' tales of Chabon's youth," [...] The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "he genre of the comic book is an anemic vein for novelists to mine, lest they squander their brilliance." [...] The New York Times states that the detective story, [...] "a genre that is by its nature so constrained, so untransgressive, seems unlikely to appeal to the real writer," [...] but adds that [...] "... Chabon makes good on his claim: a successful detective story need not be lacking in literary merit." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and I think his boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy VI {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of the best titles in the series and one of the best role-playing video games ever created. In 2005, IGN placed Final Fantasy VI 56th on their list of the 100 greatest games, as the second highest ranked Final Fantasy title on the list after Final Fantasy IV. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it as the 13th top 200 game on any Nintendo platform, suggesting that it might be the best Final Fantasy ever. That same year, readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu voted it as the 25th best game of all time. In 2008, Final Fantasy VI took the #1 spot on G4 TV's [...] "Top Must Own RPGs" [...] list. That same year, ScrewAttack named Final Fantasy VI the third best SNES game, beaten only by [...] and Super Metroid. In 2009, Final Fantasy VI was inducted into the IGN Videogame Hall of Fame, becoming the second Final Fantasy game to do so (the only other Final Fantasy to do so was the original Final Fantasy). In 2012, also IGN put Final Fantasy VI as number one on their list of the top role-playing video games, stating: [...] "There are too many moments in Final Fantasy VI worthy of celebration to name them all. Biggs and Wedge leading Terra through the snow. The poisoning of Doma. Sandy boots. The destruction of the world. A tragic opera. Ultros! We hold these close to our hearts, and that's not even including Espers and the most poignant character themes in the series to date. So cheers, Final Fantasy VI. May your name follow us as we all tumble towards the future of art, entertainment, narrative, and everything that <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> gaming." [...] In an updated version of the [...] "Top 100" [...] list in 2007, IGN ranked Final Fantasy VI as the ninth top game of all time, above all other Final Fantasy games in the series. They continued to cite the game's character development, and especially noted Kefka as [...] "one of the most memorable bad guys in RPG history." [...] In 2009, Game Informer put the SNES version of Final Fantasy III eighth on their list of the top games of all time, opining that it [...] "perfected the 2D role-playing game." [...] It fell from its seventh-place ranking the staff gave it in 2001. In 2012, the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the ninth best SNES game, stating that [...] "for it to remain so effective and so moving for so long after its 1994 release means it is a true work of art, and demands to sit high atop any list, regardless of platform (we did already name it the 14th best game of all time)." [...] In 2017, the staff of IGN ranked it as the second best RPG game of all time, stating that [...] "This willingness to explore heavy themes and unthinkable outcomes — made all the more poignant when set against dramatic set pieces and a soaring score — is one of the biggest reasons why Squaresoft’s 1994 magnum opus is so very special." ...|$|E
