500|$|Schwimmer {{made his}} directorial feature {{debut in the}} 2007 British comedy film Run Fatboy Run. The film stars Simon Pegg {{as a man who}} signs up for a {{marathon}} (he is out of shape) to convince his former fiancée and five-year-old son that he has turned his life around. When asked why he decided to direct the film, Schwimmer said: [...] "As a director, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the challenge that I thought the script presented, which was that it was kind of three films in one. You had some great, big physical comedy, and I thought funny dialogue and characters. And then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect". Run Fatboy Run garnered mixed reception, with the New York Daily News rating it one-and-a-half out of five stars and writing, [...] "Most disappointing is how Schwimmer—who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters—manages to bumble 'Fatboy's' tender moments". USA Today, however, was favorable towards Schwimmer, reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse [...] "having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera". For his directorial work, he was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Debut Director.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E

In a distant shot of Smith's son Jaden running down a riverbed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> how many small rocks were defined clearly from such a distance.

[...] The cinematographer Peter Suschitzky was apologetic about that, saying [...] "The movie is only half in true 4K. I'm sad about that. It still looks good.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{works for}} the theater were a score for Euripides' The Bacchae (2009, {{directed}} by JoAnne Akalaitis), and Kepler (2009), yet another operatic biography of a scientist or explorer. The opera {{is based on the}} life of 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler, against the background of the Thirty Years' War, with a libretto compiled from Kepler's texts and poems by his contemporary Andreas Gryphius. It is Glass's first opera in German, and was premiered by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and Dennis Russell Davies in September 2009. LA Times critic Mark Swed and others described the work as [...] "oratorio-like"; Swed pointed out the work is Glass's [...] "most chromatic, complex, psychological score" [...] and [...] "the orchestra dominates (...) <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the muted, glowing colors, the character of many orchestral solos and the poignant emphasis on bass instruments".|$|E

2500|$|After Barrera’s {{death in}} 2001—his body {{reportedly}} {{found in the}} exact spot where he found the girl’s body fifty years before—the area became a popular tourist attraction where visitors bring more dolls. The locals describe it as “charmed”—not haunted—even though travelers claim the dolls whisper to them. Professional photographer Cindy Vasko visited the nightmarish island in 2015 and described it as the [...] "creepiest place [...] ever visited". The excursion began through maze-like canals, surrounded by lush greenery and beautiful singing birds, but soon her boat was slowed down by a swarm of lily pads and the canal fell ominously silent. She told MailOnline: [...] "At {{the end of the}} journey, the trajinera turned along a bend in the waterway and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> a surreal vision of hundreds, maybe thousands, of dolls hanging from trees on the tiny island." [...] The dolls are still on the island, which is accessible by boat. The island was featured on the Travel Channel show Ghost Adventures and the Amazon Prime show Lore (TV series).|$|E
2500|$|Bellairs {{undertook}} The Face in the Frost {{while living}} in Britain and after reading J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, {{but it is not}} much like that book, apart from sharing the idea of a wizard who is palpably human and not a literary stereotype. Bellairs said of his third book: [...] "The Face in the Frost was an attempt to write in the Tolkien manner. I was much taken by The Lord of the Rings and wanted to do a modest work on those lines. In reading the latter book <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the fact that Gandalf was not much of a person—just a good guy. So I gave Prospero, my wizard, most of my phobias and crotchets. It was simply meant as entertainment and any profundity will have to be read in." [...] Writing in 1973, Lin Carter described The Face in the Frost as one of the three best fantasy novels to appear since The Lord of the Rings. Carter stated that Bellairs was planning a sequel to The Face in the Frost at the time. An unfinished sequel titled The Dolphin Cross was included in the 2009 anthology Magic Mirrors, which was published by the New England Science Fiction Association Press.|$|E
2500|$|Balachander and {{his unit}} could not trace Sulakshana who {{disappeared}} from the film scene 12 years ago. So they decided to kill Bhairavi's character and keep her as a photograph in the serial. As it transpired, Sulakshana {{found out about the}} sequel from the newspapers and contacted Balachander. To his delight, she told him she would play Bhairavi. [...] "They were so happy to see me," [...] she said. [...] "The script was rewritten and Bhairavi was alive again. I am happy to act as Bhairavi. She is still the same soft person. The only difference is she is older and the mother of two children. There is more understanding between JKB and Bhairavi now -- she doesn't fight with him". Carnatic singer Anuradha Krishnamoorthy, who has never acted before, will play Sindhu. When contacted by Minbimangal, a surprised Anuradha was reluctant to accept the offer. [...] "My initial reaction was I am not interested in acting. I am a professional singer. I had absolutely no plans to act. I told them I needed time to think. It was my husband's gentle persuasion that made me meet K Balachander. Once I met him, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> his simplicity. When he told me they would see to it that my kacheris (concerts) would not get affected because of the shooting, I said yes". [...] "That Suhasini acted in the original film does not bother me at all," [...] she says. [...] "I am a student as far as acting is concerned. My only concern is I shouldn't disappoint Balachander". Rajhesh Vaidhya, who is composing the songs for the serial, faces a tough challenge; the songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja for the film are considered masterpieces. Carnatic stalwarts Dr M Balamurali Krishna and Sudha Ragunathan will render the songs.|$|E

2500|$|The cabinet which Papen formed {{was known}} as the [...] "cabinet of barons" [...] or as the [...] "cabinet of monocles" [...] and was widely {{regarded}} with ridicule by Germans. Papen had virtually no support in the Reichstag; the only parties committed to supporting him was the far-right/national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and German People's Party. However, Papen became very close to Hindenburg. The French Ambassador André François-Poncet reported to his superiors in the Quai d'Orsay about Papen's influence on Hindenburg that [...] "It's he [...] who is the preferred one, the favorite of the Marshal; he diverts the old man through his vivacity, his playfulness; he flatters him by showing him respect and devotion; he beguiles him with his daring; he is in [...] eyes the perfect gentleman." [...] Papen first met Hitler in June 1932, and found him a ridiculous figure. Papen always spoke his German with an aristocratic, Westphalian accent and found Hitler with his lower-class Austrian accent of German to be an absurd man, deserving only of contempt. Papen wrote about his meeting with Hitler:"I found him curiously unimpressive. I could detect no inner quality which might explain his extraordinary hold on the masses. He was wearing a dark blue suit and seemed the complete petite-bourgeous. He had an unhealthy complexion, and with his little moustache and curious hair style had an indefinable bohemian quality. His demeanor was modest and polite, and although I had heard much about the magnetic quality of his eyes, I do not remember being impressed by them...As he talked about his party's aims <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the fanatical insistence with which he presented his arguments.
