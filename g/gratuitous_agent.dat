It might be thought {{there was nothing more}} calculated to awake men's resentment, and yet his rule was not more thorough than it was beneficent. His thought for the keepers was continual, and it did not end with their lives. He tried to manage their successions; he thought no pains too great to arrange between a widow and a son who had succeeded his father; he was often harassed and perplexed by tales of hardship; and I find him writing, almost in despair, of their improvident habits and the destitution that awaited their families upon a death.

Thus I find him writing to a keeper in 1806, when his mind was already pre-occupied with arrangements for the Bell Rock: [...] "I am much afraid I stand very unfavourably with you as a man of promise, as I was to send several things of which I believe I have more than once got the memorandum. All I can say is that in this respect you are not singular. This makes me no better; but really I have been driven about beyond all example in my past experience, and have been essentially obliged to neglect my own urgent affairs." [...] No servant of the Northern Lights came to Edinburgh but he was entertained at Baxter's Place to breakfast. There, at his own table, my grandfather sat down delightedly with his broad-spoken, homespun officers. His whole relation to the service was, in fact, patriarchal; and I believe I may say that throughout its ranks he was adored. I have spoken with many who knew him; I was his grandson, and their words may have very well been words of flattery; but there was one thing that could not be affected, and that was the look and light that came into their faces at the name of Robert Stevenson.|$|E

40|$|Trent Dougherty argues (contra Jonathan Matheson) {{that when}} taking into {{consideration}} the probabilities involving skeptical theism (ST) and <b>gratuitous</b> evils, an <b>agent</b> may reasonably affirm both ST and that gratuitous evils exist. In other words, Dougherty thinks that assigning a greater than. 5 probability to ST is insufficient to defeat the commonsense problem of evil. I argue that Dougherty’s response assumes, incorrectly, that ST functions solely as an evidential defeater, and that, when understood as a closure of inquiry defeater, ST may still defeat reasonable belief in gratuitous evils, {{even in the face}} of strong evidence that gratuitous evils exist.

5000|$|The {{free will}} {{controversy}} can be outlined in three parts: (1) A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were {{a product of}} his karma, he is devoid of free will, he {{can not make a}} choice, he is an agent of karma, and that he merely delivering necessary punishments his [...] "wicked" [...] victims deserved for their own karma in past lives. Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma? (2) Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral <b>agent,</b> <b>gratuitous</b> harm and seek justice? Or, should one blame oneself for bad karma over past lives, assume that the unjust suffering is fate? (3) Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral-education because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one's action and sufferings? ...|$|R
