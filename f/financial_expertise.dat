5|$|Sherman's <b>financial</b> <b>expertise</b> and his {{friendship}} with Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends in the next four years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E

25|$|Forced {{to reduce}} their {{activities}} in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the Genoese had turned to North African trade of wheat, olive oil (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant deficit in silver and gold, as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted, the lack of bullion leading {{to the development of}} a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, Banco di San Giorgio, was founded in 1407 at Genoa).

25|$|Established {{inside the}} United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the Panel is tasked with {{evaluating}} {{the conclusion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury that a company is in (or in danger of) default.

If the Panel concurs with the Secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into receivership; if they do not concur, the Secretary has an opportunity to amend and refile his or her petition. In the event that a Panel decision is appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a writ of certiorari may be filed with the United States Supreme Court. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the Secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of the {{characteristics}} of the audit committee <b>financial</b> and accounting <b>expertise</b> on <b>financial</b> reporting timeliness. Timeliness of financial reporting is measured using 2 variables: earnings announcement lag and audit report lag. The characteristics of audit committee <b>financial</b> and accounting <b>expertise</b> are measured by the proportion of the <b>financial</b> and accounting <b>expertise</b> in the audit committee and the presence of accounting expertise on audit committee chair. This study uses secondary data from financial statements and annual reports of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange within the period 2011 - 2014. Based on the purposive sampling method, there are 81 companies that met the sampling criteria. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The result shows that accounting expertise on audit committee chair has a significant negative effect on the timeliness of financial reporting. In other words, the audit committee who chaired by an accounting expert can shorten the time needed for financial reporting. Meanwhile, <b>financial</b> and accounting <b>expertise</b> on audit committee does not significantly affect the timeliness of financial reporting. It means the existence of financial and accounting experts on the overall audit committee members do not affect the company's financial reporting period...|$|R
