5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} apron, the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ring apron and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take drastic measures to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually tore off her skirt and threw it into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying elbow and Hogan's legdrop -- before taking the pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E
5|$|Wrestle Kingdom 9 {{featured}} {{two main}} event matches. In the first, Shinsuke Nakamura defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Kota Ibushi. Ibushi ridiculed Nakamura and used {{several of the}} champion's moves, including the corner vibration boot, the reverse powerslam, and the Boma Ye knee strike. Nakamura, responding aggressively, {{kicked out of the}} latter at one. Nakamura used a variety of knee-based strikes, and Ibushi's attacks included a standing corkscrew moonsault, a roundhouse kick, an elevated sit-out powerbomb, and a double stomp to the chest. Ibushi also <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top rope, grabbing Nakamura on the apron, and German-suplexed him back into the ring for a two count. In the finishing sequence, Ibushi got up immediately after receiving a knee from the second rope {{to the back of his}} head; both attempted the Boma Ye, but Nakamura recovered first with the Landslide and then the Boma Ye knee to retain the title at 20 minutes and 12 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers bumped fists.|$|E
5|$|John Wilkes Booth had {{originally}} planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell. Having found {{no opportunity to}} abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three {{senior members of the}} Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped {{at the top of the}} stairs by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) to one side, and <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.|$|E

5|$|This {{turned out}} to be unnecessary, however, as Tyler Fredrickson's punt was {{returned}} 52yards by Virginia Tech's DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. Hall's return tied the game at 49–49, and with 3:11 remaining in the game, California took over on offense. On his first play after receiving Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The Bears' Chris Murphy <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball, preventing what otherwise might have been a game-losing turnover. Rodgers recovered from the fumble by completing three straight passes: first to J. J. Arrington for 11yards, then to Brandon Hall for 18yards and a first down, then to Burl Toler for 22yards and another first down. The last play took California deep into Virginia Tech territory. At the Tech 20-yard line, Rodgers rushed for a five-yard gain, then prepared the offense for a potential game-winning field goal kick. With twoseconds remaining on the clock, California called timeout and sent in kicker Tyler Fredrickson. Despite an attempt by Virginia Tech to ice the kicker by calling its final timeout, Fredrickson was undeterred by the pressure and his 35-yard field goal sailed through the goalposts as time expired. The kick gave California three points and the 52–49 victory.|$|E

25|$|At a {{time when}} the women's {{suffrage}} movement was much in the news, in March 1914 Kalem Studios' competitor Pathé Frères released an adventure film serial titled The Perils of Pauline. Starring Pearl White as a bold and daring heroine, the Pathé serial became an enormous box-office success. As a result, Kalem Studios <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bandwagon and in November 1914 released their own adventure series called The Hazards of Helen.|$|E
25|$|During Tecumseh's War and the War of 1812, Waubonsie {{supported}} Tecumseh and the British against American expansion.

25|$|Jackson's {{economic}} growth was further stimulated in the 1930s {{by the discovery}} of natural gas fields nearby. Speculators had begun searching for {{oil and natural gas}} in Jackson beginning in 1920. The initial drilling attempts came up empty. This failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state's insane asylum to begin a well on its grounds in 1924, where he found natural gas. (Render eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did {{not have the right to}} lease the state's property.) Businessmen <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area. The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment. By 1930, there were 14 derricks in the Jackson skyline.|$|E
25|$|Her Imperial Majesty Empress Elisabeth of Austria visited Summerhill House in February 1879. The {{preparations}} were a well kept secret; {{the first}} thing that had to be sorted is where would she stay. Meath hunted the best hounds and Summerhill was centrally located, so Summerhill was chosen. When she was on one hunt in Dunshaughlin, as they came to Maynooth, they came across two men repairing a demesne wall of the Catholic seminary. As the deer they were hunting jumped into the land of the college, Her Imperial Majesty followed without knowing where she was going and nearly <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> President of the college, Professor William Walsh, who later became His Grace The Most Reverend Dr. William Walsh, Lord Primate of Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Dublin.|$|E

25|$|Warwickshire Bears <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quarter-final train just as {{it seemed}} to be leaving the station, {{grabbing}} the ticket {{out of the hands of}} Somerset Sabres. Neil Carter and Ian Bell opened the batting and scored quickly, sending the score to 40 for 1, but part-timer William Durston got three wickets in quick succession to have three for four at one point. Trevor Penney then smashed three successive sixes off Durston to end with 35 not out off 13 balls. Thus, Warwickshire closed on 172 for 8, and patient bowling from Carter and Alex Loudon sent them crumbling to 89 for 6. Arul Suppiah and Durston paired up for 27 for the seventh wicket, but when Suppiah was bowled by Jonathan Trott it looked hopeless for Somerset. Jamie Anyon wrapped them up with a hat-trick to end Somerset's innings on 125.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} for the WWE United States Championship between Booker T and Chris Benoit. Before the match began, Booker {{announced}} that he would forfeit the United States title. As Benoit confronted Sharmell, Booker attacked Benoit. Benoit controlled the match in the beginning as he performed a series of suplexes. After Booker told the referee that his groin was re-injured, the referee backed Benoit away but Booker pushed him into the steel steps. Benoit performed a series of German suplexes and paid tribute to Eddie Guerrero by performing the Three Amigos. Booker attempted a Houston Hangover but missed. Benoit executed a series of German suplexes until Sharmell <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> apron. Benoit attempted a diving headbutt but Sharmell's distraction allowed Booker to counter. Booker executed a Scissors Kick for a near-fall. Sharmell distracted Benoit again and Booker pinned him with a roll up but Benoit countered into a Sharpshooter attempt, which Booker countered. Benoit avoided a Scissors Kick and applied the Sharpshooter but Booker fought the move. Benoit forced Booker to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the title.|$|E

When the truck suddenly stalled {{in the middle of the}} street, a shootout occurred resulting in the deaths of both Bob Ashley and Riblet. Angered by Bob's killing spree, several thousand Miami residents threatened the jailhouse and talked of lynching John Ashley in his cell. It was only after police paraded the body of Bob Ashley though the streets that the mob dispersed.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on September 22 with a 4 1/2 game {{lead in the}} division to begin their final homestand of the season against the second place Giants before a crowd of 53,500, {{the largest in the}} Majors in 2014. Dan Haren allowed only one hit (a leadoff home run by Gregor Blanco) in his seven innings of work but the Dodgers defense coughed up three errors and the team failed to get a hit after the sixth inning. The Giants eventually won 5–2 in 13 innings. In the following game, Grienke pitched eight innings and Justin Turner hit two home runs as the Dodgers won 4–2 to cut their magic number to one. Clayton Kershaw struck out 11 while only allowing one run in eight innings and the Dodgers <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Giants and won 9–1 on September 24 to clinch their second straight National League West division championship and home field advantage in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. With the team resting several regulars the next game, Scott Elbert picked up his first win in two years and the Dodgers beat the Rockies 7–4. Scott Van Slyke had two hits, two steals and scored the winning run on a wild pitch in the 12th inning as the Dodgers beat the Rockies 6–5 in the second to last game of the regular season. Juan Uribe managed the team in the season finale and they hit three home runs to finish off the Rockies 10–5. The Dodgers finished the regular season with a record of 94–68.|$|E
25|$|Former North Bay Centennials and University of New Brunswick star Bill Wright {{replaced}} Chris Cobb at UMass for the 2012–13 season, and {{his tenure}} {{has been marked}} by increased success both nationally and within the ECWHL. Wright inherited a strong team that already included the aforementioned stars, then added key freshmen Ally Perdios and Jess Greenwood, along with Penn State transfer Paige Harrington, to the fray. While that roster and 2011–12's surprise run didn't initially inspire confidence among rankings voters - the Minutemen began the year placed 14th, their second lowest position ever to start a season - they quickly converted doubters and, {{by the end of the}} regular season, were ranked second only to Liberty, a new program best. That bit of history was made possible by another: UMass' first-ever ECWHL tournament title, thanks to a 2–1 title game win over defending ACHA national champion Northeastern. An impressive journey at the ACHA National Tournament in Ashburn, Virginia followed, with an opening 3–2 win over 2011 national champ Michigan State, as second-period goals from Oteri, Labossiere and Chelsea Bräm turned around an early 2–0 deficit. Although Northeastern took an ECWHL final rematch in the day one nightcap (the first day of the tournament involved two pool games played by each team at the time), two more Oteri goals delivered a vital 2–1 victory over Robert Morris (IL) that, along with tiebreaker help, sent UMass through to the semifinals for the third time in program history. Once there, however, eventual champ Minnesota <b>jumped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Minutemen for three goals in the first ten minutes of the contest en route to a 5–1 result.|$|E
