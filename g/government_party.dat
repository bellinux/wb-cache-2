25|$|The {{opposition}} in Haiti accused the <b>government</b> <b>party</b> of election {{fraud in the}} Haitian general election, 2000 as did the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{consequence of}} the kidnapping was the exclusion of PCI from any government cabinet in the following years. Although increasingly weakened, DC remained the main <b>government</b> <b>party</b> until 1994 (although in 1981, {{for the first time}} since the formation of the Italian Republic Giovanni Spadolini, a non-Christian Democrat, became premier in a DC-based alliance).|$|E
25|$|The Tories sent Allan MacNab and Cayley to London {{in early}} May {{to bring their}} {{petitions}} to the Imperial Parliament and lobby their case with the Colonial Office. The <b>government</b> <b>party</b> delegated Francis Hinks, who left Montreal on May 14, to represent {{the point of view}} of the governor, his Executive Council, and the majority of the members in both Houses of Parliament.|$|E
50|$|On 3 June 2010, Christian Wulff (CDU), the {{incumbent}} Premier of Lower Saxony, was nominated {{as the candidate}} of the <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> (CDU, CSU, FDP). Prior to this, Federal Minister of Labour Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) had been considered the front-runner for the nomination of the <b>government</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 17 May 1992 the {{two leading}} <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> {{announced}} that although they supported the constitutional amendment, they also favoured transitional clauses {{that would permit}} Suchinda to serve as prime minister for the term of the parliament. It became clear the <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> would not honour their word, and plans went ahead for a strike on Sunday, 17 May.|$|R

25|$|In June 1898, Ōkuma co-founded the Kenseitō (Constitutional <b>Government</b> <b>Party),</b> by merging his Shimpotō with Itagaki Taisuke's Jiyūtō, and was {{appointed}} by the Emperor to form the first partisan cabinet in Japanese history. The new cabinet survived for only four months before it fell apart due to internal dissension. Ōkuma remained {{in charge of the}} party until 1908, when he retired from politics.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, for {{the first}} time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one republican (Giovanni Spadolini) and one socialist (Bettino Craxi); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main <b>government</b> <b>party.</b> During Craxi's government, the economy {{recovered}} and Italy became the world's fifth largest industrial nation, gaining entry into the G7 Group. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the GDP.|$|E
25|$|With {{a fragile}} economy and Zhou falling ill to cancer, Deng Xiaoping {{returned}} to the political scene, taking up the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, {{in the first of}} a series of promotions approved by Mao. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the <b>government,</b> <b>party,</b> and military, earning the additional titles of PLA General Chief of Staff, Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party, and Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission in a short time span.|$|E
40|$|We ﬁnd strong {{evidence}} of monopoly legislative agenda control by <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> in the Bundestag. First, the <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> have near-zero roll rates, while {{the opposition parties}} are often rolled over half the time. Second, only opposition parties’ (and not government parties’) roll rates increase with the distances of each party from the ﬂoor median. Third, almost all policy moves are towards the government coalition (the only exceptions occur during periods of divided government). Fourth, roll rates for <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> sky- rocket when they fall into the opposition and roll rates for opposition parties plummet when they enter government, while policy movements go from being nearly 100 per cent rightward {{when there is a}} rightist government to 100 per cent leftward under a leftist government...|$|R
50|$|<b>Government</b> <b>parties</b> are denoted {{with the}} letter G, with the Democratic Party holding the office of Prime Minister (Xavier Bettel). O stands for opposition.|$|R
50|$|As expected, the {{coalition}} won a landslide victory. The <b>government</b> <b>parties,</b> along with pro-coalition independents, won 50 of the 55 {{seats in the}} legislature.|$|R
25|$|Members of the House occupy red benches {{on three}} sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Speaker's right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The Lords Spiritual (archbishops and bishops of the {{established}} Church of England) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The Lords Temporal (nobles) sit according to party affiliation: members of the <b>Government</b> <b>party</b> sit on the Spiritual Side, while those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches {{in the middle of}} the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as crossbenchers.|$|E
25|$|The party, {{under the}} {{stronger}} influence of Ciriaco De Mita (from 1982 to 1989), Giulio Andreotti and Arnaldo Forlani (from 1989), remained a <b>government</b> <b>party</b> until 1994; in the 1992 elections went {{down for the}} first time below 30% of the votes due to the Lega Nord's growth in Northern Italy, and following the requests of Mani pulite scandal (and the ties between the Mafia and Andreotti himself) that also involved the allied parties (in addition to former PCI, renamed PDS, involved at the local level), continued to lose support. In 1994 the party was disbanded and the DC's last secretary, Mino Martinazzoli, decided to change the name of the party to the Italian People's Party.|$|E
25|$|Sir Eric Gairy had led Grenada to {{independence}} from the United Kingdom in 1974. His term in office coincided with civil strife in Grenada. The political environment was highly charged and although Gairy—head of the Grenada United Labour Party—claimed victory {{in the general election}} of 1976, the opposition did not accept the result as legitimate. The civil strife took the form of street violence between Gairy's private army, the Mongoose Gang, and gangs organized by the New Jewel Movement (NJM). In the late 1970s the NJM began planning to overthrow the <b>government.</b> <b>Party</b> members began to receive military training outside of Grenada. On 13 March 1979, while Gairy was out of the country, the NJM—led by Maurice Bishop—launched an armed revolution and overthrew the government, establishing the People's Revolutionary Government.|$|E
50|$|The eight members {{nominated}} by the Government {{and the two}} independent candidates hold the balance of power. Since the NFU {{is supported by the}} <b>Government</b> <b>Party's</b> main rival, the Fiji Labour <b>Party,</b> <b>Government</b> appointees to the Council have always been rivals of the NFU.|$|R

25|$|The 1912 Oregon ballot for United State Senate was cluttered. In {{addition}} to the Democrat Harry Lane and Bob Selling, candidate of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, progressive Republicans had other electoral alternatives, including candidates of the Progressive Party and the Popular <b>Government</b> <b>Party.</b> Meanwhile, Floyd Ramp stood for the Socialists and yet another candidate was nominee of the Prohibition Party. Astoundingly, each of these six candidates took more than 5% of the vote — a fact which enabled the Democrat Lane to win election with a plurality {{of the vote in}} solidly Republican Oregon. Intent on proving himself a man of the people, Harry Lane set what might be a record for campaign frugality in his victorious effort, with his entire race run for the princely sum of $75 plus travel expenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{court in}} Saint Petersburg {{pronounced}} its statement July 9, 1826. Of 121 prisoners found guilty, 61 {{belonged to the}} Northern Society, 60 to the Southern Society and the United Slavs, although {{only a small fraction}} of them was directly involved in the revolt. Thirty-six Decembrists were sentenced to death. Nicholas commuted most of the sentences, although in an indiscriminate manner inconsistent with each individual's guilt. Five were actually hanged, including the Chernigov Regiment leaders Sergey Muravyov-Apostol and Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin. Others received sentences ranging from demotion to Army service to life in Siberia. In 1828 one of the Chernigov Regiment veterans, Ivan Sukhinov, was indicted in an attempted prison riot and committed suicide. Prosecution of the Decembrists, most of them ethnic Russian nobles, by a <b>government</b> <b>party</b> led by ethnic Germans (Geismar, Benckendorff, Osten-Sacken) gave rise to rumours of a German conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{economic}} growth and success in diplomatic relations, the government that gained power by coup d'etat was essentially a military regime and the public's support and trust in it was low when the promises for democratic reform never materialized. In the 1985 National Assembly elections, opposition parties won more votes than the <b>government</b> <b>party,</b> clearly indicating that the public wanted a change. Many started to sympathize with the protesting students. The Gwangju Massacre was never forgotten and in January 1987, when a protesting Seoul National University student died under police interrogation, public fury was immense. In April 1987, President Chun made a declaration that measures would be taken to protect the current constitution, instead of reforming it {{to allow for the}} direct election of the president. This announcement consolidated and strengthened the opposition; in June 1987, more than a million students and citizens participated in the nationwide anti-government protests of the June Democracy Movement.|$|E

50|$|A snap {{election}} in 2008 saw both <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> losing votes, however the coalition between SPÖ and ÖVP was renewed, with Werner Faymann, {{the new leader}} of the SPÖ, following Alfred Gusenbauer as Chancellor.|$|R
50|$|As of 2011 {{only the}} five <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> were {{represented}} in the Council of States. In the National Council the party landscape is more diverse with six non-government parties having at least one seat.|$|R
25|$|Political {{parties and}} trade unions were {{forbidden}} {{except for the}} <b>government</b> <b>party,</b> Traditionalist Spanish Falange and Offensive of the Unions of the National-Syndicalist (Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista or FET de las JONS), and the official trade union Spanish Trade Union Organisation (Sindicato Vertical). Hundreds of militants and supporters of the parties and trade unions declared illegal under Franco's dictatorship, such as the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Español), PSOE; the Communist Party of Spain (Partido Comunista de España), PCE; the Workers' General Union (Unión General de Trabajadores), UGT; and the National Confederation of Labor (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo), CNT, were imprisoned or executed. The regional languages, like Basque and Catalan, were also forbidden, and the statutes of autonomy of Catalonia and the Basque country were abolished. Censorship of the press (the Law of Press, passed in April 1938) and of cultural life was rigorously exercised and forbidden books destroyed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the north}} end of the Chamber is the Speaker's Chair, a present to Parliament from the Commonwealth of Australia. The current British Speaker's Chair is an exact copy of the Speaker's Chair given to Australia, by the House of Commons, to {{celebrate}} the opening of Old Parliament House, Canberra. In front of the Speaker's Chair is the Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons' ceremonial mace. The Table was a gift from Canada. The dispatch boxes, which front-bench Members of Parliament (MPs) often lean on or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from New Zealand. There are green benches on either side of the House; members of the <b>Government</b> <b>party</b> occupy benches on the Speaker's right, while those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker's left. There are no cross-benches as in the House of Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 650 Members of Parliament—during Prime Minister's Questions and in major debates MPs stand at either end of the House.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{parties of}} Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were {{in favour of}} the treaty, but the other <b>government</b> <b>party,</b> the Green Party, was divided on the issue. At a special convention on 19 January 2008, {{the leadership of the}} Green Party failed to secure a two-thirds majority required to make support for the referendum official party policy. The result of the vote was 63% in favour. As a result, the Green Party itself did not participate in the referendum debate, although individual members were free to be involved in whatever side they chose; all Green Party members of the Oireachtas supported the Treaty. The main opposition parties of Fine Gael and the Labour Party were also in favour. Only one party represented in the Oireachtas, Sinn Féin, was opposed to the treaty, while minor parties opposed to it included the Socialist Party, the Workers' Party and the Socialist Workers Party. Independent TD's Tony Gregory and Finian McGrath, Independent MEP Kathy Sinnott, and Independent members of the Seanad from the universities David Norris, Shane Ross and Rónán Mullen advocated a No vote as well.|$|E
40|$|This study explores agenda-setting {{dynamics}} between mainstream and niche {{parties on}} two issues owned by niche parties: immigration and European integration. It proposes an analytical distinction between opposition and <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> to understand which mainstream parties will engage in dialogue on these issues. Building on prospect theory, mainstream opposition parties (MOPs) {{are expected to}} be risk-acceptant and inclined to follow the agenda of niche competitors. Conversely, mainstream <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> (MGPs) are risk-averse, will systematically ignore shifts in the agenda of niche parties and only increase their attention in response to MOPs. Time-series analyses between 1974 and 2003 on the case of Denmark confirm the hypotheses...|$|R
50|$|The <b>government</b> <b>parties,</b> Fine Gael and the Labour Party, {{could have}} {{nominated}} a joint candidate, but following the debacle over {{the events that}} led to the resignation of President Ó Dálaigh, it was thought unwise to do so.|$|R
50|$|In May 2014, a {{few days}} after the elections, the three {{incumbent}} <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> agreed to continue their government coalition. However, since ProDG became bigger than the Socialist Party in the elections, the new Minister-President is Oliver Paasch (ProDG).|$|R
25|$|As {{opinion polls}} {{conducted}} {{after the party}} crisis indicated a fall in support for PSOE, advocates of abstention argued that the question was no longer whether Rajoy would become Prime Minister again, but whether he would be elected now or after a third election, expected {{to result in a}} landslide win for the PP. The party's caretaker leadership were confident of being able to win the vote in favour of abstention, but concerned that this move would likely widen divisions within the party. Finally, the PSOE federal committee voted on 23 October to abstain, without conditions, when Congress considered Rajoy's candidacy for a second time, allowing the formation of a Rajoy minority <b>government.</b> <b>Party</b> members subsequently clashed on how this decision could be implemented in terms of party discipline, with some deputies declaring that they would not abide by the committee's decision regardless of the outcome. King Felipe VI scheduled a new round of talks for 24 and 25 October, ahead of the 31 October deadline, with a new investiture hearing set for 26–29 October upon confirmation that Rajoy had sufficient support to win the vote.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{beginnings}} {{as a vehicle}} of intended economic revolution, the board achieved nothing of lasting importance. Once its early efforts were foiled {{by the federal government}} and the courts, it ceased to have much influence. By 1948, the dire conditions that had sparked Albertans' enthusiasm for radical economic reform had vanished, and with it their interest in social credit. [...] While the Social Crediters remained in government until 1971, the revolutionary spirit of the 1930s was all but forgotten: as Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel notes, post-war Social Credit [...] "had been transformed from a mass, eclectic movement for social reform led by monetary reformers to a relatively small <b>government</b> <b>party</b> that enjoyed considerable support from various sectors of the Alberta population for its judicious combination of right-wing rhetoric and social service and road-building programs." [...] The Social Credit Board, with its reform mandate and its direct pipeline to Douglas, was no longer needed.|$|E
2500|$|Whittlesey {{focused on}} the core Reagan agenda during her White House tenure. At its height, her office {{included}} 38 people.

50|$|The {{election}} {{was a victory}} for the <b>government</b> <b>parties,</b> the Social Democratic Party and Det Radikale Venstre, {{and for the first time}} since 1870 did a Danish government have a majority of the seats in both chambers of parliament.|$|R
50|$|The {{losses for}} the <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> (both the SPÖ and the ÖVP {{had the worst}} {{election}} result in history) resulted in strong gains for the far right, the election was seen as strong for the far-right and in support of Eurosceptics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Government</b> <b>parties</b> {{suffered}} a major setback in the elections. Social Democrats, {{who had been}} leading the polls consistently since the previous elections, finished third with 15.04% of the vote and 17 seats. Order and Justice finished with 5.72% and 8 seats (down from 7.63% and 11 seats), while Labour Party, which had led the popular vote in the elections of 2012, failed to clear the electoral threshold for proportionally allocated seats and picked up only two seats in single-member constituencies. The failure of <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> {{has been attributed to}} sluggish economic growth, scandals that had surfaced over the months preceding the elections and the adoption of a new labour code that was deeply unpopular with voters.|$|R
