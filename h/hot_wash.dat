She found him in a strange and pitiful state of nerves. The news had produced too intense and varied emotions among those crowded thousands of men buried away from normal life so long. She spent all her {{hour and a half}} trying desperately to make him see the bright side, but he was too full of fears and doubts, and she went away smiling, but utterly exhausted. Slowly in the weeks which followed she learned that nothing was changed. In the fond hope that Gerhardt might be home now any day, she was taking care that his slippers and some clothes of David's were ready for him, and the hip bath handy for him to have a lovely <b>hot</b> <b>wash.</b> She had even bought a bottle of beer and some of his favourite pickle, saving the price out of her own food, and was taking in the paper again, letting bygones be bygones. But he did not come. And soon the paper informed her that the English prisoners were returning--many in wretched state, poor things, so that her heart bled for them, and made her fiercely angry with the cruel men who had treated them so; but it informed her too, that if the paper had its way no [...] "Huns" [...] would be tolerated in this country for the future. [...] "Send them all back!" [...] were the words it used. She did not realise at first that this applied to Gerhardt; but when she did, she dropped the journal {{as if it had been}} a living coal of fire. Not let him come back to his home, and family, not let him stay, after all they'd done to him, and he never did anything to them! Not let him stay, but send him out to that dreadful country, which he had almost forgotten in these thirty years, and he with an English wife and children! In this new terror of utter dislocation the bright side so slipped from her that she was obliged to go out into the back garden in the dark, where a sou'-westerly wind was driving the rain. There, lifting her eyes to the evening sky she uttered a little moan. It couldn't be true; and yet what they said in her paper had always turned out true, like the taking of Gerhardt away, and the reduction of his food. And the face of the gentleman in the building at Whitehall came before her out of the long past, with his lips tightening, and his words: [...] "We have to do very hard things, Mrs. Gerhardt." [...] Why had they to do them? Her man had never done no harm to no one! A flood, bitter as sea water, surged in her, and seemed to choke her very being. Those gentlemen in the papers--why should they go on like that? Had they no hearts, no eyes to see the misery they brought to humble folk? [...] "I wish them nothing worse than what they've brought to him and me," [...] she thought wildly: [...] "nothing worse!" ...|$|E

Two procedures {{were used to}} accelerate the hydrolysis of celluloses and hemicelluloses and remove metallic impurities present in significant levels in sugar cane straw: <b>hot</b> water <b>washing</b> and acid leaching. Proximate analysis by thermogravimetry was carried out to cover volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash content of the different straws.

However, both straw pretreatments induced a significant increase in pozzolanic activity, mainly associated with the removal of impurities, especially CaO, SO 3, K 2 O, and carbon compounds.

40|$|Controlling the {{corrosion}} {{of historical}} and archaeological ferrous metal objects presents a significant challenge to conservators. Chloride {{is a major}} corrosion accelerator in coastal areas for historic ferrous metal structures and for the many chloride-containing archaeological objects within museums. Corrosion reactions involve the formation of akaganéite (βFeOOH) which incorporates chloride within its crystal structure and adsorbs it onto its surface. The mobility of the surface-adsorbed chloride in aqueous systems and atmospheric moisture means βFeOOH can itself cause iron to corrode. The extraction of chloride from βFeOOH by aqueous Soxhlet <b>hot</b> <b>wash</b> and aqueous room temperature washing is measured. The impact of this washing {{on the ability of}} βFeOOH to corrode iron is quantitatively investigated by determining the oxygen consumption of unwashed, Soxhlet-washed and room temperature-washed samples of βFeOOH mixed with iron powder and exposed to 80 % relative humidity. This acts as a proxy measurement for the corrosion rate of iron. The results are discussed relative to climatic factors for outdoor heritage objects and the treatment of archaeological iron in museums. Delivering better understanding of the properties of βFeOOH supports the development of evidence-based treatments and management procedures in heritage conservation...|$|E

As {{a result}} of the base-rock {{corrosion}} effects and the suspension-carrying capability of polymer in the system of strong base ASP flooding, the concentration of silicon ions in reservoir liquid increases.

40|$|Ultrasonics, {{coupled with}} an aqueous {{detergent}} process that cleans at below 43 ºC, may be best suited for fine-pitch SMT screens and stencils. Aqueous detergents clean more effectively than solvents, {{with little or no}} environmental impact. Because of the environmental concerns driving today's technology decisions, the once simple decision of selecting a stencil cleaning process is now clouded with different chemicals, different cleaning machines and various types of solder paste, all with specific environmental, health and safety related issues and regulations. Now that CFCs are undesirable, many companies that clean PCBs have changed to using saponifiers and hot water to clean RMA flux from post soldered boards. When the PCB cleaners were using CFCs, they cleaned solder paste very effectively. Thus, it seemed only natural to follow the lead of the PCB cleaners when the switch was made to saponifiers and hot water to clean solder paste from SMT screens and stencils. However, a major variable was overlooked: the effect on the stencil. PCB's travel through a 200 ºC reflow oven, and are not sensi-tive to elevated temperatures. The SMT stencil, on the other hand, is manufactured using heat-cured adhesives that bond the metal foil to the screen and the screen to the frame. If a stencil is washed in hot water or dried with hot air, the "heat sensitive " adhesives will tend to breakdown and the stencil will fall apart.

40|$|AbstractMastitis in cattle is an {{inflammation}} of the udder that {{can be caused by}} a number of bacterial pathogens. Standard testing requires a series of tests to accurately identify the cause. Mastitic milk cannot be sold and the treatment usually involves a course of antibiotics during which time the milk can also not be sold so a fast identification of the pathogen involved is essential to reduce lost revenue. A DNA microarray was designed to identify the pathogens that could be responsible for mastitis. A 6 x 6 grid of oligonucleotides was covalently immobilised (by use of a surface attached polymer network) onto the untreated surface of each well of a 96 well microtitre plate [1]. DNA extracted from mastitic milk samples was amplified using Cy 5 labelled primers and subsequently hybridised to the immobilised probes on the microarray. A standard ELISA plate washer was used to wash the microtitre plate and the signals from the bound PCR products were read in a commercially available reader (FLAIR). Using the species probes that give the strongest and weakest signals, S.

Objectives The aim of our study was to verify if house dust mite allergen avoidance measures can improve the clinical manifestations of AD in children. Methods Forty-one children (mean age 3 · 9 years) affected by AD associated with high total and/or specific IgE serum levels ('extrinsic' AD) were recruited. Clinical evaluation was performed utilizing the Severity Scoring of AD (SCORAD) index; dust was sampled from the children's beds and tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The study was planned in two parts. In the first part, a placebo-controlled trial of 2 months duration, mite allergen avoidance measures (encasing mattresses and pillows; a weekly <b>hot</b> <b>wash</b> of bedding; frequent vacuum cleaning of living room and bedroom; soft toys and carpets regularly cleaned or removed; no pets allowed) were recommended to group A patients, but not to group B. In {{the second part of}} the study, environmental avoidance measures were recommended to initial control group B patients also. One year after the start of the study the amounts of mite allergen in the home and clinical score of AD were measured in both groups. Results At the end of the first part of the study, significant decreases in major allergens of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p 1) and D. farinae (Der f 1) load (from 393 to 94 ng m 2) and concentration (from 1 · 84 to 0 · 73 µg g 1 of dust) in children's beds were observed in treatment group A. At the same time, in this group the mean SCORAD index improved significantly (from 33 to 26; P = 0 · 022). After 12 months, when all patients had used allergen avoidance measures, Der p 1 + Der f 1 load, concentration and clinical score had improved, reaching similar values in both groups.

40|$|Fundamental {{aspects of}} casein drying have been {{investigated}} to provide relevant information for design, operation and control of industrial casein driers. Casein desorption isotherms were sigmoid in shape and of type II according to the BET classification. A modified Henderson equation could describe the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of casein {{as a function of}} water activity (equilibrium relative humidity) and temperature. Under similar drying conditions, the EMC of casein decreased in the order mineral acid > rennet > lactic. Studies on mineral acid casein indicated that the EMC was not affected by wet processing conditions but more severe drying conditions caused a significant decrease. Drying mechanisms were studied in a laboratory tunnel drier and a fluidized bed drier. The batch drying curve in the tunnel drier consisted of a short constant rate period (CRP) and two linear falling rate periods (FRP). The critical moisture content was about 1. 5 kg water/kg dry solids. In contrast the batch drying curve in the fluidized bed drier had a long constant rate period down to a critical moisture content of around 0. 5 kg water/kg dry solids, followed by a single linear falling rate period. The effects of drying conditions and casein manufacturing conditions were studied in the fluidized bed drier. The CRP drying rate was directly proportional to the air temperature driving force. The FRP drying rate also increased with an increase in air temperature. An increase in air velocity caused an increase in the CRP drying rate but did not affect the drying rate in the FRP. A rise in casein precipitation pH from 4. 3 to 4. 8 caused a significant reduction in the CRP drying rate but had only a small effect on the FRP drying rate. The precipitation and <b>hot</b> <b>wash</b> temperatures of casein curd had no significant effect on the drying rates. Curd plasticization did not affect the drying rate in the CRP but increased the FRP drying rate. In the CRP, larger particles (> 2. 00 mm) tended to dry more slowly than smaller particles because of reduced fluidization efficiency, but particle sizes ranging from 0. 50 to 3. 35 mm did not appear to affect drying rates in the FRP. In general the CRP was affected by factors which altered the gas phase heat and mass transfer whereas the FRP tended to be influenced by factors affecting the solid phase heat and mass transfer. Measurements in a commercial plant indicated that bigger casein particles leaving the drier had significantly higher moisture contents than the smaller particles. Moisture equilibration between the big and small particles was reached in about 3 hours. Studies on drying of single casein particles indicated that lactic casein particles had higher air contents than rennet casein and mineral acid casein particles when drying from a mean initial MC of 1. 2 kg water/kg dry solids to a final MC of 0. 02 kg water/kg dry solids. This caused particle shrinkage of about 40 % for all three types of casein which was brought about by both evaporation of moisture and contraction of the casein matrix. Below about 0. 40 kg water/kg solids, the casein matrix no longer contracted significantly and the voids left by the evaporating moisture became air pores. A pulsed NMR technique was used to obtain the self diffusion coefficient (D) and transverse relaxation time (T 2) of water in mineral acid, lactic and rennet casein particles, as well as the moisture distribution images within mineral acid casein particles. The self diffusion coefficient and transverse relaxation time for all casein types decreased with decreasing moisture content. But at the same moisture content the T 2 values for acid caseins were much higher than for rennet casein. This may be attributed to the extra mineral content of rennet casein. The maximum self diffusion coefficient of water within a casein particle was about 25 % that of pure water. The T 2 of pure water was about 200 times that for acid caseins and 750 times for rennet casein. Moisture equilibration between particles took about 3 hours to reach an equilibrium D value which compares well with the value above. The proton density image within a wet casein particle showed regions of high moisture content and some regions of very low moisture content which may be air gaps. The effects of temperature and time on casein colour and casein solubility in alkali were studied for a range of moisture contents. In general low moisture samples were more soluble than high moisture samples. However for holding temperatures up to 100 °C and holding time up to 2 hours, the maximum insolubility of casein occurred at a moisture concent of around 0. 43 kg water/kg dry solids. Casein colour was not affected by holding temperatures of up to 100 °C at holding times of up to one hour. However a 2 hour holding time at 100 °C caused severe discoloration of casein. The implications of these results for commercial casein drying are discussed and a new design concept for casein dry processing is proposed...|$|E

Final FFA in re-esterification of products, which were cleaned up with centrifuging and <b>hot</b> wet <b>washing,</b> was monitored. The results after centrifuge indicated that only two catalysts (Zn and ZnO) were capable of promoting the reaction and achieving the requirement. Moreover, final FFA in re-esterification of products, which were cleaned up with <b>hot</b> wet <b>washing,</b> was also monitored. It was found that no significant differences existed in the two purification techniques except for the heterogeneous Zn catalyst in re-esterification product. The results showed that thin layer chromatography with a flame ionization detector (TLC/FID) could not detect all of the compositions in the pre-treatment product using Zn as a catalyst. Therefore, ZnO was the most suitable catalyst for effectively reducing FFA via a re-esterification process...|$|R
