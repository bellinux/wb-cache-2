The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named just Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics – or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning – are more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{actual data}} mining task is the {{semi-automatic}} or automatic analysis of {{large quantities of}} data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then {{be seen as a}} kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.|$|E
25|$|The MCC is the {{software}} intensive {{system of the}} ballistic missile defence system. It receives information from various sources such as radars and satellites which is then processed by ten computers which run simultaneously. The MCC is connected to all {{other elements of the}} defence through a WAN. MCC performs target classification, target assignment and kill assessment. It also acts as a <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> for the commander. It can also decide the number of interceptors required for the target for an assured kill probability. After performing all these functions, the MCC assigns the target to the LCC of a launch battery. The LCC starts computing the time to launch the interceptor based upon information received from a radar based on the speed, altitude and flight path of the target. LCC prepares the missile for launch in real time and carries out ground guidance computation.|$|E

Financial decision-making is an area where <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems,</b> knowledge-based <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems,</b> and intelligent <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> are successfully applied. In consequence of the importance and complexity of this problem area a large number of methods of support to financial decisionmaking was developed. This paper presents the most important features of two <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems,</b> a classical system and a system based on fuzzy logic. The performances of these two models are compared and the advantages achieved through the introduction of fuzzy concepts into the classical <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> are determined.

25|$|Concerning {{investment}} financing, the Soviet Union {{financed the}} Aswan High Dam during the 1960s. After Egypt opened {{itself to the}} West in the 1970s, the United States, various European countries and the World Bank provided major investment financing for {{water supply and sanitation}} and for irrigation and drainage. The Gulf countries partially financed mega-projects to develop new lands for irrigation in the New Valley (supported by the United Arab Emirates) and in Northern Sinai (supported by Kuwait an Saudi Arabia). Concerning technical assistance, the Netherlands, the World Bank and UNDP played important roles in supporting successive national water master plans since the 1980s. UNDP and the National Water Research Center have developed a computer-supported <b>Decision</b> <b>Support</b> <b>System</b> for Water Resources, which can produce various climate change scenarios for the Nile basin and therefore help to improve water resource planning and management. USAID provided substantial support to improve irrigation infrastructure and to support water user associations. With support by USAID a layer of management - the Inspectorate level - was stripped from the MWRI administrative system, different chains of command were brought together in the form of Integrated Water Management Districts (IWMDs), and Branch Canal Water User Associations were established across around 40% of the irrigated area of Egypt.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} and {{the complexity of}} financial decision-making process are the reasons why so much work has been invested {{over the years in}} formulating methods that would realistically treat this issue.

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> and their role on the strategic management development in the Universities- Case Study: Islamic University of Gaza. The descriptive approach was used where a questionnaire was developed and distributed to a stratified random sample. (230) questionnaires were distributed and (204) were returned with response rate (88. 7 %). The most important findings of the study: The presence of a statistically significant positive correlation between the <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> and strategic management in the Islamic University in Gaza, and this shows {{that there is a}} role for <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> in strategic management development. The senior management is convinced of the importance of strategic management of the organization, and this conviction paid to clearly understand the process of the development of strategic management and thus led to a commitment to this process to improve its performance. There is an impact on the strategic management of the capabilities available for the use of <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems,</b> and the type of <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> used, while there is little effect of top management support for the use of <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, the results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the averages of the respondents answers attributed to personal data. The research also concluded a series of recommendations: The Islamic University of Gaza need to develop its infrastructure of <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> when it develops the strategic management. It should increase its interest in organizational potential through the necessity of a separate unit for <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems.</b> As well as increased interest in the physical and technical capabilities available to <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> through continuity in keeping pace with technological means and techniques, continued support of senior management in the organization of strategic management for its positive role on <b>decision</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems,</b> that senior management will continue in the organization in creating a culture of strategic management, and it should encourage employees to participate in the strategic management process...|$|R
