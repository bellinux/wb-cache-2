5|$|Camouflage is a soft-tissue {{feature that}} is rarely {{preserved}} in the fossil record, but rare fossilised skin samples from the Cretaceous period show that some marine reptiles were countershaded. The skins, pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin, reveal that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> backs and light bellies.|$|E
5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's interior initially <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> {{wood panels}} and {{was decorated with}} flowers, oriental rugs on the terrazzo floor, and tables and chairs in the Mission style. In 1959, when the library moved in, local architect and village resident William Anders Sharman planned the building's $2,000 renovation; he later became {{the first president of}} the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society. The station's circular ticket office was replaced by the librarian's desk, bookshelves replaced station furniture, and the baggage room became the children's section. Former library president Theodore R. Malsin dedicated the children's room in memory of his son Donald. From 1959 until 2009, the building housed a main reading room and children's room; a vestibule and second-story balcony were added in 1980.|$|E

5|$|German Kriegsmarine ships {{before the}} Second World War were either light gray overall or <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> gray hulls, and many {{retained}} this scheme during the war. The cruiser Deutschland, for instance, had a gray hull and light gray superstructure in 1934. Others had dazzle camouflage, usually in combinations of pale gray, dark gray and sea blue. For example, {{the hull of}} the battleship Scharnhorst had a dazzle pattern of stripes on a gray background in 1940, but some of these were later painted out, and the bows forward of the main guns painted black. Scharnhorst was not camouflaged against air observation, her decks fore and aft bearing large black on white swastikas on a red field; her main gun turrets had red (in the Baltic) or yellow tops for air recognition. The battleship Bismarck set out to Norway in dazzle camouflage; this was painted out with gray for her final trip to the Atlantic. The cruiser Admiral Scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular dark gray marks on light gray for her superstructure, with a dark gray hull, black waterline and, away from air support while out raiding in 1941, dark gray turret tops.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E

25|$|Stanley Stanger was an {{investment}} broker when he volunteered in Toronto for the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 21 March 1916. He claimed a year's prior military {{service in the}} Westmount Rifles with the rank of Sergeant. His mother Mary was named as his next of kin. He was five feet six inches tall at time of enlistment. He <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> brown hair, brown eyes, and dark complexion.|$|E
25|$|All {{modern humans}} {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} who lived around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Comparisons between known skin pigmentation genes in chimpanzees and modern Africans show that dark skin evolved along {{with the loss of}} body hair about 1.2 million years ago and that this common ancestor <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> skin. Investigations into dark skinned populations in South Asia and Melanesia indicate that skin pigmentation in these populations is due to the preservation of this ancestral state and not due to new variations on a previously lightened population.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 1918, nine Siemens-Schuckert D.IIIs {{began to}} arrive. Despite high {{expectations}} for the craft because of its superior performance, it suffered engine failures at only seven to ten hours usage. The mark was rapidly withdrawn from the wing. Meanwhile, Berthold had his men begin repainting the wing's aircraft with a common background marking. The wing's craft had standard dark blue paint applied to the fuselage, a la Jasta 15. However, instead of also copying a scarlet nose from them, the other squadrons each sported their own hue on the cowlings. Jagdstaffel 12 had white cowlings; Jasta 13 <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> green ones; Jasta 19 settled on yellow. To these markings, pilots added their own personal insignia.|$|E

25|$|By 1825, {{the toilet}} {{had been removed}} and the {{bathroom}} space joined to the west bedchamber to create an office. This area {{was used for the}} President's office over the next several decades. Abraham Lincoln used it as both an office and a Cabinet room, and signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the room on January 1, 1863. During the Lincoln presidency, the walls were covered with Civil War maps. It <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> green wallpaper, and the carpeting was also dark green. Newspapers were stacked on the desk and tables along with large amounts of mail and requests from office seekers. Two large wicker wastebaskets were filled with debris. The east bedchamber was converted into an office for presidential aides, although President John Tyler used it as part of his office from 1841 to 1845.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

500|$|Ninox boobook moae [...] {{is found}} on Moa, Leti and Romang Islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is darker than {{subspecies}} boobook. It {{was described by}} Mayr in 1943 from a specimen collected by Kuhn in 1902 on Moa. Mayr noted that it <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> reddish upperparts with pronounced barring on wings and tail, larger white spots on scapulars and buff streaks on the nape.

500|$|Constance Parkin {{was born}} in 1906 in the hamlet of Miram, near Nhill in western Victoria. The family moved to Melbourne in 1920, where she {{completed}} her schooling at Genazzano convent in the suburb of Kew. Constance was short, just under five feet tall, and <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> hair. She trained between 1925 and 1929 at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne. Over the summer of 1925–1926 the Gallery held a competition for its students, who were asked to paint [...] "holiday subjects"; Constance won the prize for a landscape. The competition was judged by artist George Bell, who would have a continuing influence over her artistic career.|$|E

500|$|In {{designing}} the characters, the artists aimed for {{a style that}} was photorealistic. The creators envisaged the main protagonist, Nathan Drake, as more of an everyman character than Lara Croft, shown as clearly under stress in the game's many fire fights, with no special training and constantly living {{at the edge of}} his abilities. Director Amy Hennig felt a heavily armored, [...] "tough as nails" [...] protagonist with a large weapon was not a suitable hero, and decided a [...] "tenacious and resourceful" [...] character would portray more human qualities. Supporting characters (Elena Fisher and Victor Sullivan) were included to avoid a dry and emotionless story. Fisher's character underwent changes during development; in early trailers for the game, the character <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> brown hair, but ultimately the color changed to blonde and the style was altered.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Nolan {{wrote an}} 80-page {{treatment}} about dream-stealers. Originally, Nolan had envisioned Inception as a horror film, but eventually wrote it as a heist film {{even though he}} found that [...] "traditionally [...] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms." [...] Upon revisiting his script, he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story [...] "relies so heavily {{on the idea of}} the interior state, the idea of dream and memory. I realized I needed to raise the emotional stakes." [...] Nolan worked on the script for nine to ten years. When he first started thinking about making the film, Nolan was influenced by [...] "that era of movies where you had The Matrix (1999), you <b>had</b> <b>Dark</b> City (1998), you had The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and, to a certain extent, you had Memento (2000), too. They were based in the principles that the world around you might not be real." ...|$|E
500|$|The 17-year-old PedroII was, for his part, {{clearly and}} greatly disappointed. His first {{impressions}} were only of her physical flaws—and {{of how much}} her appearance differed from the portrait which {{had been sent to}} him. Physically, she <b>had</b> <b>dark</b> brown hair and brown eyes, was short, slightly overweight, walked with a pronounced limp and, while not ugly, neither was she pretty. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Teresa Cristina had no true limp, but her odd way of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked. PedroII's high expectations were crushed, and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show. After a short interval, he left the ship. Perceiving his disillusionment, she burst into tears, lamenting that [...] "the emperor did not like me!" [...] Although a proxy marriage had already been performed, an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
