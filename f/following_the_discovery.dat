5|$|As {{the area}} boomed <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold {{one of the}} richest seams of silver ore in what would become Nevada, and because their claim was close to the surface, it was easily {{extracted}} without initial capital investment. The Bowers Mining Company quickly made Eilley and Sandy very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Antony Gibbs & Sons {{may have}} {{intended}} to employ Great Britain only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger {{service to the}} Australian gold fields <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of gold in Victoria in 1851, but she found long-term employment on this route. For her new role she was given a third refit. Her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail-plan altered to a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a removable propeller, which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} {{in the north}} of Sweden, Lappland became a frontier for industrial development, instead of an exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists—such as Karl Tirén, Alfred Thörne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg—to create the illustrations. Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of Sami people at Skansen.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, however, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discoveries</b> by James Clerk Maxwell to {{the effect}} that {{electric}} measurements could not be explained in terms of the three fundamental units of length, mass and time, Giovanni Giorgi proposed a new standard system that would include a fourth fundamental unit to measure quantities in electromagnetism.|$|R
50|$|European {{settlement}} commenced in October 1842 {{with the}} Lovell family settling at Motupipi near the then existing Maori pa site. Prior to the Lovell's settling, in March {{of that year}} a Mr Tuckett had discovered coal on the beach near the Motupipi pa. There was a report from May 1841, which also stated there was coal in the area. In <b>the</b> 1840s, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discoveries,</b> <b>the</b> local population unsuccessfully sought to have it renamed Coal Bay. Then, in the late 1850s, with <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of gold in at Aorere, its name was changed to Golden Bay.|$|R

5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of {{the planet}} Neptune in 1846, there was {{considerable}} speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of}} the 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E
5|$|Hwa Chong Junior College {{moved out}} of its campus at Bukit Timah Road in the late 1980s <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of {{structural}} problems with the building to facilitate rebuilding. Lessons continued but conducted at various locations. The rebuilding of the campus finished in 1992 and lessons restarted at the campus in 1993. Following The Chinese High School's accord of independent school status in 1987, the junior college followed suit in 2004, becoming the first junior college in Singapore to be granted the status of an independent school.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} {{distance}} from Neptune, the regular moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, S/2004 N 1, and Proteus. All but the outer two are within Neptune-synchronous orbit (Neptune's rotational period is 0.6713 day) {{and thus are}} being tidally decelerated. Naiad, the closest regular moon, is also the second smallest among the inner moons (<b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of S/2004 N 1), whereas Proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of Neptune.|$|E
50|$|Taxotere was {{developed}} by Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (now Sanofi-Aventis) <b>following</b> from <b>the</b> <b>discoveries</b> of Pierre Potier at CNRS at Gif-sur-Yvette during his work on improvements {{to the production of}} Taxol.|$|R
50|$|It is now {{believed}} that Hamoukar was thriving {{as far back}} as 4000 BC and independently from Sumer. The origins of urban settlements has generally been attributed to the riverine societies of southern Mesopotamia (in what is now southern Iraq). This is the area of ancient Sumer, where around 4000 BC the Mesopotamian cities such of Ur and Uruk emerged. In 2007, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discoveries</b> at Hamoukar, some archaeologists have argued that the Cradle of Civilization could have extended further up the Tigris River and included the part of northern Syria where Hamoukar is located.|$|R

5|$|On 29 February {{a rocket}} {{launcher}} {{similar to one}} seized in the 1999 raid was found near an army base in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and on 15 March three men were arrested <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of 500lb of home-made explosives when the RUC searched two cars in Hillsborough, County Down. On 6 April a bomb attack took place at Ebrington Barracks in Derry. RIRA members lowered a device consisting of 5lb of homemade explosives over the perimeter fence using ropes, and the bomb subsequently exploded damaging the fence and an unmanned guardhouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Fleet Air Arm's Sea King fleet commenced faster than initially planned following {{the loss of a}} Sea King during a humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia in April 2005, resulting in nine deaths. Investigators uncovered serious faults in the condition of the Sea King's mechanical flight control system, resulting from maintenance deficiencies. In May 2007, the six remaining Sea Kings were grounded for two months <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a number of missing parts.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1558, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Building work, {{up to the}} mid-1950s, {{increased}} the number of beds and cots from 60 to 260, and new operating suite, X-ray department, and a physiotherapy department were added. From the mid-1950s fewer children were admitted <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discoveries</b> of newer medical treatments and the number of beds was reduced to 164, and more beds were used for adults. From 1961 building modifications equipped the hospital to perform orthopaedic operations. It is now a major tertiary orthopaedic hospital, and provides tertiary elective orthopaedic services for the hospitals of the region including St. Vincent's Hospital, Mater Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Temple Street Children's Hospital, and Central Remedial Clinic.|$|R

50|$|Investigative {{journalist}} Aphrodite Jones undertook {{an exploration}} of the case on her Discovery Network show True Crime With Aphrodite Jones <b>following</b> <b>the</b> DNA <b>discoveries.</b> <b>The</b> episode premiered May 5, 2011, with extensive background information included on the show's page at <b>the</b> Investigation <b>Discovery</b> site. In August 2011, White Light Productions announced that the West Memphis Three would be featured on their new program Wrongfully Convicted.|$|R
5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> {{of gold in}} California, a {{large amount}} of gold coins began {{appearing}} in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of {{the decline}} of lion {{population}} in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline. Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.|$|E
5|$|<b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of {{the wreck}} in 1971, the project became {{known to the}} general public and {{received}} increasing media attention. This helped bring in more donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Navy, the BBC and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from Prince Charles, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also more funding and assistance. The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which made it easier to raise funds, and the application for excavation and raising of the ship had been officially approved by the UK government.|$|E

These are primarily regulatory, legal, and congressional developments that are frequently referenced in the ongoing policy debate. The chronology does not contain entries for the introduction of the many BSE-related bills introduced into this or previous Congresses, except for those in recent years where committee or floor action has occurred. This report, which will be updated if significant developments ensue, is intended to be used alongside other CRS reports that provide more background and context for the BSE policy debate, and that cover many specific legislative proposals...|$|R

5|$|In 1968, the {{telescope}} observed the coordinates {{of the recently}} discovered pulsar, confirming its existence and investigating the dispersion measure. It was also {{used to make the}} first detection of polarization of the pulsar's radiation. This marked the start of a substantial amount of work investigating pulsars at Jodrell, which is still ongoing. In the 30 years <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of pulsars, {{the telescope}} discovered over 100 new pulsars (and astronomers at Jodrell Bank discovered around 2/3 of the total number using the Lovell and other telescopes). 300 pulsars are regularly observed using either the Lovell, or a nearby 42-foot (13-m) dish.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century Deddington Castle {{was adapted}} {{for use as}} a {{sporting}} facility by the local gentry. It was sold to Deddington's parish council, who attempted to build tennis courts in the inner bailey in 1947. <b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of medieval remains and a subsequent archaeological investigation, these plans were abandoned and the western half of the castle became a local park. In the 21st century, English Heritage manage the inner bailey, the eastern half remaining in use for farming, and the site as a whole is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Monteverdi revived in {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries among music {{scholars}} in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904. Largely {{through the efforts of}} Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century: L'Orfeo in May 1911, L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in May 1925.|$|E

5000|$|The entire theory {{concerning}} the first inhabitants being the Clovis culture was reevaluated <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discoveries</b> at Cactus Hill in the mid-1990s.

A 2008 DNA study suggested [...] "a complex model for the peopling of the Americas, in which the initial differentiation from Asian populations ended with a moderate bottleneck in Beringia during the last glacial maximum (LGM), around approximately 23,000 to approximately 19,000 years ago. Toward the end of the LGM, a strong population expansion started approximately 18,000 and finished approximately 15,000 years ago. These results support a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World, suggesting a rapid settlement of the continent along a Pacific coastal route." ...|$|R
5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the update would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, meeting this deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a bug which affects {{the ability to use}} WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the update may fail to install. Microsoft's attempt to fix the problem was ineffective, to the point that Microsoft pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014. On 16 May, Microsoft released additional updates to fix a problem of BSOD in the update.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{along the}} face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is another small Hindu {{excavation}} with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a flaw in the rock. Past the 7th cave, to the east of hill is a dry pond, with large artificial boulders and Buddhist cisterns along its banks. At the end of the north spur of the main hill is a mound that resembles a Buddhist stupa. This, states Michell and Dhavalikar, may be the remains of a much higher Buddhist stupa from about 2nd century BCE.|$|E
