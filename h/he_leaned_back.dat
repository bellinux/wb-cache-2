500|$|According to Nicholson, [...] "we {{never did}} shoot {{the end of}} the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You'd go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out. And in the take, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, {{filled with}} delight and amusement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> exhausted, and {{the pretty}} flowers fell at his feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, and I in mine, and {{the absurd}} parody of our {{attitude}} strikes us both.|$|R
60|$|Now {{and then}} {{he turns to the}} camp-bed, and wetting his towel in the basin, presses it against his brow. Now <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, as if to give up; but again bends over and plods.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which I did, {{and one of}} 'em {{gets out}} and standin' on the curb <b>'e</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> to the {{interior}} of the cab and says: S'long--see you to-morrow,' and then 'e says to me: 'No. 1 Cromwell Road,' and disappears in the fog." ...|$|R
60|$|Burton shivered {{a little}} as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> and closed his eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> on his box and, folding his arms, {{emitted a}} cloud of smoke.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in {{his chair}} as {{two or three of}} the senior day-room {{collected}} round the Sportsman.|$|E
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS, unsympathetically: [...] "Nothing of {{the kind}} has happened. This car has simply come uncoupled, {{and the rest of}} the train has gone on ahead, and left us {{standing}} on the track, nowhere in particular." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, and wheels it round from her.|$|R
60|$|Margaret {{saw that}} he was unusually agitated, and not by grief; applied herself to tea-making, and hoped his walk had given him an appetite; but there seemed little chance of this so long were his pauses between each morsel, and so often did <b>he</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> in his chair.|$|R
6000|$|He {{seemed quite}} dazed, {{conscious}} only of bodily needs, for he ate and drank ravenously without {{thought at first}} of thanking her. Only {{when he had finished}} did <b>he</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> once again against the cushions which her kindly hand had placed behind him, and he murmured feebly like a tired but satisfied child: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in {{his chair}} and {{regarded}} with intense satisfaction the horrified faces of the group in front.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in {{his chair}} and, {{twisting}} the paper-knife idly between his fingers, watched his chief clerk closely.|$|E
60|$|But {{he did not}} move. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> again, and hummed thoughtfully a bar or two of an outlandish tune.|$|E
60|$|Louis {{declined}} {{the chair to}} which I waved him. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> slightly <b>back</b> against the table, facing me.|$|R
60|$|Sir Leicester is {{generally}} in a complacent state, and rarely bored. When {{he has nothing}} else to do, he can always contemplate his own greatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> in his corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to society.|$|R
5000|$|There is John also, <b>he</b> who <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> on the Lord’s breast, who was {{a priest}} wearing the petalon, both witness and teacher. He has fallen asleep at Ephesus.|$|R
60|$|She whispered {{something}} in Macheson's ear which he affected not to hear. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in his cushioned seat and laughed.|$|E
60|$|Lord Chelsford {{referred}} to some {{notes in his}} hand. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, {{and looked at me}} steadfastly.|$|E
60|$|He {{saw that}} she did not grasp all he meant to convey, and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in his chair with a laugh.|$|E
6000|$|In No. 13 he {{continues}} the Legislature, and gives {{this picture of}} [...] Minister Harris: [...] "He is six feet high, bony and rather slender; [...] long, ungainly arms; stands so straight <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> a little; has [...] small side whiskers; his head long, up and down; he has no command [...] of language or ideas; oratory all show and pretence; a big washing [...] and a small hang-out; weak, insipid, and a damn fool in general." ...|$|R
50|$|John {{is waiting}} {{in his car}} at a red traffic light with his {{children}}. His children start fighting with each other while waiting, and <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> to scold them. Once their fighting stops, John checks the light again and notices that it's still red. However, while he was focusing on his children, the light had changed to green, and then back again. John doesn't think the light ever changed, but the people waiting behind him are very mad and honking their horns now.|$|R
60|$|George {{rose and}} turned rather gray in the face, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> on the <b>back</b> of a chair.|$|R
60|$|And, having handled a {{delicate}} matter in masterly fashion, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{in his chair}} and chewed the end off another cigar.|$|E
60|$|Dunstable, apparently, {{was worried}} by no scruples. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> easily in his chair, and {{kept up a}} bright flow of conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let me {{have the}} private ones." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and {{judicial}} expression.|$|E
6000|$|The big Scotchman {{held his}} little {{opponent}} in contempt; so that, {{instead of putting}} himself on the defensive, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> his <b>back</b> against the door, thrust {{his hands into his}} pockets, and requested to know [...] "what that was to him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> farther <b>back</b> {{against the}} tree, {{with a little}} {{whimsical}} smile. It was pleasant to appear as a modern Ulysses {{in the eyes of}} a very pretty girl, but he had, as she was quick to recognize, taken up the role unconsciously.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had come}} nearer with it, {{as if he}} might rise for some show of express separation; but <b>he</b> only <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> motionless, his eyes on her now--he kept her a moment before him. [...] "Do you mean that we don't--that we don't--?" [...] But he broke down.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, {{one hand}} on the child's head, which he {{smoothed}} mechanically, and gesticulated with the other, speaking to Almayer.|$|E
60|$|After {{glancing over}} it in a masterly way, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{in his chair}} and {{bestowed}} upon me an explosion of sardonic, superior, collegiate laughter.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in his chair. There was a pained {{look in his}} face. She {{was almost}} sorry that she had {{mentioned}} his daughter's name.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{turned and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> against the window, but, {{in spite of}} his usual {{listless}} manner, they almost fancied that the face in shadow was a little pale.|$|R
6000|$|My last answer {{appeared}} to relieve him. <b>He</b> sighed, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in his chair. [...] "That's right!" [...] {{he said to}} himself. [...] "I'm glad to hear that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hiram {{pushed back}} {{his chair and}} arose. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> with his <b>back</b> {{against the side of}} the fireplace. [...] "I'll stay at home," [...] said he presently.|$|R
