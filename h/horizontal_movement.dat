5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above <b>horizontal.</b> <b>Movement</b> at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement.</b> The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

40|$|Cyclical upper-limb {{movements}} involuntarily {{deviate from}} a primary movement direction when the actor concurrently observes incongruent biological motion. We examined whether environmental context influences such motor interference during interpersonal observation-execution. Participants executed continuous <b>horizontal</b> arm <b>movements</b> while observing congruent horizontal or incongruent curvilinear biological movements {{with or without}} the presence of an object positioned as an obstacle or distractor. When observing a curvilinear movement, an object located within the movement space became an obstacle, and thus, the curvilinear trajectory was essential to reach into horizontal space. When acting as a distractor, or with no object, the curvilinear trajectory was no longer essential. For observing <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements,</b> objects were located at the same relative locations as in the curvilinear movement condition. We found greater involuntary movement deviation when observing curvilinear compared to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements.</b> Also, there was an influence of context only when observing <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements,</b> with greater deviation exhibited {{in the presence of a}} large obstacle. These findings suggest the influence of environmental context is underpinned by the (mis-) matching of observed and executed actions as incongruent biological motion is primarily coded via bottom-up sensorimotor processes, whilst the congruent condition incorporates surrounding environmental features to modulate the bottom-up sensorimotor processes...|$|R

25|$|Concrete also {{provides}} good resistance against externally applied forces {{such as high}} winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which results in minimal <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement.</b> However this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is required to resist more extreme forces.|$|E
25|$|Gliding flight: falling at {{an angle}} less than 45° from the {{horizontal}} with lift from adapted aerofoil membranes. This allows slowly falling directed <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement,</b> with streamlining to decrease drag forces for aerofoil efficiency and often with some maneuverability in air. Gliding animals have a lower aspect ratio (wing length/breadth) than true flyers.|$|E
25|$|Endolymphatic infillings such as {{otoliths}} are {{structures in}} the saccule and utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of all vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). In vertebrates, the saccule and utricle together make the otolith organs. Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive {{to a change in}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement,</b> and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator).|$|E

500|$|Michael Cooper (1981) {{noted that}} the zygapophyses of the neck {{vertebrae}} were inclined, prohibiting significant <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement</b> of the neck, so that [...] "consequently any significant movement in this direction must have been accomplished by {{a change in the}} position of the entire body". This was contradicted in a recent study, noting that only the basalmost cervicals show inclined zygapophyses, allowing sufficient <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement</b> of the neck as a whole.|$|E
500|$|The {{volcanic}} {{beds are}} [...] thick. About [...] the greenstone belt {{was subjected to}} new stresses that caused movement along several faults. Faulting on both small and large scales is typical of greenstone belt deformation. These faults show both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement</b> relative to adjacent blocks. Large-scale faults typically occur along {{the margins of the}} greenstone belts where they are in contact with enclosed granitic rocks. Vertical movement may be thousands of meters and horizontal movements of many kilometers occur along some fault zones.|$|E
500|$|South of the Inyo Craters proper {{are other}} {{features}} {{related to the}} dike system responsible for creating the craters, volcanoes and lava flows. These include a north–south trend of fault scarps up to [...] high and pull-apart cracks or fissures in the earth. These fissures are not technically faults because little or no vertical or <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement</b> has occurred along them. Most notable among these is [...] "Earthquake Fault", a fissure up to [...] wide that cuts [...] into glassy rhyolite lava flows. The fissure was formed by stretching induced by the intrusion of the Inyo dike. Stairs {{to the bottom of}} the fissure were removed after being damaged by earthquakes in 1980.|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} and <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements</b> of {{southern bluefin tuna}} (SBT), Thunnus maccoyii, in the Great Australian Bight were investigated by ultrasonic telemetry. Between 1992 and 1994, sixteen tuna were tracked for up to 49 h with depth or combined temperature-depth transmitting tags. The average swimming speeds (measured over the ground) over entire tracks ranged from 0. 5 to 1. 4 m/s or 0. 5 to 1. 4 body lengths/s. The highest sustained swimming speed recorded was 2. 5 m/s for 18 hours. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>movements</b> were often associated with topographical features such as lumps, reefs, islands and the shelf break.

40|$|Strain is an {{important}} parameter for assessing the potential for impacts on surface features due to longwall mine subsidence, {{but it is also}} one of the most difficult parameters to predict. Whilst profiles of strain can be highly variable and irregular, zones of net compression and net tension generally develop above longwalls. By considering the relative <b>horizontal</b> surface <b>movements</b> over longer bay lengths, they become more regular and, hence, more predictable. Numerical modelling has been undertaken using universal distinct element code (udec) to assist with the development of predictive methods for the relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements</b> over the various zones above an active longwall. The numerical modelling was used to assess the effects of varying surface topography on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements,</b> including slopes, scarps, hills and small valleys. Predictive equations have been developed for the net compression within the sagging curvature zone and the net openings within the hogging curvature zones. These equations are consistent with the findings from reviews of ground monitoring data in nsw coalfields...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{systematically}} investigated {{the influence of}} a distractor on horizontal and vertical eye movements. Results showed that both horizontal and vertical eye movements deviated away from the distractor but these deviations were stronger for vertical than for <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements.</b> As trajectory deviations away from a distractor are generally attributed to inhibition applied to the distractor, this suggests that this deviation is not only due to differences in activity between the two collicular motor maps, but can also be evoked by local application of inhibitory processes in the same map as the target. Nonetheless, deviations were more dominant for vertical movements which suggests that for these movements more inhibition is applied than for <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements.</b> © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
500|$|Both {{males and}} females {{establish}} home ranges, and are most active only in certain regions ('core areas') within them. The area of these ranges can vary from prey density, availability of cover and human interference could be significant factors in determining their size. Home ranges might overlap extensively, but occupants show minimal interaction. Aggressive encounters are rare, as servals appear to mutually avoid one another rather than fight and defend their ranges. Agonistic behaviour involves vertical movement of the head (contrary to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement</b> observed in other cats), raising the hair and the tail, displaying the teeth and the white band on the ears, and yowling. Individuals mark their ranges and preferred paths by spraying urine on nearby vegetation, dropping scats along the way, and rubbing their mouth on grasses or the ground while releasing saliva. Servals tend to be sedentary, shifting only a few kilometres away even if they leave their range.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{fault is}} the Vermilion fault {{separating}} the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces. It has a N40°E trend and {{was caused by}} the introduction of masses of magma. The Vermilion fault can be traced westward to North Dakota. It has had a [...] <b>horizontal</b> <b>movement</b> with the northern block moving eastward and upward relative to the southern block. [...] The junction between the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite-rich migmatite, a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes; this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions. It is visible as a [...] wide belt. Most of the flattened large crystals in the fault indicate a simple compression rather than a wrenching, shearing or rotational event as the two subprovinces docked. This provides evidence that the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces were joined by the collision of two continental plates, about [...] Structures in the migmatite include folds and foliations; the foliations cut across both limbs of earlier-phase folds. These cross-cutting foliations indicate that the migmatite has undergone at least two periods of ductile deformation.|$|E

40|$|The {{planning}} of any motor action requires a complex multisensory processing by the brain. Gravity - immutable on Earth - {{has been shown}} to be a key input to these mechanisms. Seminal fMRI studies performed during visual perception of falling objects and self-motion demonstrated that humans represent the action of gravity in parts of the cortical vestibular system; in particular, the insular cortex and the cerebellum. However, little is known as to whether a specific neural network is engaged when processing non-visual signals relevant to gravity. We asked participants to perform vertical and <b>horizontal</b> hand <b>movements</b> without visual control, while lying in a 3 T-MRI scanner. We highlighted brain regions activated in the processing of vertical movements, for which the effects of gravity changed during execution. Precisely, the left insula was activated in vertical movements and not in <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements.</b> Moreover, the network identified by contrasting vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements</b> overlapped with neural correlates previously associated to the processing of simulated self-motion and visual perception of the vertical direction. Interestingly, we found that the insular cortex activity is direction-dependent which suggests that this brain region processes the effects of gravity on the moving limbs through non-visual signals...|$|R

2500|$|When {{discussing}} {{success or}} failure of prediction for the Loma Prieta earthquake, some scientists argue that it did not occur on the San Andreas fault (the focus of most of the forecasts), and involved dip-slip (vertical) movement rather than strike-slip (<b>horizontal)</b> <b>movement,</b> and so was not predicted. Other scientists argue that it did occur in the San Andreas fault zone, and released much of the strain accumulated since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; therefore several of the forecasts were correct.

2500|$|Aye-ayes tap on {{the trunks}} and {{branches}} of trees {{at a rate of}} up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers.

The aye-aye begins foraging between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an influance of the mining {{subsidence}} on an {{intensity of the}} deformation of the line structures.

If the terrain is sloped down and the mining subsidence are increasing {{in the direction of}} a slope the deformation of a segment is also increasing. On the other hand if the terrain and the mining subsidence {{in the direction of a}} slope is rising, then the deformation decreases.

False allochiria may occur in bilateral affections of nerves such as multiple neuritis, and although no such case has yet been recorded it is still clear that the condition above is not related to allochiria.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we examine}} grip forces and load forces during {{point-to-point}} arm movements with objects grasped with a precision grip. We demonstrate that grip force is finely modulated with load force. Variations in load force arise from inertial forces related to movement; grip force rises as the load force increases and falls as load force decreases. The same finding is observed in vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements</b> performed at various rates. In vertical movements, maximum grip force coincides {{in time with}} maximum load force. The maxima occur early in upward and later in downward <b>movements.</b> In <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements,</b> where peaks in load force are observed during both the acceleratory and deceleratory phases, grip force rises {{at the beginning of}} the movement and remains high until the end. The results suggest that when moving an object with the hand the programming of grip force is an integral part of the planning process...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to connect the uranium {{mineralization}} {{in the northern part}} of the Northern Territory with the geotectonics, by applying the geotectonic theories of Kraus. The bathyrheal underflow is re-sponsible for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements</b> of the separate massifs in the eastern part of the Pine Creek Orogen. Strike shearing that occurred along anticlines between the massifs cut the Pine Creek Orogen into longi-tudinal slices, which were then cut by northeast trending faults, along which further <b>horizontal</b> <b>movements</b> occurred. The presence of these two sets of faults facilitated the curving of the eastern part of the Orogen towards the northeast by the bathyrheal underflow. This curving of the Orogen initiated a couple in the area to the east of it, where structurally weak zones have permitted the extrusion of lava.
