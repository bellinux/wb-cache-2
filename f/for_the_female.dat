5|$|Although Aishwarya Rai was Shankar's {{original}} choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lead in 2001, {{she declined}} it owing to a busy schedule {{and was replaced}} by Zinta. When Shankar revived the project with Rajinikanth, contenders for the part included Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone, Shriya Saran and Rai, who was ultimately selected and paid 60million. Rai's voice was dubbed by Savitha Reddy.|$|E

40|$|This study {{measured}} {{the relationships between}} locus of control, students' perception of the schedule of teacher reinforcement, and academic achievement. The Intellectual Achievement Responsibility questionnaire, Perception of Teacher Reinforcement scale, and Wide Range Achievement Test were used to measure these variables. All subscores of the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility questionnaire correlated significantly with achievement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> but no relationships were found <b>for</b> <b>the</b> males. Perception of the teacher as partially rewarding was significantly correlated with reading, spelling, and total achievement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> males and with reading and arithmetic achievement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> Perception of <b>the</b> teacher as partially punishing was significantly correlated with arithmetic achievement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> males, but {{was not related to}} achievement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>females...</b>|$|R
5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood to stand for the mirror of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|Bondfield {{had helped}} Mary Macarthur to found the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. This {{organisation}} {{was dedicated to}} the unionisation of women, and by 1914 had more than 20,000 members. In 1915 Bondfield became NFWW's organising secretary. Together with Macarthur, Phillips and Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women's Employment, which organised relief work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> unemployed. Bondfield's investigations into workers' pay revealed considerable differences between the rates paid to men and to women, even for identical work. Through the NFWW she campaigned for a £1 a week starting minimum wage for women, whatever {{the nature of the}} work, and for equal pay with men for equal work.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lead of Cliff's girlfriend Jenny, Sherilyn Fenn, Kelly Preston, Diane Lane and Elizabeth McGovern were {{considered}} before Jennifer Connelly was eventually cast. Campbell and Connelly's working relationship {{eventually led to}} a romantic coupling, which Johnston {{found to be a}} technique for method acting that helped with their on-screen chemistry. For Secord's sidekick, Peevy, Dave Stevens hoped that Lloyd Bridges would play the part, but Bridges turned it down and Alan Arkin was cast. The part of Neville Sinclair was offered to Jeremy Irons and Charles Dance before Timothy Dalton accepted the role. Lastly, the part of Eddie Valentine was written with Joe Pesci in mind, but he turned down the part, which went to Paul Sorvino.|$|E

5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} {{to act in the}} film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E

5|$|Males attract mates by {{constructing}} specially-shaped tunnels {{in which}} they sing. Mating {{takes place in the}} male's burrow; the male may widen a tunnel to make room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to mount, though in some species mating is tail-to-tail. Females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially-dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete {{in the case of the}} genus Neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla.|$|E
5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not look very different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
5|$|This {{cockatoo}} usually lays {{a clutch}} of one to two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 days <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> to incubate the eggs, and the young fledge ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young will stay with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the nesting site after the young fledge until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more migratory than those in wetter ones. It flies with deep and slow wingbeats, generally high above trees. Seeds of plants of the families Proteaceae and, to a lesser extent, Myrtaceae form {{a large part of}} its diet.|$|E
25|$|There is {{not much}} {{difference}} in appearance between <b>the</b> male and <b>female,</b> except for a silvery sex band that runs across {{the centre of the}} upperside of the male forewing. Also <b>the</b> <b>females</b> are paler compared to the males. In anticipation of mating, the males either set up their territory on or close to the ground and wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> to arrive or they personally go in search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b> Territorial disputes are common among the males and are expressed by the upward spiral flight of the males.|$|R

5|$|At {{the launch}} of the film in July2009, Thiagarajan {{announced}} that 36 prominent actors would play lead roles with a hundred others in supporting roles. The invitation cards for the launch had 3D holographic designs which won the Sappi awards of the year 2009. Aishwarya Rai and Deepika Padukone were initially considered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lead roles, before Miss India 2009 Pooja Chopra and Divya Parameshwaran accepted the roles. The producers initially listed Sathyaraj in its cast, later replaced by Prabhu. Approximately 5000 junior artists and 1000 artists from the annual Chennai Sangamam had reportedly taken part in the film. For music, Thiagarajan approached A. R. Rahman in 2008 who declined the offer, and Ilaiyaraaja eventually replaced him. Muthuraj was selected as the art director for the film and Shaji Kumar as cinematographer while Prashanth took care of visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E

5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E
5|$|Emraan Hashmi, who {{appeared}} in the original film, was initially chosen to play the lead role. However, Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar {{for the role of}} Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim). In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor, but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. Many actresses were considered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> lead, including Illeana D'Cruz, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Asin Thottumkal, Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS. Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother-in-law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz. In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film. Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. Khan in preparation {{for his role in the}} film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor, copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. Back in those days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers.|$|E
