5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} power source instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star.

5|$|During the High Middle Ages, a few European {{scholars}} such as Hildegard of Bingen, Albertus Magnus and Frederick II {{wrote on}} natural history. The rise of European universities, though <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the development of physics and philosophy, had little impact on biological scholarship.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are <b>important</b> <b>for</b> proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Electricity power {{stations}} are often {{located on the}} coast or beside an estuary so that the sea {{can be used as}} a heat sink. A colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> expensive nuclear power plants in particular.|$|E

It also is an <b>important</b> area <b>for</b> recreation. A balance for both uses was established by restricting public use to the northern and southern ends of the island. A central core area for conservation is closed to the public.|$|R

5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} a {{vertical}} orientation, {{even if the}} object depicted (e.g. fish, Orion’s belt) is usually seen horizontally. This serves the purposes of economy and aesthetic effect. The 'vertical rule' is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> interpreting the glyphs correctly, so it may have assisted in secrecy as well.|$|E
