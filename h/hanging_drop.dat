In their combined efforts, the Lewises found that cell proliferation with their media selection and methods seemed only to occur in tissues common to all organs, such as connective tissue and blood vessel endothelium. Since the Lewises main interest was microscopic cell structures, their objective was to create optically clear media, which {{led to the creation of}} the Locke-Lewis solution.

Resting on the laurels of past-century monolayer culture technologies, the cell culture community has only recently begun to appreciate the potential of three-dimensional mammalian cell culture systems to reveal the full scope of mechanisms orchestrating the tissue-like cell quorum in space and time. Capitalizing on gravity-enforced self-assembly of monodispersed primary embryonic mouse cells in <b>hanging</b> <b>drops,</b> we designed and characterized a three-dimensional cell culture model for ganglion-like structures. Within 24 h, a mixture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and cells, derived from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (sensory neurons and Schwann cells) grown in <b>hanging</b> <b>drops,</b> assembled to coherent spherical microtissues characterized by a MEF feeder core and a peripheral layer of DRG-derived cells. In a time-dependent manner, sensory neurons formed a polar ganglion-like cap structure, which coordinated guided axonal outgrowth and innervation of the distal pole of the MEF feeder spheroid. Schwann cells, present in embryonic DRG isolates, tended to align along axonal structures and myelinate them in an in vivo-like manner. Whenever cultivation exceeded 10 days, DRG:MEF-based microtissues disintegrated due to an as yet unknown mechanism. Using a transgenic MEF feeder spheroid, engineered for gaseous acetaldehyde-inducible interferon-beta (ifn-beta) production by cotransduction of retro-/ lenti-viral particles, a short 6 -h ifn-beta induction was sufficient to rescue the integrity of DRG:MEF spheroids and enable long-term cultivation of these microtissues.

40|$|Introduction. JEG 3 is a choriocarcinoma—and HTR 8 /SVneo a {{transformed}} extravillous trophoblast—cell line {{often used}} to model the physiologically invasive extravillous trophoblast. Past studies suggest that these cell lines possess some stem or progenitor cell characteristics. Aim was to study whether these cells fulfill minimum criteria used to identify stem-like (progenitor) cells. In summary, {{we found that the}} expression profile of HTR 8 /SVneo (CDX 2 +, NOTCH 1 +, SOX 2 +, NANOG+, and OCT-) is distinct from JEG 3 (CDX 2 + and NOTCH 1 +) as seen only in human-serum blocked immunocytochemistry. This correlates with HTR 8 /SVneo’s self-renewal capacities, as made visible via spheroid formation and multi-passagability in <b>hanging</b> <b>drops</b> protocols paralleling those used to maintain embryoid bodies. JEG 3 displayed only low propensity to form and reform spheroids. HTR 8 /SVneo spheroids migrated to cover and seemingly repopulate human chorionic villi during confrontation cultures with placental explants in <b>hanging</b> <b>drops.</b> We conclude that HTR 8 /SVneo spheroid cells possess progenitor cell traits that are probably attained through corruption of “stemness-” associated transcription factor networks.

40|$|Background Information. The {{satellite}} cells (SCs) {{associated with}} muscle fibres {{play a key}} role in postnatal growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle. Commonly used methods of isolation and in vitro culture of SCs lead to the mixture of their subpopulations that exist within muscle. To solve this problem, we used the well established technique, the <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> system, to culture SCs in a three-dimensional environment and thus, to monitor them in their original niche. Results. Using <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> technique, we were able to culture SCs associated with the fibre at least for 9 days with one transfer of fibres to the fresh drops. In comparison, in the classical method of myofibres culture, that is, on the dishes coated with Matrigel, SCs leave the fibres within 3 days after the isolation. Cells cultured in both systems differed in expression of Pax 7 and MyoD. While almost all cells cultured in adhesion system expressed MyoD before the fifth day of the culture, the majority of SCs cultured in <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> still maintained expression of Pax 7 and were not characterised by the presence of MyoD. Among the cells cultured with single myofibre for up to 9 days, we identified two different subclones of SCs: low proliferative clone and high proliferative clone, which differed in proliferation rate and membrane potential. Conclusions. The <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> enables the myofibres to be kept in suspension for at least 9 days, and thus, allows SCs and their niche to interact each other for prolonged time. In a consequence, SCs cultured in <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> maintain expression of Pax 7 while those cultured in a traditional adhesion culture, that is, devoid of signals from the original niche, activate and preferentially undergo differentiation as manifested by expression of MyoD. Thus, the innovative method of SCs culturing in the <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> system may serve as a useful tool to study the fate of different subpopulations of these cells in their anatomical location and to determine reciprocal interactions between them and their niche...|$|E

40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} fullerol on the osteogenic differentiation of rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rADSCs) based on <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> culture. Methods 　rADSC spheres were formed by <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> culture for 3 days, then the spheres were dissociated to single cell by trypsin (called rADSC sphere-derived cells). The rADSC sphere-derived {{cells were cultured in}} 2 -D adherent cell cultures for 24 hours, then the ordinary culture medium was replaced by osteogenic induction medium (osteogenic medium, OM). OM without fullerol served as control group (CM); OM with 1. 0 μmol/L fullerol was used as the experimental group (OM+Ful 1. 0 μmol/L). Two groups were induced to differentiation for 14 d and 21 d, using two methods of alizarin red staining and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to detecte the ability of rADSC sphere-derived cells differentiating into osteoblasts. Results 　rADSCs could form a uniform size microspheres structure through <b>hanging</b> <b>drop</b> culture for 3 days; rADSC sphere-derived cells were obtained by dissipation of trypsin. Compared with OM group, OM+Ful 1. 0 μmol/L can make rADSC sphere-derived cells form more mineralized calcium nodules, and enhance the expression of the relevant osteogenic gene Runx 2, OCN and ColI.
