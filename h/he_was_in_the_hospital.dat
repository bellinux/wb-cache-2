25|$|A major {{reference}} source used by Basquiat {{throughout his career}} was the book Gray's Anatomy, which his mother had given him while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> at age seven. It remained influential in his depictions of internal human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text. Other major sources were Henry Dreyfuss' Symbol Sourcebook, Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Brentjes' African Rock Art.|$|E
25|$|When Morton {{was stabbed}} and wounded, a nearby whites-only {{hospital}} refused to treat him, {{as the city}} had racially segregated facilities. He was transported to a black hospital farther away. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> the doctors left ice on his wounds for several hours before attending to his eventually fatal injury. His recovery from his wounds was incomplete, and thereafter he was often ill and easily became short of breath. Morton made {{a new series of}} commercial recordings in New York, several reprising tunes from his early years that he discussed in his Library of Congress interviews.|$|E
25|$|Tarkovsky {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Yuryevets. He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically {{in the center of}} action. His father left the family in 1937, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939 Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554. During the war, the three evacuated to Yuryevets, living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943 the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet Andrey Voznesensky was one of his classmates. He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school. The family lived on Shchipok Street in the Zamoskvorechye District in Moscow. From November 1947 to spring 1948 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> with tuberculosis. Many themes of his childhood—the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital—feature prominently in his film Mirror.|$|E

25|$|A {{letter from}} the Los Angeles {{community}} published in Star of the West in October noted his many meetings along the last trip he took along the coast perhaps as far as Vancouver and that signs of his illness had appeared during the trip. The outline of his life offered by Frank G. Tyrrell included mention of being a student of Rev. Samuel F. Smith, joining the military at 17, his Civil War service and rising to Captain, but not the detail of it being with black regiments, did include briefly {{of his life in}} Colorado and then as an insurance agent. They had held a prayer vigil for him while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> which transitioned directly into a memorial on hearing of his death. The funeral was held a few days later with contributions from some ministers as well as friends and a memorial a couple days after that.

I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special.

Bela Lugosi Jr. attended the Elsinore Naval & Military School in Lake Elsinore. Lillian and Béla divorced in 1953, at least partially because of Béla's jealousy over Lillian taking a full-time job as an assistant to Brian Donlevy on the sets and studios for Donlevy's radio and television series Dangerous Assignment – Lillian eventually did marry Brian Donlevy, in 1966. Lugosi married Hope Lininger, his fifth wife, in 1955; they remained married until his death.

As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature."

[...] About two years after his original diagnosis, in May 2001, the cancer returned and Schuldiner fell ill again. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness {{to go out and get}} insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the tumor pre-dated insurance being taken out. [...] Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner's medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium has also stated that the band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> in their days as a local band. Schuldiner received chemotherapy with vincristine. [...] Like most drugs used in the treatment of cancer, the side effects were harsh and weakened him greatly.

It was with the sickest of feelings that I gave the white-flag-raising order to Colonel Paul D. Bunker." [...] Instead of burning the entire flag, Bunker cut off a piece and concealed it under a patch on his shirt. Before he died in the Japanese prison camp, Bunker sent for Colonel Delbert Ausmus, cut the flag remnant into two pieces and gave one of the pieces to Ausmus. He told Colonel Ausmus he did not expect to survive the prison camp and that it was Ausmus' duty to take his piece of the flag to the Secretary of War. Ausmus concealed the remnant in his shirt cuff, and shortly after the war ended, Ausmus delivered it to Secretary Patterson. In November 1945, Ausmus described the circumstances under which he received the remnant from Bunker:"He was taken to Billibid prison in Manila and came down with pneumonia.
