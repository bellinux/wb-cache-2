50|$|In 1854, J C Maxwell {{suggested}} a lens whose refractive index distribution {{would allow for}} every region of space to be sharply imaged. Known as the Maxwell fisheye lens, it involves a spherical <b>index</b> <b>function</b> and {{would be expected to}} be spherical in shape as well (Maxwell, 1854). This lens, however, is impractical to make and has little usefulness since only points on the surface and within the lens are sharply imaged and extended objects suffer from extreme aberrations. In 1905, R W Wood used a dipping technique creating a gelatin cylinder with a refractive index gradient that varied symmetrically with the radial distance from the axis. Disk-shaped slices of the cylinder were later shown to have plane faces with radial index distribution. He showed that even though the faces of the lens were flat, they acted like converging and diverging lens depending on whether the index was a decreasing or increasing relative to the radial distance (Wood, 1905). In 1964, a posthumous book of R. K. Luneburg was published in which he described a lens that focuses incident parallel rays of light onto a point on the opposite surface of the lens (Luneburg, 1964). This also limits the applications of the lens because it is difficult to use it to focus visible light; however, it has some usefulness in microwave applications.|$|E

DESIGN: A cross-sectional postal survey study was performed among patients diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease. METHODS: Patients completed both adapted extremity function scales, questionnaires for psychometric evaluation, and disease-specific questions. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed, and reliability and validity were examined. RESULTS: Response rate was 70 % (n[*]=[*] 702). The Extremity <b>Function</b> <b>Index</b> model with a two-factor structure - for upper and lower extremities - showed an acceptable fit. The Extremity <b>Function</b> <b>Index</b> scales showed good internal consistency (alphas: 0. 97 - 0. 98). The known-groups validity test confirmed that Extremity <b>Function</b> <b>Index</b> scales discriminate between categories of "Extent of limitations" and "Quality of Life. " Convergent and divergent validity tests confirmed that Extremity <b>Function</b> <b>Index</b> scales measure the physical impact of neuromuscular diseases. Relative validity tests showed that the Extremity <b>Function</b> <b>Index</b> scales performed well in discriminating between subgroups of patients with increasing "Extent of limitations" compared to concurrent measurement instruments.
