5|$|Spam {{filtering}} imports users' {{address books}} {{to compile a}} whitelist of allowed senders. Addresses to which users send mail and <b>e-mail</b> tagged as valid mail can be automatically added to the whitelist. Using several thousand messages, PC Magazine found that Norton marked over 40 percent of valid <b>e-mail</b> as spam. Over 80 percent of valid newsletters were marked as spam. Norton did correctly identify 90 percent of spam <b>e-mail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Advertising on the Internet was liberalized by the Government in {{time for}} the 2011 general elections. Two forms of {{political}} advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, <b>e-mail,</b> micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by <b>e-mail,</b> micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning <b>e-mail</b> address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E

It is supposed to provide suitable tool for archiving <b>e-mails</b> for administrators and enable users to read archived <b>e-mails</b> via web browser.

The program will be able to correctly display <b>e-mails</b> in various national character encodings and safely process potential untrustworthy data. It will also be able to reasonably group <b>e-mails</b> into individual threads. Lastly, the program will be able to process <b>e-mails</b> which don't meet required and customary Internet Standards in the best possible way...|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the development of}} <b>e-mails</b> in the 21 st century {{in the context of}} epistolography (i. e. an epistolary genre) : an ever increasing amount of <b>e-mails</b> covers both personal relationships and social, cultural and academic communication in the academic environment. The article aims to analyse the <b>e-mails</b> written in the spring semester by the fourth year undergraduate students of the Faculty of Environmental Engineering, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) and sent to the author of the article together with compulsory homework. The <b>e-mails</b> are analysed in terms of structural, functional and linguistic expression properties. The object of the research is 432 <b>e-mails</b> sent in 2010 by the fourth year undergraduate students of the VGTU Faculty of Environmental Engineering. The research results show that in terms of structure most <b>e-mails</b> either do not comply or only partially comply with the requirements of formal written communication. The functional analysis reveals that, in summary, students’ <b>e-mails</b> are distinguished by an extremely specific expression of the following functions characteristic to formal written communication: salutation or greeting, giving information and specifying, giving explanations and excuses, asking questions and negotiating, valediction and thanksgiving, signature and contacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a system for}} classifying <b>e-mails</b> into two categories, legitimate and fraudulent. This classifier system {{is based on the}} serial application of three filters: a Bayesian filter that classifies the textual content of <b>e-mails,</b> a rule- based filter that classifies the non grammatical content of <b>e-mails</b> and, finally, a filter based on an emulator of fictitious accesses which classifies the responses from websites referenced by links contained in <b>e-mails.</b> This system is based on an approach that is hybrid, because it uses different classification methods, and also integrated, because it takes into account all kind of data and information contained in <b>e-mails.</b> This approach aims to provide an effective and efficient classification. The system first applies fast and reliable classification methods, and only when the resulting classification decision is imprecise does the system apply more complex analysis and classification methods...|$|R
5000|$|On May 25, 2011, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth District {{ruled that}} Aaron Reich failed {{to prove that}} <b>e-mailing</b> the {{photographs}} is covered by the First Amendment. Reich claimed that he <b>e-mailed</b> the photographs as a caution {{about the dangers of}} drunk driving because he <b>e-mailed</b> the pictures with an anti-drunk driving message, despite Catsouras' postmortem examination revealing a blood alcohol content of zero. The three-justice panel which reviewed Reich's appeal wrote, [...] "Any editorial comments that Reich may have made with respect to the photographs are not before us. In short, there is no evidence at this point that the <b>e-mails</b> were sent to communicate on the topic of drunk driving." [...] The justices questioned whether the recipients still retained the <b>e-mails,</b> but Reich's attorney conceded that they had not investigated this.|$|R
