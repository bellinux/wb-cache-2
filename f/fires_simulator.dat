40|$|Abstract. The {{simulation}} of fire propagation and control {{is one of}} the most critical components of the Robocup Rescue environment. The current <b>fire</b> <b>simulator</b> provides only a rough approximation of actual fire spread in a realworld situation. Our new <b>fire</b> <b>simulator</b> moves away from the simple buildingdistance model currently used, instead calculating heat transfer based on building geometries. This has been implemented using well understood physics and in consultation with local emergency services to achieve more realistic results. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{forest fire}} {{simulation}} exercise {{was developed for}} the purpose of supplementing forest fire instruction, presenting students with decision-making situations encountered on forest fires, and introducing them to the <b>fire</b> <b>simulator</b> at Stephen F. Austin State University. The final exercise was developed after preliminary work and development of a more simple exercise. The problems with equipment, recruitment of simulator personnel, and the development and execution of the simulator exercises are discussed.

40|$|Model {{predictions}} {{are widely}} {{employed in the}} assessment of fire hazards, and there is an ongoing need to expand the existing comparisons between fire test data and model predictions to additional fire scenarios. This paper presents a comparison of fire model predictions with experimental results from pre-flashover fire tests conducted in a mockup of typical electronic data processing (EDP) or telecommunications facilities. The zone model FPETool: <b>Fire</b> <b>Simulator</b> was used to predict the results of single room preflashover fire tests. The tests involved the suppression of an in-cabinet fire by a clean agent (e. g., FM- 200 ®) system, and by a standard water sprinkler system. With the exception of heat release rates, all inputs were selected without knowledge of the experimental results. Predictions made by FPETool: <b>Fire</b> <b>Simulator</b> are discussed, and the model predictions compared to the experimental data...|$|R

There has been much research done to build a <b>fire</b> <b>Simulator.</b> In this paper, we propose a <b>fire</b> <b>Simulator</b> that is applied optimal path search algorithm to arrange the quick evacuation. This simulator considers the structure of a building and the location where the fire has initially occurred, applying it to the simulator. Especially when implementing the training simulation for firefighters, optimized evacuation path for the required virtual rescuer awaiting rescue was informed to implement more realistic firefighting training simulator. For the simulation for the test, fixed data was set to apply the shortest path search algorithm and flame smoke spread algorithm. As a result of the test, the optimized path was derived through avoiding the flame occurred from flame smoke spread algorithm and following the shortest path search algorithm...|$|R

The effect of roof vents and draft curtains on the time, number, and location of sprinkler activations and vice versa were studied with both traditional experiments and modelling (McGrattan et al.

The results from the modelling were compared to the experimental results; however, the model was also used to provide information about conditions in the experiment that was not measured. Furthermore, the model was used to study what would happen if some of the test parameters would be varied.
