5|$|A manga adaptation, {{illustrated}} by Yukiko Sumiyoshi and titled Tomoyo After: Dear Shining Memories, was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's shōnen manga magazine Dragon Age Pure between April 20 and October 20, 2007. The story {{is based on}} the visual novel version that preceded <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> instead of the story being told from Tomoya's point of view, the manga is told from Tomoyo's perspective. A single tankōbon volume was released in Japan on December 8, 2007 containing four chapters.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends <b>it</b> <b>though</b> that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle.

5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with <b>it.</b> <b>Though</b> both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.|$|E
5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed <b>it.</b> <b>Though</b> Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E

The film's theatrical release was halted {{for over a year}} regarding censorship issues over depiction of smoking in <b>it.</b> <b>Though</b> it was released on 26 December 2014 to generally positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|The Army is {{organised}} into three main elements which {{report to the}} Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large scale ground operations. It {{does not have any}} combat units permanently assigned to <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> it commands units during training activities and the Land Combat Readiness Centre reports to the divisional headquarters. Most of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their readiness and preparing them for operations. This organisation came into effect during January 2011; before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told The New York Times in an August 9, 1925 interview {{that he did not}} know what happened to the letter after his grandmother received <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> he doubted it still survived. A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the third}} edition of Erasmus's Greek text (1522) the Comma Johanneum was included. An often {{repeated}} {{story is that}} Erasmus included it, because he felt bound by a promise to include it if a manuscript was found that contained it. When a single 16th-century Greek manuscript subsequently had been found to contain it (Codex Montfortianus), Erasmus included <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> he expressed doubt as to {{the authenticity of the}} passage in his Annotations. Henk Jan de Jonge, a specialist in Erasmian studies, stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by Erasmus. The real reason to include the Comma by Erasmus, was his care for his good name and for the success of his Novum Testamentum.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E

5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as the Flowing Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so {{it was decided to}} strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of the Flowing Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested it, as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that the Flowing Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1946 season, Rocco was {{competing}} with Les Fleming and Eddie Robinson for the starting first baseman job. Fleming won {{the job and}} held <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> Rocco saw occasional playing time until June 26, when he was traded with cash to the Chicago Cubs for first baseman Heinz Becker in one of new owner Bill Veeck's first moves. However, Rocco refused to report the Nashville Volunteers, the Cubs' minor league organization, and considered quitting the game, which put the trade on hold. He eventually did report to Nashville, and finished the year having played 34 games in the majors and 37 games in the minors. After the season the Boston Red Sox signed him to a contract as a potential backup first baseman, {{but he did not}} make the cut, and was sent to the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League just before the 1947 season started.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{reconstruct}} Ukraine, but also desired {{to complete the}} interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur. As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army. Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine. Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with {{only a third of}} the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown. Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.|$|E

5|$|Past Route 3, {{the highway}} narrows to four lanes, {{continuing}} east-northeast as a limited-access divided highway with some RIRO-accessed businesses still on <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> many roads are accessed through over and underpasses. US 46 has an exit for Van Houten Avenue/Grove Street {{before coming to}} a large interchange with Route 19/CR 509 and the Garden State Parkway. After this, the road passes over the New Jersey Transit Main Line and has an exit for Hazel Street/Paulison Avenue. After the exit, US 46 begins a brief concurrence with Piaget Avenue in Clifton {{with a series of}} connector streets and three intersections controlled by stoplights. After the third, at Day Street near Christopher Columbus Middle School, the two roads split at a fork, marked as an exit, with US 46 continuing eastbound to the left and Piaget Avenue continuing to the right. Vehicles traveling west on Piaget Avenue have access to US 46 West through use of a one way underpass that carries US 46 East over it, and also have access to US 46 East by a right-turn only lane near the intersection of Piaget Avenue and Fourth Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{love story}} between Berenice and Titus {{is also the}} premise of La clemenza di Tito (1734), an Italian opera with music by Antonio Caldara and a {{libretto}} by Pietro Metastasio that was later set to music by more than 40 other composers, including Johann Adolph Hasse (1735), Giuseppe Arena (1738), Francesco Corradini (1747), Christoph Willibald Gluck (1752), Andrea Adolfati (1753), Niccolò Jommelli (1753), Ignaz Holzbauer (1757), Vincenzo Legrezio Ciampi (1757), Gioacchino Cocchi (1760), Marcello Bernardini (1768), Andrea Bernasconi (1768), Pasquale Anfossi (1769), and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (La clemenza di Tito, 1791). More recently it {{was used as the}} backdrop for the Caroline Lawrence novels the Assassins of Rome and the Enemies of Jupiter. Lindsey Davis mentions <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> without making it the central plot line in novels such as Saturnalia. It is also the stimulus for the new ballet piece by Kim Brandstrup, 'Invitus Invitam' which premiered in the Royal Opera House in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced <b>it,</b> <b>though</b> some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E
