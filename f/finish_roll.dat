40|$|Measurements of {{graphite}} {{have been}} studied for thermal white cast iron samples, where data from thermal analysis {{has been compared to}} graphite contents measured in light optical microscope. Data from the thermal analysis gives random outcome and is therefore not suitable as a measurement of graphite content in white cast iron. The reason for this is the low amount of graphite in white cast iron. Furthermore, the sampling for the thermal analysis must be performed at comparable temperatures in order to provide usable data. Sampling from thermal analysis for nodular cast iron has been compared to samples taken from the rollpin on <b>finished</b> <b>rolls.</b> The result indicates that the thermal analysis samples have a lower amount of graphite compared to the <b>finished</b> <b>rolls.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} the thermal analysis samples cool faster than the <b>finished</b> <b>rolls,</b> which are larger and demand longer cooling time.

Rotary gravure presses are the fastest and widest presses in operation, printing everything from narrow labels to 12-foot-wide (3.66-meter-wide) rolls of vinyl flooring. For maximum efficiency, gravure presses operate at high speeds producing large diameter, wide rolls.

40|$|A {{heuristic}} {{procedure for}} scheduling production rolls of paper through a finishing operation {{to cut them}} down to <b>finished</b> <b>roll</b> sizes is described. The ratio of service time to interarrival time of production rolls at the initial cutting station is large so that insufficient time is available {{to set it up}} unless a minimum number of production rolls are to be processed in the same manner. Otherwise, some portion of each production roll must go through a reprocessing operation to complete the cutting of finished sizes. The objective is to minimize the cost of trim loss and reprocessing. The procedure generates cutting patterns and usage levels sequentially until all the requirements are satisfied. At each step the search is dependent upon the characteristics of the unsatisfied requirements. A maximum of three solutions is generated for each problem. If none satisfies a predetermined aspiration level, the best of the three is chosen. The procedure was evaluated by scheduling a specific paper production facility and observing the results for a set of 15 problems. For each problem, the best solution was recorded. The overall results from this set of problems were then compared to previously recorded results on problems solved manually. There was a 16 % improvement in solution quality for the heuristic procedure relative to the manual method. ...|$|R
50|$|The pack mill {{process begins}} with a tin bar, which is a drawn flat bar that was usually {{purchased}} from an ironworks or steel works. The tin bar could be wrought iron or mild steel. The cross-section of the bar needed to be accurate in size as this dictates the length and thickness of the final plates. The bar was cut to the correct length to make the desired size plate; for instance, if a 14 x 20 in plate is desired the tin bar is cut to a length and width that is divisible by 14 and 20. The bar is then rolled and doubled over, {{with the number of}} times being doubled over dependent on how large the tin bar is and what the final thickness is. Continuing the example, if the starting tin bar is 20 x 56 in then it must be at least finished on the fours, or doubled over twice, and if a thin gauge is required then it may be finished on the eights, or doubled over three times. The tin bar is then heated to a dull red heat and passed five or six times through the roughing rolls. Between each pass the plate is passed over (or round) the rolls, and the gap between the rolls is narrowed by means of a screw. The plate is then reheated and run through the <b>finishing</b> <b>rolls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{mechanical}} hammers were developed, {{forge welding}} {{could be accomplished}} by heating the metal, and then placing it between the mechanized hammer and the anvil. Originally powered by waterwheels, modern mechanical-hammers can also be operated by compressed air, electricity, steam, gas engines, and many other ways. Another method is forge welding with a die, whereas the pieces of metal are heated and then forced into a die which both provides the pressure for the weld and keeps the joint at the <b>finished</b> shape. <b>Roll</b> welding is another forge welding process, where the heated metals are overlapped and passed through rollers at high pressures to create the weld.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} finish rolling {{temperature}} (FRT) on the austenite- () to-bainite () phase transformation is quantitatively investigated in high-strength C-Mn steels. In particular, {{the present study}} aims to clarify the respective contributions of the conditioning during the hot rolling and the variant selection (VS) during the phase transformation to the inherited texture. To this end, an alternative crystallographic reconstruction procedure, which can be directly applied to experimental electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mappings, is developed by combining the best features of the existing models: the orientation relationship (OR) refinement, the local pixel-by-pixel analysis and the nuclei identification and spreading strategy. The applicability of this method is demonstrated on both quenching and partitioning (Q&P) and as-quenched lath-martensite steels. The results obtained on the C-Mn steels confirm that the sample <b>finish</b> <b>rolled</b> at the lowest temperature (829 °C) exhibits the sharpest transformation texture. It is shown that this sharp texture is exclusively due to a strong VS from parent brass { 110 }, S { 213 } and Goss { 110 } grains, whereas the VS from the copper { 112 } grains is insensitive to the FRT. In addition, a statistical VS analysis proves that the habit planes of the selected variants do not systematically correspond to the predicted active slip planes using the Taylor model. In contrast, a correlation between the Bain group to which the selected variants belong and the FRT is clearly revealed, regardless of the parent orientation. These results are {{discussed in terms of}} polygranular accommodation mechanisms, especially in view of the observed development in the hot-rolled samples of high-angle grain boundaries with misorientation axes between and...|$|R
