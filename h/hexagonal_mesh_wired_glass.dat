40|$|Large pullout {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> embedded in silty sand locally known as Ayutthaya sand to investigate the soil reinforcement interaction. PVC-coated of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> was tested with different applied normal pressures ranging from 35 to 105 kPa. The <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> specimens with 80 x 100 mm cell sizes were pulled {{at a rate of}} 1 mm/min. In the conventional pullout test wherein the clamping system is outside the pullout box, the deformation and movement of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> known as necking phenomenon occurred simultaneously during the pullout process. In order to reduce this phenomenon, the large pullout test was modified to install the clamping system inside the pullout box hereinafter called “in-soil pullout test”. The total pullout resistance of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> reinforcement consists of two components, namely: friction and bearing resistance. An elastic-perfectly plastic model was used to simulate the friction resistance and relative displacement relation of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> while a hyperbolic model was applied to simulate the passive bearing resistance of the individual bearing member. The bearing resistance is approximately 4 to 6 times greater than the friction resistance. The maximum pullout resistances increased with increasing specimen lengths as well as the applied normal pressures. The in-soil pullout resistances are about 50 % greater than the corresponding results from previous conventional pullout tests. Several analytical models for predicting the pullout resistance of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> reinforcement have been proposed and modified in this paper. These proposed analytical models for predicting the pullout resistance and displacement relation agreed with the laboratory test results reasonable well...|$|R

50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>glass</b> (also {{known as}} Georgian <b>Wired</b> <b>Glass)</b> has a grid or mesh of thin metal wire {{embedded}} within the <b>glass.</b> <b>Wired</b> <b>glass,</b> {{as it is}} typically described, does not perform the function most individuals associate with it.

Despite this belief, <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> is actually weaker than unwired glass due to the incursions of the wire into the structure of the <b>glass.</b> <b>Wired</b> <b>glass</b> often may cause heightened injury in comparison to unwired <b>glass,</b> as the <b>wire</b> amplifies the irregularity of any fractures.This has led to a decline in its use institutionally, particularly in schools.|$|R
40|$|Masonry {{is widely}} used as a {{construction}} material for load bearing structures or as infill walls in reinforced concrete skeleton frame structures. Cracking {{is one of the}} most common problems in masonry walls. It would be better to take relevant precautions at the construction stage rather than carrying out rectification work after cracks are formed. Laboratory tests were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of five methods that can be used as remedial measures to prevent cracking near the wall openings. Test wall panels would represent the load bearing brick masonry walls with openings. Five different types of wall panels were constructed in this study, namely, walls with normal lintel above the opening, normal lintel above the opening and walls reinforced with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh,</b> normal lintel above the opening and walls reinforced with <b>hexagonal</b> plastic <b>mesh,</b> continuous lintel above the opening and both the continuous lintel above the opening with a continuous beam just below the opening. Loads at which cracks propagate were compared. From the test results it was found that many cracks propagated on walls with normal lintels at low load levels. When walls were reinforced with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> or plastic mesh, walls could withstand higher loads before cracking. However, from the results it could be clearly seen that walls having both the continuous lintels above the opening and continuous beams below the openings were the most effective method to control cracking in masonry walls compared to all four other remedial measures considered in this study...|$|R

In the analysis, the 3 D finite difference simulation using 5 times of vertical laboratory permeability can reasonably predict its behavior on soft foundation. In comparison with the field measurements, the predicted results from 3 D analysis reasonably agreed with measured data including vertical settlement, excess pore pressures and lateral displacements. Thus, the actual embankment geometry and the selected permeability influenced {{the behavior of the}} reinforced embankment constructed on soft ground foundation. The simulated maximum tension lines in the reinforcements tend to follow the coherent gravity failure plane.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved discrete element model, which incorporates stochastically distorted contact mechanics, for the simulation of double-twisted <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> that {{are commonly used}} in rockfall protection. First, the characteristics of such meshes are investigated by conducting quasi-static and dynamic experimental tests. Second, the discrete model for the simulation of such meshes is presented. A stochastically distorted contact model is introduced to account for distortions of the wires and hexagons, allowing a more realistic representation of the mechanical response of the mesh from the deformation {{point of view and}} the force point of view. Quasi-static tensile tests of a plane net sheet, subjected to a constant strain rate, are used to study the effect of the stochastically distorted contact formulation and to calibrate the numerical model. Finally, the dynamic response of an impacting block on a horizontal mesh sheet is used to compare the numerical predictions against experimental results in order to validate the proposed approach...|$|R

In this investigation a ferrocement roof truss {{has been designed}} which are of low in cost, light in weight and easy to maintain. The first step of design involves the calculation of dead load using IS 875 (part- 1) and wind load using IS 875 (part- 3) - 1987. The next step involves the calculation of tension and compression in each individual member of the truss. Sections of the truss are designed using the value of highest tension or compression. After designing all the sections, the truss is constructed. A 6 -mm diameter circular coil is used as reinforcing material for construction and angles of desired shape are made to hold the sections in position. <b>Hexagonal</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> or chicken mess is cut into required sizes and are placed over the reinforced skeleton of the section.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide greater meaning and {{significance}} to <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> {{so that it}} may be preserved by exploring the historical origins and complexity of manufacture of the medium. The Industrial Revolution was a period of amazing evolution in the history of glass manufacture. Plate glass technology allowed for new design and building construction concepts, including the Crystal Palace, but this was an imperfect technology. As the brilliant minds of the Revolution struggled to grapple with the obstacles posed by plate <b>glass,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> was eventually born. This new glass type spread across the United States in subsequent years, fueled by uniform manufacture standards on the city and state levels and the American mass media’s coverage of conflagrations, which led to the public’s association of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> with safety given its fire retardant and shatterproof qualities. <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> was technically incredibly difficult to produce, especially in mass production, and although inventors experimented with various treatments and patterns, <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> remained and was comparatively expensive (though people generally believed the safety benefits outweighed the costs). <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> fell into disfavor during the World Wars as it was replaced by newer types of glass that were more economical, but recent trends have sparked renewed interest in the use and hence preservation of <b>wire</b> <b>glass.</b> Original methods of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> manufacture using early wire netting patterns no longer exist, and so current methods of preservation and conservation involving replication through glass lamination methods using imported wire nettings and salvage are discussed.

We developed a fault-tolerant routing algorithm which assures the delivery of every message {{as long as there is}} a path between its source and destination. The algorithm works on many common mesh architectures such as the torus and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>mesh.</b> The proposed scheme can also detect the non-existence of path between a pair of nodes in a finite amount of time. Moreover, the scheme requires each node in the system to know only the state (faulty or not) of each of its own links. The performance of the routing scheme is simulated for both square and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>meshes</b> while varying the physical distribution of faulty components. It is shown that a shortest path between the source and destination of each message is taken with a high probability, and if a path exists, is usually found very quickly.
