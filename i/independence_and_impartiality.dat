25|$|The Vellama {{decision}} {{has also been}} described as enshrining the principle of judicial <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> in Singapore by dispelling unfounded beliefs by {{some members of the}} public that the judiciary is subject to influence by the legislative and executive branches of government. It has also been said that the decision serves as a definition and recognition of the rights of Singaporeans with regards to whether a by-election must be called. However, because Vellama's appeal was in fact dismissed for lack of standing, the holding of the Court with regards to the Prime Minister's discretion in calling a by-election was obiter dicta and, strictly speaking, is not binding on other courts faced with a similar decision.|$|E

Pallop was immediately ordered out of the area, and later tendered his resignation as commander of the Southern Peace Enhancement Center. The forward command of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC), which Pallop headed, was also dissolved. A government investigative commission found that the security forces had over-reacted. The Asian Centre for Human Rights questioned the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of the investigative commission.

25|$|Further, the Court of Appeal {{rejected}} two arguments {{raised by}} the Prosecution circumscribing the scope of fair criticism. In the first place, the Court found that fair criticism should {{not be limited to}} criticism that does not question the <b>independence,</b> <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> integrity of courts. This would overly restrict the scope of fair criticism and render the concept redundant, given that most allegedly contemptuous statements, by their nature, call into question the <b>independence,</b> <b>impartiality</b> <b>and</b> integrity of the courts.

Onslow saw his role to be the protection and defence of Parliament in the tradition established by the Glorious Revolution. He insisted on rigidly observing parliamentary forms and procedure, which he viewed as a protection to independent MPs. But his devotion to precedent led him to condemn the reporting of parliamentary debates as breach of privilege.|$|R

If the allegations are proved senior commanders, military and political, on both sides are liable for prosecution under international criminal law. The panel noted the Sri Lankan government's attempt at accountability consisted solely of investigating {{the actions of the}} previous government and the Tamil Tigers, and not of the present government's actions during the final stages of the war. The panel concluded this is not in accordance with international standards and fell [...] "dramatically short of international expectations". The panel found the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) established by the Sri Lankan government to be [...] "deeply flawed" [...] and not up to international standards of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> due the [...] "deep-seated conflicts of interests" [...] of some of its members. The mandate of the LLRC, its work and methodology meant that it was incapable of investigating the serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law or of examining the causes of the civil war.

2500|$|Government leaders {{historically}} have used court proceedings, in particular defamation suits, against political opponents and critics, {{leading to a}} perception that the judiciary reflected {{the views of the}} ruling party in politically sensitive cases. According to a 1996 report by Dato' Param Cumaraswamy, then United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, allegations concerning the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of the Singapore judiciary [...] "could have stemmed from the very high number of cases won by the Government or members of the ruling party in either contempt of court proceedings or defamation suits brought against critics of the Government, be they individuals or the media". Similar allegations have been made by other commentators. The United States Department of State claims the President of Singapore and the Minister for Home Affairs have substantial de facto judicial power, leading [...] "to a perception that the judiciary reflected the views of the ruling party in politically sensitive cases." [...] In addition, Singapore's [...] "judicial officials, especially the Supreme Court, have close ties to the ruling party and its leaders". The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and in consultation with the Chief Justice. The President also appoints subordinate court judges on the recommendation of the Chief Justice.|$|E

40|$|As a separation-of-powers matter, the nation’s framers {{and their}} state {{counterparts}} placed some {{distance between the}} legislative and judiciary branches so that each might better serve the people. Of course, the separation between the two branches has not prevented legislation impacting the courts {{year in and year}} out, much of which could reasonably be described as changes that potentially infringe on the <b>independence,</b> fairness, <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> of the courts. (I term these “attacks on the courts. ”) Moreover, the issue has been compounded lately by a series of efforts in initiative and referendum states to achieve by the ballot box what could not be accomplished through the legislature. Three areas in particular, those dealing with impeachment, judicial accountability, and court stripping, appear to be parts of larger national trends that will in all probability be replicated (in whole or in part) in other states in the future.

Syvret argues that he cannot have a fair trial in the island and {{there is a lack of}} appearance of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> <b>impartiality</b> because judges are appointed by the Bailiff and the other judges have attended social events with the Bailiff.

30|$|Therefore, IFCs are not {{necessarily}} assessed by how closely the forecast correspondences with actuality, but {{the degree to which}} such assessments can be judged to be independent from the influence of politics. IFCs do seek to produce accurate forecasts, but it is the coherence and cogency of the models and assumptions that inform the forecasts <b>and</b> the <b>impartiality</b> of the IFCs that is central to their legitimacy and function with regard to policy making. In essence, the rationale for contracting out the production and assessment of fiscal forecasts is that even if people disagree with the particular conclusions that have been reached, there is the reassurance that the conclusions reflect dispassionate professional judgement - rather than the wishful thinking of politicians. Such accounts of the ideal relationship of IFCs to policy making can be likened to the role of umpires, referees, and judges. Although it would be good if the judgements exhibited by IFCs, like judges, could be shown to be correct, it is the <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> more specifically, <b>impartiality</b> of IFCs that is most valued [2].

Face-to-face contact is crucial in enhancing collaborative capacity. Individuals build trust through face-to-face contacts which can translate to more frequent contact using other less personal or social modes of communication. Collaboration is an iterative process. Participants must build collaborative capacity over time by focusing on developing swift trust and be aware of cultural understanding. Participants must also use face-to-face contact at the initial meeting. After swift trust is established, participants can use media of decreasing richness over time, but should schedule face-to-face meetings to ensure collaboration is maintained.
