5|$|Andrei {{finds a way}} to get <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> a car {{and plans}} to steal his father's trolleybus. He manages to do so, {{together}} with his friends. His father sees him and starts following the boys with another driver, his colleague. Arriving at the prostitutes' meeting place, the boys cannot find Marilena. Andrei recognizes Giani's car parked in front of block P7, so he goes in.|$|E
5|$|Haakon takes <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the ring, and, {{seemingly}} to Sigmund, she clasps {{her hand}} around it. Haakon does {{not receive the}} ring. Haakon casts himself down before her a second time, and Sigmund notices that Haakon is weeping. He stands up again, takes <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the ring, and finds {{that it has become}} loose. Haakon gives the ring to Sigmund, and tells him that he must never part with it. Sigmund gives him his word on it and the men part, each returning to their ships. A storm appears and the two ships are swept apart, and many days are described as passing afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, Spectrum {{peripheral}} vendor Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) {{released the}} SAM Coupé {{as a potential}} successor with some Spectrum compatibility. By this point, the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST had taken <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the market, leaving MGT in eventual receivership.|$|E

50|$|Properties of recursively defined {{functions}} and sets {{can often be}} proved by an induction principle that follows the recursive definition. For example, {{the definition of the}} natural numbers presented here directly implies the principle of mathematical induction for natural numbers: if a property <b>holds</b> <b>of</b> the natural number 0, and the property <b>holds</b> <b>of</b> n+1 whenever it <b>holds</b> <b>of</b> n, then the property <b>holds</b> <b>of</b> all natural numbers (Aczel 1978:742).|$|R
30|$|Lastly, {{we look at}} the {{correlation}} among assets. There is a positive, and significant at the 5  % level, correlation between the decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> stocks and the decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> safe assets, and a positive and significant correlation between the decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> stocks and decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> pension plans. On the other hand, {{the correlation}} is negative for the decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> stock and the decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> housing and between the decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> stock and the decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> debt. The decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> safe assets is negatively correlated with that <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> housing and positively correlated with that <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> debt. The decision <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> housing is positively correlated with that <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> debt, as they are the decisions <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> pension plans and debt.|$|R

5|$|Mac fends off Sue's {{advances}} {{by saying}} he will only allow her to touch his arse if she can raise £10,000 for Comic Relief. Sue then proceeds to try to ask Martin, Joanna, Guy and Alan for the money, which she eventually manages to raise, though Mac runs off before she can get <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally large thefts of {{diamonds}} take place. In February 2013 armed robbers {{carried out a}} raid at Brussels Airport and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $50m (£32m; 37m euros). The gang broke through a perimeter fence and raided the cargo <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> a Swiss-bound plane. The gang have since been arrested and large amounts of cash and diamonds recovered.|$|E

5|$|The pilots felt a jolt, and the {{autopilot}} disengaged. As Records took <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> his control column, Haynes {{focused on the}} tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, a valve cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Brandenburg-Prussia {{tried to}} acquire Crab Island in 1687, but {{the island was}} claimed also by Denmark, England and Spain, and when a second {{expedition}} in 1692 found the island in Danish hands, the plan was abandoned. 1689, Brandenburg-Prussia annexed Peter Island, but the small rock proved ineligible for trade or settlement. In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by England, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with England {{did not result in}} an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia tried to get a <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> Tortola, but England denied them settlement. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.|$|E

By blackmailing Sukanya that they would reveal her past to Damodar, they trap Mallikharjun with her help and accuse him of a rape attempt on Sukanya. However, the fact that Mallikharjun was gay, which was concealed by him for a long time, was believed by none. He is murdered by eating poisoned food.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{monetary}} {{policies were}} {{closely associated with}} his religious ones, in that increased minting was associated with measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the statues and having them melted for immediate minting—with {{the exception of a}} number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to take <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E

5|$|Ecgfrith {{was killed}} during a {{campaign}} against his cousin, the King of the Picts Bridei map Beli, at a battle known as Nechtansmere to the Northumbrians, in Pictish territory north of the Firth of Forth. Bede recounts that Queen Eormenburh and Cuthbert were visiting Carlisle that day, and that Cuthbert had a premonition of the defeat. Ecgfrith's death threatened to break the <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the descendants of Æthelfrith on Northumbria, but the scholar Aldfrith became king and the thrones of Bernicia and Deira remained united.|$|E
5|$|Further in Skáldskaparmál, Snorri relates a story where Loki {{cuts off}} Sif's hair as a prank. When Thor discovers this, he grabs <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> Loki, {{resulting}} in Loki swearing {{to have a}} headpiece made of gold to replace Sif's locks. Loki fulfills this promise by having a headpiece made by dwarfs, the Sons of Ivaldi. Along with the headpiece, the dwarfs produced Odin's spear, Gungnir. As the story progresses, the incident leads {{to the creation of}} the ship Skíðblaðnir and the boar Gullinbursti for Freyr, the multiplying ring Draupnir for Odin, and the mighty hammer Mjöllnir for Thor.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Europe, Greek mythology {{never took}} the same <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. The English {{imagination}} was fired by Greek mythology starting with Chaucer and John Milton and continuing through Shakespeare to Robert Bridges in the 20th century. Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. Although during the Enlightenment of the 18th century reaction against Greek myth spread throughout Europe, the myths continued to provide {{an important source of}} raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of Handel's and Mozart's operas.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) {{controversial}} {{imitation of}} a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge—aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff—and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself.|$|E

Winthrop became governor while his brother Nelson was governor of New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M.
