5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is {{too slow to}} cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the <b>first</b> <b>bite.</b> Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the <b>first</b> <b>bite.</b> In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.|$|E

50|$|Conocephalus discolor has a {{univoltine}} life cycle, only producing {{one set of}} offspring per year. The females {{lay between}} their eggs in the stems of grasses in the late summer. They do this by <b>first</b> <b>biting</b> a whole into the stems of grasses or reeds and then insert their eggs using their ovipositors. The eggs develop over the winter months and the nymphs will begin to emerge in mid May and will reach adulthood between July and late October.|$|R
5000|$|Pharyngeal jaws are a [...] "second set" [...] of jaws {{contained}} within the pharynx of many species of fish, distinct from the primary (oral) jaws. Pharyngeal jaws have been studied in moray eels where their specific action is noted. When the moray <b>bites</b> prey, it <b>first</b> <b>bites</b> normally with its oral jaws, capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal jaws are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they then retract, pulling the prey down the eel's esophagus, allowing it to be swallowed.|$|R
50|$|A notable example {{occurs with}} the moray eel. The {{pharyngeal}} jaws of most fishes are not mobile. The pharyngeal jaws of the moray are highly mobile, perhaps as an {{adaptation to the}} constricted nature of the burrows they inhabit which inhibits their ability to swallow as other fishes do by creating a negative pressure in the mouth. Instead, when the moray <b>bites</b> prey, it <b>first</b> <b>bites</b> normally with its oral jaws, capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal jaws are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they then retract, pulling the prey down the moray eel's gullet, allowing it to be swallowed.|$|R

2500|$|Common law. At common law, a dog owner can be {{held liable}} for the injury caused by a dog that the owner knows, or has reason to know, may be dangerous. Many common law jurisdictions have {{historically}} recognized a [...] "one bite" [...] rule, meaning that absent information that suggests that a dog may be unusually dangerous to others, a dog owner cannot {{be held liable for}} the <b>first</b> <b>bite</b> injury caused by their dog.|$|E
50|$|Most {{fish species}} with {{pharyngeal}} teeth {{do not have}} extendable pharyngeal jaws. A particularly notable exception is the highly mobile pharyngeal jaw of the moray eels. These are possibly a response to their inability to swallow as other fishes do by creating a negative pressure in the mouth, perhaps induced by their restricted environmental niche (burrows). Instead, when the moray <b>bites</b> prey, it <b>first</b> <b>bites</b> normally with its oral jaws, capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal jaws are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they then retract, pulling the prey down the moray eel's gullet, allowing it to be swallowed.|$|R

50|$|The Núcleo de Colonização Celeste (Celeste Center for Settlement) {{belonged to}} Jorge Martins Phillip and had initial area of 198 000 {{hectares}} of land designated for settlement, being acquired in 1971 by Pipino. The {{opening of the}} first streets of Sinop began in May 1972 and the first families of pioneers soon arrived in the city. Until then travel to the interior of Paraná Sinop took 7 days. But despite this great difficulty, the migratory flow towards the West that accompanied the indentation of the agricultural frontier in northern Mato Grosso grew increasingly. The project execution took place about 400 men and machines who crossed the Verde River and opened the <b>first</b> <b>bites</b> in the jungle.|$|R

Along with written reviews available on the Freezerburns website, Greg hosted different types of reviews, among them full length reviews, one word reviews, [...] "Fro-Down" [...] reviews, which featured a comparison between two similar items, and Live reviews. Ng's style was relaxed, speaking casually to the audience. He displayed the frozen dish, and, after cooking, commented on its taste, sometimes upon the <b>first</b> <b>bite.</b> Each episode ended with a [...] "question of the day," [...] which helped Ng interact with his followers.|$|E

50|$|The undead {{attack the}} rebel base during the night, but Uffizi, Luke and Julia survive, {{proceeding}} to Dracula's castle. There they find Elizabeth, almost totally turned to Dracula's way of life. Dracula mortally wounds Julia and tells Uffizi that only through God's forgiveness can he truly die, but Uffizi engages the ancient vampire in a duel and ultimately destroys him by <b>first</b> <b>biting</b> him and draining {{him of his}} blood, then beheading him, announcing that he should consider himself forgiven. Meanwhile, Luke, on her request, beheads Elizabeth. Luke leaves the castle, while Uffizi sits on Dracula's throne, with Julia revived as a vampire.

50|$|Viperines {{can sense}} their prey’s {{infrared}} radiation through bare nerve endings {{on the skin}} of their heads. Also, viperines and some boids have thermal receptors {{that allow them to}} target their prey’s heat. Many snakes are able to obtain their prey through constriction. This is done by <b>first</b> <b>biting</b> the prey, then coiling their body around the prey. The snake then tightens its grip as the prey struggles, which leads to suffocation. Some snakes have fangs that produce venomous bites, which allows the snake to consume unconscious, or even dead, prey. Also, some venoms include a proteolytic component that aids in digestion. Chameleons grasp their prey with a projectile tongue. This is made possible by a hyoid mechanism, which is the contraction of the hyoid muscle that drives the tip of the tongue outwards.|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{algorithm}} {{can find}} target item in a database {{faster than any}} classical. One can trade accuracy for speed and find {{a part of the}} database (a block) containing the target item even faster: this is partial search. One can think of partial search in following terms: an exact address of the target item is given by a sequence of many bites, but we want to find only several <b>first</b> <b>bites</b> of the address. We consider different partial search algorithms consisting of a sequence of global and local searches and suggest the optimal one. Global search consists of the standard Grover iterations for the whole database. Local search consists of Grover iterations in each individual block made simultaneously in all blocks. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by number of queries to the oracle. Comment: 11 pages 4 figure...|$|R
