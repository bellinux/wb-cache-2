5|$|Manila—officially {{known as}} the City of Manila—is the {{national}} capital of the Philippines and is classified as a Special City (according to its income) and a Highly Urbanized City (HUC). The mayor is the chief executive, and is assisted by the vice mayor, the 36-member City Council, six Congressmen, the President of the Association of Barangay Captains, and the President of the Sangguniang Kabataan. The members of the City Council are elected as representatives of specific congressional districts within the city. The city, however, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over Intramuros and the Manila North Harbor. The historic Walled City {{is administered by the}} Intramuros Administration, while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies. The barangays that have jurisdictions over these places only oversee the welfare of the city's constituents and cannot exercise their executive powers.|$|E
25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over {{the events of the}} past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over these matters, we also can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Binge eating {{disorder}} is an {{eating disorder}} characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting).

25|$|On December 27, 1968 an Ozark Airlines DC-9 (Flight 982) crashed {{while taking}} off from runway 35 at Sioux Gateway Airport en route to Chicago. The plane was inadequately deiced, causing it to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> after takeoff. The plane rolled violently 90 degrees to the right causing the wing to strike the ground. The plane came to rest 1181 feet past the runway end. There were no fatalities.|$|E

25|$|For a 6to4 host to have {{fast and}} {{reliable}} connectivity {{with a host}} natively using the IPv6 Internet, both the 6to4 host and the native IPv6 host must have a route to a fast, reliable and correctly configured relay server. The 6to4 host's ISP can ensure that outgoing packets go to such a relay, but they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over the relay used for the responses from the native IPv6 host. A variant called IPv6 rapid deployment ("6rd") uses the same basic principles as 6to4 but uses a relay operated by the 6rd user's ISP for traffic in both directions. To achieve this an address block allocated by the user's ISP is used instead of 2002::/16.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} by {{scientists}} commissioned by the ICC it was shown that Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar and Indian bowler R. P. Singh were seen to extend their elbow joints by a negative angle {{with respect to the}} upper arm. This phenomenon, also known as hyperextension, can give the illusion of throwing. In the report it was seen that R. P. Singh maintained this negative angle throughout his delivery stride, while Akhtar sometimes bowled a quicker delivery by flexing this hyperextension. These actions are not considered to be chucking as they are due to the distinctive architecture of their elbows, possibly a congenital condition. Since these cricketers <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over this hyperextension, any degree of hyperextension (past zero) is not included in the 15 degree extension tolerance threshold.|$|E
25|$|As {{an expert}} in {{psychological}} warfare, Linebarger {{was very interested in}} the newly developing fields of psychology and psychiatry. He used many of their concepts in his fiction. His fiction often has religious overtones or motifs, particularly evident in characters who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over their actions. James P. Jordan argued for the importance of Anglicanism to Linebarger's works back to 1949. But Linebarger's daughter Rosana Hart has indicated that he did not become an Anglican until 1950, and was not strongly interested in religion until later still. The introduction to the collection Rediscovery of Man notes that from around 1960 Linebarger became more devout and expressed this in his writing. Linebarger's works are sometimes included in analyses of Christianity in fiction, along with the works of authors such as C. S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.|$|E

25|$|By {{the turn}} of the century the Christchurch City Council was {{strongly}} in favour of bringing the tramways under municipal control but only on its own terms. This ignited suspicion amongst Christchurch City's neighbouring boroughs – through whose territory such a system would have to be built even if only to replace the existing private network – that they would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over the running of such a system. A series of tramway conferences were held from the mid-1890s for the local bodies involved to advance the cause of municipalisation but it was not until March 1902 that the City Council acquiesced to the demands of its neighbours for a tramway board with elected members. The Tramway Conference had received an offer to construct and operate an electric tramway system from the British Electric Traction Company (the same company that had the contract for the Auckland system) in February but, despite public support for the proposal, declined as they were already in favour of municipal control.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, {{is the lack of}} personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, [...] "The knife went in", in reference to the words of one of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions seem like they are something separate from the person themselves and that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over it.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles. She wanted [...] "Cry" [...] to be released instead, but conceded that, [...] "in the end, they’re releasing it without my consent. It sucks, but it's one of those things I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over... At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Tedder, however, was pleased that the song was released, saying that he likes it more than [...] "Halo". The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11, 2009. In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder {{commented that}} he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her {{criticism}} was [...] "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] are completely different. Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those things I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Sleeper berth time is {{any amount}} of time spent inside the sleeper berth (e.g., resting or sleeping). FMCSA {{regulation}} §393.76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth. The simple definition is an area separate from (usually immediately behind) the driving controls that includes a bed. The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep, only that a driver must take a period of [...] "rest" [...] within the sleeper berth or off-duty (i.e., home). A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off-duty, although some of his spare time activities may tire him as much as any work would do. We can only emphasize, by this comment, the responsibility which is the driver's own to assure himself of adequate rest and sleep, in the time available for this purpose, to ensure safety of his driving, and likewise the employer's responsibility to see that his drivers report for work in fit condition." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{session was}} stopped while doctors {{attended}} to Ratzenberger. After initially being taken by ambulance to the on-circuit medical centre, he was airlifted to Maggiore Hospital shortly after, the second driver {{to be admitted}} there during the weekend. The session was restarted approximately 25minutes later, but several teams—including Williams and Benetton—took no further part. Later in hospital, {{it was announced that}} Ratzenberger had {{died as a result of}} his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Professor Sid Watkins, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs Ayrton Senna's reaction to the news, stating that [...] "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder." [...] Watkins tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking [...] "What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing." [...] Senna replied, [...] "Sid, there are certain things over which we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control.</b> I cannot quit, I have to go on." ...|$|E
500|$|Large game hunting {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} as a signal of men’s willingness to take physical risks, as well as showcase strength and coordination. Costly signalling theory is {{a useful tool for}} understanding food sharing among hunter gatherers because it can be applied to situations in which delayed reciprocity is not a viable explanation. Instances that are particularly inconsistent with the delayed reciprocity hypothesis are those in which a hunter shares his kill indiscriminately with all members of a large group. In these situations, the individuals sharing meat <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over whether or not their generosity will be reciprocated, and free riding becomes an attractive strategy for those receiving meat. Free riders are people who reap the benefits of group-living without contributing to its maintenance. [...] Fortunately, costly signalling theory can fill some of the gaps left by the delayed reciprocity hypothesis. Hawkes has suggested that men target large game and publicly share meat to draw social attention or to show off. Such display and the resulting favorable attention can improve a hunter’s reputation by providing information about his phenotypic quality. High quality signallers are more successful in acquiring mates and allies. Thus, costly signalling theory can explain apparently wasteful and altruistic behaviour.|$|E
500|$|By default, Aurora {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the film's main character. Leigh Butler of Tor.com argues that the role of [...] "protagonist" [...] rightfully belongs to the three good fairies because they [...] "make all the critical decisions in the film, the ones which drive the action", while Aurora acts {{as little more than a}} pawn. Butler expounded that Aurora [...] "never grows as a character during the course of the film; she has no agency at all, in fact. She doesn’t act; she is acted upon. So she is definitely not the hero of the story." [...] Helping Writers Become Authors' K. M. Weiland agreed, writing, [...] "Sleeping Beauty has no arc. Prince Phillip has no arc. And, even more importantly, neither of them are present from start to finish in the story. Without the fairies to hold this thing together, the plot would have lacked any kind of impetus or cohesion." [...] Upon initial viewing of Sleeping Beauty, a writer for Anibundel originally dismissed Aurora as [...] "the ultimate Disney princess in the most negative and passive sense of the stereotype ... playing no part whatsoever in her own outcome." [...] However, in retrospect, the author's opinion eventually evolved upon subsequent viewings: [...] "Although Aurora has little to do with her own conclusion, it’s not a mark of her being a non-person. Instead it reflects how sometimes bad things just happen which we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> over, a difficult but important lesson." [...] Anibundel does agree that although Aurora is Sleeping Beautys title character, she can hardly be considered the film's protagonist, instead believing instead that the film actually lacks one completely. Meanwhile, the author dubbed Aurora the film's most sympathetic character because she has [...] "thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and emotions," [...] elaborating, [...] "While most characters ... are overly focused on the plot and reacting to events, Briar Rose is unaware of the other events so we get to see a more authentic everyday side of her." [...] In his book Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment, author Douglas Brode wrote that the fairies' raising of Aurora mirrors [...] "precisely that sort of women's commune numerous feminists experimented with throughout the seventies." ...|$|E
