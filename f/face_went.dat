500|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{travel to}} Gibsonton to {{investigate}} a 28-year series of attacks by an unknown assailant {{in a community of}} former circus sideshow performers. They attend the funeral of the [...] "Alligator Man" [...] (who suffered from Ichthyosis).

2500|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, small wrestling {{promotions}} had {{fierce competition}} with each other, often stealing talents and [...] "invading" [...] enemy companies {{to win over}} fans. With inter-promotional matches occurring nationwide, the promotions were vying for dominance.

In the late 1940s to 1950s, the NWA chose Lou Thesz to unify the various world championships into a single [...] "World Heavyweight" [...] title. Thesz's task was not easy, as some promoters, reluctant to lose <b>face,</b> <b>went</b> so far as to shoot title matches to keep their own champions popular with the fans.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Telejato's {{reporting}} on the unauthorised use of an extended land area by cattle barns that allegedly belonged to local, Mafia-affiliated families and had been operating there {{for more than twenty}} years, led to renewed threats. Pino's daughter, Letizia, hung placards outside the stables, reading [...] "Stables of shame." [...] The next day, Pino Maniaci was allegedly beaten by two unknown teenagers in the street and taken to hospital. After receiving first aid assistance, Maniaci left the hospital and, with bruises and cuts visible on his <b>face,</b> <b>went</b> on the air to denounce from Telejato, once more, the ostensibly Maffia-run cattle business. Soon after, the Italian carabinieri, in a combined anti-Mafia operation, closed down the illegal barns in the area.|$|E
