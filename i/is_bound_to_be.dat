Chinese assertion in Tibet, {{its role in the}} Korean War and other such acts concerned Washington. As the relations between India and China were heated during the late fifties, the Americans found a golden opportunity {{to take advantage of this}} situation to promote India as a counterweight to China. But any unidimensional alliance <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> short-lived and this alliance was no exception to this general rule. As China ceased to be a headache for the American policymakers by the late sixties, this unidimensional alliance disappeared into thin air.|$|E
25|$|When the Spaniards arrived, {{the ruler}} of the Aztec empire was Moctezuma II, who was later killed. His {{successor}} and brother Cuitláhuac {{took control of the}} Aztec empire, but {{was among the first to}} fall from the first smallpox epidemic in the area a short time later. Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors, among whom smallpox was endemic, the infectious disease ravaged Mesoamerica in the 1520s. It killed more than 3 million natives as they had no immunity. Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million) although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 Aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million. Severely weakened, the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cortés and his forces on his second return with the help of state of Tlaxcala whose population estimate was 300,000. The native population declined 80–90% by 1600 to 1–2.5 million. Any population estimate of pre-Columbian Mexico <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a guess but 8–12 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern nation.|$|E

Other reviewers were also critical of the track's lyrics; Alfred Soto of Spin said it [...] "lays out every admonitory cliché from the Barnes & Noble self-help shelf"—a view echoed by Lindsay Zoladz of New York who dismissed it as [...] "inspirational quotes copied from a high-school guidance counselor's bulletin board". Karen Lawler of Blues & Soul wrote: [...] "While, [...] <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a favourite among Iggy fans, it's a subject that's been done millions of time before and it's been done better".

500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser. It takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if you enjoy playing the Sonatas and Interludes then do it so that it seems right to you".|$|E

Considine of The Baltimore Sun noted that Madonna's [...] "newfound {{strength}} is particularly apparent in pulsing, rhythm driven tracks like , which finds her soaring confidently {{at the top of}} her register on the busily percolating chorus, then whispering breathily on the brief, dream-like bridge". David Browne, while reviewing Ray of Light for Entertainment Weekly, titled the song as [...] "sirenlike techno-glitter-ball". Idolator's Stephen Sears explained that Madonna's vocals throughout the album were a [...] "game-changer", including on the song, as she strengthened her voice while working on her film Evita. He ends his review by stating [...] "Indeed, no choir is needed to lift 'Ray Of Light' into disco heaven. Madonna supplies the highs herself in some perfect moments: the extended, spiraling way she wails 'yea-ea-ears' at 3:27 or how her vocal spins out of control at 4:14, matched by Orbit's frenzied guitar work".|$|E

[...] Harrison's {{standing}} there was not helped by the presence of [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] on the B-side, due to its casual delivery and the literal message in the song title. In a more favourable review, for Melody Maker, Chris Irwin wrote of the single: [...] "We’ve come to expect something with more substance than this glorified nursery rhyme from {{one of the most important}} musicians of the decade. True, it’s catchy with a full chunky sound to bounce it along, but with an undeniable infectiousness of the sort normally associated with chicken pox or measles ...

[...] Chicago Sun-Timess Thomas Conner complimented the harmonies [...] "scooping, gliding multi-tracked harmonies that almost make moot the idea of a Destiny's reunion."

A number of Joyce scholars question the legitimacy of searching for a linear storyline within the complex text.

[...] David Hayman has suggested that [...] "For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the Wake, it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold." [...] The book's challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes, prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of [...] "boiling down" [...] Finnegans Wake into [...] "insipid pap, and leaving the lazy reader with a predigested mess of generalizations and catchphrases." [...] Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses, saying [...] "we have some traditional summaries, also some put in circulation by Joyce himself. I find them most unsatisfactory and unhelpful, they usually leave out the hard parts and recirculate what we already think we know. I simply cannot believe that FW would be as blandly uninteresting as those summaries suggest." ...|$|E

500|$|Up! Live from Chicago {{received}} favorable critic reviews. Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of Up! Close and Personal. He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, you know exactly what you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very good thing indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E

Legally, morally, politically, and militarily it has only one justification: protecting the country's people." [...] However, the Council also noted that the policy had been used only in Libya, and not in countries such as Côte d'Ivoire, undergoing a political crisis at the time, or in response to protests in Yemen. A CFR expert, Stewert Patrick, said that [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selectivity and inconsistency in the application of the responsibility to protect norm given the complexity of national interests at stake in...the calculations of other major powers involved in these situations."
