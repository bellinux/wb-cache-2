The involvement in <b>equipment</b> <b>planning</b> and crane selection was characterized with regard to project stages and planning parties. The findings were analysed with a view to the changing participation level of each party throughout project life. The conclusions of the study portray a picture that is different from the common assumptions about mobile crane selection, with respect to both influencing factors and the process itself.

40|$|Planning of Container Terminal {{equipment}} {{has always}} been uncertain due to seasonal and fluctuating throughput demand, along with factors of delay in operation, breakdown and maintenance. Many timeseries models {{have been developed to}} forecast the unforeseen future of container throughput to project the needed amount of port equipments for optimum operation. Conventionally, a "ratio" method developed by port consultants at early port design stage is adopted for <b>equipment</b> <b>planning,</b> giving no consideration to the dynamic growth of the port in terms of improved layout and technological advancement in equipments. This study seeks first to enhance the empirical approach of the <b>equipment</b> <b>planning</b> at the end of planning time horizon by including assumed coefficient of port capacity parameters.

The new paradigm in waste management has to implement the 3 R concept, by recovering waste from the source {{to the end of}} process in the landfill. Thus, management solid waste in Semarang Timur Sub-District is developed. Before designing, analysis of existing condition are needed to determine waste generation and service rate management with SNI 19 - 2454 - 2002. The design stage starts from preparation, then calculate the number of equipment and cost to manage solid waste with SNI 19 - 2454 - 2002 and SNI 3242 - 2008. Existing condition refers to solid waste management is low about 57, 82 %, waste generation in volume and weight are 3, 02 l/person/day and 0, 41 kg/person/day. Waste composition in Semarang Timur Sub-District is devided to organic and anorganic. Organic waste with the volume is 32, 51 %, and anorganic waste composed by 24, 07 % paper, 29, 98 % plastic, 0, 49 % metal, 5, 46 % glass, 0, 75 % wood, and 4, 73 % bottle.

40|$|This Bachelor of Science in Conservation {{is about}} how I as a garden {{designer}} will produce a sustainable design proposal of an ash burial place for the church of Tidaholm. The main problem that I have chosen to deal with is that the Tidaholms church joint property {{is in need of}} a new burial {{in the form of an}} ash burial place. This includes that an ash burial place is a relatively new type of burial and today there is currently some confusion in the country regarding to how this type of burial should be designed and named. It is also true that the church and cemetery of Tidaholm is laid out before 1939 and is therefore classified as historically interesting according to the Heritage Conservation Act. This entails that the design proposal first must be approved by the County board to get built and therefore, one as a designer, needs to pay extra attention to the sites heritage values. To make the design proposal sustainable in a long term I took into account several aspects. The first one was to clarify the definition of what an ash burial place is. The second one was to find out more about the selected sites conditions as an historical envi-ronment. And the last one was to clarify the needs and wishes of the client and visitors concerning the design of the ash burial place. This then led to a design proposal of an ash burial place to the church of Tidaholm in the form of a description of the proposed expression and its future development as well as an <b>equipment</b> <b>plan</b> and a planting plan with plant list and detailed sketches. The thesis turns to cemetery administrations and garden designers which in future will face to shape new ash burial places.

40|$|The {{process of}} doing the {{software}} training portion of a large complex command and control system under government contract was traced from the initial advertisement to completion of formal training. The Royal Thai Air Defense System (RTADS) contract, as viewed {{from the perspective of}} the software training manager, was used as the vehicle for describing the development and delivering a software maintenance training program. The early aspects of the contracting process were reviewed in general terms from the initial public announcement to the contract award. Emphasized, was the need for thorough analysis of the request for proposal (RFP), the system specification, and references included in both. Each included reference could lead to further references and failure to examine all such references could result in underestimating the amount of work needed to complete the contract. Such a failure could result in not bidding enough money to do the job within the proposed schedule. Once the contract was awarded, the processes involved in doing the project were described. These included acquiring and training the necessary staff; analyzing the project needs; coordinating with subcontractors; developing the training and training <b>equipment</b> <b>plan</b> (TTEP); developing budgets and schedules; coordinating with governmental oversight agencies; designing the courses, lessons, and instructional materials; producing the lesson plans, student study guides, and other materials; securing approvals; scheduling students and classes; and finally delivering the planned and prepared training. The problems encountered in coordinating and implementing a program where multiple agencies have shared responsibilities were discussed. Also described were the complications of developing training materials for teaching computer programs that were simultaneously being developed and were thus changing regularly. The added complications associated with training Thai military personnel were covered, such as language and cultural problems. The software maintenance training program was described as it grew from a few lines of general statements in the RFP to about 60 pages of the 800 page TTEP to about 3800 pages of training materials and 500 graphic slides developed specifically for the three software maintenance courses. Those three courses were presented successfully over a two year period to three different groups of people. Conclusions emphasized the need to plan in great detail, to expect problems, to coordinate with everyone concerned, to adhere to budgets and schedules, and to expect to expend much time and energy on student personal matters because of cultural and language difficulties. The RTADS software maintenance training program was evaluated as successful by all concerned, all students completed their training, and all students safely returned home to Thailand...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} thirty years, a series of plans have been {{developed}} by successive Brazilian governments in a continuing effort to maximize the nation's resources for economic and social growth. This planning history has been quantitatively rich but qualitatively poor. The disjunction has stimulated Professor Mello e Souza to address himself {{to the problem of}} national planning and to offer some criticisms of Brazilian planning experience. Though political instability has obviously been a factor promoting discontinuity, his criticisms are aimed at the attitudes and strategic concepts which have sought to link planning to national goals and administration. He criticizes the fascination with techniques and plans to the exclusion of proper diagnosis of the socio-political reality, developing instruments to coordinate and carry out objectives, and creating an administrative structure centralized enough to make national decisions and decentralized enough to perform on the basis of those decisions. Thus, fixed, quantified objectives abound while the problem of functioning mechanisms for the coordinated, rational use of resources has been left unattended. Although his interest and criticism are focused on the process and experience of national planning, he recognized variation in the level and results of Brazilian planning. National plans have failed due to faulty conception of the function of planning. Sectorial plans, save in the sector of the petroleum industry under government responsibility, ha e not succeeded in overcoming the problems of formulation and execution thereby repeating old technical errors. Planning for the private sector has a somewhat brighter history due to the use of Grupos Executivos which has enabled the planning process to transcend the formalism and tradition-bound attitudes of the regular bureaucracy. Regional planning offers two relatively successful experiences, Sudene and the strategy of the regionally oriented autarchy. Thus, planning history in Brazil is not entirely black but a certain shade of grey. The major part of the article, however, is devoted to a descriptive analysis of the national planning experience. The plans included in this analysis are: The Works and <b>Equipment</b> <b>Plan</b> (POE); The Health, Food, Transportation and Energy Plan (Salte); The Program of Goals; The Trienal Plan of Economic and Social Development; and the Plan of Governmental Economic Action (Paeg). Using these five plans for his historical experience the author sets out a series of errors of formulation and execution by which he analyzes that experience. With respect to formulation, he speaks of a lack of elaboration of programs and projects, of coordination among diverse goals, and of provision of qualified staff and techniques. He mentions the absence of the definition of resources necessary to the financing of the plan and the inadequate quantification of sectorial and national goals {{due to the lack of}} reliable statistical information. Finally, he notes the failure to coordinate the annual budget with the multi-year plans. He sees the problems of execution as beginning in the absence of coordination between the various sectors of the public administration, the failure to develop an operative system of decentralization, the absence of any system of financial and fiscal control over execution, the difficulties imposed by the system of public accounting, and the absence of an adequate program of allocation for the liberation of resources. He ends by pointing to the failure to develop and use an integrated system of political economic tools in a mode compatible with the objective of the plans. The body of the article analyzes national planning experience in Brazil using these lists of errors as rough model of criticism. Several conclusions emerge from this analysis with regard to planning in Brazil and in developing countries, in general. Plans have generally been of little avail in Brazil because of the lack of a continuous, bureaucratized (in the Weberian sense) planning organization set in an instrumentally suitable administrative structure and based on thorough diagnoses of socio-economic conditions and problems. Plans have become the justification for planning. Planning has come to be conceived as a rational method of orienting the process of decisions through the establishment of a precise and quantified relation between means and ends. But this conception has led to a planning history rimmed with frustration, and failure, because of its rigidity in the face of flexible and changing reality. Rather, he suggests a conception of planning which understands it "as a rational process of formulating decisions about the policy, economy, and society whose only demand is that of managing the instrumentarium in a harmonious and integrated form in order to reach explicit, but not quantified ends". He calls this "planning without plans": the establishment of broad-scale tendencies through diagnosis whose implementation is carried out through an adjustable, coherent instrumentarium of political-economic tools. Administration according to a plan of multiple, integrated goals is a sound procedure if the nation's administrative machinery contains the technical development needed to control the multiple variables linked to any situation of socio-economic change. Brazil does not possess this level of refinement and any strategy of planning relevant to its problems must recognize this. The reforms which have been attempted fail to make this recognition as is true of the conception of planning informing the Brazilian experience. Therefore, unworkable plans, ill-diagnosed with little or no supportive instrumentarium or flexibility have been Brazil's legacy. This legacy seems likely to continue until the conception of planning comes to live in the reality of Brazil...|$|E
