War pensions and allowances (for both World Wars) were increased by an Act of 1946 which gave the wounded man with an allowance for his wife and children if he married after he had been wounded, thereby removing a grievance of more than twenty years standing. Other improvements were made in war pensions during Attlee’s tenure as prime minister. A Constant Attendance Allowance was tripled, an Unemployability Allowance was tripled from 10s to 30s a week, and a special <b>hardship</b> <b>allowance</b> of up to £1 a week was introduced. In addition, the 1951 Budget made further improvements in the supplementary allowances for many war pensioners. From 1945 onwards, three out of every four pension claims had been successful, whilst after the First World War only one pension claim in three was allowed. Under the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1948, employees of a body representative of local authorities or of the officers of local authorities could be admitted “on suitable terms to the superannuation fund of a local authority.” In 1951, a comforts allowance was introduced that was automatically paid to war pensioners “receiving unemployability supplement and constant attendance allowance.” ...|$|E

Expatriates cost corporations three to five times more than local employees and the costs of expatriate failure can be high. It is therefore important for multinational corporations to attract and retain a competent and motivated cadre of expatriates. Since compensation {{plays an important role in}} employee motivation and retention, it is necessary to identify those remuneration aspects perceived to be important by expatriates. Experts in expatriate remuneration were interviewed to identify the variables that are important in expatriate remuneration. From these interviews, a questionnaire was designed, piloted and sent to expatriates in seven South African multinational companies. Conjoint analysis was used to examine the relative importance of the identified variables. The relative importance of these variables was also examined according to different demographic characteristics of the sample. The results show that of the compensation package variables, base salary is perceived to be the most important followed by benefits, currency in which the expatriate is paid, equity, taxation method, and lastly the cost of living adjustment. In terms of the different benefits and allowances, housing is perceived to be the most important followed by career opportunities of the assignment, education allowance, health benefits, partner assistance, <b>hardship</b> <b>allowance,</b> and finally foreign service premium...|$|E

Therefore, the problem of the study was the shortage of teacher’s on implementation of the Curriculum. The research design used in this study was cross –sectional survey aimed at collecting data from large number of samples of various categories at a particular time so as to describe the nature of the problem. The methods of date collection used were questionnaires, interview and documentary review. The major findings revealed in this research were as follows: the shortage of teachers seemed to be a major factor hindering the implementation of Curriculum as some subjects were taught effectively while other not taught at all, the shortage resulted into student indiscipline behavior where most of the time spent without teachers in classes is misused by student involving themselves in immoral behaviours such as love affairs. The researcher found that, the school administration used various strategies to alleviate the shortage of teachers such as the use of form six-leavers, part time teachers and remedial classes to reduce the problem.

In fact, {{there has been no}} change among the top tier. The score and ranking of the top 65 cities remain identical to six months ago. This may primarily reflect renewed stability as some economies begin to recover from the global economic crisis of a few years ago, although the continuing crisis in the euro zone and tighter fiscal budgets may have also slowed planned improvements, meaning that scores have remained static rather than moving up or down. The Liveability Ranking and Overview assesses living conditions in 140 cities around the world. A rating of relative comfort for 30 indicators is assigned across five broad categories: stability; healthcare; culture and environment; education; and infrastructure. The survey gives an overall rating of 0 - 100, where 1 is intolerable and 100 is ideal. The concept of liveability is simple: it assesses which locations around the world provide the best or the worst living conditions. Assessing liveability has a broad range of uses. The survey originated as a means of testing whether Human Resource Departments needed to assign a <b>hardship</b> <b>allowance</b> as part of expatriate relocation packages. While this function is still a central potential use of the survey, it has also evolved as a broad means of benchmarking cities.

Five objectives were set; the Teacher Pupils Ratio for remote and peripheral schools compared to urban schools against internal efficiency parameters such as, the dropout rate, the transition rate, the pass rate, and the repetition rates. Methodologically both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used for data collection and analysis. Focused group discussions (FGD), semi–structured interviews, questionnaires and unpublished documentary reviews were used as instruments for data collection. The {{results of this study}} show that there are wide TPR between Morogoro urban 1 : 48 and Mvomero district 1 : 58; concerning dropout rates there are differences between Morogoro Municipality and Mvomero district schools. In terms of repetition rate the findings indicate that there is difference of 15 per cent between Morogoro urban with an average of 37 per cent in Mvomero district schools with an average of 22 per cent for Morogoro municipality schools.

Specifically, the study intended to examine elements in the 1995 national Education and Training Policy (ETP) on job satisfaction to secondary school teachers; to assess perceptions of secondary school teachers on their job satisfaction; and to evaluate general views of community about secondary school teachers’ job satisfaction. The study was qualitative in nature and was supplemented by quantitative approach. The data were collected through questionnaire, interviews, observations and documentary review. However, secondary sources such as written materials like books were also used to collect data to supplement primary sources. A sample of 132 (N= 132) respondents were surveyed in Same District. The descriptive statistics techniques revealed that teachers were significantly dissatisfied with both monetary and non-momentary incentives. Furthermore, the study revealed that, except location of schools there were no significant differences in teachers’ job satisfaction in relation to other aspects of demographic data. The study shows that the unfulfilled strategies of the 1995 ETP on teachers’ working conditions were one of the factors that demoralize secondary school teachers in the District. This study proposes that national Education Policy makers should make strategies that the government can meet in the near future. Again, both policy makers and implementers of the policy should rely on Maslow’s theory of need to motivate secondary school teachers to the level of self-actualization.

40|$|The {{rural areas}} of many {{countries}} in Africa are affected by critical shortages of staff. One of the contributing factors to this problem is the poor distribution of the available health workers between rural and urban areas. Fortunately health policy managers {{in the region are}} trying to find means and ways of improving the availability of health workers in the rural areas. However in order for the health service managers to develop and implement effective policy options, {{it is important to understand}} the underlying assumptions of health workers decision to relocate to, stay in or leave the rural areas. It is the aim of this review to explore what health workers think can drive them to accept rural post and how governments have responded to their concerns focusing the ECSA region. Methods A literature review was conducted on factors which influence health workers decision to work in rural areas and government policies. Only English language materials which were published between 1990 and 2012 were searched. Documents were searched from PubMed, Google scholar, Global HRH resource centre and rural health Journal. Different terms in relation to attraction and retention of health workers in rural areas were used. Government and WHO web sites were also searched to find relevant policy documents therefore Grey and unpublished literature was included in the review. Snow bowling was mainly used to find relevant documents. The initial study produced 106 documents on preferences and choices of health workers which were examined and eventually 20 documents were included in the review. Results Despite the availability of evidence on the preferences and choices of health workers to relocate to, stay in or leave the rural areas, countries in the ECSA region do not respond favourably to the concerns raised by the health workers. Only Zambia has a comprehensive strategy which incorporated both financial and non-financial incentives however the scheme targeted doctors only. Few other countries which have the specific policies on rural retention are South Africa unfortunately; they only concentrated on <b>hardship</b> <b>allowances.</b> Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya do have the rural policies which are solely donor driven and are implemented in selected areas. In Malawi, the country failed to implement its hard to reach package due to poor economic environment and government failed to meet the cost of the strategies. Conclusion There is enough evidence in the ECSA region that health workers do not like working in the rural areas and governments have not responded favourably to the providers concerns. Factors influencing the decision to relocate or stay in the rural areas are very complex and interrelated. Knowledge of these factors is the first step towards the development of successful strategies because the knowledge will assist in the selection of best policy options according to context. There is no single solution to solve the problem of retention tit all depends on knowing what fits what at a particular situation. Continuous research in the area will assist health service managers to develop and implement strategies according to their context...|$|R
40|$|Background: Availability {{of human}} {{resource}} {{for health and}} its distribution to required areas is vital in delivering health care services, especially in rural areas. Deployment, attraction and retention of health workers in rural districts/areas have {{been a problem for}} a long period. Various incentives and benefits have been set by the government of Tanzania whereby employers are directed to provide those incentives to improve attraction and retention of health workers. However, its implementation and outcomes is not well explored. Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the implementation of the public health sector incentive scheme for attraction, deployment and retention of human resource for health in Newala district. Materials and methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in Newala district between March and May, 2010 using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. A total of 120 health workers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires, and an interview guide was used for key informants (4 district officials and three heads of facilities) in their respective workplaces. Results: Majority of health workers interviewed were not aware of their stipulated benefits and rights. Health workers who had heard about the govermnent documents stipulating health workers rights and benefits were 63. 3 %, while only 14. 5 % of those who had heard about the documents reported to had ever read such government documents. Both financial and non financial incentives were implemented but the overtime allowances were less implemented in rural health facilities as compared to urban health facilities. It was also found that majority of health workers had attended seminars (81. 7 %), while less than fifty percent had been promoted (33. 3 %), and went for leave (24. 2 %). Nurses {{were more likely to have}} had attended seminars than other cadres. Furthermore, district/health facility official reported that some of the incentives were specific to a certain cadres while some were for all health workers (e. g. overtime allowances). Majority of health workers who reported to had received non financial incentives were satisfied with those incentives which also was reported to create job satisfaction, however, those who reported to had received financial incentives were not satisfied with leave allowances hence created job dissatisfaction. Incentives preferred by health workers were overtime allowances, 	 	 Vlll improved working conditions and tools, while their leaders preferred to provide <b>hardship</b> <b>allowances</b> and housing. This study also revealed the factors affecting effective implementation of incentive scheme were shortage of funds and district lack authoritative power to implement. Conclusion and Recommendations: Majority of health workers interviewed were not aware of their benefits and rights. Both fmancial and non fmancial incentives were implemented but overtime allowances were less implemented in rural facilities. Health workers who reported to receive non fmancial incentives were satisfied with those incentives which also were reported to create job satisfaction. District and facilities leaders should give education to all health workers concerning their benefits and rights. Implementation of non fmancial incentives (e. g. recognition) should be emphasized.

In order to improve educational standards and particularly KCSE performance, in depth research, analysis and documentation of factors affecting KCSE performance is required that will enable educational stakeholders strategize towards better performance. The study aimed at identifying the most influential school based, socio-cultural and family’s economic and educational background factors affecting KCSE {{performance in}} Garissa District. A descriptive survey study design was used and questionnaires were used as the main instruments, this instrument was structured to have both open ended and closed ended questions. Simple random sampling technique was used to select the study samples which were seven public secondary schools. The researcher collected data from the DEO, head teachers, deputy head teachers, HODs, class teachers and students. After collecting data the researcher checked the questionnaires for completeness, accuracy and uniformity of the information obtained. Data was then coded and analyzed using SPSS to get the frequencies and percentages, and presented in tables. The findings of this research included the great extent to which school based factors affected KCSE performance such as lack of physical facilities in the school as reported by 70 % of the students, 83 % of the class teachers noted lack of students discipline, 96 % of the HODs expressed lack of teachers‟ motivation while 67 % of the deputy head teachers reported teacher’s availability and motivation, 83 % of the head teachers said lack of physical facilities in the school. The DEO mentioned teachers’ unavailability and lack of preparedness. The socio-cultural factors affected KCSE performance greatly such as religious beliefs as noted by 80 % of the students, 83 % of the class teachers said that preference for boys to girls especially in education matters, 98 % of the HODs expressed nomadism, 60 % of the deputy head teachers reported female genital mutilation while 67 % of the head teachers mentioned early marriages. The DEO noted female genital mutilation. Family economic and educational background factors greatly affected KCSE performance such as lack of parents‟ support and encouragement as mentioned by 69 % of the students, 65 % of the class teachers said family size, 88 % of the HODs expressed parents‟ level of education, 83 % of the deputy head teachers reported parents‟ poverty levels while 67 % of the head teachers noted source of income of parents. The DEO reported parents‟ poverty and educational levels. The study recommended {{that in order to}} improve KCSE performance, the government through TSC should employ more teachers and improve on their <b>hardship</b> <b>allowances</b> to attract and retain qualified teachers, as an incentive the government through the Joint Admissions Board (JAB) should lower university entry marks and review upwards the loans and bursaries allocated to university students from arid and semi–arid regions in order to motivate the students and to increase their access to higher education. The government through the law enforcements agents such as the police and the provincial administration should also eradicate drug and substance abuse and ensure that legal drugs such as Khat (Miraa) are only sold to adults of over 18 years. The parents should be educated on the modern methods of farming such as irrigation and zero grazing for those situated on river banks or drill boreholes to discourage staying away from homes for 3 - 4 months while looking for pasture and water for animals. The presence of parents at home will improve their support and encouragement to the students.

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{imbalance of}} the health workforce in Tanzania represents a serious problem {{when it comes to}} delivering crucial health services to a large share of the population. The Tanzanian health system, like many others in low-income countries, needs better incentive systems to attract dedicated workers to the health sector, to bring more qualified health workers to rural areas, and to induce them to use their knowledge and skills efficiently. However, creating better incentive and recruitment systems requires thorough knowledge of health workers’ motivations and preferences, as well as the relative valuations of different job attributes. The aim of this Ph. D. project has been to contribute to the base of knowledge about health workers’ individual motivations and preference structures. It has also been an important goal to examine how jobs with different characteristics can be matched with these preferences in order to provide high-quality health services on a larger scale. The first essay, ‘How to make rural jobs more attractive to health workers: findings from a discrete choice experiment in Tanzania’, published in ‘Health Economics’ (2010), provides new quantitative information about how health authorities can make jobs in rural areas more attractive to newly educated clinical officers. A data set stemming from a discrete choice experiment with clinical officer finalists in Tanzania is applied. The results show that offering additional education after a certain period of service {{is one of the most}} powerful recruitment instruments the authorities have available. Increased salaries and <b>hardship</b> <b>allowances</b> are also likely to substantially increase recruitment in rural areas. Offers of decent housing and good infrastructure, including the provision of equipment, can also increase recruitment to rural remote areas but not as much as higher wages and offers of education. In the second essay, ‘Mixed logit estimation of willingness to pay distributions: a comparison of models in preference and WTP space using data from a health-related choice experiment’, co-authored with Arne Risa Hole, different approaches to modelling the distribution of WTP are compared using mixed logit models and the same data set as in essay 1. The standard approach of specifying the distributions of the coefficients and deriving WTP as the ratio of two coefficients (estimation in preference space) is compared to specifying the distributions for WTP directly at the estimation stage (estimation in WTP space). The results suggest that sensitivity testing using a variety of model specifications, including estimation in WTP space, is highly recommended when using mixed logit models to estimate willingness to pay distributions. In the third essay, ‘How does additional education affect willingness to work in rural remote areas?: an application to health workers in a low-income context’, the main objective is to evaluate the effect of offering education opportunities as a strategy to recruit health workers to rural areas. A dataset capturing stated job preferences among freshly educated Tanzanian health workers with basic and more advanced clinical education is applied in order to investigate how additional education as an incentive mechanism affects the willingness to work in rural areas. In order to control for selection effects into the additional education scheme, the two cadres are matched on propensity scores. It turns out that the health workers with advanced clinical education would have been more likely to prefer a job in a rural remote area had they not received the advanced clinical education. The result goes a long way in suggesting that a policy aiming at recruiting health personnel with basic clinical education to rural remote areas by offering jobs that include possibilities of upgrading after a certain period of service, may be a temporary measure only. The fourth essay, “Pro-social preferences and self-selection into the public health sector: evidence from economic experiments” co-authored with Ida K. Lindkvist, studies the extent to which differences in pro-social preferences are related to career choices. We test whether preferences vary systematically between Tanzanian health worker students who prefer to work in the private health sector and those who prefer to work in the public health sector. Despite its important policy implications, this issue has received hardly any attention to date. By combining data from a questionnaire and two economic experiments, we find that students who prefer to work in the public health sector have stronger pro-social preferences than those who prefer to work in the private sector. We also show that the extent to which these students care about others can be conditional and linked to inequality aversion. A systematic selfselection of pro-socially motivated health workers into the public sector suggests that it is a good idea to have two sectors providing health services: this can ensure efficient matching of individuals and sectors by allowing employers in the two sectors to use different payment mechanisms tailored to attract and promote good performance from different types of health workers...|$|R
