Weekly Shonen <b>Jump</b> (initially named Weekly Shonen <b>Jump</b> Alpha) launched in January 2012 and is still in production. Based on Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump,</b> Weekly Shonen <b>Jump</b> is an attempt to provide English readers with easily accessible, affordable, and officially licensed editions of the latest installments of popular Shōnen <b>Jump</b> manga soon after their release in Japan, as an alternative to popular bootleg scanlation services.|$|E
5|$|A special side story, titled , was {{developed}} by Toriyama and published together with chapter 386 on August 31, 1992, in issue No. 36/37 of Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump.</b> Toriyama created a short series, Neko Majin, that became a self-parody of Dragon Ball. First appearing in August 1999, the eight-chapter series was released sporadically in Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> and Monthly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> until it was completed in 2005. These chapters were compiled into one kanzenban volume released on April 4, 2005.|$|E

5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and <b>jump</b> to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and <b>jump</b> height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double <b>jump</b> by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|Athletics {{events were}} held in the National Sports Center Athletics Stadium. Ana Katiloka {{represented}} Tonga in the triple <b>jump</b> event of athletics. This event took place on 11 September 2011. Katiloka's best <b>jump</b> in the event was 10.41m, and she finished last (eighth) in the final standings. The gold medal in this event was won by Nat Apikotoa of Australia with a best <b>jump</b> of 12.55m.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long <b>jump</b> and high <b>jump.</b> The first competition was the pentathlon. He won {{four of the five}} events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high <b>jump</b> final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place in the long <b>jump.</b> Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

40|$|The bachelor's thesis builds {{upon the}} study of <b>jumping</b> finite automata and {{introduces}} <b>jumping</b> finite transducers. <b>Jumping</b> finite automata are finite automata modified {{in such a way}} that symbols from the input tape are not read continuously from left to right but that the reading head can make moves on the input tape by <b>jumps.</b> <b>Jumping</b> finite transducers are finite transducers modified in a very similar way. In order to implement <b>jumping</b> finite automata and transducers, strictly deterministic versions of them were introduced by restricting the finite state control and by modification of the binary <b>jumping</b> relation. The thesis furthermore focuses on possible usage of <b>jumping</b> finite automata and transducers and on the description of the implementation of strictly deterministic <b>jumping</b> finite automata...|$|R
50|$|Notable players <b>jumped</b> to the Orioles {{from the}} rival National League (NL). In December 1901, Joe Kelley <b>jumped</b> from the Brooklyn Superbas.

Kip Selbach and Jim Jackson <b>jumped</b> from the New York Giants, Ernie Courtney <b>jumped</b> from the Boston Beaneaters, Tom Hughes <b>jumped</b> from the Chicago Orphans, and Dan McGann <b>jumped</b> from the St. Louis Cardinals. The Orioles signed Bill Keister {{as a free}} agent. With these transactions, the Orioles were seen as a {{contender}} in the AL pennant going into the 1902 season.|$|R

50|$|The {{team and}} {{individual}} eventing competitions {{used the same}} scores. Eventing consisted of a dressage test, a cross-country test, and a <b>jumping</b> test. The <b>jumping</b> test had two rounds. After the first <b>jumping</b> round, the teams results were determined. Both <b>jumping</b> rounds counted towards the individual results. Only the top 25 horse and rider pairs (including ties for 25th) after the first <b>jumping</b> round (adding the three components) competed in the second <b>jumping</b> round. However, each nation was limited {{to a maximum of}} three pairs qualifying for the second (final) <b>jumping</b> round.|$|R
50|$|Split <b>jumps</b> are a {{category}} of figure skating <b>jumps</b> in which the skater achieves a split position in the air.

5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long <b>jump</b> and triple <b>jump</b> areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes <b>jump</b> from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high <b>jump</b> is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|The long <b>jump</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and <b>jump</b> into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the <b>jump</b> then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern long <b>jump,</b> standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must <b>jump</b> before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
5|$|The manga began {{serialization}} in 2004 in the Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> magazine, {{published by}} Shueisha. Production {{of the series}} was suspended several times because of Hoshino's health. D.Gray-man made {{the transition from a}} weekly to a monthly series in November 2009, when it began serialization in <b>Jump</b> Square. On December 29, 2012, the series went on indefinite hiatus. It resumed serialization on July 17, 2015 after the release of <b>Jump</b> SQ.Crown, a spin-off from the magazine <b>Jump</b> SQ. The manga's chapters have been collected in twenty-five tankōbon volumes. By August 5, 2014, Viz Media had released 24 volumes in the United States.|$|E

Shueisha is also publishing the first {{chapters of}} Gin Tama online on their Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> official website. Viz Media licensed Gin Tama for publication in North America. A 55-page preview from the series was first featured in the January 2006 Shonen <b>Jump</b> issue. Viz acquired the license to publish chapters from the series in the Shonen <b>Jump</b> during the San Diego Comic-Con International in 2006. The chapters were serialized in Shonen <b>Jump</b> from January to May 2007 at a rate of one chapter a month.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, {{allowing}} them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to <b>jump</b> while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space <b>Jump</b> allows Samus to <b>jump</b> infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher <b>jump.</b> The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E
