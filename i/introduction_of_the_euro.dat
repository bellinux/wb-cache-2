5|$|The <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> {{has led to}} {{extensive}} {{discussion about}} its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in {{the population of the}} eurozone that the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro.</b> The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> to do so.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence {{may not have been}} linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
50|$|In late 2008, the i20 was introduced, {{replacing}} the Getz in most markets. In Europe, the Getz co-existed with the i20 {{until it was}} completely phased out in 2011. The Getz continued to be sold in the Australian market until December 2010. In India, the car was discontinued due to falling demand {{as compared to the}} warm response received by the i20 and <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>Euro</b> 4 emission norms from May 2010.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} <b>euro</b> {{took place}} on December 31, 2001. Welteke visited Berlin with his family for the celebration, and his hotel stay was paid for by Dresdner Bank. [...] In 2003, BMW, which owns a bank, paid for Welteke to spend a night on a yacht during the Monaco Grand Prix. [...] Controversy over these incidents led to Welteke resigning from Bundesbank in April 2004. The Christian Democratic Union, then an opposition party, alleged that the German Finance Ministry had leaked details of Welteke's hotel bill. The government denied the allegations.|$|R
5000|$|Following German {{unification}} in 1871, {{the country}} adopted the German gold mark (officially known {{just as the}} [...] "mark") as its currency in 1873. The name {{was taken from the}} mark banco. Initially, the coins and banknotes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various predecessor currencies, such as the , the , and the guilder, continued to circulate, and were treated as fixed multiples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new unit <b>of</b> account, similarly to <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> between 1999 and 2002. Coins denominated in gold marks were first issued in 1871, and gradually replaced the old coins. The mark banco was converted into the new gold mark at par. <b>The</b> Bank <b>of</b> Hamburg was incorporated as the Hamburg subsidiary into the newly founded [...] (established 1876), issuing banknotes denominated in gold marks.|$|R
5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E
5|$|As of January 2014, {{and since}} the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro,</b> {{interest}} rates of most members countries (particularly those with a weak currency), have decreased. The countries whose interest rates fell most {{as a result of}} the adoption of the euro are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. These very countries have had the most serious sovereign financing problems.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile is edible, as {{indicated}} by its alternative specific epithet edulis, and was known to the ancient Greeks; it is probably this species which they depicted on medals found at Agrigento, Sicily.

25|$|The Central Bank began {{production}} of euro coins in September 1999, producing over a billion coins, weighing about 5,000 tons, with a value <b>of</b> €230million before <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> into circulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> coins in January 2002. Production of euro banknotes began in June 2000, with 300million notes worth €4billion being produced in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 euros. Euro banknotes produced for the Central Bank are identified {{by having the}} serial number begin with the letter T. The Bank did not initially issue €200 or €500 notes, but has since begun to do so.|$|R
5|$|The euro was {{established}} by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict criteria, such as a budget deficit of less than three percent of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than sixty percent of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union {{which resulted in the}} <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might {{be the source of}} observed increase in trade.|$|E
5|$|Between 1982 and 1988 {{a series}} based on Irish {{architecture}} {{through the ages}} was released, with line drawings by Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish cultural heritage followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish birds feature in the 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency to the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Euro.</b> These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. On 9 September 2004 new stamps, featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland, become available.
