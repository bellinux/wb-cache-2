The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E

Buyers paid US$0.33 per kilogram, a price that kept the farmers poor.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the biggest}} steps, which is also controversial, is {{a new system of}} registrations, passports, and travel visas to control the flow of pilgrims.

Around {{the same time that}} pirates were invited to Port Royal, England {{launched}} a series of attacks against Spanish shipping vessels and coastal towns. By sending the newly appointed privateers after Spanish ships and settlements, England had successfully set up a system of defence for Port Royal.

25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{has never}} {{overruled}} its 1946 Yamashita decision.

25|$|Some {{stations}} that broadcast from smaller cities are private affiliates of the CBC, that is, stations which {{are owned by}} commercial broadcasters and air a predominantly CBC schedule. However, most affiliates of the English network opt out of some network programs to air local programming or more popular foreign programs acquired from other broadcasters. Private affiliates of the French network, {{all of which are}} located in Quebec, rarely <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> to provide alternate programming, and thus diverge from the main network schedule only for local newscasts. Such private affiliates are becoming increasingly rare, and there have been indications that the CBC plans to discontinue all affiliation agreements with non-CBC owned television stations in the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|Scania {{also has}} churches {{built in the}} gothic style, such as Saint Petri Church in Malmö, dating from the early 14th century. Similar {{buildings}} {{can be found in}} all Hansa cities around the Baltic Sea (such as Helsingborg and Rostock). The parishes in the countryside did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> for such extravagant buildings. Possibly the most notable countryside church is the ancient and untouched stone church in Dalby. It is the oldest stone church in Sweden, built around the same time as Lund cathedral. After the Lund Cathedral was built, many of the involved workers travelled around the province and used their acquired skills to make baptism fonts, paintings and decorations, and naturally architectural constructions.|$|E
25|$|The February Revolution (March 1917) was a {{revolution}} focused around Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), {{the capital of}} Russia at that time. In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament (the Duma) assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government which was heavily dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> to suppress the revolution, resulting in Nicholas's abdication. The soviets, which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution {{took place in the}} context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War (1914–18), which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny.|$|E

25|$|Phinehas is said {{never to}} have {{accepted}} {{an invitation to a}} meal and, after he had attained his majority, to have refused to eat at the table of his father.

Judah I once invited him to a meal, and exceptionally he decided to accept the invitation; but on arriving at the house of the patriarch he noticed in the yard mules of a certain kind the use of which was forbidden by local custom on account of the danger in handling them. Thereupon he retraced his steps and did not return (Hul. l.c.).|$|E
25|$|For Fitzpatrick, {{the key to}} {{establishing}} financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, {{in addition to the}} production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} the large {{quantity}} of prisoners stemmed from the Austrian command decision that captivity in Italy was preferable to starvation at home. After the armistice, {{hundreds of thousands of}} Austrian soldiers without weapons, food and discipline made their way home through the alpine valleys. The alpine villages were caught between the retreating, half-starved soldiers who repeatedly resorted to theft and robbery to survive, and the advancing Italian army. At the same time, great numbers of Italian war prisoners were making their way south towards their homeland. Austria did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> to guarantee the orderly retreat of its own army or the organized return of Italian war prisoners. In the meantime, Italian occupation of Tyrol was going as planned. On 11 November, Italian troops occupied the Brenner Pass and the Pass at Toblach. To secure access to the Inn valley, crucial for an advance into southern Germany, Innsbruck, capital of Tyrol, and the village Landeck were occupied as well. On 10 January 1919, the commander of the 3rd army corps, Gen. Ugo Sani, was appointed military governor of northern Tyrol with residence in Innsbruck.|$|E
