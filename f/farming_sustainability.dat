40|$|The {{traditional}} approach for assessing <b>farm</b> <b>sustainability</b> (based on indicators of “productivity”, “profitability”, and “financial dependency”) fails {{to explain why}} there exist highly sustainable farms with different levels of “efficiency” such as low productive subsistent and part-time farming, non-for profit and cooperative enterprises, small commercial farms and large agro-corporations, etc. In this paper we adapt the New Institutional and Transaction Costs Economics perspective to agrarian sphere, and suggest a new framework for assessing <b>sustainability</b> of <b>farms</b> and farm structures. Firstly, an analysis is made on various approaches for defining sustainability of agricultural systems: as “an ideology”, as “a set of strategies”, as “the ability to fulfill a set of goals”, and as “ability to continue”. The “problem of sustainability” in the economic model (mainly associated with “negative externalities”, “tragedy of commons”, “jointness of farm production”) is also presented, and the “institutional” solutions of that problem discussed. Second, we prove that analysis of institutions and transacting costs is important for proper understanding the <b>farms</b> <b>sustainability.</b> Institutional environment is the crucial factor, which determines the restrictions and costs of farm activities, and eventually - the level of <b>sustainability</b> of different <b>farm</b> organizations. In the specific institutional setting, agrarian agents use (or develop) {{a great variety of}} effective (cost economizing) market and non-market modes for governing of their exchanges. Therefore, studying the farm as a governance (rather than production) structure is the key for understanding the <b>farm</b> efficiency and <b>sustainability.</b> Third, we define <b>sustainability</b> of <b>farm</b> as a state when it manages all transactions in the most economical way – that is the situation when there exist no transaction, which could be carried out with net benefit. When a farm experiences high costs and difficulties meeting institutional restrictions and carrying out transactions, comparing to other feasible modes, it will be unsustainable. That is because there will be strong incentives for exploring the existing potential (adapting to sustainable state) through reduction or enlargement of farm size, or via reorganization or liquidation of the farm. Thus the farm potential for adaptation to changing (market, institutional, technological etc.) environment is to be the main indicator for <b>farm</b> <b>sustainability.</b> Furthermore, the most effective form for organization of farm transactions will depend on individuals’ characteristics (preferences, entrepreneurial abilities, risk aversion etc.) and specific attributes of each transaction (uncertainty, frequency, assets specificity, and appropriability). Consequently, effective farms of different type and size could persist (sustain) in agriculture. Finally, we develop a principle matrix with the effective modes for governing of agrarian sustainability. Discrete structural analysis is used to define the transactions for which market, contract, and integral forms are efficient (sustainable). We also determine the situation(s), where there is strong need for a third-party public involvement in agrarian sphere - that is for transactions with low appropriablity, and high uncertainty and asset specificity. In later case, there are no sustainable market and private modes to organize such transactions effectively (e. g. supply of environmental goods). Next, we specify the spectrum of possible public forms for intervention in market and private transactions - assistance, regulation, hybrid and in-house organization, international cooperation, property rights and institutional modernization. The comparative efficiency of feasible modes for public involvement is to be assessed taking into account the overall costs and benefits. Sustainable agrarian development is compromised when both market and private forms fails, and no effective public intervention takes place. assessing <b>farm</b> <b>sustainability,</b> governing of agrarian and <b>farm</b> <b>sustainability,</b> new institutional and transaction costs economics...|$|R

The {{issue of}} {{governance}} {{and evaluation of}} <b>sustainability</b> of <b>farming</b> enterprise like individual and family farms, agro-companies, agro-cooperatives, etc. {{is among the most}} discussed among researchers, farmers, investors, politicians, interests groups and public at large. Despite the significant development of the theory and practice in that new area still there is no common understanding on “what is (how to define) <b>sustainability</b> of <b>farming</b> enterprises?”, „what is the difference and relations between farm and agrarian sustainability?“, “which are the critical factors of <b>sustainability</b> of <b>farming</b> enterprises?”, “which are the governing mechanisms and forms for farms sustainability?”, “how to select the most-efficient forms for governing of farms sustainability?”, and “how to evaluate the <b>sustainability</b> level of <b>farming</b> enterprises” in a dynamic world, where hardly there is anything actually “sustainable. This paper tries to give answer to all these questions. First, evolution of the “concept” of <b>sustainability</b> of <b>farming</b> enterprises is initially analyzed and discussed. On that base is suggested adequate definition of <b>farming</b> enterprise’ <b>sustainability</b> as ability of a particular farm to maintain its governance, economic, social and ecological functions in a long term. After that principle mechanisms and modes of governance of <b>sustainability</b> of <b>farming</b> enterprise are specified, including institutional environment, market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes. Following applicable for the contemporary conditions of the development of Bulgarian agriculture framework for assessing the <b>farm</b> <b>sustainability</b> level is suggested. The later includes a system of appropriate principles, criteria, indicators, and reference values, which characterize the governance, economic, ecological and social aspects of <b>farms</b> <b>sustainability</b> as well as approach for their integration and interpretation.

Assessment was supported by qualitative analysis aimed to highlight the stakeholders’ perspectives in understanding environmental effects and in promoting energy crops local development. Perspectives were evaluated through a stakeholders’ involvement approach. We found that environmental impacts are not among the priority motivations that lead farmers to practice these energy crops. Afterwards, some farmers’ profiles were estimated through the Multiple Correspondence Analysis. We found that perspectives on positive environmental effects caused by energy crops are strongly related to positive expectations on their introduction into local cropping systems. Finally, we focused attention on assessing the environmental sustainability associated to substitution of some traditional crops with energy crops in Sardinia.

A methodology was developed to identify agri-environmental indicators of the environmental, economic and social dimensions of the farming systems. The criteria used for selecting sustainability indicators were policy relevance, measurability, validity/analytical soundness, level of aggregation/communication to the user. Based on these criteria indicators were selected for natural, financial, physical, human, and social capital assets. The research identified 'external' indicators, those relevant to researcher/policy makers, and 'internal' indicators, those relevant to the resource users. The two sets were combined and data relevant to the selected indicators were collected from secondary sources and also direct from farmers through a small-scale sample survey. After analysing the data, indicators were selected for each capital asset to generate a multi-criteria assessment of sustainability at three scales: farm, local and regional.
