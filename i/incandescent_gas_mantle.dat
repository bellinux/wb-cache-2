2500|$|Identified by the EPA in 1980, the Welsbach/General Gas Mantle site {{contained}} {{soil and}} building materials contaminated with radioactive materials. [...] Radiation became prominent when the companies used thorium, a radioactive material withdrawn from monazite ore, {{in the production}} of their <b>gas</b> <b>mantles.</b> [...] In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Welsbach Company was located in Gloucester City, which borders Camden, and was a major producer of <b>gas</b> <b>mantles</b> until <b>gas</b> lights were replaced by electric lights. [...] The fabric of the Welsbach <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> was put into a solution that consisted of 99% thorium nitrate and 1% cerium nitrate in distilled water, causing it to emit a white light.

50|$|The {{excess of}} {{hydrogen}} in a coal, above the amount necessary to combine with its oxygen to form water, {{is known as}} disposable hydrogen, and {{is a measure of}} the fitness of the coal for use in the manufacture of coal gas. Such coal, although of very small value as fuel, commands a specially high price for gas-making. Cannel coal was used as a major feedstock for the historical manufactured gas industry, as the gas produced from it was valuable for lighting due to the luminosity of the flame it produced. Cannel gas was widely used for domestic lighting throughout the 19th century before the invention of the <b>incandescent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> by Carl Auer von Welsbach in the 1880s. Following the introduction of the gas mantle, cannel coal lost favour as a manufactured gas feedstock as the gas mantle could produce large quantities of light without regard for the flame luminosity of the gas burnt.|$|E

50|$|In 1540 John Leland {{reported}} that Sir Roger Bradshaigh {{had discovered a}} seam of cannel coal on his estate which could be burnt or carved by hand or machine into ornaments. It was an excellent fuel, easily lit, burned with a bright flame and left virtually no ash. It was widely used for domestic lighting in the early 19th century before the <b>incandescent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> was available but lost favour when coal gas made it obsolete. The cannel coal was mined from Tudor times but by the mid-1600s the mines were wet and started flooding. To remedy this, between 1653 and 1670, Sir Roger Bradshaw built a sough or adit, the Great Haigh Sough which ran for about a mile under his estate. It still drains water from the ancient workings. The Bradshaws successors, the Earls of Crawford and Balcarres, founded the Wigan Coal and Iron Company in 1865. Collieries in Haigh belonging the Wigan Coal and Iron Company in 1896 were the Alexandra, Bawkhouse, Bridge, Lindsay and Meadow Pits.|$|E
50|$|The model town of Saltaire was founded, {{along with}} others, as a planned {{environment}} with good sanitation and many civic, educational and recreational facilities, although it lacked a pub, which {{was regarded as}} a focus of dissent. During the Victorian era, science grew into the discipline it is today. In addition to the increasing professionalism of university science, many Victorian gentlemen devoted their time to the study of natural history. This study of natural history was most powerfully advanced by Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution first published in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859.Although initially developed {{in the early years of}} the 19th century, gas lighting became widespread during the Victorian era in industry, homes, public buildings and the streets. The invention of the <b>incandescent</b> <b>gas</b> <b>mantle</b> in the 1890s greatly improved light output and ensured its survival as late as the 1960s. Hundreds of gasworks were constructed in cities and towns across the country. In 1882, incandescent electric lights were introduced to London streets, although it took many years before they were installed everywhere.|$|E
