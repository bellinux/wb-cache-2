40|$|Of the 229 mature (> 50 cm) cod {{that were}} tagged with plastic marker tags (‘Howitts’), 18 (~ 8 %) have been recaptured to date. Due {{to the small}} numbers of returns, little more than is already known can be {{concluded}} about the movement or behaviour of eastern Channel cod or about the possible interactions between cod in ICES VIId and ICES IVc. Figure 1 : Numbers of tagged cod recaptured by <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle.</b> Of the 18 recaptures reported, 12 were made between January and March 2007, and the remaining six between April and December 2007. During the spawning period (January – March), three tagged fish were recaptured in ICES rectangles adjacent to that {{in which they were}} released (30 F 0), one of which was recaught in ICES area IVc (Figure 1). The time at liberty ranged from 3 to 316 days (Figure 2), and the age was determined for 12 fish: eight were 2 years old and four were 3 {{years old at the time}} of recapture. For those fish for which the recapture position is known, 16 (Figure 1), 12 were recaptured in the <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle</b> of their release (30 F 0), 9 in January 1 and February 2007, of which 6 spent < 10 days at liberty, and the other three fish were caught later, in May and October 2007 (Figure 1 and 2). This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that cod tagged in spring disperse both eastwards and westwards, and spend the summer on feeding grounds in the western Channel and southern/central North Sea (Pawson, 1995; Righton et al., 2007) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies based {{mainly on}} {{research}} survey {{data suggest that}} within the North Sea, sole Solea solea and plaice Pleuronectes platessa have exhibited distribution shifts in recent decades—on average southward for sole and northward to deeper waters for plaice. Various hypotheses may account for such shifts, including climate change effects and more intensive fishing in southern and shallower waters; but the relatively short time-span of datasets analysed so far (~ 3 decades) has complicated the separation of these two effects. We have made use of a unique dataset of catch and effort data for British North Sea trawlers; these cover nine decades (spanning the period 1913 – 2007) and are spatially detailed by <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle</b> (0. 5 ° latitude by 1 ° longitude). We quantify, for the first time, long-term distribution changes of North Sea sole and plaice over a period approaching a century, and demonstrate that the distribution shift in plaice was attributable to climate change rather than to fishing, but that both climate and fishing {{played a role in}} the distribution shift of sole.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a European Union (UE) contract and with voluntary participation of commercial fishing vessels, a discard sampling programme based on stratified random sampling by fisheries covered the activities of trawl and long line Spanish fleets fishing in ICES Subarea VII in 1994. Discards of commercial and non-commercial species, including species of pinnipeds, cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds, caught incidentally were estimated in kg per fishing hour by <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle</b> and depth stratum in 1994. The sampling programme was carried out by observers on board commercial fishing vessels during normal fishing activity. A total of 238 species caught by trawlers and 76 by long liners were determined. The comparison of the two fleets regarding their ratios of discards in 1994 shows that the larger percentages of discards relative to total catches are found in the trawl fisheries (48 %) and around 50 % are primarily due to the discards of three species of fish and one of crustacea. Seasonal variation in the case of discards of the two main species (Great Silver Smelt and Horse Mackerei) was observed. The depth at which discards were hig lies between 200 and 400 m. Conversely, long line fishing in Subarea VII shows a lower discard rate than that of trawlers (10 %). Approximately 60 % of discards primarily comprise two species of fish, Blue Whiting and Great Silver Smelt, both of which show the highest discard value per f. h. in the 3 rd quarter. No differences were observed by depth strata...|$|E
40|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} {{vulnerable}} to fisheries exploitation because of late maturation and low fecundity, highlighting the need for effective conservation strategies. Area closures have been proposed as an appropriate management option for thornback rays in the southern North Sea, where they appear to form local subpopulations between which there is limited mixing. To gain a fishery-independent estimation of stock distribution, 197 thornback rays Raja clavata tagged with electronic data storage tags (DST) were released in the Thames Estuary in 1999 and 2000. The tidal location method was used to estimate the positions of individual fish between time of release and recapture. The fishery-independent seasonal stock distributions were integrated with landings data and a simple model was developed to estimate monthly fishing effort per International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (<b>ICES)</b> <b>rectangle</b> by different fleets and gear types. The potential impacts of closed area management, in terms of reducing thornback ray mortality in the southern North Sea, were calculated. Spatial closures were applied either (i) as permanent closures of individual ICES rectangles or (ii) seasonally, {{at the level of}} the Thames Estuary. Catch reductions were calculated allowing for the redistribution of fishing effort. The results confirmed the importance of the Thames Estuary for thornback rays. However, 77 % of rays moved outside the estuary over winter, with seasonal migration into the Thames to spawn between March and August. The effects of closures varied between areas and gear types. Permanent closures of individual ICES rectangles were less effective at reducing fishing mortality on rays than a spring or summer closure of the Thames Estuary as a whole, which would have a major impact on the commercially more valuable sole fishery. Synthesis and applications. The results presented illustrate the potential impacts of a range of closure scenarios, prior to their implementation, as a basis for advice on sustainable exploitation of thornback rays. These models could be further refined by additional studies of juvenile behaviour and of other ray subpopulations in the southern North Sea...|$|E
40|$|Contributor: Svein A. IversenThe 2005 {{meeting of}} SGFI {{was reduced to}} a one-day meeting due to {{untoward}} weather condi-tions prevailing in Stavanger during arrival. As a result some of the presentations were given and discussed before the Chair and other members arrived. The starting point of SGFI was the intention to evaluate the North Sea Stocks Survey (Fishers Survey), to examine its suitability for incorporation in the fish stock assessment procedure and, if possible, to come up with proposals for improvement. The main conclusion for the Fishers Survey is that it should be continued and quantitative results can only be expected after a couple of more years, when trends become conspicuous and can be correlated with assessment outputs. Extensive discussions on the format of advice and what is presented in the Working Group Reports led to the conclusion that it is of prime importance to better explain what information has been used in the assessment process and why certain information was not used. This espe-cially holds for the CPUE and LPUE data which in some assessments are used, in others not. It was repeatedly outlined that in some cases the trend in CPUEs could have indicated at a relatively early stage that assessments go wrong. The fishery offers offensively their support and data, at least as a tool for the assessment biologists to check whether their perception of the stock developments coincide or contradict the field experience of the fishery. In this con-text it was pointed out that for some stocks the fishery provides detailed information on haul positions on the log-book sheets, this data seems however to get lost in the process of data processing, to the effect that the data are simplified and pooled back on the <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle</b> level, thus valuable information is getting lost. The meeting then concentrated on the discussion and evaluation of the achievements of the three years of cooperation. It was concluded that SGFI was a valuable initiative and should in {{one way or the other}} continue, not however, in form of the Study Group as has been so far. The NSC will initiate a steering group to meet and design a platform for continuation of the cooperation possibly under the realm of the North Sea RAC. Other ways, including financing though the COM will also be explored...|$|E
40|$|Contributor: Are DommasnesIt {{has been}} several years since ICES has {{completed}} {{a comprehensive review}} of the effects of fishing on the North Sea ecosystem, and this year our ToR (Section 3) has allowed us to revisit this important topic. We have reviewed the impacts of each of the major gears in terms of their effects on all components of the ecosystem, {{and for the first time}} since 1995 have described the international distribution of fishing effort of beam trawls, otter trawls (including seine gears), and small-meshed fisheries throughout the North Sea. Compilation of such data at an international level, and at the scale of the <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle,</b> was a frustrating task and was fraught with problems of data compatibility and quality. ICES will need to plan carefully if such an advisory request should come from an external customer, and in section 7 we consider ICES readiness to provide advice to the Regional Advisory Councils, and have included lessons learnt from our work on this ToR. Last year WGECO identified the need for fully Integrated Ecosystem Assessments to link manageable human activities with the pressures they cause in the marine ecosystem. The matrix of pressures and components of the ecosystem provides a useful tool for prioritising the key interactions in the ecosystem, and a weighting system was developed based on the spatial extent (local or widespread) and intensity of the interaction (chronic or acute) (section 4). Indicators which might be appropriate for managing the human activities responsible for these pressures were identified. In our 2005 Report we presented a detailed analysis of how ecosystem effects of fishing could be included into the provision of routine fisheries advice. In turn, SGMAS considered our proposals and Section 5 continues this dialogue. We identify ecosystem considerations that should be taken into account in an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, and suggest that these should be part of routine activities not an optional extra. WGECO feels that this would be an attitude consistent with good risk management practices applied in many other fields. Where knowledge or data are inadequate, we clarify the work that needs to be undertaken so that improvements can be made. WGECO has advised on the development and implementation of the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) approach in OSPAR for several years, and feels that ICES is now in a position to provide clear advice on a way forward with implementing the EcoQO on changes in the proportion of large fish in the fish community (section 6). This EcoQ element, as measured in research trawls, is a useful indicator of the effect of fishing, a useful state indicator for the fish community and is indicative of wider changes in the biodiversity of the ecosystem. WGECO concluded that the EcoQO can be further progressed as part of an objectives-based management framework and so has defined a goal for the fish community to Halt as rapidly as possible, and begin to reverse by 2010, both the decline in the mean weight and the proportion of large fish. Large fish were defined as those greater than 30 cm in length, and short, medium and long-term operational targets were suggested. In the short-term it is suggested that the decline in proportion of these fish size measures in survey catches should be halted immediately. In the medium term, targets for fish size should be based on the time necessary to restore fish populations to conditions in the early 1980 s when ICES generally considered stocks to be sustainable. In the longer term, targets could be revised using improved information on the ecological consequences of an over-fished fish community and societal choices for more or less ambitious conservation objectives. ICES have begun a dialogue with the Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) to develop an understanding of their requirements for advice and how this advice might be provided. In section 7 we provide a summary of the ecosystem effects of fishing for all components relevant to the North Sea RAC (based on work in section 3), and extend this approach to the other RACs. Although not comprehensive, it highlighted the many interactions between fisheries and ecosystems for which ICES lacks knowledge to provide quality advice. While many effects can be generalised across the region, most specific studies relate to the North Sea and Baltic Sea, and in many cases, the extent of the effect will depend on the nature and scale of the fishing activity in an area. ICES currently lacks the capacity to deal with geographically referenced data and this skill will become increasingly important as advice is requested on a range of geographically-related fisheries management measures. This year WGECO continued to assist the Regional Ecosystem Group for the North Sea (REGNS) in their work on an Integrated Assessment (section 8). In our review of the dataset used by the working group we found a number of inconsistencies and anomalous data entries which may have affected the outcome of their analyses. We also reviewed the coverage of the ecosystem components in the database supplied to us and suggested taxa and components which have important roles in ecosystem function, and which could be used in future. Comments were also made on the analytical approach adopted by REGNS to encourage wider discussion of the methods used for Integrated Assessment and in their later thematic assessments...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this report is to present the science {{developed}} within the VECTORS project to improve {{the understanding of the}} key processes driving the behaviour of human agents utilising a variety of EU maritime domains. While particular {{attention has been paid to}} the spatial interactions between fishing activities and other human uses (e. g., maritime traffic, offshore wind parks, aggregate extractions), the behaviour of non-fishing sectors of activity has also been considered. Various quantitative and semi-qualitative approaches have been pursued to gain better insight into behavioural drivers based on past data, and also forecast how human agents would react if access was constrained by either management (e. g. Marine Protected Areas – MPA), or the installation of a new operator. This report covers the North Sea and Eastern Channel, and also one area of the Baltic Sea: the Gdansk Bay. Fine-scale catch and effort data by fishing vessel, fishing trip, gear used and <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle</b> visited have been made available for the French, Dutch, English and German fleets. The VECTORS WP 2. 3 team has also collected data from the non-fishing sectors of activity, in particular, aggregate extractions and maritime traffic. The objective of collecting data for non-fishing sectors is to produce a Spatial Overlap Metric measuring the constraint exerted by other sectors of activity on fishing. Comprehensive aggregate extraction and shipping intensity metrics could then be derived dynamically at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. For the other sectors potentially competing for space with fishing (e. g., wind farms, oil/gas extractions, aquaculture), and also for protected areas, a static overlap metric has been set to the surface occupied by the plant or area protected. In order to apply common methodologies and codes across different case studies, whilst abiding by confidentiality issues around these data, it has been decided to develop a common exchange format to collate the data used in subsequent analyses; five tables have then been produced. Two complementary types of approaches have been carried out to analyse and/or model the mechanisms of human behaviour, which are hereby referred to as quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative research consisted of analysing fishing decision-making processes based on existing data and then making forecasts building on scenarios, while qualitative research consisted of interviewing stakeholders from different sectors of activity to get their views on both their past and likely future behaviour. Different methodological approaches have been pursued by different institutes, and these were applied to several case studies wherever possible. Modelling the current and past dynamics of fishing vessels: The understanding of the dynamics of fishing vessels is of great interest to define sustainable fishing strategies and to characterize the spatial distribution of the fishing effort. It is also a prerequisite to anticipate changes in fishermen’s strategy in reaction to management rules, the economic context or the evolution of exploited resources. In this context, analysis of individual vessel's trajectories offers promising perspectives to describe behaviour during fishing trips. A hidden Markov model with two behavioural states (steaming and fishing) was developed to infer the sequence of non-observed fishing vessel behaviour along the vessels' trajectory based on GPS records. Conditionally to the behaviour, vessels movements were modelled by a discrete time solution of a (continuous time) stochastic differential equation on vectorial speeds. The model's parameters and the sequence of hidden behavioural states were estimated using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, coupled with the Viterbi algorithm that captures the most credible joint sequence of hidden states. A simulation approach was performed, that outlined the importance of contrast between the model’s parameters as well as the influence of path length to allow good estimation performances. The model was then fitted to four original GPS tracks recorded with a time step of 15 minutes derived from voluntary fishing vessels operating in the Channel within the IFREMER's RECOPESCA project. Results showed differences in parameter estimation depending on the gear used, on both the speeds during fishing operations and the Markovian transitions between behaviours. Results also suggested the benefits of future inclusion of variables such as tidal currents within the ecosystem approach of fisheries. Hidden Markov models are well suited to describe jointly fishing boat movement and associated fishing activities. They allow us to estimate the sequence of activities (i. e. fishing, travelling) along a trajectory, as well as the movement parameters (speed, turning angle) associated with each activity. Normally, these models are developed to characterize the spatial dynamics of fishing vessels that belong to a specific fishery with a given métier. However, because of the large variability that exists in fishing practices, some adaptations in the modelling structure are needed when the spatial dynamics of one or several fishing fleets present a mixture of métiers with distinct traits of movement and trajectory. A procedure was developed to capture the variability of fishing practices and associated vessel trajectories. Fishing trips were characterized by their métiers, which were identified for each gear by clustering landing profiles (in value). Fishing boat trajectories were described using movement parameters (speed, acceleration, turning angles, straightness) estimated from GPS positions recorded along the tracks. A principal component analysis was performed to provide a detailed description of the different trajectory patterns in relation with fishing trip specificities (i. e. vessel, gear, métier). Hidden Markov models were then fitted for some selected fishing trips. Two types of models were considered. The basic one was a 2 states model with behavioural activities corresponding to fishing and traveling. The second one presented a number of fishing states depending on the number of métiers identified for the trip. Fitting performance was compared based on DIC and estimated confidence intervals for the parameters. This procedure was applied to a set of volunteer vessels participating in the RECOPESCA project from IFREMER in the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel for years 2011 - 2012. We show that fishing trip activities, such as métiers, were structuring variables for trajectories, which helped to specify properly hidden Markov models. Discrete choice models building in a random utility function (RUMs) have also been used to aid understanding and modelling of fleet dynamics and to anticipate how fishing effort is re-allocated following any permanent or seasonal closure of fishing grounds, given the competition for space with other active maritime sectors. A first Random Utility Model (RUM) was developed and initially applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the French demersal mixed fleet fishing in the Eastern English Channel. The spatial resolution of this investigation was that of an <b>ICES</b> <b>rectangle</b> (30 ’ x 60 ’). The explanatory variables chosen were past effort i. e. experience or habit, previous catch to represent previous success, % of area occupied by spatial regulation, and by other competing maritime sectors. Results showed that fishers tended to adhere to past annual fishing practices, except for the fleet targeting molluscs which exhibited within year behaviour influenced by seasonality. Furthermore, results indicated generally that maritime traffic may impact negatively on fishing decision. Finally, the model was validated by comparing predicted re-allocation of effort against observed effort, for which there was a close correlation. The method was also applied to the Dutch beam trawl fleet (2008 - 2010). The Dutch fleets’ activity was well captured by the model which included only biological and economic drivers. Predictions were accurate and followed the seasonal patterns well. To predict the long term changes in fishing activity additional factors, such as the competition for space with other marine users, should be included and changes in fish distribution should be linked to the current model. A second Random Utility Model (RUM) was developed using a finer spatial resolution (15 ’ x 15 ’) and initially applied to analyse the determinants of English and Welsh scallop-dredging fleet behaviour, including competing sectors operating in the eastern English Channel. Results show that aggregate activity, maritime traffic, expected costs, English inshore 6 and French sovereign 12 mile nautical limits negatively impact the choice of fishers, and conversely that past success, expected revenues and fishing within the 12 nautical mile limit have a positive effect on their utility. The model has potential application for Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). This RUM was also used to evaluate the interactions of fishing effort allocation and shipping for the Dutch demersal fleet fishing in the English Channel, this analysis of the French and UK fleets was also undertaken for Dutch seiners operating in the Eastern Channel. The parameters associated with the gross revenue all had positive parameter estimates for the means, as is expected from fishers seeking to maximise net revenues. The parameters associated with costs were also positive, which is striking, given that one would expect a cost minimization. The positive estimates could be caused by the trips to Dutch harbours that are in the data set. The closed area parameters are both negative, reflecting the fact that fishing is not allowed in these areas. The parameters associated with the shipping lanes had negative estimates, as in the French and English case, but these estimates did not differ significantly from zero. Other spatially-explicit statistical analyses have been conducted to evaluate, separately, the impacts of aggregate extraction and maritime traffic. In terms of marine aggregate extractions, the effects were investigated of both aggregate extraction intensity and the proximity to dredging sites on the distribution of fishing effort, for a broad selection of French and English demersal fleets operating in the Eastern Channel. The most striking result was that for most of the fishing fleets and aggregate extraction sites, neither dredging intensity, nor the proximity to the extraction site, had a deterring effect on fishing activities. To the contrary, the fishing effort of dredgers and potters could be larger in the vicinity of marine aggregates sites than in their neighbourhood and also positively correlated to extraction intensity with a lag of 0 to 6 months. The fishing effort distribution of French netters was overall space-invariant over the whole time period under investigation. However, it is important to note that the fishing effort of netters has increased substantially in the impacted area of the Dieppe site (where it is correlated to dredging intensity with a lag of 6 months), whilst remaining almost constant in the intermediate and reference areas. The attraction of fishing fleets is likely due to a local and temporary concentration of their main target species. However, knowledge on the vulnerability and life-history characteristics of these species to aggregate extractions suggests that over-extending the licensed areas would be detrimental to them and to their related fisheries in the longer term. In relation to maritime traffic, we investigated whether fishermen’s effort and catch information could be used to inform on species distributions and if the observed effort (and catches) could be constrained by other activities, such as maritime traffic. In this first attempt to correlate fish distribution observed during a scientific survey and fishing catches via linkage of VMS and logbooks data there was a good correlation between the observed biomass in October by a scientific survey and fishing location targeting the different demersal species in the Eastern Channel. Fleets seem attracted by areas identified to have high abundance densities. For most of the species, maritime traffic seems to be a perturbation for the fishing activities. However, in the case of the red mullet fishery, vessels seem to avoid traffic lanes except when they expect high fish densities. They then may take the risk of fishing inside the traffic lanes or in areas of high marine traffic densities. Eliciting the perspectives of fishers: To validate the outcomes of fleet dynamics models a survey was undertaken of French and Dutch fishers operating in the Eastern Channel and in the German Bight. In the Eastern Channel, French fishers did not feel constrained in the amount of space they had available for fishing. The one who did, cited Natura 2000 and shipping lanes as constraining factors, and said this directly influenced his fishing patterns. Four agreed that they conflicted at times with other fishers (all Dutch purse seiners) over space while one mentioned conflicts with coast guards. One also cited aggregate extraction (when completed) as resulting in no fishing anymore in that area. In the German Bight, Dutch fishers considered that their fishing ground in the German Bight shrank in the past 10 years. They have to fish more intensively now on less available fishing grounds. They have to face sometimes unsafe situations near oil rigs and wind farms. Finally, fishers do not think they have any influence on the increase of competition for space but would like to have more. Closed areas (including real time closures), wind farms and Natura 2000 areas have restricted their activities spatially as well as, to a lesser degree, oil rigs, shipping, and mussel cultures. -German Bight Dutch fishers earn less and catch less targeted species. They have to adapt their fishing pattern. It is crowded now and less safe. Fishers expect more large-area restrictions of a permanent character in the near future in the German Bight but will continue fishing since they feel they have no choice. Interviews were also conducted with representatives of the main sectors of activity (including fishing but also non-fishing sectors) in the Eastern Channel, the Dogger Bank and the Gdansk Bay. The pressure on spatial usage of European regional seas by various stakeholder groups is intense. In all case study sites, the majority of stakeholders feel this pressure will only increase in the future, primarily due to proposals and plans for offshore wind farms, the newest entrants to these busy seas. In some case study areas, such as the eastern English Channel and Dogger Bank, applications have already been approved with construction planned; in the German Bight wind farms already exist and at least in the Dutch part new proposals have been made. In others, such as the Gulf of Gdansk, such developments are further away, and unlikely to happen soon due to legal constraints, yet the uncertainty of impacts, such as on fishing, is a cause of great concern. Of all the stakeholder groups, the fisheries group was the only one addressed by all surveys and thus can be compared across all case study areas: eastern English Channel, the Dogger Bank, the German Bight, and the Gulf of Gdansk. Fishing is one of the oldest activities in all four of the case study areas and though fishers in each area tend to use different gears and face different pressures, there are a number of similarities among them. These pressures include: regulatory pressures, competition with other users, and area restrictions. Modelling the future dynamics of fishing vessels: Having analysed the key determinants of fishers’ and other stakeholders’ decision-making behaviour, the future effects of increased resource-based competition (resulting from a discard ban combined with restrictive individual fish quotas) or of new area-based constraints (e. g., implementation of new wind farms or enforcement of new legally-binding closed areas) were evaluated in the short- and/or the long-term using bio-economic models. The short-term economic effect of implementing wind farms in combination with closed areas was studied in the North Sea using an Individual Stress Level Analysis (ISLA). In this study we used the spatial data of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) coupled with logbooks to assess the stress potentially caused by closure of fishing areas. The stress was expressed in financial terms as the percentage of current revenue obtained from catch coming from areas to be closed. It is therefore not a loss but more a measure of the level of reallocation of fishing needed to maintain the current revenue. We used the A 2 (“National enterprise” scenario) and B 1 (“Global community scenario”) VECTORS scenarios to design potential closures due to wind farms, nature conservation areas and maritime traffic in the North Sea and we calculated the stress caused by the closures on the Dutch and German 2010 fishing fleets. The scenarios investigated envisage large closures leading to stress levels of 7 to 15 % for the Dutch fleet and 3 to 5 % for the German fleet. Almost all of the Dutch vessels would be impacted by the closures (more than 90 % of vessels in both cases) while the German fleet would be slightly less impacted (around 55 % of vessels impacted for A 2 and 65 % for B 1). All Dutch harbours would have seriously impacted vessels (> 15 % of revenue) for both scenarios, although the proportion of those vessels would be higher in B 1 scenario, especially in the southern harbours. The German harbours would be less impacted with only Büssum showing hosting impacted vessels. We then examined the longer-term effects of fishers competing for resources and/or space. First, we explored the potential effects of a discard ban in mixed fisheries management using the French mixed fisheries in the Eastern English Channel as a model system (DSVM IBM model). The model evaluates a time series of decisions taken by fishers to maximize profits within management constraints. Compliance to management was tested by applying a tax for exceeding the quota, which was varied in the study. We then evaluated the consequences of individual cod quota in both scenarios, with respect to over-quota discarding, spatial and temporal effort allocation and switching between métiers. Individual quota management without a discard ban hardly influenced fishers’ behaviour, as they could fully utilize cod quota and continue fishing other species while discarding cod. In contrast, a discard ban forced fishers to reallocate effort to areas and weeks where cod catch is low, at the expense of lower revenue. In general, a restrictive policy for individual quota for cod needs to be combined with a discard ban and a high tax to reduce over-quota discarding. Second, we evaluated the long-term bio-economic effects of a closed area, using the FISHRENT model, for a variety of scenarios. Regulations and changes in market and environmental conditions may change the profitability of one fishery and can lead to reallocation of fishing effort. The extent of this effort displacement will depend on the relative profitability of the alternative options for the fleet segments affected. When fishing areas and fleet segments are heterogeneous, simple aggregate effort models such as those based on the ideal free distribution theory may provide inaccurate predictions. A bio-economic optimization and simulation model was applied to explore how the different conditions of A 2 (“National enterprise” scenario) and B 1 (“Global community scenario”) could impact the fishing effort allocation and the distribution of benefits across fleet segments from different nations. In the model the optimization of net profits determines the effort adjustment and the investment behaviour of fleet segments, which i...|$|E
