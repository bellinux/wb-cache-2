50|$|Boetti disassociated {{himself from}} the Arte Povera {{movement}} in 1972 and moved to Rome, without, however, completely abandoning some of its democratic, anti-elitist, strategies. In 1973, he renamed himself as a <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> Alighiero e Boetti (“Alighiero and Boetti”) reflecting the opposing factors presented in his work: the individual and society, error and perfection, order and disorder. Already in his double-portrait I Gemelli begun in 1968 and published as a postcard, Boetti had altered photographs so that {{he appeared to be}} holding the hand of his identical twin. He trained himself to write and draw ambidextrously.|$|E

50|$|Savarin wrote {{a series}} of action thrillers {{featuring}} the exploits of Gordon Gallagher and David Pross, who had been pilot and navigator, respectively, of a Phantom in the British Royal Air Force. Gordon subsequently became a secret agent, and Pross an accomplished pilot of helicopter gunships. Gallagher is an excellent lead character in the mould of James Bond, whereas Pross is more grounded with a family life and business interests. Pross has an unusual relationship with a young agent that is almost brother/sister, and has a <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> in the books - as an individual he is mild mannered and fairly timid. When piloting a gunship Pross becomes an amazing and ruthless pilot.|$|E
40|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the extent to}} which real estate continues to behave like real estate once it is securitized as a real estate investment trust (REIT). The purpose of our study is to examine the nature of deviations of securitized real estate from its underlying fundamental value and the role that institutional flow of funds play in this process. Towards this end, we also explore whether the transformation of real estate into a marketable security generates a <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> for REITs with respect to its market movements. We find support for the notion that REIT returns display a <b>dual</b> <b>persona,</b> with REITs going through periods where they trade like real estate, and other periods where they trade like common equity, preferred stock or corporate debt. Furthermore, since the relaxation of the 5 / 50 rule in 1993, institutional fund flows have {{played a significant role in}} th...|$|E
40|$|Most workers 2 ̆ 7 {{compensation}} schemes {{are designed}} to provide a swift and sure source of benefits to injured workers by placing on employers the risks and burdens of modern industry. In keeping with this policy, Washington 2 ̆ 7 s Industrial Insurance Act 2 (IIA) requires injured workers to relinquish the right to sue at common law for damages sustained on the job, and it requires employers to accept liability for a measure of damages set out by the statute. However, if a worker 2 ̆ 7 s injuries are caused by the negligence of a third person who is not in the worker 2 ̆ 7 s same employ, the IIA 2 ̆ 7 s third-party provision allows the worker to pursue an independent cause of action against the third person in addition to his workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation claim. This type of third-party liability provision has prompted considerable debate as to whether an injured employee may ever sue his employer or a co-employee as a third-party tortfeasor. Attempts by injured workers to circumvent the exclusive remedy principle in this way have given rise to the dual capacity and <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> doctrines, under which the employer or co-employees of an injured worker may be found independently liable for the worker 2 ̆ 7 s injuries, regardless of whether the worker also recovered workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation benefits. These doctrines are premised on the concept that when an employer or co-employee also serves in a distinct nonemployment capacity toward the employee, or has a legal persona other than that of employer or co-employee, the exclusive remedy principle will not bar the employee 2 ̆ 7 s common-law remedies. The application of the dual capacity and <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> doctrines has an enormous impact on employers, particularly employers who run small businesses or closely-held corporations. For example, many individuals who serve as the sole shareholder, director, and officer of a small, closely-held corporation also, as individuals, own the land on which the corporation is located. Under a recent judicial decision in Washington State, these small businesses, and the individuals who run them, may be subject to a new threat of liability. This Note will first explain the structure of Washington 2 ̆ 7 s IIA and the exclusive remedy principle. Next, it will explore the third-party provision of the IIA and the judicially-created doctrines that have made employers and co-employees vulnerable to tort suits by injured workers regardless of the exclusive remedy principle. Finally, this Note will discuss the Washington Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Evans v. Thompson and argue that the court should not have allowed consideration of the <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> doctrine on remand because the doctrine, if applied, will circumvent the exclusive remedy principle and put the landowners at unjustifiable risk of being held liable for workplace injuries...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we tackle the {{challenge}} of providing a generic security architecture for the Android OS that {{can serve as a}} flexible and effective ecosystem to instantiate different security solutions. In contrast to prior work our security architecture, termed FlaskDroid, provides mandatory access control simultaneously on both Android’s middleware and kernel layers. The alignment of policy enforcement on these two layers is non-trivial due to their completely different semantics. We present an efficient policy language (inspired by SELinux) tailored to the specifics of Android’s middleware semantics. We show the flexibility of our architecture by policydriven instantiations of selected security models such as the existing work Saint as well as a new privacyprotecting, user-defined and fine-grained per-app access control model. Other possible instantiations include phone booth mode, or <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> phone.

40|$|Smartphones and tablets {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of our daily life. They increasingly store and process security and privacy sensitive data which makes them attractive targets for attackers. In particular for the popular Android OS, a number of security extensions have been proposed that target specific security and privacy problems caused by Android’s lack of a fine-grained, dynamic and system-wide mandatory access control. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of providing a generic security architecture for the Android OS that can serve as a flexible and effective ecosystem to instantiate different security solutions. In contrast to prior work our security architecture, termed FlaskDroid, provides mandatory access control simultaneously on both Android’s middleware and kernel layers in a consolidated manner. The synchronization of policy enforcement between the two layers is non-trivial due to their completely different semantics. We present an efficient policy language (inspired by SELinux) tailored to the specifics of Android’s middleware semantics. We show the flexibility of our architecture by policy-driven instantiations of selected security models: one is from the existing work (Saint) while the other one is a new privacy-protecting, userdefined and fine-grained per-app access control model. Other possible instantiations include phone booth mode, or <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> phone. Finally we evaluate our implementation on SE Android 4. 0. 4 illustrating its efficiency and effectiveness. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} the soldier in late-Victorian Britain in light of the movement to rehabilitate the public image of the ordinary ranks initiated by the Cardwell-Childers Reforms. Venerated in popular culture, Tommy Atkins became a symbol of British imperial strength and heroism. Socially, however, attitudes to the rank-and-file were defined by a pragmatic realism purged of such sentiments, the likes of which would characterise the British public’s relationship with their army for over thirty years. Scholars of both imperial culture and the Victorian military have identified this <b>dual</b> <b>persona</b> of Tommy Atkins, however, a dedicated study into {{the true nature of the}} soldier’s position has yet to be undertaken. The following research will seek to redress this omission. The soldier is approached through the perspective of three key influences which defined his development. The first influence, the politics of the War Office, exposes a progressive series of schemes which, cultivated for over a decade, sought to redefine the soldier through the popularisation of military service and the professionalisation of the military’s public relations strategy and apparatus. A forgotten component of the Cardwell-Childers Reforms, the schemes have not before been scrutinised. Despite the ingenuity of the schemes devised, the social rehabilitation of the soldier failed, primarily, it will be argued, because the government refused to improve his pay. The public’s response to the Cardwell-Childers Reforms and the British perception of the ordinary soldier in the decades following their introduction form the second perspective. Through surveys of the local and London press and mainstream literature, it is demonstrated the soldier, in part as a result of the reforms, underwent a social transition, precipitated by his entering the public consciousness and encouraged by a resulting fascination in the military life. The final perspective presented in this thesis is from within the rank-and-file itself. Through the examination of specialist newspaper, diary and memoir material the direct experiences of the soldiers themselves are explored. Amid the extensive public and political discussion of their nature and status, the soldier also engaged in the debate. The perspective of the rank-and-file provides direct context for the established perspectives of the British public and the War Office, but also highlights how the soldier both supported and opposed the reforms and was acutely aware of the social status he possessed. This thesis will examine the public and political treatment of the soldier in the late-nineteenth century and question how far the conflicting ideas of soldier-hero and soldier-beggar were reconciled...|$|E
