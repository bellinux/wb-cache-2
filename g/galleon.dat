5000|$|The {{principal}} warships of {{the opposing}} English and Spanish fleets in the 1588 confrontation of the Spanish Armada were <b>galleons,</b> with the modified English [...] "race-built" [...] <b>galleons</b> developed by John Hawkins proving decisive, while the capacious Spanish <b>galleons,</b> designed primarily as transports, showed great endurance in the battles and in the great storms on the voyage home; most survived the ordeal.|$|R
5|$|Brézé, {{unable to}} {{dispatch}} his fireships over the Spanish vessels, {{as he had}} done in his previous battles at Cádiz, Barcelona and Cartagena, lunged over Pimienta's <b>galleon</b> Santiago and riddled the ship with his artillery Santiago lost its main-mast and had to be succored by Linhares and Pablo de Contreras. Fearing the attack of the French fireships or the boarding of Brézé's galleys, Contreras covered the damaged <b>galleon</b> at the head of six vessels, while Linhares flag galley towed it out of danger. The remaining ships engaged Brézé in an inconclusive action which lasted until both fleets separated at dusk. The Spanish lost the frigate Santa Catalina, burnt by its own crew to avoid capture when she was surrounded by the French la Mazarine and three other vessels. The foremost Spanish galleons Testa de Oro, León Rojo and Caballo marino received heavy damage, while a French fireship blew up. Two French galleons were also badly damaged. The human loss aboard the Spanish fleet is unknown. Forty men were killed or wounded aboard the French fleet One of them was Admiral Brézé, cut in half by a cannonball which hit the stern of his flagship Grand Saint Louis.|$|E
5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with <b>Galleon</b> Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though {{the manner in which}} it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E
5|$|Manila {{became famous}} during the Manila–Acapulco <b>galleon</b> trade, which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa and Hispanic America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia (which was already an entrepôt for goods coming from India, Indonesia and China), and vice versa. Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru was {{exchanged}} for Chinese silk, Indian gems and the spices of Southeast Asia. Likewise, wines and olives grown in Europe and North Africa were shipped via Mexico to Manila.|$|E

50|$|At {{the early}} days of the Spanish period; the first Manila <b>Galleons</b> were {{originally}} constructed at the port of Oton to the west of Iloilo. Since there was no precedent in Spain for the immensity of a Manila-Galleon, it could be argued that the proto-type Manila <b>galleons</b> were of Visayan design since the Visayans were already constructing huge multi-masted 4 to 5 decked caracoas in their wars against the other kingdoms and thus, the technical know-how to construct the first Manila <b>galleons</b> was an amelioration of Visayan shipbuilding with Spanish shipbuilding. Oton built the first Manila <b>galleons</b> before operations were eventually transferred to the Bicol and Cavite shipyards.|$|R
5|$|Of humble origin, uneducated, and fatherless {{from a young}} age, {{he watched}} over his family's flock of sheep before apprenticing to a {{shipbuilder}} {{near his home in}} present-day Maine. He moved to Boston to start a business building ships and soon began to embark on treasure-hunting expeditions to the West Indies. He became famous in London and Boston for recovering a large treasure from a sunken Spanish <b>galleon,</b> a feat that earned him instant wealth and a knighthood.|$|E
5|$|The fleet sailed further south, {{and by the}} end of May {{encountered}} the Santa Clara, an armed, 600-ton Spanish <b>galleon,</b> just off Cape St. Vincent. The English captured the ship after heavy resistance, taking whatever goods the Spanish had failed to retrieve from her burnt-out hull. She was carrying a large amount of ironware valued at £7,000 and was sailing to Sanlúcar de Barrameda where further freight was destined for the West Indies. With the capture, the fleet separated, leaving the prize and goods in the hands of Frobisher and Clifford.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted <b>galleon</b> named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.|$|E
50|$|Importantly {{beginning}} in 1565, Acapulco was a {{home of the}} vital Manila <b>Galleons.</b> The Manila <b>Galleons</b> crossed the Pacific Ocean to the Spanish possession of the Philippines, laden with silver and gemstones from Mexico. There, the wealth was used to purchase Asian trade goods such as spices, silk, and porcelain. These goods were then carried across the Pacific by the Manila <b>Galleons</b> to Acapulco; from there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico, for delivery to the Spanish treasure fleet, for shipment to Spain. The income provided to Spain by the Manila <b>Galleons</b> was essential to the Spanish Crown and to the Spanish economy of the era.|$|R
50|$|As the San Bernardino Strait was {{along the}} route of the Spanish <b>galleons</b> plying between Manila and Acapulco, Mexico, a royal port was {{established}} in Palapag where the richly laden Manila <b>galleons</b> were protected from unfavorable winds and troubled seas.|$|R
5|$|Spanish rule {{eventually}} {{contributed significantly}} to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain and then was administered directly from Madrid after the Mexican War of Independence. The Manila <b>galleons,</b> the largest wooden ships ever built, were constructed in Bicol and Cavite. The Manila <b>galleons</b> were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and from Manila and Acapulco. The <b>galleons</b> sailed {{once or twice a}} year, between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Manila <b>Galleons</b> brought with them goods, settlers and military reinforcements destined for the Philippines, from Latin America.|$|R
5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet {{bore down}} off the Giglio Island in a line astern with the galleons and the galleys at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and galleys, and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the lightness of the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line to catch it between two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag <b>galleon</b> Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan galleys, the <b>galleon</b> Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian galleys, other large Spanish galleons.|$|E
5|$|In 1609, the Spanish Manila <b>galleon</b> San Francisco {{encountered}} {{bad weather}} {{on its way}} from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships {{would be allowed to}} visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court.|$|E
5|$|Senior partner Anil Kumar, {{described}} as Gupta's protégé, left the firm after the allegations in 2009 and {{pleaded guilty in}} January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey's consulting services to the <b>Galleon</b> Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey's policies on confidentiality. Gupta was convicted in June 2012 of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks — an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year — as a senior partner emeritus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the dark}} on 17 February the English ships {{followed}} by the French slavers reached the port of Puerto Caballos and detached seven boats with 200 men and light artillery. They hoped to board the two partially laden Spanish <b>galleons</b> at anchor in the roads rather than destroy them. The <b>galleons</b> were Captain Juan de Monasterios's 600-ton Nuestra Señora del Rosario and Francisco Ferruﬁno's 400-ton San Juan Bautista. These were the flagship and vice flagship of the flota of New Spain. At almost sunrise the attackers rowed towards the <b>galleons</b> hoping to use surprise, {{but it was not}} to be. Warning shots were fired, but soon the English and French boarded both the <b>galleons.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sultan Bahadur Shah {{had grown}} {{apprehensive}} {{of the power}} of Humayun. He dispatched his chief officer Xacoes (Shah Khawjeh) to Nuno da Cunha with an offer to hand over the seven islands of Bombay together with Bassein, its dependencies, and revenues by sea and land. On 23 December 1534, the Treaty of Bassein was signed on board the <b>galleon</b> San Mateos (St. Matthew). Bassein and the seven islands of Bombay were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha on 25 October 1535, permanently ending the Islamic rule on the islands.|$|E
5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 13 January 1798, Sybille and Fox arrived in Manila Bay, slipping unchallenged past the fortress of Corregidor and then sailing across the bay {{on the morning of}} 14 January, anchoring between Manila and Cavite. From his vantage point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in Cavite, the ships of the line San Pedro, Europa and Montañés and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa in dock and unfit for action. To Cooke's disappointment he could also see the Manila <b>galleon,</b> Marquesetta being unloaded at the Cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour. The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward Pakenham was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{recently}} built Battersea Power Station then dominated most {{views of}} the area, so {{it was decided that}} the bridge's appearance was unimportant. Consequently, in contrast to the heavily ornamented 1858 bridge, the new bridge has a starkly utilitarian design and the only ornamentation consists of two ornamental lamp posts at each entrance. Each features a gilded <b>galleon</b> on top of a coat of arms. The outward facing sides of all four posts show the LCC coat of arms of the Lion of England, St George's Cross and the barry wavy lines representing the Thames; the inward faces on the south side show the dove of peace of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, that on the northwest corner shows the winged bull, lion, boars' heads and stag of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea, and that on the northeast corner the portcullis and Tudor roses of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E
50|$|Van Heemskerk {{left some}} of his ships at the bay {{entrance}} to prevent the escape of any Spanish ships. Twenty from the Dutch fleet were ordered {{to focus on the}} Spanish <b>galleons</b> while the rest attacked the smaller vessels. Van Heemskerk was killed during the first approach on the Spanish flagship as a cannon ball severed his leg. The Dutch then doubled up on the <b>galleons</b> {{and a few of the}} <b>galleons</b> caught fire. One exploded due to a shot into the powder magazine. The Dutch captured the Spanish flagship but let it go adrift.|$|R

5|$|Robert Dudley was {{a pioneer}} of new industries; {{interested}} in many things from tapestries to mining, he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history. The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor. On a personal level, he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis. Due to his interests in trade and exploration, {{as well as his}} debts, his contacts with the London city fathers were intense. He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers. English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester. This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making). He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage. Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the <b>Galleon</b> Leicester, which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton, but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António, the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.|$|E
25|$|Depredations by pirates continued. On October 18, 1586, Sir Francis Drake {{took the}} Manila <b>galleon</b> Santa Ana. On August 6, 1587, {{the port of}} Huatulco (Oaxaca) fell to English corsair Thomas Cavendish, and on September 3, 1587 he sacked Navidad (Jalisco). Cavendish also {{captured}} the Manila <b>galleon</b> Santa Ana off Baja California on November 15, 1587. Each Manila <b>galleon</b> was loaded with a year's worth of treasure from the Philippines en route to Acapulco for ultimate delivery to Spain.|$|E
25|$|The Manila-Acapulco <b>Galleon</b> Trade was {{the main}} source of income for the colony during its early years. Service was inaugurated in 1565 and {{continued}} into the early 19th century. The <b>Galleon</b> trade brought silver from New Spain, which was used to purchase Asian goods such as silk from China, spices from the Moluccas, lacquerware from Japan and Philippine cotton textiles. These goods were then exported to New Spain and ultimately Europe by way of Manila. Thus, the Philippines earned its income through the trade of the Manila-Acapulco <b>Galleon.</b>|$|E

50|$|During {{his term}} also, Dutch naval officer Joris van Spilbergen and his fleet of 10 <b>galleons</b> formed a {{blockade}} at Manila Bay, after being defeated in Iloilo on September 30, 1616. This was faced by a Spanish armada of 7 <b>galleons</b> under Juan Ronquillo del Castillo. This was the Second Battle of Playa Honda, occurred on April 14, 1617. Spillbergen's flagship sank with other two <b>galleons,</b> and the Dutch repulsed. Jeronimo de Silva returned on September 30, 1617, taking over military affairs. However, the Audiencia still takes {{charge of the}} country as a whole. In 1618, the government collected 160,000 tributes.|$|R
