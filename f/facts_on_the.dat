5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|The IDF command {{did not see}} {{the forces}} in the western Negev as {{sufficient}} to fully stop an Egyptian invasion, wherever it was headed, and ordered an operation to stop or delay the advancing column. The command also feared that the Arab forces would try to create <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground before the impending UN-imposed ceasefire. The two Arab forces that were considered a threat were the Iraqis in the Triangle (Jenin–Nablus–Tulkarm) and the Egyptians at Majdal–Isdud. Thus, Golani and Carmeli were to attack Jenin, Alexandroni was to harass Tulkarm, and Givati was to attack Isdud.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than <b>facts.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E

25|$|The main {{thrust of}} Operation Horev {{was in the}} south, and on December 25–27, Israeli forces {{captured}} the Beersheba–'Auja road, including Bir 'Asluj. The Southern Command decided to exploit this success in order to complete the rest of Operation Horev, namely, to surround and eventually expel all Egyptian forces from Palestine. The order was given {{to move into the}} Sinai Peninsula on the morning of December 28. This order directly contradicted the General Staff plan, which forbade entering Egyptian territory. According to Yitzhak Rabin, then the operations officer of the Southern Command, the command attempted to create <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground before getting the necessary approval for the action.|$|E

25|$|Experiments on the {{properties}} of gases started early in the seventeenth century. By {{the middle of the}} seventeenth century Robert Boyle had derived the inverse relationship between the pressure and the volume of gases. About the same time, Guillaume Amontons started looking into temperature effects on gas. Various gas experiments continued for the next 200 years. During that time there were efforts to liquefy gases. Many new <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of gases had been discovered. For example, early in the nineteenth century Cagniard de la Tour had shown there was a temperature above which a gas could not be liquefied. There was a major push in the mid to late nineteenth century to liquefy all gases. A number of scientists including Michael Faraday, James Joule, and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), did experiments in this area. In 1886 Karol Olszewski liquefied methane, the primary constituent of natural gas. By 1900 all gases had been liquefied except helium which was liquefied in 1908.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1976 the two-man Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) {{detachment}} of Willow Bunch {{moved to the}} nearby town of Coronach, Saskatchewan after 90 years in Willow Bunch. The then-Assistant Commissioner, J.E. Gibbon, recommended that the RCMP should be moved because of the low population in Willow Bunch. Residents of Willow Bunch strongly disagreed with the move and protested at the Regina Legislature on two different occasions. Two hundred protesters gathered outside the legislature on June 1, 1976. On June 30, 130 protested, demanding to see then-Saskatchewan premier Allan Blakeney. The premier told the angry group that he would not make any commitments other than to consider new <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> move. Until that confrontation, Attorney General Roy Romanow had been the main government official handling the press and public for the RCMP move. Romanow had said the RCMP advised him that, “one man detachments are of limited value” and that is why the RCMP would be building a new detachment in the economically prosperous Coronach. The developing Poplar River Power Station in Coronach would be expecting 400 to 500 workers, therefore more police manpower would be needed in the town, he argued.|$|E
500|$|According to Rives (1999), {{the fact}} that the ancient Germanic peoples claimed descent from an earth-born god was used by Tacitus to support [...] his {{contention}} that they were an indigenous population: the Latin word indigena was often used in the same sense as the Greek autochthonos, meaning literally ' the land itself'. Lindauer (1975) notes that, although this claim is to be judged as one made out of simple ignorance of the <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of Tacitus, he was not entirely wrong, as he made the judgement based on a comparison with the relatively turbulent Mediterranean region of his day.|$|E

500|$|When Emperor Ichijō died in 1011, Shōshi {{retired from}} the Imperial Palace {{to live in a}} Fujiwara mansion in Biwa, most likely {{accompanied}} by Murasaki, who is recorded as being there with Shōshi in 1013. George Aston explains that when Murasaki retired from court she was again associated with Ishiyama-dera: [...] "To this beautiful spot, it is said, Murasaki no Shikibu (sic) retired from court life to devote the remainder of her days to literature and religion. There are sceptics, however, Motoöri being one, who refuse to believe this story, pointing out... that it is irreconcilable with known <b>facts.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the very chamber in the temple where the Genji was written is shown—with the ink-slab which the author used, and a Buddhist Sutra in her handwriting, which, if they do not satisfy the critic, still are sufficient to carry conviction to the minds of ordinary visitors to the temple." ...|$|E
500|$|Dewar and Daniel, {{feeling that}} morale was sinking due to these public displays, wrote letters of {{complaint}} which {{were given to}} Collard on 10 March, {{on the eve of}} a major exercise. [...] Collard forwarded the letters to his superior, Vice-Admiral Sir John Kelly; he immediately passed them on to the Commander-in-Chief Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. On realising that the relationship between the two and their Flag Officer had irretrievably broken down, Keyes ordered the exercise postponed by fifteen hours and ordered a Court of Inquiry to be convened. [...] As a consequence, Collard was ordered to strike his flag in Royal Oak and Dewar and Daniel were ordered back to Britain. [...] The Admiralty was informed of the bare <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 12th and Keyes proceeded to sea with the Mediterranean Fleet for the exercise as planned. [...] The press picked up on the story worldwide, describing the affairwith some hyperboleas a [...] "mutiny".

[...] In 1987, culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a [...] "New Center". [...] But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial. [...] Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in New Age Politics, he defines radical middle politics as [...] "idealism without illusions"– more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face [...] "the hard <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground". [...] Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he says most Americans are already radical middle– [...] "we're very practical folks, and we're very idealistic and visionary as well." ...|$|E

500|$|The Radcliffe Commission, {{dividing}} Bengal and Punjab, {{completed its}} work and reported to Mountbatten on 12 August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th, {{not wanting to}} spoil the independence celebrations in both nations. There had already been ethnically charged violence and movement of populations; publication of the Radcliffe Line dividing the new nations sparked mass migration, murder, and ethnic cleansing. Many on the [...] "wrong side" [...] of the lines fled or were murdered, or murdered others, hoping to make <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground which would reverse the commission's verdict.
