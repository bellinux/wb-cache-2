5|$|The Drowned World Tour was {{the fifth}} concert tour by Madonna. It {{supported}} her seventh and eighth studio albums Ray of Light and Music respectively, and visited Europe and North America. It was also her first tour in eight years, following The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The tour was supposed to start in 1999, but was delayed until 2001 as Madonna {{gave birth to her}} son Rocco, got married to Guy Ritchie, was working on Music, and was busy filming The Next Best Thing. When the tour was decided, Madonna appointed Jamie King as choreographer and the tour was planned in a short timespan of three months, including signing up the dancers, musicians, and technicians. Designer <b>Jean</b> <b>Paul</b> Gaultier developed the costumes in such way that they indicated different phases of Madonna's career. The tour garnered positive reception from contemporary critics.|$|E
