5|$|The two {{examples}} witness the chthonic {{nature of these}} mythological creatures: a hero can enter the chthonic space and discover the secret of that world, but he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> relate that secret to other humans. Both the ala and Baba Yaga {{can be traced back}} to an older concept of a female demonic divinity: the snakelike mistress of the underworld.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a technicality in the show choir {{competition}} rules, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> accompany New Directions to sectionals. Guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) postpones her own wedding by a few hours so that she can take the club in his place, although her fiancé, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), feels she is choosing Will over him.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, as Cluj-Napoca is {{the capital}} of Cluj County, the city hosts the palace of the prefecture, the {{headquarters}} of the county council (consiliu județean) and the prefect, who is appointed by Romania's central government. The prefect <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> be a member of a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the local level. Like all other local councils in Romania, the Cluj-Napoca local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argue whether ghosts {{are real}} after she {{claims to have}} seen one at a pub where she used to work. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) dresses up as Sarah Kerrigan from StarCraft, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) takes off his wings as they had knives on them and Dwight <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> bring in weapons. Bert recognizes what his costume is {{supposed}} to be and the two bond over playing StarCraft all day, ignoring everyone else. Dwight also makes Bert pretend to fire Toby, for taking away his weapons, on the grounds that he is the CEO's son.|$|E
30|$|As C. C. Li put it, “I <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> teach. I <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> do anything.” “No one was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> talk to me.” “I was persecuted.” (Wohleber, 1991; Srikameswaran, 2003).|$|R
50|$|There {{are certain}} food women <b>are</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> eat during {{pregnancy}} and labor, {{as they could}} have a lasting effect of the child’s health. For example, women <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> eat eggs.|$|R
50|$|CHP {{followers}} {{also tried}} to establish parties. But they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> use the name CHP and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> elect the well known pre-1980 politicians to party posts. So they had to introduce new politicians.|$|R
5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him {{with the arrival of}} Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He {{was known for his}} quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E

50|$|Immediately a “deadlock” {{system was}} put into effect until October 16, 1978. Prisoners <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave their cells for any reason. Their meals were brought to them; all {{recreational}} time and work assignments were cancelled. The prisoners <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> shower until October; family visits were banned until October 14 and they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> make phone calls to their families until September 30. The officials of the prison began searching the prisoners for weapons on October 2 and ended October 13.|$|R
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E
5|$|On Harry Potter's {{birthday}} in 1992, the Dursley family—Harry's uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley—hold {{a dinner party}} for a potential client of Vernon's drill-manufacturing company. Harry is not invited, but is content to spend the evening quietly in his bedroom, although he is upset that his school friends have not sent cards or presents. However, {{when he goes to}} his room a house-elf named Dobby warns him not to return to Hogwarts and admits to intercepting Harry's post from his friends. Having failed to persuade Harry to voluntarily give up his place at Hogwarts, Dobby then attempts to get him expelled by using magic to smash Petunia's dessert on a dinner party guest and framing it on Harry, who <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> use magic out of school. Uncle Vernon's business deal falls through, but Harry is given a second chance and allowed to return {{at the start of the}} school year.|$|E

However, she explains to her mother (Reema Lagoo) that she does not really love him and is marrying him as a compromise as she feels she can never love again after losing Rahul. Aman also suspects that she does not really love him. Determined to reunite her father and his best friend, Anjali Khanna and her grandmother search for Anjali Sharma and soon learn that {{she is going to be}} working at a summer camp in Shimla. Rahul tells his daughter that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> attend the summer camp and heads to a conference, only to find out that his mom and daughter went without telling him, having left a letter for him. They travel to the camp, with a plan to later lure Rahul to come as well, and the two Anjalis meet each other. One night while watching television, Anjali Sharma realizes she has met Rahul's daughter, and that Tina is dead. Rahul soon arrives at Camp Sunshine, after his daughter fakes a fever, where he and Anjali Sharma are surprised and delighted to see each other again, sharing a sweet reunion. Throughout the days spent at the camp, Rahul and Anjali feel themselves falling in love. Just as they are about to share a heated moment, Anjali thinks about her upcoming engagement and feels guilty. She runs away in tears, after which Aman arrives and tells Rahul that he is Anjali's fiancee. Rahul is heartbroken but congratulates Anjali.
