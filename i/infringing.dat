50|$|The {{patentee}} may {{exercise a}} right to demand an injunction against the person who <b>infringes</b> or is likely to <b>infringe</b> its rights: Article 100(1) of the Patent Act. A “person who <b>infringes</b> or is likely to <b>infringe</b> the patent rights” in that paragraph means a person who works (Article 2(3)) a patented invention without the patentee's permission, or a person who commits an act of indirect infringement.|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{urged that}} Netgear {{indirectly}} <b>infringed</b> its patents and was liable for contributory infringement. First, {{with respect to}} the indirect infringement, the district court concluded that Netgear could not indirectly <b>infringe</b> plaintiff's patent since there were no evidence that the patent is directly <b>infringed</b> by the third parties. The court acknowledged that end users could enable fragmentation through software control and therefore might <b>infringed</b> the patents at issue. However, because fragmentation is merely an optional component of the IEEE 802.11 specification and Netgear products did not enable fragmentation by default, the court could not find any explicit circumstantial evidences that third parties indeed <b>infringed</b> the 952 patent.|$|R

5|$|In 2015, the pro-independence group People's Voice {{established}} a demonstration {{camp on the}} grounds of the Scottish parliament demanding independence. this camp was objected to as it risked <b>infringing</b> on the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate and prevented others from using the grounds. Sheriff officers issued the campers with a notice ordering them to leave, however the campers refused.|$|E

50|$|The court {{originally}} {{granted a}} preliminary injunction for the plaintiff {{and ordered the}} defendant to remove from the website the material that allegedly <b>infringed</b> plaintiff's copyright, and to refrain from reproducing or distributing verbatim in a tangible medium any material that allegedly <b>infringed</b> the copyright.|$|R
5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, the author was granted an exclusive right to control the copying of the book. Penalties for <b>infringing</b> this right were severe, with all <b>infringing</b> copies to be destroyed and large fines {{to be paid to}} both the copyright holder and the government; there was only a three-month statute of limitations on bringing a case, however. This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of copyright was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the copyright expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, and when that ran out, the works would enter the public domain. Copyright under the Statute applied to Scotland and England, as well as Ireland when that country joined the union in 1800.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, <b>infringing</b> on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E

In March 1918, Cotillo opposed the proposed prohibition of alcohol in the state. Although he believed in temperance, he doubted if that would be achieved by prohibition; he advocated education and not <b>infringing</b> on civil liberties.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, a {{jury found}} that Nellcor <b>infringed</b> several Masimo patents related to measure-through motion and low {{perfusion}} signal processing technology. In 2005, {{the appellate court}} affirmed the infringement findings against Nellcor and instructed the District Court to enter a permanent injunction against Nellcor’s pulse oximeters (e.g., N-395, N-595) that were found to <b>infringe.</b> In January 2006, Masimo and Nellcor entered into a settlement agreement, where Nellcor, among other things, agreed to discontinue shipment of the pulse oximeters that were found to <b>infringe</b> Masimo’s patents.|$|R
5|$|In March 1904 Neild {{attacked}} the government's military {{policy and the}} commander of the military forces, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, who had long wished to dismiss Neild from the citizen army. Neild had incited a near mutiny by destroying a well-known sergeant's military career, and was suspended from duty; Neild responded by accusing Hutton of intimidation and <b>infringing</b> a Senator's right of freedom of expression. In April 1904 the Senate formed a committee to investigate alleged contempt of Parliament by Hutton, which found that Neild had not been intimidated. In 1905 Neild retired from the militia.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was <b>infringing</b> upon these individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} into all major languages, and in the United States it became the second best-selling book after the Bible. A number of the early editions carried an introduction by Rev James Sherman, a Congregational minister in London noted for his abolitionist views. Uncle Tom's Cabin sold equally well in Britain, with the first London edition appearing in May 1852 and selling 200,000 copies. In a few years over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were <b>infringing</b> copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States).|$|E
50|$|The court {{holds in}} the {{judgment}} that the test of whether an imported work <b>infringes</b> copyright is laid down in S.53 (this section allows seizure of goods by the Registrar of Copyrights). The test is that whether the copy if made in India would <b>infringe</b> copyright? If so then it <b>infringes</b> upon copyright. This is because the essence of infringement is taking what is not yours. Copyright is a territorial right and has been regarded as something worth protecting in the ultimate public interest.|$|R

5|$|While Cáceres {{was engaged}} in what would evidently be a lengthy siege, Montejo sent a column of Spanish {{soldiers}} into the area around Gracias a Dios; he sent a second column, with 20 Spaniards accompanied by native auxiliaries, south to the Valley of Xocorro. Montejo led a third column in person, taking 23 Spanish soldiers to Comayagua. He also sent a message ahead, for Santa María de Comayagua to send support to Cáceres at the Peñol, and fourteen soldiers marched from there to join the siege. The Xocorro column was forced to return to Santa María de Comayagua after falling afoul of the Spanish authorities in San Miguel, who claimed they were <b>infringing</b> upon their jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of <b>infringing</b> five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
5|$|After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and {{contained}} little deep and persistent convection; with dry air <b>infringing</b> {{on the western}} edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely. Despite being sheared, the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non-tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents, and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper-level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September12. After a jog to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection. Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough. Hanna then strengthened sharply to reach to its peak intensity of 60miles per hour (100km/h) at 0000UTC on September14.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Judge Gilstrap {{enhanced}} damages {{based on}} a jury verdict that LG willfully <b>infringed</b> two Standard essential patents (SEPs) owned by Core Wireless covering cellular standards. He previously denied LG's motion for summary judgmement that the SEPs were not willfully <b>infringed,</b> letting that issue go to the jury.|$|R
50|$|Interchemical Corporation {{asserted}} that inks made by Sinclair & Carroll Co. <b>infringed</b> U.S. Patent No. 2,087,190 to Albert E. Gessler (assigned to Interchemical Corporation).

2500|$|In 1971, {{however, the}} Council ruled unconstitutional (...) some {{provisions}} {{of a law}} changing the rules for the incorporation of private nonprofit associations, because they <b>infringed</b> on freedom of association, one of the principles given in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen; they used {{the fact that the}} preamble of the French constitution briefly referred to those principles to justify their decision. For the first time, a statute was declared unconstitutional not because it <b>infringed</b> on technical legal principles, but because it was deemed to <b>infringe</b> on personal freedoms.|$|R
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as <b>infringing</b> on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was <b>infringing</b> its patents because the {{soybeans}} he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} <b>infringing</b> 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{concluded}} {{that the right to}} liberty had been <b>infringed</b> because the provision hampered a woman's free choice to marry a non-citizen and, in fact, undermined marriage. The Court also decided that the right not to be expelled from Botswana was <b>infringed</b> because, if the plaintiff's resident permit was not renewed, she would be forced to leave Botswana if she desired to stay with her family. Finally, the Court stated that the right not to be subjected to degrading treatment was <b>infringed</b> because any law discriminating against women constitutes an offense against human dignity.|$|R
