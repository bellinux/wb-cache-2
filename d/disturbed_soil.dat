5|$|Great mullein most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist of bare and <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil,</b> usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. This ability to grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats has been linked to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E
5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil</b> or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|Amanita daucipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies may {{be found}} growing solitary or scattered {{on the ground in}} mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (especially those dominated by oak trees) in Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas; other associated tree species include hickory (genus Carya) and birch (Betula). A predilection for <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil,</b> such as roadsides, has been noted. Amanita authority Cornelis Bas, writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on the genus, claimed A.daucipes to be a rare species; subsequent investigations have shown it to be common in oak forests in the eastern United States. The southern end of its distribution extends to Sonora, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Xerochrysum bracteatum {{occurs in}} all Australian {{mainland}} states and territories, {{as well as}} Tasmania. Widespread, it is found from North Queensland across to Western Australia, and in all habitats excluding densely shaded areas. It grows as an annual in patches of red sand in Central Australia, responding rapidly to bouts of rainfall to complete its lifecycle. It is common among granite outcrops in southwest Western Australia, and is found on heavier and more fertile soils in the Sydney region, such as basalt-, shale-, or limestone-based soils, generally in areas with a high water table. Associated species in the Sydney Basin include blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) in open forest, and the shrubs Empodisma minus and Baloskion australe in swampy areas. It has been reported growing in <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil,</b> along roadsides and in fields in the New England region in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the species}} {{cultivated}} by Indians for food are today considered undesirable weeds. Another name for marshelder is sumpweed; chenopods are derisively called pigweed, although one South American species with a more attractive name, quinoa, is a health food store favorite. Many plants considered weeds are the colonizers of <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil,</b> the first fast-growing weeds to spring up when a natural or man-made event, such as a fire, leaves a bare patch of soil.|$|E

She asks Martha for garden tools, which Martha sends with Dickon, her 12-year-old brother. Mary and Dickon take a liking to each other, as Dickon has a kind way with animals and a good nature. Eager to absorb his gardening knowledge, Mary tells him about the secret garden.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of CO 2  flux, soil temperature, and {{moisture}} content of selected natural and <b>disturbed</b> <b>soils</b> in central California {{were made on}} a monthly basis from August 1994 to October 1995 in an attempt to detect the effects of temperature, moisture, and land use change on CO 2  production in soils. Soil CO 2  flux displayed a strong negative correlation with soil temperature and a positive correlation with soil moisture at the natural site. However, at the disturbed site, the linear correlation between CO 2  flux and temperature/moisture was insignificant. The negative correlation between soil CO 2  flux and soil temperature is in contrast to what has been observed in other ecosystems but is typical for Mediterranean ecosystems in which grasses are biologically active only during cool months. Comparison of carbon (C) inventories of paired natural and <b>disturbed</b> <b>soils</b> indicates that both cultivation and logging have resulted in a significant decrease in total soil C content. The reduction in soil C storage is about 26 % for the cultivated soil and around 30 % for the logged soil. Most of the C loss is from the upper horizons. Radiocarbon (14 C) measurements of both recent and archived soil samples demonstrate large differences in C input rate and turnover time between natural and <b>disturbed</b> <b>soils.</b> The average turnover times of organic matter are longer in <b>disturbed</b> <b>soils</b> than in the corresponding natural soils as a result of preferential loss of C from “active” soil C pools. In both natural and <b>disturbed</b> <b>soils,</b> the average turnover times of organic matter increase with depth from decades or less in shallow horizons to hundreds of years or even thousands of years in deeper horizons. Our results show that land use change can have significant impact on soil C cycle and that shallow soil horizons are most susceptible to disturbance because of shorter turnover times of organic C in these horizons...|$|R

25|$|In {{gathering}} the seeds some were undoubtedly {{dropped in the}} sunny environment and <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil</b> of a settlement, and those seeds sprouted and thrived. Over time the seeds were sown and the ground was cleared of any competitive vegetation. The seeds which germinated quickest (i.e. thinner seed coats) and the plants which grew fastest were {{the most likely to}} be tended, harvested, and replanted. Through a process of unconscious selection and, later, conscious selection, the domesticated weeds became more productive. The seeds of some species became substantially larger and/or their seed coats were less thick compared to the wild plants. For example, the seed coats of domesticated chenopodium is less than 20 microns thick; the wild chenopodium of the same species is 40 to 60 microns thick. Conversely, when Indians quit growing these plants, as they did later, their seeds reverted within a few years to the thickness they had been in the wild.|$|E
500|$|This species grows {{scattered}} or {{in groups}} on <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil</b> in coniferous or mixed forests. It {{is also found}} growing on wood chips used as mulch in gardens or for landscaping; Blanton has also reported it growing in a garden [...] "solitary and very large".|$|E

60|$|As I {{remained}} curious I made {{an opportunity}} to scramble {{to the bottom of}} one of these craters, taking with me some of the natives with their wooden tools. Here I found a good deal of soil either washed down from the surface or resulting from the decomposition of the rock, though oddly enough in it nothing grew. I directed them to dig. After a while to my astonishment there appeared a corner of a great worked stone quite unlike that of the crater, indeed it {{seemed to me to be}} a marble. Further examination showed that this block was most beautifully carved in bas-relief, apparently with a design of leaves and flowers. In the <b>disturbed</b> <b>soil</b> also I picked up a life-sized marble hand of a woman exquisitely finished and apparently broken from a statue that might have been the work of one of the great Greek sculptors. Moreover, on the third finger of this hand was a representation of a ring whereof, unfortunately, the bezel had been destroyed.|$|E

40|$|A {{physical}} model {{was developed to}} explain threshold friction velocities u*t for particles of the size 60 – 120 μm lying on a rough surface in loose soils for semiarid and arid parts of the United States. The model corrected for the effect of momentum absorption by the nonerodible roughness. For loose or <b>disturbed</b> <b>soils</b> the most important parameter that controls u*t is the aerodynamic roughness height z 0. For physical crusts damaged by wind the size of erodible crust pieces is important along with the roughness. The presence of cyanobacteriallichen soil crusts roughens the surface, and the biological fibrous growth aggregates soil particles. Only undisturbed sandy <b>soils</b> and <b>disturbed</b> <b>soils</b> of all types {{would be expected to}} be erodible in normal wind storms. Therefore disturbance of soils by both cattle and humans is very important in predicting wind erosion as confirmed by our measurements...|$|R
