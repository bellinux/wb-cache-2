Not <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised and overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account British authorities were especially interested in <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> his achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E

5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of <b>knowing.</b> <b>Whether</b> it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
25|$|The {{petrol tank}} filler came adrift {{as they neared}} the Adriatic coast and drenched them both. Jenkinson's {{spectacles}} were blown off by the slipstream when he vomited {{over the side of}} the Mercedes; he carried a replacement pair. Arriving in Rome, he and Moss were told they were leading from Taruffi, Herrmann, Kling and Fangio, but from then on they had no way of <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> any of their rivals had gone ahead on elapsed time. Soon after Rome, Kling's race ended when he went off the road avoiding spectators and crashed into a tree.|$|E
25|$|Hanafi: The Hanafi {{school does}} not {{consider}} a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory (wajib) {{for a woman to}} cover her face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely no fear of attraction, the woman has no way of <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> the gazes directed towards her are free of desire or not, especially when she is out in public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E

25|$|While {{concrete}} {{figures are}} difficult to determine, the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently reported that {{there are at least}} 600,000 children involved in forced begging. The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging. Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by Human Rights Watch projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging. Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though {{there is no way of}} <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> it was through forced means.|$|E
25|$|But if Tilney's {{censorship}} {{restricted the}} writers, his support protected them from generally hostile civic authorities. The polite fiction of aristocratic patronage did not obscure {{the reality that}} the troupes were commercial enterprises; however, that fiction brought the theatres under royal protection; in 1592, the Lord Mayor of London named Tilney {{as one of the}} obstacles to ending public drama in the city. However, Tilney's censorship was not of a generalising nature. While he did omit politically volatile passages and scenes, some, like the deposition scene in Richard II and the murder of Julius Caesar, were allowed to remain. However, {{there is no way of}} <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> Julius Caesar was allowed to be performed uncensored. Shakespeare's plays seemed to have suffered the severest form of censorship under Tilney.|$|E
25|$|The {{breast cancer}} {{movement}} {{has resulted in}} widespread acceptance of second opinions, the development of less invasive surgical procedures, the spread of support groups, and other advances in patient care. The movement successfully separated diagnostic biopsy from mastectomy surgery; before about 1980, it was common to perform the biopsy and, if a quick review of tissues indicated a probable need, a mastectomy in the same surgery. The one-step surgery prevented women from seeking different opinions about their treatment, and sent them into the surgery without <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> their breasts would be removed that day. In response to women's concerns over lymphedema after routine removal of lymph nodes during mastectomy, the more limited approach of sentinel node biopsy was developed. Advocacy efforts also led to the formal recommendation against the routine use of the Halsted radical mastectomy in favor of simple mastectomies and lumpectomies.|$|E
6000|$|Harriet said, [...] "very true," [...] and she [...] "would {{not think}} about it;" [...] but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at last, {{in order to put}} the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly <b>knowing</b> herself <b>whether</b> to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a {{conclusion}} of Mr. Elton's importance with her! ...|$|R
60|$|There is no <b>knowing,</b> indeed, <b>whether</b> {{these were}} the very words in which the Captain meditated that night; for it is yet a mooted point among metaphysicians, whether we think in words or whether we think in thoughts. But {{something}} like the above {{must have been the}} Captain's cogitations. At any rate, that very evening the ship's company were astounded by an extraordinary announcement made at the main-hatch-way of the gun-deck, by the Boat-swain's mate there stationed. He was afterwards discovered to have been tipsy at the time.|$|R

25|$|Promoted to {{squadron}} leader on 1 January 1980, Stirrup was {{serving as a}} flight commander on No. 226 Operational Conversion Unit which was based at RAF Lossiemouth in March 1983: his duties centred around the instruction of trainee pilots on the SEPECAT Jaguar and, on 7 March 1983, Stirrup was carrying out a student progress check from the rear seat of his aircraft when they suffered a serious bird strike. Stirrup was unable to ascertain whether his student was conscious and forward vision through the canopy was obscured: one of his engines caught fire, and although ejecting from the aircraft would have been justified, not <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> the student was conscious or not, Stirrup managed to land at RAF Leuchars. Stirrup was later awarded the Air Force Cross in recognition of {{his handling of the}} incident.|$|E
25|$|Amnesty {{also reports}} {{allegations}} of abuse of suspects during these interrogations. There {{are reports of}} physical abuse, sleep deprivation and denial of food, water and use of a toilet. One of its biggest criticisms is that inmates usually remain for years (and sometimes decades) on death row without ever actually being informed of the date of their execution prior to the date itself, so inmates suffer due to the uncertainty of not <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> or not any given day will be their last. According to Amnesty International, the intense and prolonged stress means many inmates on death row have poor mental health, suffering from the so-called death row phenomenon. The failure to give advanced notice of executions has been stated by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to be incompatible with articles 2, 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.|$|E

500|$|Filatov {{was also}} the first overall {{selection}} in the 2008 Canadian Hockey League Import Draft, selected by the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Sudbury General Manager Mike Foligno was comfortable with the risks of not <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> Filatov would play at junior or professional level when he came to North America. Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson would not guarantee Filatov a place on their team, saying, [...] "We've already told Nikita that we'll see how things go in training camp and we'll decide what's best for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." ...|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} with {{certainty}} about his life. [...] The enigma of his biography {{stems from a}} difficulty in <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> he was Flemish or Italian. [...] A northern origin is suggested by his name, a copy {{of one of his}} works in a Flemish manuscript, and a possible citation of his music by Thomas Fabri. [...] But with only one other exception, all of his works are found in Northern Italian manuscripts, and that exception, a Polish manuscript, has strong Italian connections. [...] The most important biographical research on the composer was conducted by Reinhard Strohm, who notes that it was more common for Northern works (and composers) to travel to Italy than the opposite.|$|E
60|$|I drank to {{the last}} drop, neither <b>knowing</b> nor caring <b>whether</b> it were wine or poison, since my heart seemed desperate at its failure and my spirit crushed beneath the weight of its great betrayal.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Educational and School Psychology. This {{study is}} a further {{investigation}} of epistemological beliefs, specifically ways of <b>knowing,</b> and <b>whether</b> people will adapt these beliefs dependent upon social context (i. e. in-group or out-group). In addition, this research examined the role of gender and one’s use of connected knowing (CK) or separate knowing (SK). One hundred twenty-three college students were surveyed to determine if use of CK or SK shifted when thinking of in-group or out-group associations. Results did not confirm {{a shift in the}} use of CK or SK dependent upon social context. The results confirmed that men had higher SK scores than women; however, no gender differences were confirmed in CK scores...|$|R
500|$|... "Adventure Time" [...] {{was created}} by Pendleton Ward. The short's style was {{influenced}} by his time at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts).

Homan told Ward that he should consider pitching an idea to the Frederator [...] series Random! Cartoons. Ward spent approximately one to two weeks storyboarding the outline for [...] "Adventure Time". He described the process as [...] "exciting" [...] because he was [...] "jumping into it not <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> [...] would sink or swim." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite these {{positive}} reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for Sense and Sensibility, three for Pride and Prejudice, none for Mansfield Park, and seven for Emma. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. [...] They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, [...] "their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, {{for the benefit of}} women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so positive. Author Phil Farrand was {{critical}} of the episode, rating it his fifth least favorite episode of the first four seasons. He criticized the entry for having an uninteresting first half, and relying on the [...] "cliche" [...] of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Furthermore, he was unhappy {{with the fact that}} viewers did not have any way of <b>knowing</b> <b>whether</b> the content of the episode really happened. Alan Kurtz criticized the episode for being inconsistent with the timetable of The X-Files, pointing {{to the fact that the}} episode contradicts canon that was established in the third season episode [...] "Apocrypha". Furthermore, he derided the show for too closely mirroring the plots of the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now as well as Forrest Gump.|$|E
25|$|A {{fabrication}} {{is a lie}} told {{when someone}} submits a statement as truth, without <b>knowing</b> for certain <b>whether</b> or not it actually is true.

Examples of fabrication: A person giving directions to a tourist when the person doesn't actually know the directions. Often propaganda is fabrication.|$|R

40|$|Under common law, the {{standard}} remedy for {{breach of contract}} is expectation damages. Under continental law, {{the standard}} is specific performance. The common law solution is ex post efficient. But is it also ex ante efficient? We use experimental methods to test <b>whether</b> <b>knowing</b> that non-fulfilment will only lead to damages deters mutually beneficial trade. The design excludes aversion against others willfully breaking their promises. We find that there is indeed less trade if specific performance is not guaranteed, provided the preference for the traded commodity is sufficiently pronounced...|$|R
