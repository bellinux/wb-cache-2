40|$|Two-level {{factorial}} and fractional factorial designs {{have played}} {{a prominent role in}} the theory and practice of experimental design. Though commonly used in industrial experiments to identify the significant effects, it is often undesirable to perform the trials of a factorial design (or, fractional factorial design) in a completely random order. Instead, restrictions are imposed on the randomization of experimental runs. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to factorial and fractional factorial plans with different randomization restrictions (e. g., nested designs, split-plot designs, split-split-plot designs, strip-plot designs, split-lot designs, and combinations thereof). Bingham et al. (2006) proposed an approach to represent the randomization structure of factorial designs with randomization restrictions. This thesis introduces a related, but more general, representation referred to as randomization <b>defining</b> <b>contrast</b> subspaces (RDCSS). The RDCSS is a projective geometric formulation of randomization <b>defining</b> <b>contrast</b> subgroups (RDCSG) defined in Bingham et al. (2006) and allows for theoretical study. For factorial designs with different randomization structures, the mere existence of a design is not straightforward. Here, the theoretical results are developed for the existence of factorial designs with randomization restrictions within this unified framework. Our theory brings together results from finite projective geometry to establish the existence and construction of such designs. Specifically, for the existence of a set of disjoint RDCSSs, several results are proposed using (t- 1) -spreads and partial (t- 1) -spreads of PG(p- 1; 2). Furthermore, the theory developed here offers a systematic approach for the construction of two-level full factorial designs and regular fractional factorial designs with randomization restrictions. Finally, when the conditions for the existence of a set of disjoint RDCSSs are violated, the data analysis is highly influenced from the overlapping pattern among the RDCSSs. Under these circumstances, a geometric structure called star is proposed for a set of (t- 1) -dimensional subspaces of PG(p- 1; q), where...|$|E

The 25 {{factorial}} design is a {{factorial design}} that contains 5 factors where each factor has two levels that 32 treatment combinations and 32 unit of experiments will be needed. Frequently, the whole experiment units can’t be done, {{so that a}} part of the whole treatments combinations or {{a part of the}} whole replications can be taken.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} selecting two-level fractional factorial designs that allow joint estimation of all main effects and some specified two-factor interactions (2 fi’s) without aliasing from other 2 fi’s. This problem is to find, among all 2 m−p designs with given m and p, those resolution IV designs whose sets of clear 2 fi’s contain the specified 2 fi’s as subsets. A 2 fi is clear {{if it is not}} aliased with any main effect or any other 2 fi. We use a linear graph to represent the set of clear 2 fi’s for a resolution IV design, where each line connecting two vertices represents a clear 2 fi between the two vertices. We call a 2 m−p resolution IV design admissible if its graph is not a real subgraph of any other graphs of 2 m−p resolution IV designs. We show that all even resolution IV designs are inadmissible. In fact, the number of admissible designs is much smaller than the number of non-isomorphic designs. This leads to a concise catalog of all admissible designs of 32 and 64 runs. We also use an algorithm to determine all admissible 128 -run resolution IV designs, but only provide some representative designs here.

40|$|A {{standard}} approach to generating a grayscale equivalent to an input multi-spectral image involves calculating the so-called structure tensor at each image pixel. <b>Defining</b> <b>contrast</b> as {{associated with the}} maximum-change direction of this matrix, the gray gradient is identified with the first eigenvector direction, with gradient strength given by the square root of its eigenvalue. However, aside from the inherent complexity of such an approach, each pixel’s gradient still possesses a sign ambiguity, since an eigenvector is given only up to a sign. This is ostensibly resolved by looking at how one of the color channels behaves, or how the the luminance changes, or how overall integrability is affected by each sign choice. Instead, {{we would like to}} circumvent the sign problem in the first place, and also avoid calculating the costly eigenvector decomposition. We suggest replacing the eigenvector approach by generating a grayscale gradient equal to the maximum gradient amongst the color or multi-spectral channels ’ gradients, in each of x, y. color or But in order not to neglect the tensor approach, we consider the relationship between the complex and the simple approaches. We also note that, at each pixel, we have both forward-facing and backward-facing derivatives, which are different. In a novel approach, we consider a tensor formed from both. Then, over a standard training set, we ask for an optimum set of weights for all the maximum gradients such that the simple maxima scheme generates a grayscale structure tensor to best match the original, multi-spectral, one. If we use only forward-facing derivatives, a fast Fourier-based solution is possible. But instead, we find that a simple scheme that equally weights maxima in the forward-facing and backward-facing directions produces superlative results if a reset step is included, in a spatial-domain solution. Grayscale results are shown to be excellent, and the algorithm is very fast. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{traffic safety}} analysis, weight factors are often applied, to correct for road length, traffic volume, numbers of {{kilometers}} driven, etc. Also, many data are subdivided into classes (road type: freeway, 80 km/hr, two lanes, rural area, etc); combining factors {{often leads to}} a cross-classification. Analysis of accidents (numbers of deaths, e. g.) is mostly done by using the Poisson model, {{which has become a}} standard in traffic safety research. The best known paradigm for the analysis of unweighted Poisson data is Goodman (1970), on which Goodman's ECTA is based too. Goodman's procedure leads to orthogonal row-, column- and interaction effects, {{in exactly the same way}} as in analysis of variance. For the weighted Poisson model, at SWOV, a computer program was developed ('WPM': Weighted Poisson Method', by De Leeuw and Oppe, 1976) and the question was, whether there existed a comparable procedure in SAS. In using SAS-GENMOD, one can perform weighted Poisson regression, but not an orthogonal decomposition of effects; this has been achieved by <b>defining</b> <b>contrast</b> vectors for a 'hypervariable', for which all variables are subclasses, such that interaction contrasts can be defined too. One problem in implementing Goodman's procedure was the fact that in WPM (following Goodman) 0. 5 was added to each cell count; SAS-GENMOD however, only accepts counts. It will be discussed how SAS-GENMOD can be made dealing with real numbers. Furthermore, the distinction between four types of sums of squares (Ti - T 4) is very important and parallels 'sequential' and 'partialized' sums of squares. Apart from this, there is a choice between test statistics ('likelihood ratio test statistic', LR, or 'Wald statistic' - which yields Pearson's chi-squared test statistic). Also, parametrisation in SAS is different from other well known packages. Most common are the 'S'-restrictions: sum of parameter values is zero; this defines the ANOVA-model. Other restrictions are the J. t-Model restrictions: the last level is set zero. For the weighted Goodman design, more examples and setups will be given. Test statistics and sums of squares for different parameterizations will be given with the examples. (Author/publisher...|$|E
