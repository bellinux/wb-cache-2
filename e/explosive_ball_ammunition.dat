50|$|The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company was a U.S. company {{formed in}} 1855 by {{partners}} Horace Smith and Daniel B.

While the Volcanic Repeating Arms Company was short lived, its descendants, Smith & Wesson and Winchester Repeating Arms Company, became major firearms manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|In some cases, these rifles may {{actually}} be training rifles intended for firing blank cartridges only. The training rifles were made of mild steel and were never intended for <b>ball</b> <b>ammunition.</b> It is possible that reports of Type 99 rifles blowing up were simply the results of soldiers testing captured weapons. Unaware that they were using drill rifles, they fired <b>ball</b> <b>ammunition</b> in them with poor results and possible injuries. It is possible that this may have unjustly led to the Arisaka having a reputation (at least for the last ditch rifles) for being of poor construction.|$|R
