50|$|The towers did not rotate {{like those}} {{commonly}} used in other radar models. The ACO radar installation consisted of 14 switches on the receiver tower {{and more on the}} transmitter. These had to be constantly relayed from on to off, lower to higher, and to between different directions. The switches were controlled by the radar operators from the radar consoles located within the concrete igloos. Aircraft activity was monitored from an eleven-inch cathode ray tube screen. Using the <b>goniometre</b> consisting of switches and controls of the direction and height finding components, the operator would monitor the screen and make comparisons to decipher the direction, elevation and distance of the aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Le sujet de ma thèse est l étude de la {{diffraction}} par des trous sub-longueur percés dans des films métalliques, ainsi que la compréhension du rôle des plasmons de surface (SPs) dans la diffraction en champ lointain. Nous avons construit un <b>goniomètre</b> fait maison de haute qualité. Une série de trous unique percés dans un film opaque et variant continûment de k r >> 1 à k r > 1 to k r<< 1 {{in a flat}} opaque film were explored, where k is the wavevector of {{the incident}} wave and r is the radius of the hole. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} diffraction of single hole can be classified into four regimes, depending on the input polarization. A simple analytical expression reveals {{for the first time the}} subtle interplay of two competing factors: one related to surface plasmon excitation and the other originating in the coupling of the field to the waveguide mode of the aperture. When the hole is surrounded by concentric grooves (bull s eye structure) and is illuminated with the grooves on the output side, the beaming effect occurs: far-field diffraction is confined in very small solid angle. The effects of geometrical parameters on bull s eye diffraction have been studied and the diffraction patterns with the width less than 1 in the far field have been achieved. Another surface waves (CWs) different from SPs on tungsten films were studied. It was demonstrated that the CWs have beaming effect as well. By comparison we showed that CWs display much weaker enhancement in transmission than SPs through nanostructures. STRASBOURG-Bib. electronique 063 (674829902) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E
