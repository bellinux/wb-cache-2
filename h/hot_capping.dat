40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} the thermal X-ray radiation from the <b>hot</b> polar <b>cap</b> of radio pulsars showing evidence of subpulse drift in radio band. In our recent Paper I, using the partially screened gap (PSG) model of inner acceleration region we derived a simple relationship between the drift rate of subpulses observed in a radio-band and the thermal X-ray luminosity from polar caps heated by the back-flow particle bombardment. This relationship can be tested for pulsars in which the so-called carousel rotation time P_ 4, reflecting the plasma drift, and the thermal X-ray luminosity L_x from the <b>hot</b> polar <b>cap</b> are known. To test the model we used only two available pulsars: PSRs B 0943 + 10 and B 1133 + 16. They both satisfied the model prediction, although due to low photon statistics the thermal component could not be firmly identified from the X-ray data. Nevertheless, these pulsars were at least consistent with PSG pulsar model. In the present paper we consider two more pulsars: PSRs B 0656 + 14 and B 0628 - 28, whose data have recently become available. In PSR B 0656 + 14 the thermal radiation from the <b>hot</b> polar <b>cap</b> was clearly detected, and PSR B 0628 - 28 also seems to have such a component. In all cases for which both P_ 4 and L_x are presently known, the PSG pulsar model seems to be fully confirmed. Other available models of inner acceleration region fail to explain the observed relationship between radio and X-ray data.

The phase separation between the two X-ray peaks is approx. 144 deg (maximum to maximum) {{which is similar to}} the pulse peak separation observed in the radio band at 1. 4 GHz. The fraction of X-ray pulsed photons is approx. 30 %. A phase resolved spectral analysis confirms the nonthermal nature of the pulsed emission and finds power law slopes of alpha = 2. 4 (sup + 0. 52) (sub - 0. 42) and alpha = 1. 93 (sup + 0. 29) (sub - 0. 24) for the pulse peaks P 1 and P 2, respectively. The spectral emission properties observed for PSR B 0823 + 26 {{are similar to those of}} PSR B 0950 + 08. Its energy spectrum is very well described by a single power law with photon-index alpha = 2. 5 (sup + 0. 52) (sub - 0. 24. Three-sigma temperature upper limits for thermal contributions from a <b>hot</b> polar <b>cap</b> or from the entire neutron star surface are T(sup infinity) (sub pc) < 1. 17 x 10 (exp 6) K and T(sup infinity) (sub s) < 0. 5 x 10 (exp 6) K, respectively. There is evidence for pulsed X-ray emission at the - 97 % confidence level with a pulsed fraction of 49 +/- 22 %. For PSR 52043 + 2740 we report the first detection of X-ray emission. A power law spectrum, or a combination of a thermal and a power law spectrum all yield acceptable descriptions of its X-ray spectrum. No X-ray pulses are detected from PSR J 2043 + 2740 but the sensitivity is low - the 2 -sigma pulsed fraction upper limit is 57 % assuming a sinusoidal pulse profile...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} deep BVR-imaging {{of the field}} of the nearby {{millisecond}} pulsar PSR J 0030 + 0451 obtained with the ESO/VLT/FORS 2. We do not detect any optical counterpart down to B> 27. 3, V> 27. 0 and R> 27. 0 in the immediate vicinity of the radio pulsar position. The closest detected sources are offset by > 3 '', and they are excluded as counterpart candidates by our astrometry. Using our upper limits in the optical, and including recent XMM-Newton X-ray data we show that any nonthermal power-law spectral component of neutron star magnetospheric origin, as suggested by the interpretation of X-ray data, must be suppressed by at least a factor of ~ 500 in the optical range. This either rules out the nonthermal interpretation or suggests a dramatic spectral break in the 0. 003 - 0. 1 keV range of the power-law spectrum. Such a situation has never been observed in the optical/X-ray spectral region of ordinary pulsars, and the origin of such a break is unclear. An alternative interpretation with a purely thermal X-ray spectrum is consistent with our optical upper limits. In this case the X-ray emission is dominated by <b>hot</b> polar <b>caps</b> of the pulsar. Comment: 6 pages, LaTeX aa. cls style, 5 EPS figures.

40|$|A&A Letter, in pressContext: As is {{the case}} of several other Be stars, Achernar is {{surrounded}} by an envelope, recently detected by near-IR interferometry. Aims: We search for the signature of circumstellar emission at distances of a few stellar radii from Achernar, in the thermal IR domain. Methods: We obtained interferometric observations on three VLTI baselines in the N band (8 - 13 mic), using the MIDI instrument. Results: From the measured visibilities, we derive the angular extension and flux contribution of the N band circumstellar emission in the polar direction of Achernar. The interferometrically resolved polar envelope contributes 13. 4 +/- 2. 5 % of the photospheric flux in the N band, with a full width at half maximum of 9. 9 +/- 2. 3 mas (~ 6 Rstar). This flux contribution is in good agreement with the photometric IR excess of 10 - 20 % measured by fitting the spectral energy distribution. Due to our limited azimuth coverage, we can only establish an upper limit of 5 - 10 % for the equatorial envelope. We compare the observed properties of the envelope with an existing model of this star computed with the SIMECA code. Conclusions: The observed extended emission in the thermal IR along the polar direction of Achernar is well reproduced by the existing SIMECA model. Already detected at 2. 2 mic, this polar envelope is most probably an observational signature of the fast wind ejected by the <b>hot</b> polar <b>caps</b> of the star...|$|R
