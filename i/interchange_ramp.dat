5|$|What is now US 46 was {{originally}} designated as three separate routes. Pre-1927 Route 5 {{was created in}} 1916 to follow the road from Delaware to Denville, pre-1927 Route 12 in 1917 to follow the route between Hackettstown and Paterson, and pre-1927 Route 10 in 1917 to run between Paterson and Edgewater. In 1927, Route 6 was legislated to run from Delaware east to the George Washington Bridge, replacing portions of Routes 5 and 12 and paralleling the former Route 10, which itself became Route 5 and Route 10N, the latter being shortly removed from the state highway system. In 1936, US 46 was designated to run from US 611 in Portland, Pennsylvania east to the George Washington Bridge. The route replaced Pennsylvania Route 987 to the Delaware Bridge over the Delaware, and from there followed Route 6 across New Jersey. In 1953, the Route 6 designation was removed from US 46 in New Jersey, and later that year, the route was realigned to end at US 611 in Columbia, New Jersey, replacing a part of Route 94. US 611 had been brought into New Jersey by two new bridges over the Delaware River, following a freeway between them that {{became a part of}} I-80. In 1972, US 611 was aligned back into its original Pennsylvania route (which from 1953 until US 611 decommission was US 611 Alternate), and US 46’s western terminus remained as an <b>interchange</b> <b>ramp</b> with I-80 and Route 94.|$|E
500|$|A {{motorway}} connecting Zagreb to Varaždin and Budapest {{was proposed}} in the early 1970s, but unlike the ZagrebRijeka or ZagrebBelgrade motorways, no construction was actually carried out.

Although a 32-year concession for development of the motorway was awarded to Transeuropska Autocesta d.d.

The highway can also be accessed from the I-84 eastbound HOV lane, and westbound I-384 traffic can also access the HOV lane on westbound I-84. Westbound I-84 access to I-384 is provided through a complex interchange that also provides access from Pleasant Valley Road near Buckland Hills Mall and from I-291. I-384's first exit is for Spencer Street.

40|$|Consider a {{city with}} a highly compact central {{business}} district (CBD) in which commuters' origins are continuously dispersed. The travel demand is dependent on the total travel cost to the CBD. The transportation system is divided into two layers: major freeways and dense surface streets. Whereas the major freeway network is modeled according to the conventional discrete network approach, the dense surface streets are approximated as a continuum. Travelers to the CBD either travel on the continuum (surface streets) and then exchange to the discrete network (freeways) at an <b>interchange</b> (<b>ramp)</b> before moving to the CBD on the discrete network, or they travel directly to the CBD on the continuum. Specific travel cost-flow relationships for the two layers of transportation facilities are considered. A traffic equilibrium model is developed for this discrete-continuous transportation system in which for a particular origin no traveler can reduce his or her individual travel cost to the CBD by unilaterally changing routes. The problem is formulated as a simultaneous optimization program with two subproblems. One subproblem is a traffic assignment problem from the interchanges to the CBD in the discrete network, and the other is a traffic assignment problem with multiple centers (i. e., the interchange points and the CBD) in the continuous system. A Newtonian algorithm based on the sensitivity analyses of the two subproblems is proposed to solve the resultant simultaneous optimization program.
