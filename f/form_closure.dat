40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the {{characterisation}} and numerical modelling of advanced sheet metal components reinforced by light metal cast structures (SADH). The modelling is focused on full car simulation. One major aspect is the discretisation of <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> connections between sheet metal and aluminium cast structure which realise the compound between both materials. A SADH structure consists of a steel sheet metal and an integrated stiffening structure of aluminium. For the manufacturing process a perforated sheet metal is placed in a high pressure die casting tool before the casting. During the casting the holes of the sheet metal are filled with aluminium and a fixed <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> connection is generated. At a demonstrator structure of a SADH typical characteristics are named and analysed. Resulting from different thermal expansion coefficients and manufacturing temperatures residual stresses and distortion are analysed. Static loading tests are carried out to analyse the mechanical performance. For a virtual development process a numerical model of a SADH is generated. To model the material characteristics thermal loading test become necessary for the sheet metal. The sheet metal is exposed to a short and high thermal treatment during the high pressure die casting process which has to be considered for the material card. At a special <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> specimen manufacturing details are investigated. This specimen is further used to generate a loading profile of <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> connections under different conditions. Based on the test data a numerical model of the <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> connections is developed on full car modelling level. The verified <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> model is then transferred to the SADH structural model. Concluding the correlation between numerical calculation and experiments is shown on the SADH structural tests...|$|E

40|$|This thesis about {{immobilization}} of two- and three-dimensional objects. Immobilization {{is crucial}} to fixturing in manufacturing processes and to robot hand grasping. There are many types of immobility depending on the finger types and the analyses, such as <b>form</b> <b>closure,</b> force closure and second-order immobility. Among these, <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> {{is the basis of}} immobility. <b>Form</b> <b>closure</b> was formulated by Reuleaux in 1876. He defined a rigid body to be in <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> if a set of fingers along its boundary constrained all finite and infinitesimal motions of the body. Chater 1 and 2 introduce the background and the concepts of immobility of various types. Chater 3 to Chapter 8 are about efficiently identifying all these immobilizing grasps. For efficient synthesis of all form-closure grasps of planar objects, we use the geometric formulation of <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> in three-dimensional wrench space. Our problem in the formulation in wrench space states as follows: Given a set of shapes in three-dimensional space, report all sets of shapes, such that each set has four points whose convex hull contains the origin inside. We transform this geometric problem into intersection search problems on planes, which can be handled with techniques in Computational Geometry. In Chapter 3 and 4, we propose efficient algorithms to enumerate all combinations of concave vertices and edges or arcs of a polygon and a semi-algebraic set that allow at least one form-closure grasp with at most four frictionless point fingers. In Chapter 5, we efficiently identify all immobilizing grasps (called force-closure grasps) of a polygon and a semi-algebraic set with two or three frictional point fingers. In Chapter 6, we propose efficient output-sensitive algorithms to enumerate all immobilizing grasps called second-order immobility grasps, with two and three frictionless point fingers for a polygon. Chapter 7 is about grasps that are tolerant to misplacements of fingers. We first divide the edges into small pieces of length varepsilon. Then we compute all sets of concave vertices and edges of a polygon, such that any placement of three or four frictionless point fingers inside these edges will put the polygon in <b>form</b> <b>closure.</b> We call such a combination of concave vertices and edges an independent form-closure grasp region. Chapter 8 is on efficiently computing all combinations of faces, concave edges and concave vertices, such that four to seven frictionless point fingers on each of these combinations allow at least one form-closure grasp. In Chapter 9, we study the problem of immobilizing a serial chain of hinged polygons in a given placement with frictionless point fingers. We define new notions of immobility and robust immobility, which are comparable to second-order immobility and to <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> for a single rigid object. For each case, we show how many fingers can immobilize or robustly immobilize a given serial chain of hinged polygons, by constructing a grasp...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding a path among obstacles for an object {{that can only be}} moved by means of a so-called <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> grasp by four frictionless fingers. The goal is to determine if there is a preferable method to create a roadmap needed for solving the path planning problem. Along the path both the object and the fingers must avoid collisions with the obstacles. The presence of the obstacles may necessitate occasional regrasps, but we require that a <b>form</b> <b>closure</b> grasp of the object is maintained at all times. The problem will be split into two separate parts. First a grasp graph is constructed that connects grasps that can be reached from each other while maintaining <b>form</b> <b>closure.</b> We consider two different methods of regrasping.

30|$|When grasping, {{except for}} the structure, {{choosing}} a suitable grasping mode is also important. And analyzing the grasping mode can guide the design of mechanical structure of hand. Many researches have been presented on grasping taxonomies. Some of them attempt to categorize grasping modes by studying grasps of human hand while others study the physical and mechanical properties of the hand, the object, and the contact [22]. The physiological approach has many different classifications because the points they focused on are diverse. For instance, Cutkosky and Wright [23] focus on machine environment, Lyons [24] bases his classification on precision, and Iberall [25] wants to simplify the taxonomy by using virtual fingers [22]. All of these taxonomies are influenced by power grasping and precision grasping which were introduced by Napier [26].

Second, when the use of control groups is compared to Maki's method of isolation, it can be shown that Lawson implies substantially similar closure to that which is proposed by Maki.
