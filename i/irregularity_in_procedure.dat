50|$|In the British House of Commons, {{a motion}} or an {{amendment}} {{which is the}} same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be renewed again in that same session. Such substantive motions can be renewed in succeeding sessions as new motions. Reversals of earlier decisions {{can be done by}} Repeal of a Standing Order, Annulment, or Rescission. The repeal of a standing order is normally made as part of an order creating a new standard order. An annulment is used to declare proceedings to be null and void because of some form of <b>irregularity</b> <b>in</b> <b>procedure.</b> Renewals {{in the form of a}} rescission of a resolution made in earlier sessions is not prohibited by the practice of the House of Commons, but is seldom done. Technically it is regarded as a new question: the form being to read the previous resolution of the House and to move that it be rescinded. This power of rescission has been used sparingly and then only in the case of substantive motions. The reasons why open rescission is so rare is that the House instinctively realizes that parliamentary government requires the majority to abide by a decision regularly come to, however unexpected, and that it is unfair to resort to methods, whether direct or indirect, to reverse such a decision. Essentially this is a safeguard for the rights of the minority.|$|E
50|$|During the 2004-2005 season, Doru Viorel Ursu {{served as}} President of the Romanian Football Federation's Disciplinary Commission; he {{resigned}} in May 2005, citing <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> <b>procedures</b> (according to Ursu, sanctions for misconduct prescribed for local soccer clubs were regularly below standards imposed by FIFA).|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, Iunian {{was called}} {{as a witness}} {{in the trial of}} Petre Constantinescu-Iaşi and other seven members of the Romanian Communist Party, which was housed <b>in</b> Chişinău. Witnessing <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> <b>procedures</b> (such as Romanian Army {{soldiers}} guarding the hall), he stated: [...] "I shall not lend myself to a farce. I did not know, upon arriving here, that {{it was to be a}} simulacrum".|$|R
25|$|In 1979, Susan Blackmore {{visited the}} {{laboratories}} of Carl Sargent in Cambridge. She noticed {{a number of}} <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the <b>procedure</b> and wrote about them for the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there are}} two Unions at the University of Glasgow, most {{students}} choose to only join one of them [...] Some students think that joining both is not allowed, but many first years join both before deciding which union they prefer. In 2003-2004, both Unions attempted to change their Constitutions to allow for Automatic Joint Student Membership. The QMU successfully made the required changes, but due to an <b>irregularity</b> <b>in</b> <b>procedures,</b> the GUU did not put the matter to a vote and the process was abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|In Albania, Greeks are {{considered}} a [...] "national minority". There were no reliable statistics {{on the size of}} any ethnic minorities, while the latest official census (2011) has been widely disputed due to boycott and <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the <b>procedure.</b>|$|R

25|$|A party {{committee}} which included Ion Popescu-Puțuri investigated {{the matter of}} his arrest and interrogation, concluding that evidence against Pătrășcanu was fabricated, {{that he had been}} systematically beaten and otherwise ill-treated, and that a confession had been prepared for him to sign. This was coupled with various <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> <b>procedures</b> (such as the court having been given only 24 hours to assess evidence from years of investigation, and the death penalty having been decided by the party leadership before being imposed on the panel of judges). Evidence was also presented that some of the false confessions were designed as political weapons in internal party struggles (implicating names of politicians who were not facing trial at the time).|$|R
50|$|Since 2009, {{various people}} have been arrested in the provinces of Catanzaro, Crotone and Reggio Calabria in {{connection}} with organised crime; alleged offences include insurance fraud, the sale of bogus degrees, fraud in relation to grants and subsidies, collusion with the Mafia, forgery, <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> tendering <b>procedures,</b> extortion, murder, electoral fraud, supply of drugs and intimidation.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a letter}} to the War Office, in December 1953, {{to be found in the}} British archives, Erskine made this candid admission: [...] "There is no doubt that in the early days, i.e. from Oct 1952 until last June there was a great deal of {{indiscriminate}} shooting by Army and Police. I am quite certain prisoners were beaten to extract information." [...] To avoid a scandal, McLean's inquiry, therefore, drew a veil of official secrecy over the first eight months of the emergency. Though McLean went carefully into the details of the Chuka affair, his final report was a whitewash. He concluded that, whilst there may have been some <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> <b>procedures</b> by some units, the conduct of the British army in Kenya [...] "under difficult and arduous circumstances, showed that measure of restraint backed by good discipline which this country has traditionally expected".|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} riots, {{a wave of}} arrests—more than 150 persons—was criticized by human rights groups, {{highlighting}} <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the <b>procedures</b> and denial by the authorities to monitor their detention conditions. The owner of Beehive Radio, Mom Sonando, and Chan Sivutha, Editor-in-Chief of Reaksmei Angkor, were both arrested without warrants, charged with incitement to commit a crime, incitement to discrimination and announcement of false information. They were later on released on bail and no trial was ever held.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 February 2009 Geoff Southern and Shona Pitman {{pleaded guilty}} in the Magistrate's Court to charges of contravening the Public Elections Law with respect to <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> postal voting <b>procedure,</b> and were {{referred}} to the Royal Court for sentencing. They have also faced calls to annul {{the result of the}} election.|$|R
50|$|Bouvier and {{co-defendant}} Tania Rappo, who {{is accused}} of money laundering in the fraud, attempted to have charges against them thrown out in November 2015. They argued that {{there were a number of}} <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the legal <b>procedure</b> against them and that Rybolovlev, as a prominent citizen in Monaco, may have exercised undue influence.|$|R
50|$|Wall became President of Bradford Trades Council in 1973, and in 1981 {{he won a}} re{{selection}} {{battle against}} the sitting MP for Bradford North, Ben Ford, by 35 votes to 28. Ford alleged <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the selection <b>procedure</b> and it was re-run, but Wall won again, this time by 49 votes to 12, and replaced Ford as the Labour candidate.|$|R
50|$|Due to the <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> {{the census}} <b>procedure,</b> Omonoia representatives {{conducted}} another census {{in order to}} count {{the members of the}} ethnic Greek minority. According to this a total of 286,852 individuals were counted, which equals to ca. 10% {{of the population of the}} country. During the time the census was conducted, half of this number resided permanently in Greece, but maintained strong contacts with its homeland.|$|R
5000|$|Polling day was {{monitored}} by international observers. Final results gave an absolute majority (31 seats) to the left-leaning MLSTP-PSD, which had fallen short of this edge {{by only one}} seat in 1994. In this context, ADI alleged <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the voting <b>procedure.</b> The victors promptly announced that their priority would be to reorganize the economy and thus alleviate the widespread poverty plaguing the nation.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the June election, {{opposition}} parties and election observers raised concerns over {{fairness of the}} election conduct, with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) denouncing the process as 'unfair'. The Organisation for Security and Co-operarion in Europe (OSCE) claimed that concerns over media bias and voter safety cast a 'shadow' over the results, while political parties expressed suspicions over a controversial collapse in the Supreme Electoral Council's ballot tracking systems during the counting process as well as <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the voting <b>procedure.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} of the Himarë region is 11,257 inhabitants, with the ethnic composition of both the town and region predominantly Greek. The town of Himarë and the settlements of Dhërmi and Palasë, which account {{for the bulk of}} the region's population, are inhabited by Greeks, while Pilur, Kudhës, Vuno and Ilias are populated by an Orthodox Albanian population. The village of Qeparo is inhabited by both Greeks (upper neighbourhood) and an Orthodox Albanian population (lower neighbourhood). On the other hand, the latest official census in Albania (2011), which has been widely disputed due to <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the <b>procedure,</b> and its results affected by boycott by part of the Greek minority, shows that 60.38% were registered as Albanians, 24.56% as Greeks and 14.00% preferred not to declare any ethnicity at all. Comparatively, the 2015 Albanian Civil Registry offices suggested a municipal {{population of}} 27,049 people, mostly {{as a result of the}} Greek community's boycotting of the 2011 census where it recorded only 5,738 people.|$|R
40|$|Public {{procurement}} is {{an important}} part of the current economic reality. The economic development of Romanian companies taking part in the bidding process closely depends on the national public system and it cannot be achieved without an efficient and correct procurement process. This study is focused on the irregularities found as a result of a complex research regarding the public procurement system. The main objective of this research is to build a model- an applicable strategy for identifying <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> procurement <b>procedures</b> and, as such avoiding them, by taking into consideration the particularities of the bidding process, its content and methods. The number of procurement appeals gives information about participant companies’ level of dissatisfaction, while the number of the admitted appeals shows the real leaks from the system. Considering these aspects, the current paper discusses about the public procurement process and it presents the critical phases of the public procurement procedure, by emphasizing the possible weaknesses and activities that can generate <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> this area. Thus, by analyzing the content of many officially admitted complaints related to the public bidding process, the paper reveals the main problematic aspects of the public procurement system, contributing thus to improvement and increased satisfaction for all participants taking part in the process...|$|R
50|$|In March 1933, an {{argument}} arose over <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the voting <b>procedure.</b> The Social Democratic {{president of the}} National Council (the lower house of parliament) Karl Renner resigned {{to be able to}} cast a vote as a parliament member. As a consequence, the two vice presidents, belonging to other parties, resigned as well to be able to vote. Without a president, the parliament could not conclude the session. Dollfuss took the three resignations as a pretext to declare that the National Council had become unworkable, and advised President Wilhelm Miklas to issue a decree adjourning it indefinitely. When the National Council wanted to reconvene days after the resignation of the three presidents, Dollfuss had police bar entrance to parliament, effectively eliminating democracy in Austria. From that point onwards, he governed as dictator by emergency decree with absolute power.|$|R
40|$|Initial {{experience}} in transdermal administration of Restylane SubQ for augmentation of {{the cheek and}} chin suggests that the product is easy to administer via this route and that it provides a stable aesthetic result. Local adverse reactions {{are consistent with those}} expected of an alloplastic filler material and appear {{to be related to the}} injection procedure/site rather than to the product itself. In the event of overcorrection or the appearance of superficial irregularities (nodules), any excess material can readily be removed by needle aspiration. Several measures can be taken to increase the likelihood of a satisfactory aesthetic outcome and minimize the risk of treatment complications with Restylane SubQ. One such measure is to deposit the product in small aliquots at multiple sites (using a multiple tunneling technique) to avoid pooling within the soft tissues. Treatment sites with poor soft-tissue cover pose a chal-lenge because of the high risk of surface <b>irregularities.</b> <b>In</b> cheek augmentation <b>procedures,</b> Restylane SubQ should be placed below the zygomatic arch where the subcutaneous tissue is more fibrous, thereby providing a possible barrier to implant mobility. The chin appears to be particularly well suited to volume augmentation with Restylane SubQ because its dense fibrous tissue creates naturally occurring pockets for product placement. In summary, transdermal administration of Restylane SubQ is a convenient, noninvasive procedure for chin and cheek contouring and for rejuvenation of the mid an...|$|R
