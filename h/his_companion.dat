2500|$|Ibn Taymiyyah (1263 to 1328) said: [...] "Muawiyah did {{not call}} {{himself to be a}} khaleefah and was not given the oath of {{allegiance}} to it when he fought Ali. He fought not because he considered himself to be the khaleef or deserving of the khilaafah. This they all agreed upon and he himself would affirm this to whomever asked him. He and <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> did not consider it permissible that they initiate the fight against Ali and <b>his</b> <b>companions.</b> But Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> believed that Muawiyah and <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> must pledge allegiance and show obedience to Ali, due to his authority such that there be only one khaleefah for the Muslims. Considering them defecting from this obligation he decided that Muawiyah and <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> should be fought until they fulfilled it. All this so that obedience and unity occur. Muawiyah and <b>his</b> <b>companions</b> did not see that it was obligatory upon them and if they were fought against they would consider themselves oppressed because Uthman was killed oppressively as was agreed by all the Muslims at the time and his killers were in Ali's camp, he having authority over them" ...|$|R

5|$|Scott {{was given}} {{leave from the}} Navy to write the {{official}} expedition account, The Voyage of the Discovery; this was published in 1905, and sold well. However, Scott's account {{in the book of}} Shackleton's breakdown during the southern journey led to disagreement between the two men, particularly over Scott's version {{of the extent to which}} <b>his</b> <b>companion</b> had been carried on the sledge. The implication was that Shackleton's breakdown had caused the relatively unimpressive southern record.|$|E

5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of <b>his</b> <b>Companion</b> cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|At 03:30 on 16 October, another sail {{was spotted}} to the southwest, rapidly {{revealed}} to be a second British frigate, the 38-gun HMS Ethalion under Captain James Young. Ethalion joined the chase and at dawn two more sails were sighted, the 32-gun HMS Alcmene under Captain Henry Digby {{to the west and}} 32-gun HMS Triton under Captain John Gore to the north. With four British frigates now in full pursuit, the Spanish captains sought to split their enemy and divided, at which Pierrepont directed Ethalion, the closest British ship, to pursue the faster Thetis. Young complied, firing long-range shot in Santa Brigidas direction at 09:00, driving Pillon's ship further from <b>his</b> <b>companion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and <b>his</b> <b>companion</b> were separated, made the {{decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode.

A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would really happen.|$|E
