25|$|Stoke Newington East and West Reservoirs, to {{the north}} of Clissold Park, are quite {{substantial}} for urban facilities. Stoke Newington Reservoirs were constructed in 1833 to purify the New River water and to act as a water reserve. The West Reservoir is now a leisure facility, offering sailing, canoeing and other water sports, plus Royal Yachting Association-approved sailing courses. On its western edge stands the former <b>filter</b> <b>house,</b> now set out as a visitor centre with a café; some of the old hydraulic machinery can be viewed in the main hall. The pumping station at the reservoir gates, converted to a climbing centre in 1995 was designed in a distinctive castellated style by Robert Billings under the supervision of William Chadwell Mylne and built in 1854–56.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents an}} As Low As Reasonably Achievable Control Technology (ALARACT) demonstration for evaluating corrosion on the I-beam supporting <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> No. 9 for the 291 -A-l emission {{unit of the}} Plutonium-Uranium Extraction (PUREX) Facility, located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Site. The PUREX facility is currently in surveillance and maintenance mode. During a State of Washington, Department of Health (WDOH) 291 -A-l emission unit inspection, {{a small amount of}} corrosion was observed {{at the base of a}} high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) <b>filter</b> <b>housing.</b> A series of internal and external inspections identified the source of the corrosion material as oxidation of a small section of one of the carbon steel I-beams that provides support to the stainless steel <b>filter</b> <b>housing.</b> The inspections confirmed the corrosion is isolated to one I-beam support location and does not represent any compromise of the structural support or <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> integrity. Further testing and inspections of the support beam corrosion and its cause were conducted but did not determine the cause. No definitive evidence was found to support any degradation of the housing. Although no degradation of the housing was found, a conservative approach will be implemented. The following actions will be taken: (1) The current operating <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> No. 9 will be removed from service. (2) The only remaining available filter housings (No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3) will be placed in service. These filter housings have new HEPA filters fitted with stainless steel frames and faceguards which were installed in the spring of 2007. (3) Filter housings No. 5 and No. 10 will be put on standby as backups. To document the assessment of the unit, a draft ALARACT <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> demonstration for the PUREX <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> was prepared, and informally provided to WDOH on August 7, 2008. A follow up WDOH response to the draft ALARACT <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> demonstration for the PUREX <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> questioned whether deteriorated galvanized filter faceguards discovered during an internal <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> inspection met American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) AG-l or Military Specification (MIL) 51068 standards. The filter system was designed and installed prior to the issuance of AG-l, February 1986; however, MIL 51068 did require galvanized faceguards. The faceguards are not necessary for filtration or structural purposes; it is concluded that the system is in compliance with the intent of the applicable standard. Appendix B provides supporting information to address this issue...|$|R

40|$|The tilt {{after-effect}} (TAE) {{is thought}} to be a manifestation of gain control in mechanisms selective for spatial orientation in visual stimuli. It has been demonstrated with luminance-defined stripes, contrast-defined stripes, orientation-defined stripes, and even with natural images. Of course, all images can be decomposed into a sum of stripes, so it should not be surprising to find a TAE when adapting and test images contain stripes that differ by 15 ° or so. We show this latter condition is not necessary for the TAE with natural images: adaptation to slightly tilted and vertically <b>filtered</b> <b>houses</b> produced a “repulsive” bias in the perceived orientation of horizontally <b>filtered</b> <b>houses.</b> These results suggest gain control in mechanisms selective for spatial orientation in natural images...|$|R

50|$|In a {{mechanical}} compression chiller technology, the coolant {{is circulated through}} a chilling coil heat exchanger that is inserted in the <b>filter</b> <b>house,</b> downstream from the filtering stage. Downstream from the coil, a droplet catcher is installed to collect moisture and water drops. The mechanical chiller can increase the turbine output and performance better than wetted technologies {{due to the fact}} that inlet air can be chilled below the wet bulb temperature, indifferent to the weather conditions. Compression chiller equipment has higher electricity consumption than evaporative systems. Initial capital cost is also higher, however turbine power augmentation and efficiency is maximized, and the extra-cost is amortized due to increased output power.|$|E
