40|$|P>Background: Mould-attributed {{symptoms}} {{have included}} features which overlap with unexplained syndromes such as sick building syndrome. Objectives: We describe questionnaire and chart review findings in patients following exposure to moulds which include Stachybotrys and compare responses with two control groups. Methods: Thirty-two patients presented with symptoms attributed to mould exposures. Exposure identification for 25 patients had reported S tachybotrys chartarum {{as well as}} other mould (Aspergillus, Penicillium), 88 % at work. The remaining seven had professionally visualized or self-reported/photographic exposure evidence only. A chart review was performed and a follow-up with a questionnaire, including questions on current health status, and nonspecific symptoms. Results: Cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness (at presentation) were reported in 79 %, 70 % and 64 %, respectively, and persisted > 6 weeks in 91 %. Skin test(s) were positive to fungal extract(s) in 30 %. Seventeen returned questionnaires were obtained 3. 1 (SD 0. 5) years after the initial clinic assessment. Among this subgroup, persisting asthma-like symptoms and symptoms suggestive of sick building syndrome were frequent, and similar to a group previously assessed for darkroom disease among medical radiation technologists. The mould-exposed group more commonly reported they were bothered when walking in a room with carpets, complained of a chemical or metallic taste in their mouth, and had problems in concentration when compared with a control physiotherapist group (P < 0. 005). Conclusions: Although only a minority with health concerns from indoor mould exposure had demonstrable mould-allergy, a significant proportion had asthma-like symptoms. Other symptoms were also common and persistent after the initial implicated <b>exposure.</b> <b>Centre</b> for Research Excellence in Occupational Disease, TorontoCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Brazi...|$|E

40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections {{have been}} {{confined}} to healthcare centres for decades. However, MRSA infections are increasingly seen in young healthy individuals with no <b>exposure</b> to healthcare <b>centres.</b> These community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains differ from healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains in various ways. For example, CA-MRSA is strongly associated with the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV and the toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin. CA-MRSA spreads relatively easily but often remains susceptible to non- 3 -lactam antibiotics. Given the epidemic potential of CA-MRSA strains, {{there is a high}} probability that the number of CA-MRSA infections will increase in The Netherlands. In order to prevent and control CA-MRSA outbreaks in the community successfully, the restrictive Dutch antibiotic policy must be followed with strict infection prevention measure...|$|R
30|$|ConclusionsThe {{results of}} this {{investigation}} proved that maize pollen were dispersed by wind to distances farther than 250  m from field edge leading to maize pollen <b>exposure</b> in the <b>centre</b> of the nature reserve. The results also demonstrated that foraging NTOs living in the nature reserve were exposed to maize pollen from surrounding fields. Considering the cultivation of Bt-maize MON 810, the assumption of the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) {{that there will be}} no relevant exposure beyond the Bt-maize fields, cannot be confirmed. Considering the {{results of this}} and related studies and with respect to the precautionary principle, one can state that buffer zones between Bt-maize fields and protected areas are an effective measure to minimise the exposure of Bt-maize pollen to NTOs and, thus, to prevent from adverse effects.|$|R
40|$|Objective. This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the relationship between}} severity of visual impairment and depression among elderly Malaysians attending an eye clinic. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study. The study population included patients, aged >= 60 years who attended the Eye Clinic in University Malaya Medical <b>Centre.</b> <b>Exposure</b> measurement was based on ophthalmologic examinations by an ophthalmologist. Data on outcome were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Results. After adjusting for important confounders, severity of visual impairment either having low vision or blind were independent risk factors of depression. The odds of developing depression among elderly with low vision were 2 times more than those with normal vision, and elderly who were blind had almost 5 times the odds to be depressed compared with those having normal vision. Conclusion. Findings from this study suggest {{a positive relationship between}} the severity of visual impairment and depression among elderly Malaysians...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReal–time {{concentrations}} of PM 10 were monitored over a 24 hour period {{for a number}} of different subjects as part of an investigation to examine the influence of daily activities and locations on the personal <b>exposure</b> of city <b>centre</b> office workers to air pollution. The resulting data comprised time series plots consisting of a series of peaks and troughs as a result of exposure to the differing sources of particulate matter subjects were encountering as well as the underlying background concentration. In order to separate the background concentration component from the data a number of baseflow separation techniques were employed, commonly used in stream–flow hydrology. Filter separation and frequency analysis techniques were examined comparing their predictions of background concentration with urban background concentration measurements for reference. The results of this investigation highlight a number of different approaches to separating background concentration from real–time personal exposure data. These methods will enable further investigation of purely activity and location based personal exposures as well as improvements in the numerical modelling of air pollution exposure in future. The results of this investigation also demonstrate a novel synergy in methods of analysis between the fields of air pollution and hydrology...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{and assess the}} contributions of major risk factors for campylobacteriosis in New Zealand. DESIGN: Case-control study. Home interviews were conducted over nine months using a standardised questionnaire to assess recent food consumption and other <b>exposures.</b> SETTING: Four <b>centres</b> in New Zealand with high notification rates of campylobacter infections [...] Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, and Christchurch. PARTICIPANTS: Case patients were 621 people notified between 1 June 1994 and 28 February 1995 as having campylobacter infection. Control subjects were selected randomly from telephone directories, and were matched 1 : 1 with case patients in relation to sex, age group, and home telephone prefix. RESULTS: Risk of campylobacteriosis was strongly associated with recent consumption of raw or undercooked chicken (matched odds ratio 4. 52, 95 % confidence interval 2. 88, 7. 10). There was also an increased risk with chicken eaten in restaurants (matched odds ratio 3. 85; 2. 52, 5. 88). Recent consumption of baked or roasted chicken seemed to be protective. Campylobacteriosis was also associated with recent overseas travel, rainwater {{as a source of}} water at home, consumption of raw dairy products, and contact with puppies and cattle, particularly calves. CONCLUSIONS: Improperly cooked chicken seems to be associated with a large proportion of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand. Thorough cooking of chicken in homes and restaurants could reduce considerably the incidence of this disease...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe studied {{respiratory}} problems among vendors exposed to cooking fumes in an open-air hawker <b>centre.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to cooking fumes {{from either the}} use of fossil fuels or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) {{has been shown to}} be associated with adverse respiratory health effects. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 67 food vendors exposed to cooking fumes as well as 18 merchandise sellers at an open-air hawker centre in Brunei Darussalam. Past medical and smoking history and exposure to cooking fumes were obtained. The validated American Thoracic Society (ATS) Questionnaire with a translated Malay version was used to ask for respiratory symptoms. Results Compared to merchandise sellers (n= 18), cooking vendors (n= 67) had a higher self-reported respiratory symptoms (50. 7 % for those cooking and 33. 3 % for merchandise sellers). Cough (28. 3 %) was the main respiratory symptom experienced in cooking vendors and breathlessness (22. 2 %) among merchandise sellers. Half (50. 0 %) of cooking vendors who worked for more than 10 years had cough and 27. 3 % had phlegm. Those cooking with charcoal were two times more likely to have cough than those cooking with LPG. Cooking vendors with a job duration of more than 10 years were thrice more likely to have cough. Conclusion Cooking vendors in the open air hawker centre exposed to cooking fumes had more respiratory symptoms compared to non-exposed merchandise sellers. The type of fuel used for cooking and duration of work were associated with increased prevalence of cough...|$|R
40|$|Invasive candidiasis, {{including}} candidemia and deep-seated Candida infections, is {{a severe}} opportunistic infection {{with an overall}} mortality in ICU patients {{comparable to that of}} severe sepsis/septic shock. With an incidence ranging from 5 to 10 cases per 1000 ICU admissions, invasive candidiasis represents 510 % of all ICU-acquired infections. Although a high proportion of critically ill patients is colonised with Candida spp., only 540 % develop an invasive infection. The occurrence of this complication is difficult to predict and an early diagnosis remains a major challenge. Indeed, blood cultures are positive in a minority of cases and often late in the course of infection. New non-culture based laboratory techniques may contribute to early diagnosis and management of invasive candidiasis. Recent data suggest that prediction rules based on risk factors, clinical and microbiological parameters or monitoring of Candida colonisation may efficiently identify critically ill patients at high risk of invasive candidiasis who may benefit of preventive or pre-emptive antifungal therapy. In many cancer <b>centres,</b> <b>exposure</b> to azoles antifungals has been associated with an epidemiological shift from Candida albicans to non-albicans Candida species with reduced antifungal susceptibility or intrinsic resistance. This trend has not been observed in recent surveys on candidemia in non-immunocompromised ICU patients. Prophylaxis, pre-emptive or empirical antifungal treatment are possible approaches for prevention or early management of invasive candidiasis. However, the selection of high-risk patients remains critical for an efficient management aimed at reducing the number needed to treat and thus avoiding unnecessary treatments associated with the emergence of resistance, drug toxicity and costs...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{gastroenteritis}} (AGE) morbidity {{remains high}} amongst preschool children, posing a significant societal burden. Empirical data on AGE-causing agents {{is needed to}} gauge their clinical relevance and identify agent-specific targets for control. We assessed the prevalence, risk factors and association with symptoms for enteropathogens in households with preschool children. A monthly-repeated cross-sectional survey of enteropathogens in households with preschool children was performed. A parent-child pair per household (n = 907 households) provided faecal samples and reported their symptoms and potential risk exposures. Samples were tested by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 19 enteropathogens. Associations were assessed using logistic regression. 28. 3 % of children (n = 981) and 15. 6 % of parents (n = 971) carried pathogenic bacteria and/or Escherichia coli-associated pathogenicity genes, and 6. 5 % and 3. 3 % carried viruses, respectively. Giardia lamblia (4. 6 % of children, 2. 5 % of parents) and Dientamoeba fragilis (36 %, 39 %, respectively) were the main parasites, and were associated with pet exposure. Living in rural areas was associated with carriage of pathogenic E. coli, norovirus I and D. fragilis. Pathogenic E. coli was associated with summertime and livestock <b>exposure.</b> Attending day-care <b>centres</b> increased the risk of carrying norovirus, sapovirus and G. lamblia. Viruses occurred mainly in winter and were associated with AGE symptoms. Childparent associations were found for bacterial pathogenicity genes, viruses, G. lamblia and D. fragilis. Enteropathogens spread widely in households with preschool children, particularly viruses, which more often cause symptoms. While bacteria predominate during summer and in those exposed to livestock, viruses predominate in wintertime and, like G. lamblia, are widespread amongst day-care centre attendees...|$|R
40|$|Bank of Venice Venice was {{traditionally}} a {{very wealthy}} city {{leading to the}} introduction of the first banks by the influential Medici family. It is only fitting that given my site just behind the Piazza, with not too much <b>exposure</b> but still <b>centre</b> location that I design a bank to fit this area. By choosing the site behind the Piazza I am maintaining the integrity of the renowned St. Marks Square and allow my building to have more freedom in its design. When designing any bank security is a big issue, hence the basement level being below the ground and surrounded by water on three of its four sides. The ground level aims to create a space that is not overwhelming but still gives a sense of privacy for the clients entering the banking hall. The double height ceiling in the entrance hall opens up the space to look at the surrounding canals and lets vast amounts of light in. The overhanging first floor offices creates a more closed in space over the teller areas for privacy whilst still allowing the staff to enjoy the view and have the ability to observe the happenings in the banking hall. The cladding modernises the Bank whilst still maintaining influences from Venice itself. The texture of the roof implies that of the sandstone of the surrounding buildings whilst the shape of the roofing windows allows maximum penetration of light. The windows on the north side mimic the shape of the first floor offices and the teller booths below to give the building a cohesive feel. The entrance over a canal via a bridge gives the bank a sense of grandeur without the elaborate ornamentation and decoration and also offers the sense of security. The bank sits in harmony with the surrounding older buildings whilst still maintaining a newer style. DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{implicit}} cognition {{suggest that}} behaviour is partly influenced by automatic processes of perception and memory (implicit cognition). An important implication of these theories is that patient self−report may not capture influential processes in psychological disorders (as {{some of these}} processes may not be available to self-report). For example, a patient may report that {{they are no longer}} anxious (based on their current awareness or willingness to disclose) but may retain implicit/hidden processing biases (e. g., in sensitivity to threat) that leave them vulnerable to relapse in the future. Evidence suggests that, for various psychological disorders, relapse following temporarily successful treatment is not uncommon; the literature around implicit cognition may help to improve understanding of relapse processes. Investigation of implicit cognition has further clinical implications: for enhancing our comprehension of how existing treatment may be effective (e. g., through implicit and/or explicit processes) and of how to develop treatment that influences implicit (in addition to explicit) cognition. Researchers have now developed a number of methods for accessing/measuring implicit processes and these have been shown to predict behaviour in various psychological disorders. An important question arising from the literature around implicit cognition and its potential role in psychopathology is: do existing treatment interventions affect implicit processes? More broadly, how malleable are implicit processes? Can implicit processes be changed in a way that supports desired functioning? Research to date is limited and contradictory in its findings. The present research contributed to knowledge by examining the effects of two treatment−analogue interventions on implicit relational processes. The two interventions (exposure and acceptance/defusion) examined in the present research were based on existing clinical treatments. Spider fear was examined as a test construct in this research. The present research applied an implicit assessment procedure, intervention, and interpretive framework deriving from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (and the underlying Relational Frame Theory). In this way, the present research attempted to draw together theoretically coherent aspects of basic and applied psychology to better understand the constructs of interest. Towards the aim of testing the impact of brief exposure and acceptance interventions on implicit verbal relations in spider-fear (in addition to spider-fear-related self-report and behavioural indices), three specific objectives were identified: 1. To examine effects of exposure and acceptance interventions on implicit (and explicit) measures of spider fear 2. To test the predictive relationship between implicit (and explicit) spider fear and spider-approach behaviour 3. Combining the above, to examine intervention effects on behaviour (directly and/or via fear measures). 48 participants (from a non-clinical sample) were randomly allocated to receive one of the two interventions. Participants completed pre− and post−intervention measures of implicit (and explicit) spider fear and a post−intervention behavioural approach test. Implicit fear incrementally predicted behaviour over explicit fear, replicating previous findings. However, neither intervention appeared to affect implicit fear. Interventions did have differential effects on explicit fear and overt behaviour; notably, defusion facilitated greater approach behaviour than <b>exposure.</b> Discussion <b>centres</b> on clinical and theoretical implications of the research, considering limitations and directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the availability of}} information from poisons centres and other sources that would characterise the nature of accidental exposure to household chemical products to improve risk management. The DeNaMiC project was funded by European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and {{was carried out by}} the poisons centres in Göttingen, Lille, London and Prague, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the World Health Organization and the Health Protection Agency (UK). Method: The project involved developing an analytical tool to compare data on accidental poisoning obtained from the published literature, poisons centre annual reports and official mortality and morbidity statistics, and comparing and mapping the data collection and product classification schemes used by three poisons centres (Göttingen, Lille and London). A retrospective analysis of 3 years of enquiry data from Göttingen and Lille was also carried out to determine routinely available data on circumstances of <b>exposure.</b> European poisons <b>centres</b> were surveyed to {{determine the}} availability of data useful for product risk assessment. In addition, an analysis of published literature on toxicovigilance and a survey of toxicovigilance activities of European poisons centres was carried out. Finally, the project explored the feasibility of using poisons centres to obtain additional information about circumstances of exposure through a prospective followup study. Results: A range of publicly available data on accidental exposures was found; however, this provided little on the circumstances of exposure and could only be compared qualitatively. The product classification schemes used by three poisons centres showed some degree of comparability for household products. European poisons centres collected the same base data set but varied in collecting data relevant for risk assessment. European poisons centres varied in their understanding of ‘toxicovigilance’ but most stated that they perform it. It was possible to collect additional prospective data on exposures to household products relevant for risk assessment and management. Conclusions: Poisons centres are an important potential source of data useful for product risk assessment and management. In most cases, however, this requires additional work that needs to be resourced. Cooperation between poisons centres and industry can contribute to improving product safety...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} a continuous palaeoclimatic record for northern Australia covering the period ~ 60 - 14 ka BP. Novel geochemical techniques {{are applied to}} more than 500 fossil ostracods extracted from the well established lacustrine sequence of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Located between Papua New Guinea and Australia, the Gulf of Carpentaria was disconnected from both Pacific and Indian Ocean when global sea level was 53 m (or lower) below present sea level with sedimentological and geochemical evidence suggesting the dominance of a lacustrine environment after MIS 4. During this time period, the lake extent underwent wide oscillation from a maximal covered area of 190 000 km 2 to totally empty with periods of subaerial <b>exposure</b> in the <b>centre</b> of the basin. Although {{the environment of the}} gulf has been previously characterized for the last glacial cycle, palaeoclimatic inferences using the lake sequence have remained challenging due to episodes of marine water inflow and strong seasonality. Methodological and analytical developments were used to measure Na/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, Fe/Ca, U/Ca ratios and δ 18 O, δ 13 C values on individual ostracod valves of typical weights 40 - 60 μg. Inferences about the palaeolake water-level and salinity are drawn from the ostracod element-to-calcium ratios and stable-isotope values. The chemical evolution of the palaeowater, inferred from the ostracod relative concentrations Na/Mg/Sr/Ba, is compared to the chemical signature of the rivers draining the modern Carpentaria basin. The combined use of these techniques allows precise reconstruction of the basin‟s hydrological history. Wide climatic variations were recorded by the ostracod chemical and isotopic composition and reflect the changing state of the Australian monsoon through time. The monsoon appears weaker/absent during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), although irregular precipitation patterns during this time provoked the oscillations of the palaeolake water-level. Immediately after the LGM, the monsoon progressively developed over northern Australia until 15 ka BP. This causes the rivers from the far south of the basin to reconnect with the palaeolake. Finally, this work provides new tools for future studies using ostracod shell chemistry as proxy of environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Particulate air {{pollution}} {{has been associated}} with excess deaths from, and increases in hospital admissions for, cardiovascular disease among older people. A study was undertaken to determine whether this may be a consequence of alterations in the blood, secondary to pulmonary inflammation caused by the action of fine particles on alveolar cells, by repeatedly measuring haematological factors in older people and relating them to measurements of exposure to airborne particles.  METHODS—One hundred and twelve individuals aged 60 + years in two UK cities provided repeated blood samples over 18 months, 108 providing the maximum of 12 samples. Estimates of individual exposure to particles of less than 10 µm diameter (PM 10), derived from a mathematical model based on activity diaries and comparative measurements of PM 10 at multiple sites and during a variety of activities, were made for each three day period prior to blood sampling. The relationships between blood values and estimates of both personal <b>exposure</b> and city <b>centre</b> measurements of PM 10 were investigated by analysis of covariance, adjusting for city, season, temperature, and repeated individual measurements.  RESULTS—Estimated personal exposure to PM 10 over the previous three days showed negative correlations with haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume (PCV), and red blood cell count (p< 0. 001), and with platelets and factor VII levels (p< 0. 05). The changes in red cell indices persisted after adjustment for plasma albumin in a sample of 60 of the subjects. City centre PM 10 measurements over three days also showed negative correlations with haemoglobin and red cell count (p< 0. 001) and with PCV and fibrinogen (p< 0. 05), the relationship with haemoglobin persisting after adjustment for albumin. C reactive protein levels showed a positive association with city centre measurements of PM 10 (p< 0. 01). Based on a linear relationship, the estimated change in haemoglobin associated with an alteration in particle concentration of 100 µg/m 3 is estimated to have been 0. 44 g/dl (95 % CI 0. 62 to 0. 26) for personal PM 10 and 0. 73 g/dl (95 % CI 1. 11 to 0. 36) for city centre PM 10 measurements.  CONCLUSIONS—This investigation is the first to estimate personal exposures to PM 10 and to demonstrate associations between haematological indices and {{air pollution}}. The changes in haemoglobin adjusted for albumin suggest that inhalation of some component of PM 10 may cause sequestration of red cells in the circulation. We propose that an action of such particles either on lung endothelial cells or on erythrocytes themselves may be responsible for changing red cell adhesiveness. Peripheral sequestration of red cells offers an explanation for the observed cardiovascular effects of particulate air pollution. ...|$|R
