50|$|Class C {{airspace}} {{is defined}} below 8100 m and allows IFR and VFR operations. Both IFR and VFR operations {{are required to}} have permanent two-way radio contact with ATC. <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> are separated {{from each other and}} from VFR flights. VFR flights are separated from <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> and are provided traffic information about other VFR flights. Permission for using airspace is required except for the special cases listed in clause 114 of the Federal rules for using Russian air space.|$|R
40|$|Interactive speech recognition/synthesis {{technology}} is assessed {{as a method}} for the aleviation of single-pilot <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> workloads. Attention was given during this series of evaluations to the conditions typical of general aviation twin-engine aircrft cockpits, covering several commonly encountered <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> condition scenarios. The most beneficial speech command tasks are noted {{to be in the}} data retrieval domain, which would allow the pilot access to uplinked data, checklists, and performance charts. Data entry tasks also appear to benefit from this technology...|$|R
5000|$|In the USA and Canada, for {{eastbound}} (heading 0-179 degrees) <b>IFR</b> <b>flights,</b> {{the flight}} plan must list an [...] "odd" [...] flight level in 2000 foot increments starting at FL190 (i.e., FL190, FL210, FL230, etc.); Westbound (heading 180-359 degrees) <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> must list an [...] "even" [...] flight level in 2000 foot increments starting at FL180 (i.e., FL180, FL200, FL220, etc.). However, Air Traffic Control (ATC) may assign any flight level {{at any time}} if traffic situations merit a change in altitude.|$|R

50|$|Standard {{instrument}} departure (SID) routes, {{also known}} as departure procedures (DP), are published flight procedures followed by aircraft on an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan immediately after takeoff from an airport.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, a {{standard}} terminal arrival route or standard terminal arrival (STAR) is a published procedure followed by aircraft on an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan just before reaching a destination airport.|$|R
5000|$|Alternate Airports: Airports of {{intended}} landing as {{an alternate}} of the destination airport. May {{be required for}} an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan if poor weather is forecast at the planned destination.|$|R
50|$|A visual {{approach}} is an ATC authorization for an aircraft on an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan to proceed visually {{to the airport}} of intended landing; {{it is not an}} instrument approach procedure.|$|R
5000|$|... (This is {{not correct}} with SVFR. Not related to class A)In Class A airspace, flight under {{visual flight rules}} (VFR) is not {{permitted}} and instrument <b>flight</b> rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>flight</b> is the norm.|$|R
50|$|Not all STARs are for <b>IFR</b> <b>flights.</b> Occasionally, STARs are {{published}} for visual approaches, {{in which case}} they refer to landmarks visible {{on the ground or}} other visual reference points, instead of waypoints or radio navigation aids.|$|R
5000|$|Flight Data/Clearance Delivery: Issues <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan clearances, obtains squawk {{codes for}} VFR aircraft, helps with {{coordination}} for GC/LC, and cuts the ATIS (weather). FD/CD is commonly {{known in the}} profession as {{the secretary of the}} tower.|$|R
5000|$|Remarks: Any {{information}} the PIC believes {{is necessary to}} be provided to ATC. One common remark is [...] "SSNO", which means the PIC is {{unable or unwilling to}} accept a SID or STAR on an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|R
50|$|SIDs and STARs are {{procedures}} and checkpoints used {{to enter and}} leave the airway system by aircraft operating on <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plans. There is a defined transition point at which an airway and a SID or STAR intersect.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{publication}} {{is to increase the}} awareness of pilots in the use of GNSS. The Winter Training Brochure is oriented towards a brief and clear explanation of the basic principles and requirements for the correct and safe use of GNSS devices during the flight, with regard to the target group, pilots and instructors, different age, experience and skill categories. The Winter Training Brochure is divided into three main parts, Part 1 addresses the basic theoretical bases and GNSS principles common for VFR and <b>IFR</b> <b>flights,</b> Part 2 deals with the principles of GNSS use for VFR flights, Part 3 deals with the principles of GNSS use for <b>IFR</b> <b>flights...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Canada and the United States, DVFR is an {{aviation}} acronym for Defense Visual Flight Rules. It refers to {{one type of}} flight plan that must be filed for operation within an Air Defense Identification Zone (the alternative being an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan).|$|R
50|$|At {{airports}} {{equipped with}} radar, procedural approaches normally are used {{only in the}} event of an aircraft suffering a radio failure, or for training purposes. At non-radar airports or when radar is not available, these are the only means of <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> making approaches to the airport.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} make their {{decision}} for departure, the crew obtained the observed weather data and the weather forecast for the takeoff, landing and alternate aerodromes all of which met the requirements for <b>IFR</b> <b>flights.</b> All the crew were correctly licensed and adequately rested to operate the flight.|$|R
50|$|Though {{ground-based}} NAVAID approaches still exist, the FAA is transitioning to approaches {{which are}} satellite-based (RNAV). Additionally, {{in lieu of}} the published approach procedure, a flight may continue as an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> to landing while increasing the efficiency of the arrival with either a contact or visual approach.|$|R
50|$|Class G is used below 2500 ft AGL (around {{airports}} below 1000 ft AGL, then rises via a step at 1700 ft to 2500 ft AGL). <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> in Class G are {{not allowed}} in Germany except for arrivals and departures in Radio Mandatory Zones (RMZ) around uncontrolled airfields with IFR procedures.|$|R

5000|$|The United States Federal Aviation Administration defines an ARTCC as: [...] a {{facility}} established to provide {{air traffic control}} service to aircraft operating on <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plans within controlled airspace, principally during the en route phase of flight. When equipment capabilities and controller workload permit, certain advisory/assistance services may be provided to VFR aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Instrument Flying Handbook defines IFR as: [...] "Rules and {{regulations}} {{established by the}} FAA to govern flight under conditions in which flight by outside visual reference is not safe. <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> depends upon flying by reference to instruments in the flight deck, and navigation is accomplished by reference to electronic signals." [...] It is also a term used by pilots and controllers to indicate the type of flight plan an aircraft is flying, such as an <b>IFR</b> or VFR <b>flight</b> plan.|$|R
50|$|<b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> in {{controlled}} airspace require an ATC clearance for {{each part of}} the flight. A clearance always specifies a clearance limit, which is the farthest the aircraft can fly without a new clearance. In addition, a clearance typically provides a heading or route to follow, altitude, and communication parameters, such as frequencies and transponder codes.|$|R
50|$|Managed by SATA Gestão de Aeródromos, {{it has an}} 1754 m {{operational}} runway (oriented 09/27), with a {{width of}} 45 m. The runway is illuminated and can handle evening flight operations (although rare), using VFR or <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> rules, while approximation instruments are based on PI locators. The installation of an ILS system was adjudicated around 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Charts {{used for}} <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> contain an {{abundance}} of information regarding locations of waypoints, known as [...] "fixes", which are defined by measurements from electronic beacons of various types, {{as well as the}} routes connecting these waypoints. Only limited topographic information is found on IFR charts, although the minimum safe altitudes available on the routes are shown.|$|R
