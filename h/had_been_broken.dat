5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name, {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di Sicilia, and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> by partisans.|$|E

5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E

Nürnberg was the second-largest warship of the Kriegsmarine to survive the war intact, after the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, and she was the only vessel to see service after the war, albeit in a foreign navy.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane was {{transferred}} to the North America and West Indies station in November 1917, but rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron early in 1918.

Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road running through the middle of it.|$|E

In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains on the bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> during sexual intercourse, {{and that she had}} therefore been a virgin.|$|E

Initial announcements stated that Paul suffered only minor injuries but subsequent news reports said he sustained five broken ribs and lacerations to his lungs. Some sources later stated that six ribs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> and that pleural effusion had set in. Three of the ribs were displaced fractures.|$|E
5|$|Turgut Reis {{was laid}} up again on 30 October 1918, and was {{refitted}} at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard from 1924 to 1925. After returning to service, {{she served as}} a stationary training ship based at Gölcük. At the time, she retained only two of her originally six 28cm guns. She was decommissioned in 1933 and was thereafter used as a barracks ship for dockyard workers, a role she filled until 1950, {{when she began to}} be broken up at Gölcük. By 1953, the ship <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>broken</b> down into two sections, and these were sold to be dismantled abroad. Demolition work was finally completed between 1956 and 1957.|$|E
