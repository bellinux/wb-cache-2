5|$|Over {{the years}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person {{the nature of his}} tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in the {{composition}} of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.|$|E
500|$|Times public editor Arthur Brisbane {{wrote in}} 2012: [...] "When The Times covers a {{national}} presidential campaign, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share {{a kind of}} political and cultural progressivism — {{for lack of a}} better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah, father,' said George, pausing and {{standing}} opposite to the innkeeper, 'but {{who is to}} protect her from you? If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> that which you are doing was making her happy,--I would have spoken my mind indeed; <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> shown her once, and once only, what she had done to me; how she had destroyed me,--and then <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> gone, and troubled none of you any more.' ...|$|R
500|$|Amidst all of {{this family}} turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin {{in the summer of}} 1816 and he and Imlay {{discussed}} the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too [...] "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth. That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet {{her for the first time}} and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: [...] "I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to such a mother... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's [...] to love and esteem me" [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{cases of}} sukuk defaults and bankruptcies, Muddassir Siddiqui complained that [...] "Through reading many {{cases that have}} so far been litigated in courts around the world, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in almost all cases, the courts have struggled to reconcile the substance and form of the contract. Was it a sale, lease, construction or partnership contract or a financing arrangement between the parties?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{foreword}} to his book, Huygens wrote: [...] "It {{should be}} said, also, {{that for some}} time {{some of the best}} mathematicians of France have occupied themselves with this kind of calculus so that no one should attribute to me the honour of the first invention. This does not belong to me. But these savants, although they put each other to the test by proposing to each other many questions difficult to solve, have hidden their methods. I have had therefore to examine and go deeply for myself into this matter by beginning with the elements, and it is impossible for me for this reason to affirm that I have even started from the same principle. But finally <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> my answers in many cases do not differ from theirs." [...] (cited by [...] ). Thus, Huygens learned about de Méré's Problem in 1655 during his visit to France; later on in 1656 from his correspondence with Carcavi he learned that his method was essentially the same as Pascal's; so that before his book went to press in 1657 he knew about Pascal's priority in this subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{conscience}} {{was very}} much pleased with me," [...] was the answer. [...] "What I did was a stratagem, and perfectly fair too. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it was right {{for you to see}} Junius, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> done everything <b>I</b> could to help you communicate with him. But when I did at last see him, down you swooped upon us before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an opportunity of saying a word about you." ...|$|R

6000|$|He smiled triumphantly. [...] "It is {{a theory}} of mine, Mr. Snyder, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{valuable}} <b>that,</b> in nine cases out of ten, remarkable things don't happen." ...|$|R

6000|$|Now I make a leaf of Voices--for I {{have found}} nothing mightier than they [...] are, And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> no word spoken but is {{beautiful}} in its place.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush!' {{rejoined the}} old man laying his hand upon her mouth, 'Fortune will not bear chiding. We must not reproach her, or she shuns us; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{listen to}} me; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> {{you are a}} pretty high liver, Hardwick, and you have {{probably}} squandered nearly all {{of what you have}} stolen----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I said {{anything}} about his age, Beatrice, but simply told you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> it was Sir Cyril Shenstone that had saved you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>I</b> {{not said}} that ours {{was a black}} oak-panelled hall, with a wide fireplace, a gallery and oriel window, matted, and so fitted up as to be a {{pleasant}} resort for summer days. Our lessons took place there, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> my old schoolroom, {{out of sight and}} sound of everything, was such an intolerable prison to my little wild Bush girl, that she really could not learn there, since her very limited attention could only be secured, under the certainty that Harold did not leave the house without her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} other. [...] "But I am {{quite sure that}} the matter will grow easier as I proceed. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> out from what I have already done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But her worst trouble {{will still}} cling to her. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it is so. She has taken this man {{not because she}} loves him, but because you have bidden her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Neigh--I may as {{well tell}} you and have done with it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a lady of my {{acquaintance}} has two strings to her bow, or I am very much in error.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{three hundred}} {{thousand}} dollars," [...] I said to him, [...] "I could have scoured and sifted {{the surface of the}} earth to find May Martha Mangum." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{this thing}} keeps on {{it will make}} me believe that I am what these kind chairmen say of me. In {{introducing}} me, Judge Ransom spoke of my modesty {{as if he was}} envious of me. I would like to have one man come out flat-footed and say something harsh and disparaging of me, even if it were true. I thought at one time, as the learned judge was speaking, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> man; but he wound up, like all the others, by saying complimentary things.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I will go now! I haf {{no wish to}} stay, for all my life {{is black}} to me. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> other little friend to fill her place, I should not grieve so much, because she is weller there above than I could make her here; but no; I wait for that other one; I save all my heart for her; I send it, but {{it comes back to}} me; then I know my hope is dead, and I am all alone in the strange land." ...|$|R
60|$|Hect. Refuse! I'll not be hindered, brother. I'll {{through and}} through them, even their hindmost ranks, Till <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> large-sized boasting fool, Who dares presume my life is in his gift.|$|E
6000|$|... "So she was!" [...] exclaimed Ruth, {{with a look}} of triumph. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> out--only I {{fear that}} is not proof positive, because, you know, {{although}} not a common name, Bream is by no means singular.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{tasted the}} sweets, and the bitters, of love, [...] In {{friendship}} I early {{was taught to}} believe; [...] My passion the matrons of prudence reprove, [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a friend may profess, yet deceive.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "I can speak better standing. Maria Port, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> you <b>have</b> {{been trying to}} make people believe that I am engaged to marry you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No. Officially, I {{have nothing}} to do with it. Until <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish must think I am working for her husband, not against him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bear your destiny in mind," [...] the Italian said earnestly, [...] "remember that in {{many cases}} {{predictions}} bring about their own fulfilment; and truly I am rejoiced that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the stars point out so prosperous a future for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|When man and maid, all unafraid, 'Sat out' {{upon the}} stairs, No spectre dread, with feet of lead, Came past them unawares. I know not why, but alway <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it is so, That when the glum Researchers come The brutes of bogeys--go! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A fine old place. An {{excellent}} {{setting for}} a widow with romantic fortunes. And {{she seems to have}} <b>had</b> several romances. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> there was one between her and my friend Rex." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have, sir, {{and though}} there {{only a few}} days, gained {{information}} that necessitated my return here. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> the name I go by is not mine, and that my proper name is Gerald O'Carroll." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lynn, [...] "a self-made {{business}} magnate, {{was suffering}} from nervousness and dissatisfaction when he met Paramahansa Yogananda in Kansas City in 1932. Lynn later said of that meeting: 'I became aware that (for {{the first time in}} years) I was sitting very still...I <b>had</b> <b>found</b> entrance into a spiritual realm previously unknown to me.'" [...] In spite of his material success Lynn was unhappy, and acknowledged that he had a short temper and nervous problems. In January, 1932, his life changed when he attended a series of classes given by Paramahansa Yogananda. Lynn felt instantly transformed in Yogananda’s presence:On the second night of the class, I became aware that I was sitting upright, my spine straight and I was absolutely motionless. I looked down at my hands, which were so restlessly moving before and which were now perfectly still… <b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> the path <b>that</b> gave me inner peace and satisfaction and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> something tangible <b>I</b> was seeking, a guru.|$|R
