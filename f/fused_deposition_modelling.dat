50|$|Robocasting or Direct Ink Writing (DIW) is an {{additive}} manufacturing technique {{in which a}} filament of a paste (known as an 'ink', as per the analogy with conventional printing) is extruded from a small nozzle while the nozzle is moved across a platform. The object is thus built by 'writing' the required shape layer by layer. The technique was first developed in the United States in 1996 as a method to allow geometrically complex ceramic green bodies to be produced by {{additive manufacturing}}. In robocasting, a 3D CAD model is divided up into layers {{in a similar manner}} to other additive manufacturing techniques. A fluid (typically a ceramic slurry), referred to as an 'ink', is then extruded through a small nozzle as the nozzle's position is controlled, drawing out the shape of each layer of the CAD model. The ink exits the nozzle in a liquid-like state but retains its shape immediately, exploiting the rheological property of shear thinning. It is distinct from <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> as it does not rely on the solidification or drying to retain its shape after extrusion.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} technologies in additive manufacturing. The layer-by-layer mechanism of rapid prototyping allows this technology to rapidly create and print complex geometries from three-dimensional models of any objects. <b>Fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> {{is one of the}} common processes in rapid prototyping, and its maturity has given birth to full-scale, commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machines, as well as low-cost, <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machines, which are also referred to as three-dimensional printers. This work compares the effect of layer thickness during printing on the tensile and compressive strengths of samples, for commercial and low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machines. Standard samples based on ASTM D 638 and ASTM D 695 were prepared for the tensile and compressive tests, with layer thicknesses of 0. 3302 and 0. 2540 mm, using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene as the printing material. From the tensile tests, specimens prepared using low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> managed to obtain only 41. 87 and 54. 69 % of the ultimate tensile strength of specimens prepared using commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling,</b> for layer thicknesses of 0. 3302 and 0. 2540 mm. Meanwhile, from the compressive tests, specimens prepared using low-cost <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> managed to obtain only 75. 55 and 73. 79 % of the ultimate compressive strength of specimens prepared using commercial <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling,</b> for the same layer thicknesses.

40|$|AbstractIn this research, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to find out the {{influence}} of the process parameter along with their interactions on the dimensional accuracy of part fabricated using two different rapid prototyping machines namely <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine, and a low cost open source 3 D printer. 3 D open source printer (3 D-OSP) is one of the newly developed rapid prototyping (RP) process for part fabrication. It has been observed from previous research that the contribution of parameters such as raster width, slice height, and path speed are the most significant to the dimensional accuracy of 3 D open source product while raster width, slice height, and tip dimension are the most influencing factors for <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine. Taguchi parameter design of experiment method has been used to find out the optimum parameters level to minimize percentage change in length (L 1), length (L 2) and height (H) of test specimens fabricated by each of these two rapid prototyping machines. Experimental result revels that there is different optimal parameters level setting for each dimensional characteristics namely change in length (L 1), length (L 2) and height (H). Therefore, grey relational method is used to obtain optimum factor level of each dimensional characteristic simultaneously. Dimensional accuracy of parts fabricated by two different technique namely 3 D open source printer and <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine is within a desired range. Appropriate controls of machine process parameters improve the dimensional accuracy of parts. It is concluded that a low cost 3 D open source printer gave sufficient amount of part accuracy when it is compared with the industrial based <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>Fused</b> <b>Deposition</b> <b>Modeling</b> {{as a small}} volume manufacturing process {{and a lack of}} explicit rules for improving the efficiency of this process bring necessity to the development of build guidelines. This work develops a proposed set of build guidelines for use in <b>Fused</b> <b>Deposition</b> <b>Modeling</b> (FDM). The guidelines are verified by the literature and experience, and validated by statistical analysis of quantitative FDM build data and qualitative review of example cases from student projects. The experimental data are obtained using the fabrication protocol for a Dimension SST <b>Fused</b> <b>Deposition</b> <b>Modeling</b> machine. Using simulation software known as Catalyst TM, build time and material volume characteristics of many components of varying size and complexity were calculated.

40|$|Purpose - The paper aims {{to predict}} the surface {{roughness}} of <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> prototypes. Since average roughness is not comprehensive, this study aims to extend the characterization to all the roughness parameters obtainable by a profilometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model of the 3 D profile is supplied {{as a function of}} process parameters and part shape. A suitable geometry was designed and prototyped for validation. Data were measured by a profilometer and complemented by microscopic analysis. A methodology based on the proposed model was applied to optimise prototype fabrication in two practical cases. Findings - The proposed profile is effective in describing the micro-geometrical surface of <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> prototypes. The third dimension enables the calculation of amplitude, spatial and hybrid roughness parameters. Research limitations/implications - Because of mathematical assumptions and technological aspects, the validity of the model presents limitations related to the deposition angle. Practical implications - The method is an effective tool in the process planning stage: it enables knowing in advance how to assure part specifications delivering a set of technical choices. Two practical applications point out the usability in the product development and process parameters optimisation. Originality/value - This work fulfils an identified need to predict a complete surface characterization of <b>fused</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>modelling</b> technology...|$|E
