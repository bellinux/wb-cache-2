In this study we analyze the determinants of the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production in Denmark with particular focus on spatial externalities and the interaction between the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production and upstream sector and slaughterhouses. It is the assumption that the location of slaughterhouses is influenced by the location of the primary producers, implying that this variable is endogenous, whereas the location of primary producers is independent of the location of slaughterhouses. This is due to the fact that transportation costs <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> are paid by the cooperatives owning the slaughterhouses. This assumption is tested applying a spatial econometric model.

40|$|Japanese {{encephalitis}} (JE) virus infection {{can cause}} severe disease in humans, resulting in death or permanent neurologic deficits among survivors. Studies {{indicate that the}} incidence of JE is high in northwestern Bangladesh. Pigs are amplifying hosts for JE virus (JEV) and a potentially important source of virus in the environment. The objectives of this study were to describe the transmission dynamics <b>of</b> JEV among <b>pigs</b> in northwestern Bangladesh and estimate the potential impact of vaccination to reduce incidence among pigs. We conducted a comprehensive census <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> in three JE endemic districts and tested a sample of them for evidence of previous JEV infection. We built a compartmental model to describe JEV transmission dynamics in this region and to estimate the potential impact <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> vaccination. We identified 11, 364 pigs in the study area. Previous JEV infection was identified in 30 % <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> with no spatial differences in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> that were seropositive across the study area.

40|$|Abstract. The {{persistence}} of antibodies to glycoprotein X (gpX) in the serum <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> experimentally infected with pseudorabies virus (PRV) was determined using an anti-gpX {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Antibodies to gpX were detected for at least 365 days postchallenge in nonvaccinated <b>pigs.</b> Previous sensitization <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> by vaccination with S/PRV had no apparent effect on the antibody response <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> to gpX postchallenge. In determining previous exposure <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> to PRV strains containing the gpX gene, the anti-gpX ELISA was highly specific, but its sensitivity was lower than the standard serological procedures currently used for detecting PRV antibodies. The move toward a national pseudorabies eradica-tion program has dictated a need for improved diag-nostic tests. Of particular importance has been {{the need for a}} diagnostic serology test that would differentiate vaccinated pigs from infected <b>pigs.</b> Vaccination <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> with pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccines is commonly practiced.
