5|$|The Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C³I) {{performed}} poorly {{during the}} conflict. The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making {{contact with his}} combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone. Without the modern <b>GLONASS,</b> precision-guided munitions could not be used; the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since the war zone was blacked out. Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not authorised; an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces lacked reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead. However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war. General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the General staff, said that during the war, new weapons were not tried out.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>GLONASS</b> {{constellation}} {{has reached}} global coverage, its commercialisation, especially {{development of the}} user segment, has been lacking compared to the American GPS. For example, the first commercial Russian-made <b>GLONASS</b> navigation device for cars, Glospace SGK-70, was introduced in 2007, but it was much bigger and costlier than similar GPS receivers. In late 2010, {{there were only a}} handful of <b>GLONASS</b> receivers on the market, and few of them were meant for ordinary consumers. To improve the situation, the Russian government has been actively promoting <b>GLONASS</b> for civilian use.|$|E
25|$|By 2010, <b>GLONASS</b> had {{achieved}} 100% coverage of Russia's territory and in October 2011, the full orbital constellation of 24 satellites was restored, enabling full global coverage. The <b>GLONASS</b> satellites' designs have undergone several upgrades, {{with the latest}} version being GLONASS-K.|$|E
25|$|Following a December 2006 {{meeting in}} Moscow of the GPS-GLONASS Interoperability and Compatibility Working Group (WG-1), it was {{announced}} that in the future, <b>GLONASS</b> satellites would transmit a CDMA in addition to the FDMA. This would make <b>GLONASS</b> compatible with GPS, GALILEO and Compass receivers, which also use the CDMA method. A change in the <b>GLONASS</b> system from its current FDMA technique to the GPS and Galileo's format would enable a simply-designed receiver to use multiple satellite systems simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Satellite {{navigation}} {{systems such}} as GPS and <b>GLONASS.</b> All current systems use LFSR outputs to generate {{some or all of}} their ranging codes (as the chipping code for CDMA or DSSS) or to modulate the carrier without data (like GPSL2CL ranging code). <b>GLONASS</b> also uses frequency-division multiple access combined with DSSS.|$|E
25|$|Since 2008, new CDMA {{signals are}} being {{researched}} {{for use with}} <b>GLONASS.</b>|$|E
25|$|Originally, <b>GLONASS</b> was {{designed}} to have an accuracy of 65 m, but in reality it had an accuracy of 20 m in the civilian signal and 10 m in the military signal. The first generation <b>GLONASS</b> satellites were 7.8 m tall, had a width of 7.2 m, measured across their solar panels, and a mass of 1,260kg.|$|E
25|$|The {{interface}} control {{documents for}} <b>GLONASS</b> CDMA signals {{was published in}} August 2016.|$|E
25|$|During {{the middle}} of {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, the Russian economy boomed, {{resulting}} in substantial increases in the country's space budget. In 2007, the financing of the <b>GLONASS</b> program was increased considerably. Its budget was almost doubled: while in 2006 the <b>GLONASS</b> had received $181 million from the federal budget, in 2007 the amount was increased to $380 million.|$|E
25|$|On 14–15 April 2014 nine <b>GLONASS</b> {{satellites}} {{experienced a}} technical failure due to software problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>GLONASS</b> {{satellites}} transmit {{two types}} of signal: open standard-precision signal L1OF/L2OF, and obfuscated high-precision signal L1SF/L2SF.|$|E
25|$|On 10 December 2003, {{the second}} {{generation}} satellite design, GLONASS-M, was launched for the first time. It had a slightly larger mass than the baseline <b>GLONASS,</b> standing at , but it had seven years lifetime, four years longer than the lifetime of the original <b>GLONASS</b> satellite, decreasing the required replacement rate. The new satellite also had better accuracy and ability to broadcast two extra civilian signals.|$|E
25|$|GPS {{and phone}} {{baseband}} chips from major vendors Qualcomm, Exynos and Broadcom all support <b>GLONASS</b> {{in combination with}} GPS.|$|E
25|$|On October 27, 2010, Sergei Ivanov {{confirmed}} a plan {{to introduce}} a 25% import duty on all GPS-capable devices, including mobile phones, unless they are compatible with <b>GLONASS.</b> As well, the government is planning to force all car manufacturers in Russia to make cars with <b>GLONASS</b> starting from 2011. This will affect all car makers, including foreign brands like Ford and Toyota, which have car assembling facilities in Russia.|$|E
25|$|To improve {{development}} of the user segment, on 11 August 2010, Sergei Ivanov announced a plan to introduce a 25% import duty on all GPS-capable devices, including mobile phones, unless they are compatible with <b>GLONASS.</b> The government also planned to force all car manufacturers in Russia to support <b>GLONASS</b> starting from 2011. This would affect all car makers, including foreign brands like Ford and Toyota, which have car assembly facilities in Russia.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground control}} segment of <b>GLONASS</b> {{is almost entirely}} located within former Soviet Union territory, except for several in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, Sergey Ivanov updated Putin on the {{progress}} of the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System <b>GLONASS,</b> when Putin enquired whether {{he would be able to}} buy a device hooked into <b>GLONASS</b> that would allow him to keep track of Konni. Ivanov advised Putin that collars for pets would be available in mid-2008. The collar was demonstrated to Putin on Konni on 17 October 2008, making Konni the first recipient of a GLONASS-enabled pet collar.|$|E
25|$|Development of <b>GLONASS</b> {{began in}} the Soviet Union in 1976. Beginning on 12 October 1982, {{numerous}} rocket launches added satellites to the system until the constellation was completed in 1995. After a decline in capacity during the late 1990s, in 2001, under Vladimir Putin's presidency, {{the restoration of the}} system was made a top government priority and funding was substantially increased. <b>GLONASS</b> is the most expensive program of the Russian Federal Space Agency, consuming a third of its budget in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin {{signed a}} decree allocating {{additional}} 67 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) to <b>GLONASS</b> {{from the federal}} budget.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev {{ordered the}} {{government}} to prepare a new federal targeted program for <b>GLONASS,</b> covering the years 2012–2020. The original 2001 program is scheduled to end in 2011. On 22 June 2011, Roscosmos revealed that the agency {{was looking for a}} funding of 402 billion rubles ($14.35 billion) for the program. The funds would be spent on maintaining the satellite constellation, on developing and maintaining navigational maps as well as on sponsoring supplemental technologies to make <b>GLONASS</b> more attractive to users.|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, Sweden's Swepos—a {{national}} network of satellite reference stations that provides real-time positioning data with meter accuracy—became the first known foreign company to use <b>GLONASS.</b>|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} GLONASS-K satellites have an operational lifetime of 10 years, {{compared to the}} 7-year lifetime of the second generation GLONASS-M, and to the 3-year lifetime of the original <b>GLONASS</b> satellite. The mass of the new satellite is just 750kg, compared to 1,450kg of GLONASS-M. This means that two can be orbited at time on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket, or six at a time on Proton-M. In contrast, only three GLONASS-M satellites can be launched on Proton-M at a time. The new satellite design is expected to double {{the accuracy of the}} <b>GLONASS</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Currently Russia has {{completed}} the <b>GLONASS</b> satellite navigation system. The country is developing its own fifth-generation jet fighter and constructing the first serial mobile nuclear {{plant in the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The system {{requires}} 18 satellites {{for continuous}} navigation services covering {{the entire territory}} of the Russian Federation, and 24 satellites to provide services worldwide. The <b>GLONASS</b> system covers 100% of worldwide territory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, under Vladimir Putin's presidency, the Russian economy {{recovered}} and state finances improved considerably. Putin himself took {{special interest in}} <b>GLONASS</b> and the system's restoration was made one of the government's top priorities.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October 2011 the 24th {{satellite}} of the system, a GLONASS-M, {{was successfully}} launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome {{and is now}} in service. This made the <b>GLONASS</b> constellation fully restored, {{for the first time since}} 1996.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers of GPS devices {{say that}} adding <b>GLONASS</b> made more {{satellites}} available to them, meaning positions {{can be fixed}} more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where the view to some GPS satellites is obscured by buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of the project will include {{equipping}} automobiles with <b>GLONASS</b> receivers and creation of back-end software which will provide call center operators within emergency services with geographic data. The second phase will also involve GPS/GLONASS enabled phones and smartphones.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} navigation system <b>GLONASS</b> was conceived {{in the late}} 1960s, and formal requirements were completed in 1970. The government of the Soviet Union {{made a decision to}} develop the system in 1976. Design work was carried out by specialists led by Vladimir Cheremisin at NPO PM in Krasnoyarsk-26. The first launch took place in 1982. Until its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union launched 43 GLONASS-related satellites. Work on the system was continued by the Russian Federation which brought it its full operational capability in 1995. In the following years, the system fell into disrepair due to the economic crisis in the country and diminished space funding. Starting from 2000, the government under President Vladimir Putin made the restoration of <b>GLONASS</b> a top priority; its funding was doubled and after a lull of several years, launches were restarted again. In 2003, a new satellite design, GLONASS-M, was introduced. By early 2011, <b>GLONASS</b> had 22 operational satellites, two short of the required constellation of 24 to provide global coverage. The latest and significantly improved satellite type, GLONASS-K, is set to be launched in February 2011.|$|E
25|$|Block II {{satellites}} {{were typically}} launched three {{at a time}} from the Baikonur Cosmodrome using Proton-K Blok-DM-2 or Proton-K Briz-M boosters. The only exception was when, on two launches, an Etalon geodetic reflector satellite was substituted for a <b>GLONASS</b> satellite.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 to April 1991, the Soviet Union {{successfully}} {{launched a}} total of 43 GLONASS-related satellites plus five test satellites. When the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, twelve <b>GLONASS</b> satellites in two planes were operational; enough to allow limited use of the system (to cover the entire territory of the Union, 18 satellites would have been necessary.) The Russian Federation took {{over control of the}} constellation and continued its development. In 1993, the system, now consisting of 12 satellites, was formally declared operational and in December 1995 it was brought to a fully operational constellation of 24 satellites. This brought the precision of <b>GLONASS</b> {{on a par with the}} USA GPS system, which had achieved full operation а year earlier.|$|E
25|$|Binary {{phase-shift}} keying (BPSK) {{is used by}} standard GPS and <b>GLONASS</b> signals, however both BPSK and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) can {{be considered}} as variations of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), specifically QAM-2 and QAM-4. Binary offset carrier (BOC) is the modulation used by Galileo, modernized GPS, and COMPASS.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{there has}} been a long history of {{cooperation}} between the Soviet Union and India in space. Examples include Aryabhata it was India's first satellite, named after an Indian astronomer of the same name. It was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. During President Vladimir Putin's visit to India in December 2004, two space-related bilateral agreements were signed viz. Inter-Governmental umbrella Agreement on co-operation in the outer space for peaceful purposes and the Inter Space Agency Agreement on co-operation in the Russian satellite navigation system <b>GLONASS.</b> Subsequently, a number of follow-up agreements on <b>GLONASS</b> have been signed. In November 2007, the two countries have signed an agreement on joint lunar exploration. These space co-operation programmes are under implementation.|$|E
25|$|On 10 December 2003, {{the second}} {{generation}} satellite design, GLONASS-M, was launched for the first time. It had a slightly larger mass than the baseline <b>GLONASS,</b> standing at 1,415kg, but it had double the original's lifetime, decreasing the required replacement rate by 50%. The new satellite also had better accuracy and ability to broadcast two extra civilian signals.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>GLONASS</b> developers, {{there will}} be three open and two {{restricted}} CDMA signals. The open signal L3OC is centered at 1202.025MHz and uses BPSK(10) modulation for both data and pilot channels; the ranging code transmits at 10.23 million chips per second, modulated onto the carrier frequency using QPSK with in-phase data and quadrature pilot. The data is error-coded with 5-bit Barker code and the pilot with 10-bit Neuman-Hoffman code.|$|E
25|$|The L2 band signals use {{the same}} FDMA as the L1 band signals, but {{transmit}} straddling 1246MHz with the center frequency 1246MHz + n×0.4375MHz, where n spans the same range as for L1. In the original <b>GLONASS</b> design, only obfuscated high-precision signal was broadcast in the L2 band, but starting with GLONASS-M, an additional civil reference signal L2OF is broadcast with an identical standard-precision code to the L1OF signal.|$|E
