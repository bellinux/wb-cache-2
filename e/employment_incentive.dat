50|$|Changes in the {{perception}} of health care after World War II and an assessment of medical services provided to dependents caused Congress to re-evaluate the dependent health care benefit in the late 1950s. Changes in tax law had induced business and industry to begin offering a health care benefit as an <b>employment</b> <b>incentive.</b> A 1956 Department of Defense estimate was that 40 percent of active duty dependents did not have access to federal facilities due to distance, incomplete medical coverage at the federal facility, or due to the saturation of services at military treatment facilities. Congress responded by passing the Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956 and the Military Medical Benefits Amendments of 1966. These acts created the program known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS).|$|E

The government also changed 34 articles of the Constitution to widen fundamental rights and freedoms, and did this with the approval of all the parties in Parliament. Turkey became a candidate country to the European Union (without any political preconditions and with equal treatment as all other candidate countries). Three major EU harmonisation packages were passed during this government, including the most comprehensive package of 3 August 2002, which included the removal of the death penalty and many changes in fundamental rights and freedoms. An economic crisis which resulted from long overdue problems from previous governments caused a drop in the currency in February 2001. But 2 months later, the government passed a series of very comprehensive economic reforms which enabled the high growth of 2002-2007.|$|E

40|$|This article takes {{a gender}} {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} changes in the relationship of reciprocity that links the State and people receiving social benefits targeted at poverty reduction. The counterpart required in exchange for national solidarity is not the same for men and women beneficiaries and varies with family status, which induces a discrimination. Whereas what is important for women has long been their role as ?mothers above all?, for men it is their integration into the world of work. The integration in 2009 of the French minimum income benefit (RMI) and the lone parent allowance (API) into what is now called the active solidarity income (RSA) led to strengthening job integration requirements for beneficiaries. Nevertheless, the traditional model seems to have been spared by the tightening of requirements, as women with children who live in a couple do not have their employability questioned to the same extent as other beneficiaries. Their role as housewives excludes them from a logic of employment at any cost. But as soon as they are separated from their partner, they once again become a target of activation policies.

40|$|Although {{many have}} {{expressed}} concern over whether generous welfare policies discourage the employment of single mothers, scholars have rarely exploited cross-national variability in the generosity of social policies to assess this question. This is the case even though much previous scholarship has {{examined the effects of}} social policy on women's and mothers' labor force engagement. This paper evaluates whether generous social policies have a disincentive effect on single mother employment. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), we conduct a cross-national, multi-level analysis of the effects of social policy generosity on single mother employment in 17 affluent democracies. We find high rates of single mother employment - above 60 percent in 15 of the 17 countries and above 70 percent in 5 countries. We find little effect of social policy for employment, as our two measures of social policy are insignificant in almost all models. If there are welfare disincentives, they only appear significant for young single mothers, and this evidence is limited as well. We find contradictory evidence for the <b>employment</b> <b>incentive</b> for low educated single mothers. We determine that single mother employment is largely driven by the same individual characteristics - educational attainment, age and household composition - that drive employment in the general population, and among women and mothers. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is one of the}} few cross-national, multi-level tests of the welfare disincentive thesis for single mother employment. We provide evidence that welfare generosity does not discourage single mother employment...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{analyze the}} {{physician}} labor market in Croatia {{with respect to}} the internship and employment opportunities, Croatian needs for physicians and specialists, and trends in physician labor market in the European Union (EU) in the context of EU enlargement. Methods: Data were collected from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the Croatian Employment Service, and the Croatian Institute for Public Health. We compared the number of physicians waiting for internship before and 14 months after the implementation of the State Program for Intern Employment Stimulation. Also, the number of employed specialists in internal medicine, general surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, and pediatrics was compared with estimated number of specialists that will have been needed by the end of 2007. Average age of hospital physicians in the four specialties was determined and the number of Croatian physicians compared with the number of physicians in EU countries. Results: The number of unemployed physicians waiting for internship decreased from 335 in 2003 to 82 in 2004, while a total number of unemployed physicians decreased from 436 to 379 (χ 2 = 338, P< 0. 001). In October 2004, 79. 3 % of unemployed physicians waited for internship < 6 months; of them, 89. 2 % waited for internship < 3 months. In February 2005, 365 unemployed physicians were registered at the Croatian Employment Service and that number has been decreasing {{in the last couple of}} years. The number of employed specialists was lower than the estimated number of specialists needed in the analyzed specialists, as defined by the prescribed standards. A shortage of 328 internists, 319 surgeons, 209 gynecologists, and 69 pediatricians in Croatian hospitals is expected in 2007. Conclusion: The lack of <b>employment</b> <b>incentive</b> seems to be the main reason for the large number of unemployed physicians waiting for internship before the implementation of the Employment Stimulation Program. According to the number of physicians per 100000 population, Croatia is below the EU average. Croatian labor market will not be able to meet the needs of the health system for physicians by the end of 2007...|$|E
40|$|There are {{competing}} theoretical expectations and conflicting empirical results concerning {{the impact of}} partisanship on spending on active labour market policies (ALMPs). This paper argues that one should distinguish between different ALMPs. <b>Employment</b> <b>incentives</b> and rehabilitation programmes incentivize the unemployed to accept jobs. Direct job creation reduces the supply of labour by creating non-commercial jobs. Training schemes raise the human capital of the unemployed. Using regression analysis this paper shows that the positions of political parties towards these three types of ALMPs are different. Party preferences also depend on the welfare regime in which parties are located. In Scandinavia, left-wing parties support neither <b>employment</b> <b>incentives</b> nor direct job creation schemes. In continental and Liberal welfare regimes, left-wing parties oppose <b>employment</b> <b>incentives</b> and rehabilitation programmes {{to a lesser extent}} and they support direct job creation.

40|$|The {{major goal}} {{in this thesis}} is to explore the {{potential}} impact of an unemployment account system on individuals' <b>employment</b> <b>incentives.</b> This thesis consists of three parts. In the first part (Chapter 2) we identify the extent of the intrapersonal income redistribution, which is inherent in the German tax-benefit system. Disentangling the income redistribution in this way shows that the extent of intrapersonal income redistribution in Germany is indeed very high. In particular, unemployment benefits exhibit a large share of redistribution that occurs within the life cycle of the individuals. In the second part (Chapter 3) we investigate whether replacing the traditional German unemployment insurance system by unemployment accounts will improve <b>employment</b> <b>incentives</b> and thereby also the overall unemployment rate. We employ a stochastic life-cycle framework to study how the trade-off between labor market incentives, consumption and savings is affected under a system of unemployment accounts. In Chapter 4 we stress the role of the financial perspective and determine the optimal tax rate both in the long-run and during a transition period. In {{the first part of this}} chapter we implement a pay-as-you-go structure in the unemployment account system with a balanced government budget and identify the optimal long-run tax rate. Moreover, we investigate how the <b>employment</b> <b>incentives</b> and the unemployment rate behave in the long-run and how they react to the adjusted tax rate, which prevails in the long-run. In the second part of this chapter we identify the optimal tax rate during the transition period when switching from the UI system to the UA system...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three empirical {{papers on}} important health policy issues. The first paper {{looks at the}} effect of changes in levels of Medicare home health care services on the informal care use of disabled, older adults. I estimate two-part models of informal care use, where the key independent variable {{is a measure of}} Medicare home health payment restrictiveness. Individuals who lived in states with less Medicare home health care services increased their use of informal care, although this effect is only observed among low-income individuals. The second paper assesses the effects of changes in <b>employment</b> <b>incentives</b> on the supply of informal support from adult children to their disabled, older parents. This study focuses on one specific form of informal support, co-residence with a disabled parent. I compare changes in co-residence patterns between 1990 and 2000 across groups of middle aged women whose co-residence patterns were arguably comparable, and who experienced very different changes in <b>employment</b> <b>incentives.</b> Results from difference-in-difference models provide support to the hypothesis that increasing <b>employment</b> <b>incentives</b> reduces the supply of informal support to disabled parents. The third paper looks at the effect of education on health status. This paper builds on the extensive research literature on this topic by measuring health {{in terms of the number}} of Quality-Adjusted Life Years experienced by individuals over an extended period of time. This measure captures overall health status over time, which is arguably a more important measure than point-in-time measures of specific health conditions or longevity alone.
