5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked {{some of his colleagues}} with a bold action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scenes were}} filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather {{conditions}} making shooting difficult enough to require an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of work. The episode's production took place {{just a week}} before David Duchovny's wedding, with his fiancée Téa Leoni visiting the set during filming. The first cut of the episode was twelve minutes too long, resulting {{in some of the}} scenes in the mountains being removed. Series creator Chris Carter re-edited the entire episode two days before it aired.|$|E
5|$|An attack {{had been}} planned for 18 September but was {{postponed}} due to the poor weather. On 25 September, the attack went ahead. It was intended to extend the front to high ground that was known as Factory Corner. The high ground was undefended, and the 1st Brigade easily captured it {{under the cover of}} a creeping barrage. Two days later, Factory Corner formed the launchpad for a further attack by the brigade and the neighbouring 55th Division on two more trenchlines, designated Gird Trench and Gird Support. This time, the attack was not as straightforward and it took an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> before the entire objective was in New Zealand hands. On 1 October, as a preliminary to the Battle of Le Transloy, 2nd Brigade's Otago and Canterbury battalions captured strongpoints near Eaucourt L'Abbaye, which fell to the 47th Division two days later.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, Chulasakarat uses three {{similar but}} not {{identical}} types of lunar years {{used by the}} Burmese calendar. Each calendar has the same regular year of 354 days and a leap year of 384 days. However, whereas the Burmese calendar adds the intercalary day only in a leap cycle according to its Metonic cycle, the Siamese calendar adds the intercalary day to a regular year. The Siamese calendar does add the <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> {{in the same place}} (Jyestha/Nayon), however.|$|E
25|$|There are {{additional}} {{rules in the}} Hebrew calendar to prevent certain holidays from falling on certain days of the week. (See Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, below.) These rules are implemented by adding an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> to Marcheshvan (making it 30 days long) or by removing one day from Kislev (making it 29 days long). Accordingly, a common Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 353, 354 or 355 days, while a leap Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 383, 384 or 385 days.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{match the}} new German speedsters, White Star decided {{to drop out}} of the {{competition}} and commission the four large Celtic-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> at sea. In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its bad experience with the Deutschland, Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the Celtic.

25|$|Li Na {{followed}} her strong showing at the Medibank tournament with an equally strong showing at the 2007 Australian Open, where she {{advanced to the}} fourth round. Seeded 19th, Li dispatched Elena Bovina and Lourdes Domínguez Lino in straight sets through the first two rounds, leading to a matchup with no. 9 Dinara Safina. The match was postponed due to rain, but Li handily beat Safina {{to advance to the}} fourth round to play Swiss star, no. 6 Martina Hingis. Due to a rain delay and the fact that Hingis played on Rod Laver Arena, a roofed court, on the originally scheduled day, Hingis had an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of rest. The match the previous day seemed to have no effect, as Li took the first set from Hingis. However, Na faded as the match went on and lost while committing 69 unforced errors. Despite the loss, the tournament was a success for Na, as it marked the third straight time in a Grand Slam that she advanced at least to the fourth round.|$|E
25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of rest due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, {{was supposed to take}} the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout enabled him to get a third day of rest and thus be ready to go for the decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night if he was needed.|$|E
25|$|And fail to win they did, losing 2–1 to a Chelsea {{side that}} {{had had an}} <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> to recuperate from their Champions League tie against Liverpool in mid-week. Coming {{off the back of}} a poor display in Barcelona, United were looking to cement their claim to the Premier League title, which would have been all but won with a win over Chelsea. However, with several players rested with Barcelona on Tuesday in mind, and Nemanja Vidić having to be {{substituted}} early on after a knee to the face, the odds never looked in United's favour. Owen Hargreaves took Vidić's place in defence, with Wes Brown switching from right-back to centre-back. Joe Cole had the first real chance, but could only smash the ball into the woodwork from 18yards after he regained the ball from a poor clearance. United held out for 45 minutes, but finally went behind on the stroke of half-time to a Michael Ballack header, after the German had lost his marker to find room at the back post. After the break, United came out a new team, taking the game to Chelsea. After 57 minutes, United conceded a free kick just inside Chelsea's half, but a poor back pass from Ricardo Carvalho allowed Wayne Rooney to pounce on the ball and place a shot beyond Petr Čech into the corner of the net, his first career goal against Chelsea. However, he appeared to have injured himself during his celebration and was soon substituted, making way for Cristiano Ronaldo. The game went quiet for the last 20 minutes, until a Michael Essien cross was handled by Michael Carrick just inside the United penalty area with four minutes left to play. Referee Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, and Ballack stepped up to convert and give Chelsea the win. United went all out for a much needed equaliser, but the closest they came were two shots blocked on the line by Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko. The result brought Chelsea level on points with United with two games to go, United holding on to top spot by virtue of their +53 goal difference. This now meant that United would have to win both of their remaining games to secure the title, provided that Chelsea did not drop any more points.|$|E

500|$|Humber was {{promoted}} to the Mets, again as a September call-up, on September 2. Though the Mets considered inserting him into the starting rotation immediately, they chose to start Pelfrey. Humber made two relief appearances for the Mets, on September 5 and 11. The Mets, having lost eight of their previous 12 games and seen their lead over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East division race decrease from seven games to two, removed Pelfrey from the final rotation to give an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of rest to pitchers Pérez, Maine, and Pedro Martínez, and gave Humber his first Major League start on September 26, 2007, against the Washington Nationals, choosing him over Dave Williams. Although the Mets raced out to a 6–2 lead, Humber allowed five runs in four-plus innings, receiving a no decision in a game the Mets eventually lost, 9–6. The decision to start Humber was seen as emblematic of the Mets' desperation. As George Vecsey wrote in The New York Times, [...] "How did it come to this? How did the entire Mets' season come to depend so much on a young pitcher, Philip Humber, who had never started {{in the major leagues}} until last night?" [...] He concluded his three Mets appearances in the 2007 season with a 7.71 ERA.|$|E
500|$|Another summertime {{birthday}} celebration in the Netherlands {{was that of}} Wilhelmina's mother, Queen-Regent Emma, who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn. [...] Until her death in 1934, Emma received an annual floral tribute from the townsfolk on her birthday. [...] In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, Princess Juliana, took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April. In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards Koninginnedag was on her birthday. [...] The change in date attracted immediate approval from Dutch children, who gained an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> of holiday. [...] The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium—one not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace. [...] Queen Juliana retained the floral tribute, staying each year on Koninginnedag at Soestdijk Palace to receive it. [...] The parade became televised in the 1950s, and Koninginnedag increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off. Juliana {{had a reputation as}} a [...] "queen of the people", and according to Peek, [...] "it felt as if she invited her subjects to the royal home".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} morning, 1 September, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion went on {{the offensive}} again, while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga. By this time, the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians {{long enough to be}} evacuated. This information was not known by the Allies, however, who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action. In this regard, the 2/9th, initially with orders to join the 2/12th's counterattack, was delayed an <b>extra</b> <b>day</b> after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthur's headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture. The attack did not occur and, as a result, on 2 September the 2/9th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission. The next day it took over from the 2/12th and led the Australian advance. With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse, on 2 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet which stated: [...] "e have reached the worst possible situation.
