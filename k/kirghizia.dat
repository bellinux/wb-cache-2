5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing <b>Kirghizia,</b> Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.|$|E
25|$|In oral cultures, {{concepts}} {{are used in}} a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by A.R. Luria, a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of Uzbekistan and <b>Kirghizia</b> in 1931–2 documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.|$|E
25|$|Batken {{virus was}} first {{isolated}} from hard-bodied ticks {{of the species}} Hyalomma plumbeum plumbeum infesting sheep {{near the town of}} Batken, <b>Kirghizia,</b> now in Kyrgyzstan, in 1970. It has also been found to infect mosquitoes of the species Aedes caspius Pallas and Culex hortensis Ficalbi, also in Kyrgyzstan. Its geographical range is limited to Central Asia, Transcaucasia and the area {{to the north of the}} Caspian Sea. In the laboratory it is highly pathogenic for mice, hamsters and chickens. The virion is variable in shape, with spherical and filamentous forms being observed; it has a diameter of 50–100nm. Batken is considered a DHOV subtype; the viruses have a high degree of sequence identity (90% in the envelope glycoprotein; 96–98% in other proteins), and their antibodies crossreact.|$|E
25|$|Constitutionally, the USSR was a {{federation}} of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as Ukraine or Byelorussia (SSRs), or federal states, such as Russia or Transcaucasia (SFSRs), all four being the founding republics {{who signed the}} Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December 1922. In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of the Russia's Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSRs. In 1929, Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan SSR. With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and <b>Kirghizia</b> were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status. In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of the Ukraine and Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (SSRs) were also admitted into the union which was not recognized {{by most of the}} international community and was considered an illegal occupation. Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956. Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).|$|E

2500|$|When {{the weather}} became {{more conducive to}} travel, Maclean began his third and longest trip, aiming for Chinese Turkestan, {{immediately}} east of the Soviet Central Asian republics he had reached in 1937. [...] This journey, unlike the previous two, was {{at the request of}} the British government. They wished him to investigate the conditions in Urumchi (Ürümqi), the capital of the province of Sinkiang (Xinjiang), which had fallen under Soviet influence. [...] He was commissioned to talk to the tupan (provincial governor) there about the situation of both the consul-general and the British Indian traders. [...] The first stage was retracing his steps on a five-day train journey to Alma Ata; the train ran via Orenburg and the Aral Sea, then parallel to the Syr Darya and the mountains of <b>Kirghizia</b> (Kyrgyzstan). [...] From Alma Aty he travelled four hundred miles north through the Hungry Steppe to Ayaguz (Ayagoz), where [...] "a road which had been made, and was being kept up, for a very definite purpose" [...] led to the frontier town of Bakhti (Bakhty or Bakhtu, about 17km from Tacheng, known in Maclean's time as Chuguchak). The Soviet officials were, at first, willing to assist him but the Chinese ones were not, and in the course of the negotiations that surrounded his passage, Maclean discovered that the Soviets exercised some influence over at least the consul if not the provincial government of their neighbours. [...] He crossed the border into China, where he was refused permission to continue; he was forced to return to Alma Aty, whence he was expelled. [...] Soon he found himself back in Moscow.|$|E

50|$|In 1918, forty-eight Thoroughbreds were {{imported}} to the Issyk-Kul stud in <b>Kirghizia</b> (Kirghistan) {{and were}} bred with Old Kirghiz mares.

Because of breeding with the English Thoroughbred, the Novokirghiz has become faster and more refined than the Old Kirghiz. Other breeds that were infused into the Old Kirghiz to develop the Novokirghiz are: English Thoroughbred, (Russian) Don, and half-bred Anglo/Don blood.|$|E
