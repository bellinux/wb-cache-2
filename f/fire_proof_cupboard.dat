Concrete material will become brittle, spelling, and barest easyto and its strength is downhill effect of high temperature. In this research the specimens are cylinder shape of concrete and reinforced concrete beams. For this type of concrete cylinder specimens were made with size of 15 cm diameter and 30 cm high, while for the typeof reinforcedconcrete beam specimens were made with size of 15 cm x 20 cm x 150 cm. Each type of specimen for each variety is made of 3 repetitions. Variations in temperature used are normal temperatures, 400 o C, 600 o C and 800 o C.

40|$|Abstract [...] The durable fire-retardants {{based on}} the {{colloidal}} solution of cationic aminotriazinealdehyde resin have been applied to HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper. The treatment is accomplished by soaking samples through an aqueous solution of these resins, drying and curing at room temperatures. The effect of kind of acids and of varying ratio of fire retardant components in treat-ing solution on the <b>fire</b> <b>proofing</b> efficiencies of HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper are discussed. Results are compared with those reported in previous paper 4 l and ammonium salts as fire retardant agents for wood, paper, fabrics and other combustible materials. Aminotria-zine-aldehyde condensation products combined with strong acids such as phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid and sulfamic acid imparted excellent fire resistance to wood and filter paper. Satisfactory <b>fire</b> <b>proofing</b> properties can be obtained in both HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper at resin add-on as low as about 1 O~ 15 % with a few excep-tions.

Inclement weather and flooding caused at least two months' worth of delays and forced the crews to rebuild part of the structure. By April 16, 1907, the dam was only 41% complete. It would take another year and a half before the diversion works were ready to unload into the New York Canal. The company eventually lost $90,000 on the contract.
