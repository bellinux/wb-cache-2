40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} for estimating causal effects when the exposure is measured with error and confounding adjustment is performed via a generalized propensity score (GPS). Using validation data, we propose a regression calibration (RC) -based adjustment for a continuous error-prone exposure combined with GPS to adjust for confounding (RC-GPS). The outcome analysis is conducted after transforming the corrected continuous exposure into a categorical exposure. We consider confounding adjustment {{in the context of}} GPS subclassification, inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) and matching. In simulations with varying degrees of <b>exposure</b> <b>error</b> and confounding bias, RC-GPS eliminates bias from <b>exposure</b> <b>error</b> and confounding compared to standard approaches that rely on the error-prone exposure. We applied RC-GPS to a rich data platform to estimate the causal effect of long-term exposure to fine particles (PM_ 2. 5) on mortality in New England for the period from 2000 to 2012. The main study consists of 2, 202 zip codes covered by 217, 660 1 km × 1 km grid cells with yearly mortality rates, yearly PM_ 2. 5 averages estimated from a spatio-temporal model (error-prone exposure) and several potential confounders. The internal validation study includes a subset of 83 1 km × 1 km grid cells within 75 zip codes from the main study with error-free yearly PM_ 2. 5 exposures obtained from monitor stations. Under assumptions of non-interference and weak unconfoundedness, using matching we found that exposure to moderate levels of PM_ 2. 5 (8 < PM_ 2. 5 ≤ 10 μ g/m^ 3) causes a 2. 8 % (95 % CI: 0. 6 %, 3. 6 %) increase in all-cause mortality compared to low exposure (PM_ 2. 5 ≤ 8 μ g/m^ 3) ...|$|E

Further, because people spend more time indoors, using ambient concentration to represent exposure may cause error. To quantify the associated <b>exposure</b> <b>error,</b> we computed a series of six different hourly-based exposure metrics at 16, 095 Census blocks of three Counties in North Carolina for CO, NOx, PM 2. 5, and elemental carbon (EC) during 2012.

Using a hybrid-based indoor concentration as the standard, the comparison showed that outdoor STOK metrics yielded large error at both population (67 % to 93 %) and individual level (average bias between ´ 10 % to 95 %).

Development of exposure metrics that represent the multipollutant environment {{is important to understand}} the impact of ambient {{air pollution}} on human health. Objectives:We reviewed existing multipollutant exposure metrics to evaluate howthey can be applied to understand associations between air pollution and health effects. Methods: We conducted a literature search using both targeted search terms and a relational search in Web of Science and PubMed in April and December 2013. We focused on exposure metrics that are constructed from ambient pollutant concentrations and can be broadly applied to evaluate air pollution health effects. Results: Multipollutant exposure metrics were identified in 57 eligible studies. Metrics reviewed can be categorized into broad pollutant grouping paradigms based on: 1) source emissions and atmospheric processes or 2) common health outcomes. Discussion: When comparing metrics, it is apparent that no universal exposure metric exists; each type of metric addresses different research questions and provides unique information on human health effects.

40|$|Abstract Studies in air {{pollution}} epidemiology may suffer from some specific forms of confounding and <b>exposure</b> measurement <b>error.</b> This contribution discusses these, {{mostly in the}} framework of cohort studies. Evaluation of potential confounding is critical in studies of the health effects of {{air pollution}}. The association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mortality has been investigated using cohort studies in which subjects are followed over time with respect to their vital status. In such studies, control for individual-level confounders such as smoking is important, as is control for area-level con-founders such as neighborhood socio-economic status. In addition, there may be spatial dependencies in the survival data that need to be addressed. These issues are illustrated using the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention II cohort. <b>Exposure</b> measurement <b>error</b> is a challenge in epidemiology because inference about health effects can be incorrect when the measured or predicted exposure used in the analysis is different from the underlying true exposure. Air pollution epidemiology rarely if ever uses personal measurements of exposure for reasons of cost and feasibility. <b>Exposure</b> measurement <b>error</b> in air pollution epidemiology comes in various dominant forms, which are different for time-series and cohort studies.

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of digital imaging, there have been questions about the necessity of continuing reject analysis programs in imaging departments to evaluate performance and quality. As a marketing strategy, most suppliers of digital technology focus on the supremacy of the technology {{and its ability to}} reduce the number of repeats, resulting in less radiation doses given to patients and increased productivity in the department. On the other hand, quality assurance radiographers and radiologists believe that repeats are mainly related to positioning skills, and repeat analysis is the main tool to plan training needs to up-skill radiographers. A comparative study between conventional and digital imaging was undertaken to compare outcomes and evaluate the need for reject analysis. However, digital technology still being at its early development stages, setting a credible reject analysis program became the major task of the study. It took the department, with the help of the suppliers of the computed radiography reader and the picture archiving and communication system, over 2 years of software enhancement to build a reliable digital repeat analysis system. The results were supportive of both philosophies; the number of repeats as a result of exposure factors was reduced dramatically; however, the percentage of repeats as a result of positioning skills was slightly on the increase for the simple reason that some rejects in the conventional system qualifying for both exposure and positioning errors were classified as <b>exposure</b> <b>error.</b> The ability of digitally adjusting dark or light images reclassified some of those images as positioning errors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{harmful effects}} of urban air {{pollution}} on general population in terms of annoying symptoms are not adequately evaluated. This {{is in contrast to}} the hospital admissions and short term mortality. The present study protocol is designed to assess the association between the level of exposure to certain ambient air pollutants and a wide range of relevant symptoms. Awareness of the impact of pollution on the population at large will make our estimates of the pertinent covert burden imposed on the society more accurate. Methods/design A cross sectional study with spatial analysis for the addresses of the participants was conducted. Data were collected via telephone interviews administered to a representative sample of civilians over age four in the city. Households were selected using random digit dialling procedures and randomization within each household was also performed to select the person to be interviewed. Levels of exposure are quantified by extrapolating the addresses of the study population over the air pollution matrix of the city {{at the time of the}} interview and also for different lag times. This information system uses the data from multiple air pollution monitoring stations in conjunction with meteorological data. General linear models are applied for statistical analysis. Discussion The important limitations of cross-sectional studies on acute effects of air pollution are personal confounders and measurement error for exposure. A wide range of confounders in this study are controlled for in the statistical analysis. <b>Exposure</b> <b>error</b> may be minimised by employing a validated geographical information system that provides accurate estimates and getting detailed information on locations of individual participants during the day.

40|$|Frequently, {{exposure}} data are measured over {{time on a}} grid of discrete values that collectively define a functional observation. In many applications, researchers are interested in using these measurements as covariates to predict a scalar response in a regression setting, with interest focusing on the most biologically relevant time window of exposure. One example is in panel studies of {{the health effects of}} particulate matter (PM), where particle levels are measured over time. In such studies, there are many more values of the functional data than observations in the data set so that regularization of the corresponding functional regression coefficient is necessary for estimation. Additional issues in this setting are the possibility of exposure measurement error and the need to incorporate additional potential confounders, such as meteorological or co-pollutant measures, that themselves may have effects that vary over time. To accommodate all these features, we develop wavelet-based linear mixed distributed lag models that incorporate repeated measures of functional data as covariates into a linear mixed model. A Bayesian approach to model fitting uses wavelet shrinkage to regularize functional coefficients. We show that, as long as the <b>exposure</b> <b>error</b> induces fine-scale variability in the functional exposure profile and the distributed lag function representing the exposure effect varies smoothly in time, the model corrects for the exposure measurement error without further adjustment. Both these conditions are likely to hold in the environmental applications we consider. We examine properties of the method using simulations and apply the method to data from a study examining the association between PM, measured as hourly averages for 1 – 7 days, and markers of acute systemic inflammation. We use the method to fully control for the effects of confounding by other time-varying predictors, such as temperature and co-pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{epidemiological}} studies assign exposure to an individual's residence {{at a single}} time point, such as birth or death. This approach makes no allowance for migration and may result in <b>exposure</b> <b>error,</b> leading to reduced study power and biased risk estimates. Pregnancy outcomes are less susceptible to this bias, however data from North American populations indicate that pregnant women are a highly mobile group. We assessed mobility in pregnant women {{in the north of}} England using data from the Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey (NorCAS). Methods Data were extracted from NorCAS for 1985 to 2003. Eligible cases had a gestational age at delivery of ≥ 24 weeks (a viable delivery) (n = 11 559). We assessed mobility between booking appointment (average gestational age 13 weeks) and delivery for pregnancies where the address at booking appointment and delivery were known. The impacts on mobility of maternal age and area-level socio-economic indicators were explored using standard descriptive statistics. A sensitivity analysis and a small validation exercise were undertaken {{to assess the impact of}} missing data on the estimate of mobility. Results Out of 7 919 eligible cases for whom addresses at booking and delivery were known, 705 (8. 9 % (95 % CI 8. 3 - 9. 5)) moved between booking and delivery; the mean and median moving distance was 9. 7 and 1. 4 km respectively. Movers were significantly younger (25. 4 versus 27. 3 years, p Conclusion Mobility in the north of England (9 %) is considerably lower than that reported in North America and the only other study from the UK (23 %). Consistent with other studies, mobility was related to maternal age and socio-economic status, and the majority of moves were over a relatively short distance. Although this population appears relatively stable, the mobility we have observed may still introduce misclassification or error into an exposure assessment relying solely on postcode at delivery, and migration should still therefore be considered a potential source of bias in future studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In ecologic studies, group-level {{rather than}} individual-level {{exposure}} data are used. When using group-level exposure data, established by sufficiently large samples of individual exposure assessments, the bias {{of the effect}} estimate due to sampling errors or random assessment errors at the individual-level is generally negligible. In contrast, systematic assessment errors may produce more pronounced errors in the group-level exposure measures, leading to bias in ecologic analyses. METHODS: We focus on effects of systematic <b>exposure</b> assessment <b>errors</b> in partially ecologic case-control studies. Individual-level information on disease status, group membership, and covariates is obtained from registries, whereas the exposure is a group-level measure obtained from an established exposure database. Effects on bias and coverage of 95 % CI in various error situations are investigated under the linear risk model, using both simulated and empirical ecologic data on exposures that are binary at the individual level. RESULTS: Our simulations suggest that the bias produced by systematic <b>exposure</b> assessment <b>errors</b> under the linear risk model is generally approximately equal to {{the ratio of the}} slope bias and the intercept bias in ordinary linear regression with measurement errors in the independent variable. Consequently, bias in either direction can occur. <b>Exposure</b> assessment <b>errors</b> that systematically distort the group-level exposure measures have more pronounced effects on bias and coverage than errors producing random fluctuations of the group-level measures, which imply bias towards the null. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the need for careful consideration of potential effects of systematic distortions of the group-level exposure measures when constructing and applying group-level exposure databases, such as probabilistic job exposure matrices...|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} {{of products}} and services is exposed to three kinds of risk: performance risk: that a component might not work as specified by the supplier; composition risk: that hitherto independent components might be {{not be able to}} interoperate {{in such a way as}} to provide an intended product or service; and implementation risk: that the intended product or service might not satisfy the client’s demand when used in its actual context-of-use, even though it meets the specification agreed with the supplier. Performance risk involves <b>exposure</b> to <b>errors</b> of execution, the supplier being unable to sustain the performance of its constituent capabilities, and is typically evaluated by behavioural analysis of models of those capabilities, using simulation, analytical techniques or exhaustive testing. These forms of analysis are computationally effective for first-order systems. Composition risk involves <b>exposure</b> to <b>errors</b> of planning, the supplier being unable to ensure the validity of its approach to composing constituent capabilities in order to deliver the product or service that, it believes, the client expects.

30|$|The {{effects of}} <b>exposure</b> and {{thresholding}} <b>errors</b> on HP estimation {{have to be}} examined together. The digital number (also known as the greyness scale number) of all pixels in CHPs increases with exposure (Zhang et al. 2005). Nevertheless, as long as exposure is not high enough to cause the so-called blooming effect (Leblanc et al. 2005), the effects of higher exposure on HP estimates can be cancelled out by using higher threshold values in CHP analysis (Song et al. 2014). In other words, an estimation inaccuracy cannot be introduced to HP by either <b>exposure</b> or thresholding <b>errors</b> alone, but by the mismatch between exposure and thresholding (hereafter, exposure-thresholding mismatch, ETM).|$|R
