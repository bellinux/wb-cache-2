Sandis, ???Period and Place: Collingwood and Wittgenstein on Understanding Others???, Collingwood and British Idealism Studies, Vol 22 (1) : 167 - 193, January 2016. The Version of Record is available online at: [URL] it takes to understand radically different others {{lies at the heart}} of the philosophies developed by Collingwood and Wittgenstein at roughly the same time. Their approaches contain three differences of focus that are prima facie significant: (i) period vs. place; (ii) individual vs. collective; (iii) re-enactment vs. forms of life. In this essay I demonstrate that these are little more than a divergence in emphasis and thatwemust view their approaches as complimentary, rather than opposed. This this is not a simple case of reaching the same conclusions through different, let alone <b>incompatible,</b> <b>routes.</b> Far from it. The two philosophers use similar methods and reason in similar ways when considering the relation of thought to action, and of both thought and action to explanation and understanding. This is particularly remarkable given that the two thinkers are often thought to stand at opposite ends of the methodological spectrum with respect to the value of metaphysics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{foreseeable}} {{scenario is}} where on the Internet Mobile IPv 6 is deployed {{and a large}} percentage of the clients are mobile nodes. These mobile clients will communicate with large servers, which under the Mobile IPv 6 ’s point of view, will be Correspondent Nodes. Usually large servers operate in servers farms with a load balancer device. Mobile clients can communicate with these servers through their Home Agent (a sub-optimal path) or directly by using the built-in mechanisms of Mobile IPv 6 Route Optimization. In this paper we detail an important incompatibility between the Mobile IPv 6 ’s Route Optimization and several load balancing techniques. This means that mobile clients need to revert to the sub-optimal path when communicating with these server farms. This issue reduces considerably the communications performance increasing the delay and the infrastructure load. Moreover it may be an important drawback when considering Mobile IPv 6 ’s deployment. In this paper we show which load balancing techniques are <b>incompatible</b> with <b>Route</b> Optimization and we propose a novel mobile entity that solves this issue for several load balancing techniques...|$|R
