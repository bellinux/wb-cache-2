50|$|With {{a service}} brake relay valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|E
50|$|Known as the Papa pump, this utilises the low {{pressure}} generated by high velocity water flow around a curve-shaped elastomeric valve (with {{low pressure}} loss) {{to allow a}} valve design that enables rapid closure and with a relatively small cross sectional area and low weight. The venturi valve is configured as a ring section positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting {{in line with the}} supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery non return valve. The elastomeric material and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A pressure vessel installed on a tee connected to the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means. This unique technology and design dramatically reduced the weight, manufacturing cost and number of components required - as well as provided an overall improvement in efficiency.|$|E

Rifabutin was estimated in serum and tissues by HPLC. When ~ 20 mg of microparticles were loaded in the apparatus, ~ 2. 5 mg were collected at the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> in 30 seconds of operation. Mice inhaled ~ 300 μg of the 2. 5 mg emitted at the <b>delivery</b> <b>port.</b> Alveolar macrophages of mice receiving inhalations for 30 sec accumulated 0. 38 μg of rifabutin, while the amount in blood serum of these mice was 0. 62 μg. In mice receiving 83 μg rifabutin intravenously or orally, the intracellular amounts were 0. 06 and 0. 07 μg respectively, while the amounts in serum were 1. 02 and 0. 80 μg.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Explanations for laparoscopic-induced {{hypothermia}} fail {{to explain}} clinical observations.

Methods: Theoretical calculations based on thermal conductivity, mass transfer effects and heat flux considerations correlated closely with synthetic and tissue experiments.

Results: Cooling rates of 10 to 25 degrees centigrade per second for high flow rates were found based on gas flow rate and effective size of gas delivery site. These rapid temperature drops extended beyond a 2 cm 2 diameter. Conclusions: Evaporative cooling accounts for significant hypothermia.

50|$|The {{plant was}} located in the rural town of Fernald, which is about 20 miles (32 km) {{northwest}} of Cincinnati, Ohio, and occupies 1,050 acres (425 hectares). This location was chosen because it was between the uranium ore <b>delivery</b> <b>ports</b> of New York and New Orleans, and it was accessible to the other main AEC sites. In addition, the site was close to Cincinnati's large labor force, the landscape was level making the site's construction easy, it was isolated, which provided safety and security, and it was located 30 to 50 feet above a large water aquifer, which supplied the water needed for uranium metal processing. From 1951 to 1989 Fernald converted uranium ore into metal, and then fabricated this metal into target elements for nuclear reactors. Annual production rates ranged from a high in 1960 of 10,000 metric tons to a low in 1975 of 1,230 metric tons. Refining uranium metal was a process requiring a series of chemical and metallurgical conversions that occurred in nine specialized plants at the site.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of the dissolution time – time for the liquid to absorb the gas till the saturation state - on the behaviour of positivedisplacement vane pumps, in terms of pressure peaks within internal chambers and forces applied to the stator ring. The chamber pressurization depends on the volume variation and fluid Bulk modulus in the pre-compression phase during which the volume is trapped between the suction and the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> rims. If the dissolution time is short, then the entrained air is quickly absorbed and the fluid Bulk modulus sharply increases just before opening the connection to the outlet; as a consequence, pressure peaks may appear thus degrading the NVH characteristics of the pump. Moreover the pressure within internal chambers generate i) a torque demand to the driver (the combustion engine or an electrical motor) and ii) a total force applied to the stator ring. In case of fixed displacement designs, the resultant pressure force simply represents a load for support bearings; while in case of variable designs, it contributes to the displacement regulation. Simulation results show that the pump behaviour is very sensitive to the dissolution time when it is quite close to the duration of the trapped period...|$|E

The system has an osmotic mi-croactuator (see Su, Lin, and Pisano, J.

Using oxygen plasma to activate the sur-faces of polymers for bonding, the osmotic actuator is bonded with the PDMS cover while liquid drug can be encapsulated during the bonding process. Employing the net water flow induced by osmosis, the prototype {{drug delivery}} system has a measured con-stant delivery rate at 0. 2 L h for 10 h with an accumulated de-livery volume of 2 L.

40|$|Conditioned {{responding}} to drug-predictive discrete cues can be strongly modulated by drug-associated contexts. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} differential recruitment of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell mediates {{responding to}} drug cues in a drug vs non-drug context. Rats were trained to discriminate between two 10 -s auditory stimuli: one stimulus (CS+) was paired with ethanol (10 % v/v; 0. 2 [*]ml; oral) whereas the other (CS−) was not. Training occurred in operant conditioning chambers distinguished by contextual stimuli, and resulted in increased entries into the ethanol <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> during the CS+ {{when compared with the}} CS−. In experiment 1, port entries were then extinguished in a second context by withholding ethanol, after which context-induced renewal of ethanol-seeking was tested by presenting both stimuli without ethanol in the previous training context. This manipulation stimulated strong responding to the CS+ in rats pretreated with saline in the core (n= 9) or shell (n= 10), which was attenuated by pharmacologically inactivating (muscimol/baclofen; 0. 1 / 1. 0 [*]mM; 0. 3 [*]μl/side) either subregion pretest. In experiment 2, after discrimination, training rats were habituated to a different context in which ethanol and both stimuli were withheld.

Saline-pretreated rats responded more to the CS+ than the CS− (core n= 8; shell n= 9), and inactivating the core but not shell attenuated this effect. These data highlight an important role for the core in cue-induced ethanol-seeking, and suggest that the shell is required to mediate the influence of contexts on conditioned ethanol-seeking...|$|E
40|$|External {{gear pumps}} {{are the most}} widely {{employed}} source of power in hydraulic applications, allowing good performance and low manufacturing costs. The present paper reports the description of a numerical model for the simulation of these kind of machines, developed by the authors. The model has been implemented using the software AMESim®, introducing new in-house C++ models, with the main aim of an accurate prediction of the pressure ripple at the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> and the calculation the flow rate time course through the pump. In fact the reduction of flow pulsations {{is one of the}} crucial targets in the development of these machines. The fluid dynamic model of the pump is based on a finite volumes framework: each chamber presents uniform fluid proprieties and is connected with the adjoining ones by variable orifices. The pump is described by the interaction between a fluid dynamic model, that predicts the instantaneous pressures and the flow rates between the chambers, with a geometrical sub-model for the evaluation of the actual values of the variable volumes (defined by teeth, housing, and side wear plates) and the throat areas, as functions of the shaft angular position. This paper reports a deep description of the fluid dynamic model and a comparison between its numerical results and data available from experiments, showing how a correct evaluation of the flow when the chambers expand (and oil is pushed from the supply tank) or decrease (and oil is ejected into the outlet port) allows a good prediction of the pump characteristics. The results reported in the paper show how the model can be a powerful tool for design and development of external gear pumps, e. g. it easily allows the prediction of the maximum and minimum pressure reached inside the teeth space volumes, giving important information to prevent cavitation and damages as well as to reduce the pump noise. Moreover the simulation environment easily allows the evaluation of the pump behaviour when it works in a given hydraulic system...|$|E
40|$|Ionization methods {{operating}} at atmospheric pressure have largely affected {{the development of}} analytical mass spectrometry. Today, virtually every atmospheric pressure ionization (API) mass spectrometer on the market is compatible with numerous API methods, with electrospray ionization (ESI) being the most prominent technique, followed by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). The aim of this work was {{the development of a}} corona-microplasma based APCI source that efficiently generates protonated molecules in a controllable manner. For a hypothesis driven ionization source development the complex ionization mechanisms have to be fundamentally understood. In addition, the physical and chemical environments ions are exposed to on their passage from the API source to the analyzer have to be well characterized. At atmospheric pressure, these environments strongly differ from classical vacuum ionization sources. Ions generated at atmospheric pressure have to be efficiently transported to the analyzer region through a pressure gradient spanning more than nine orders of magnitude. They are typically undergoing at least 10 7 molecular collisions before they reach essentially collision-free vacuum regions. In API water is always present at elevated mixing rations and thus ion-molecule reactions are inevitably encountered. Therefore the main questions in API source development are: Which species are important in the chemical system, which play a minor role and how does the physical environment, i. e., the presence of electrical fields, impact on the ion-molecule chemistry within the source and the ion transfer region? The capillary atmospheric pressure ionization (cAPI) concept is used to develop an APCI source, which relies on the generation of proton bound water clusters as reactant ions with particular emphasis on stable, reproducible, and controllable conditions. The reactant ion generation region is spatially separated from the neutral analyte gas flow, thus adverse analyte ion transformation processes are largely suppressed. In addition, the reactant ion generation is entirely decoupled from the neutral analyte <b>delivery</b> <b>port.</b> Using a liquid cone as point electrode for sustained corona discharge operation, electrochemical corrosion of the electrode is eliminated. Simultaneously, very stable water mixing ratios are generated. The custom source designs of the employed mass spectrometric systems allowed the detection of thermally equilibrated ion populations, particularly ion bound clusters, under controlled API source conditions. It is found that in essentially all API methods, at least when coupled to liquid chromatography or when operating in ambient environments, ion bound cluster systems are playing {{a major role in the}} complex ion source chemistry. Thus, the properties of a number of cluster systems are fundamentally studied and characterized to establish optimum ionization conditions for the cAPCI source developed in this work. During the course of experiments it became readily apparent that for the generation of [M+H] + analyte ions in addition to concentration driven cluster chemistry, fluid dynamics and electrical fields within the ion transfer region of the mass spectrometer are pivotal. Thus the impact of electrical fields on the ion temperature and thus on the position of chemical equilibria and/or the extent of individual bimolecular reactions are studied. Central to this work is to find efficient means to control the amount of kinetic energy supplied to ions present within the collision dominated transfer regions and to assess to what extent such control is possible. The final goal for the present ion source development is a conclusive assessment of the analytical applicability, particularly with respect to controlled manipulation of ion-molecule chemistry. As one result of this assessment an ion activation stage, operating with electrical radio frequency fields in the first differential pumping stage is developed. It is found that the operation of this stage lead to highly efficient [M+H] + generation even for analytes with low proton affinity. In summary, from the fundamental characterization of the complex ion-molecule chemistry prevailing in API sources a generally applicable ionization mechanism regarding the formation of protonated molecules using proton bound water clusters as reagent ions was inferred and validated. This in-depth analysis was used for the development of a clean, stable and controllable APCI source, which incorporates an ion activation stage. The combination of both significantly increased the ionization efficiency towards typical APCI amenable analytes and also considerable widens the analyte range...|$|E

Players “fish” by scooping beads from a common bowl into individual cups placed near the bowl. The beads are the fish stock; the scoops are the fishing gear, and the cups are the player’s <b>delivery</b> <b>ports.</b> Players pay a rental cost for their gear (scoop), which depends upon the scoop size they choose. They are paid a price for their fish, which depends upon {{the distance of the}} cup from the bowl. If not allowed to communicate, most players compete aggressively to maximize their harvests from the limited total stock of beads by scooping as fast as they can. We describe three games which compellingly illustrate three important mechanisms by which rent dissipation may occur in competitive fisheries. The “gear-choice game” illustrates cost-driven rent dissipation as players choose larger, higher-cost scoops rather than the smallest and lowest-cost scoops. The “port-choice game” illustrates value-driven rent dissipation as players deliver beads to a closer but lower-priced cup. The “harvest choice game”—in which the volume left un-harvested each period determines {{the extent to which the}} bead stock is replenished for the next period—illustrates resource-driven rent dissipation as players over-harvest in earlier periods. In all of these games, replacing competitive fishing with individual quotas immediately and dramatically changes player behavior and increases rents.
