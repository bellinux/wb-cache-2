40|$|International audienceGrowth {{is known}} to be {{dependant}} of the qualitative as well as the qualitative values of children's diet. Among forest populations, vulnerable categories, such as pregnant and lactating women, have to respect numerous food taboos which <b>detend</b> symbolic as well as social functions. These taboos concern numerous species rich in protein content, such as game. This assertion had upset numerous nutritionnists of the 50 - 70 ies. Some thirty years ago, although the protein factory like tropical forest showed numerous food taboos which were respected, the rate between forbidden and allowed species was high. Nevertheless, at this time, weaning was delayed and the majority of the most frequent species of the diet was not concerned. Nowadays, game is not so abounding, due to an overexploitation related to new trading behaviours. Conversely, a great number of forbidden species is no more respected. Consequently, the protein value of the diet has declined, but this harmfull fact has been countered by the evolution of social behaviours, such as abandoning most taboos. That is why, one can consider that the harmfull effect of food taboos should be considered within the global context of feeding behaviours, in other terms the ecological and social dynamics related to food availability and food choices...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University 1. Thare is a vitalistic reality {{which is}} {{external}} and yet immediately given in intuition. 2. This reality exists in its initial purity as a free, creative, energizing, implusive force, that Bergson calls supraconsciousness. 3. The expansion or creative explosiveness of this original impetus tends, as its psychic force is extended beyond its origin, to condense into matter and <b>detend</b> toward pure homogeneous space. 4. The evolution {{of life is}} one manifestation of this psychic energy in its creative struggle against matter. 5. A theory of knowledge must be formulated {{in relation to the}} creative evolving of consciousness, and also the metaphysical antithesis representing inversions of the psychical tensions of the supra-consciousness. 6. The intellect is thereby found to be one tendency of the supra-consciousness, a relaxation toward apatial representation, whose forms have been molded by the necessity of acting on inert extended matter. 7. The analytic and deductive functions of the intellect rest on its spatial form, and prevent a conceptual apprehension of the mobility, creativity, and essential freedom of reality. 8. Another tendency developed from the supra-consciousness is intuition, and by the use of intuition one can see how such metaphysical opposites as space and duration, matter and life, necessity and freedom, intelligence and intuition spring from reality as inversions of the supra-consciousness. 9. However, Bergson's initial assumption that a mathematical account of mobility is inherently incorrect, and thereby manifests a natural inability of the intellect, has been proven false. 10. Bergson's narrow restriction of the function of the intellect must be reinterpreted in terms of actual intellectual processes themselves...|$|R
