5|$|Peanut, or <b>groundnut</b> (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally}} from South America, {{has grown from}} a relatively minor crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, in part due to the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, <b>groundnut</b> and <b>groundnut</b> oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E
5|$|India is {{the largest}} {{producer}} {{in the world of}} milk, cashew nuts, coconuts, tea, ginger, turmeric and black pepper. It also has the world's largest cattle population (193million). It is the second largest producer of wheat, rice, sugar, <b>groundnut</b> and inland fish. It is the third largest producer of tobacco. India accounts for 10% of the world fruit production with first rank in the production of banana and sapota, also known as chiku.|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxin, a human liver carcinogen, {{frequently}} contaminates <b>groundnuts,</b> maize, rice, {{and other}} grains, especially in Africa. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention that involved training rural Gambian women on how to identify and remove moldy <b>groundnuts</b> to reduce aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) contamination. In total, 25 women, recruited from the West Kiang region of The Gambia, were trained on how to recognize and remove moldy <b>groundnuts.</b> Market-purchased <b>groundnuts</b> were hand sorted by the women. <b>Groundnuts</b> were sampled at baseline (n = 5), after hand sorting (“clean,” n = 25 and “moldy,” n = 25), and after roasting (n = 5). All samples were analyzed for AFB₁ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A reduction of 42. 9 % was achieved based on the median AFB₁ levels at baseline and after hand sorting (clean <b>groundnuts),</b> whereas an alternative estimate, based on the total AFB₁ in moldy and clean <b>groundnuts,</b> indicated a reduction of 96. 7 %, with a loss of only 2 % of the <b>groundnuts.</b> By roasting the already clean sorted <b>groundnuts,</b> the AFB₁ reduction achieved (based on median levels) was 39. 3 %. This educational intervention on how to identify and remove moldy <b>groundnuts</b> was simple and effective in reducing AFB₁ contamination...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between commercialisation and gender for <b>groundnuts</b> in Eastern Province, Zambia, using a mixed methods approach. Women saw themselves as having greater control over <b>groundnuts</b> than other crops, and both sexes saw <b>groundnuts</b> as controlled by women.

Propensity Score Matching showed that the machine shelling and higher sales did not reduce women’s perceived level of control over <b>groundnuts.</b> Women welcomed greater male participation in machine shelling because it reduced the drudgery of shelling by hand. This suggests that commercialisation did not disempower women...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Most of {{the peanut}} butter marketed in Nairobi is {{processed}} in cottage industry and its aflatoxin contamination status has not been documented. This study was therefore conducted to determine the status of aflatoxin contamination in <b>groundnuts</b> and peanut butter in Nairobi and Nyanza. Methodology and results: Eighty two fresh samples comprising raw and roasted <b>groundnuts</b> and peanut butter were obtained from market outlets and cottage processors in Nairobi and Nyanza regions. The marketers and processors were asked {{for information on the}} source of <b>groundnuts.</b> The incidence of Aspergillus section Flavi was determined using standard laboratory methods. Defective nuts in raw <b>groundnuts</b> were determined by manual sorting. Aflatoxin analysis was done using competitive ELISA technique. <b>Groundnuts</b> in Nairobi were imported from Malawi while those Nyanza were grown in the region. The fungal species isolated from the samples were: Aspergillus flavus (L and S strains), A. parasiticus, A. niger, A. tamari, A. alliaceus, A. caeletus and Penicillium spp. The percentage of defective nuts among all unsorted <b>groundnuts</b> ranged from 0. 0...|$|R

5|$|On 10 May 1948, {{the pair}} left {{to work on}} a {{government-funded}} <b>groundnut</b> food scheme in East Africa. There was some difficulty in getting permission for Judy to travel, and it was feared that she and Williams would be split up. This issue was promoted in the Evening Standard, and after the involvement of William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme, permission was given for Judy to travel with Williams. She had a third and final litter of puppies during her time in Africa. After two years there, Judy was discovered to have a mammary tumour; an operation removed the growth, but a tetanus infection soon set in, and she was euthanized on 17 February 1950 at the age of nearly 14. She was buried in her RAF jacket, with her campaign medals, the Pacific Star, the 1939–1945 Star, and the Defence Medal. Frank spent two months building a granite and marble memorial in her memory, which included a plaque that told of her life story.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved around}} several more camps, and survived {{the sinking of}} the {{transport}} ship SS Van Warwyck where in the aftermath she saved several passengers from drowning. Les Searle from the Grasshopper smuggled her once again into the next camp, where she was reunited with Frank Williams. After the end of the war, Judy's life was put in danger once again. She was about to be put to death by the Japanese guards following a lice outbreak amongst the prisoners. However, Williams hid the dog until the Allied forces arrived. Searle, Williams, and others smuggled Judy back to the UK aboard a troopship and she spent the next six months in quarantine after arriving. She was awarded the Dickin Medal by the PDSA, considered to be the animals' Victoria Cross. Judy died in 1950 in Tanzania from a tumour, after travelling with Williams there to work on a <b>groundnut</b> food scheme. Her Dickin Medal and collar were subsequently put on display at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford as part of 'The Animal's War' exhibition.|$|E
50|$|The larvae are a pest of <b>groundnuts.</b> Since <b>groundnuts</b> {{were only}} {{introduced}} into Africa 400 to 500 years ago, {{there must be}} at least one other host plant. The larvae cause massive damage to the crown of the plant.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{construction}} of the Nigerian railway system, which extended from Lagos in 1896 to Ibadan in 1900 and Kano in 1911, the Hausa of northern Nigeria became major producers of <b>groundnuts.</b> They surprised the British, who had expected the Hausa to turn to cotton production. However, the Hausa had sufficient agricultural expertise to realise cotton required more labour and the European prices offered for <b>groundnuts</b> were more attractive than those for cotton. [...] "Within two years the peasant farmers of Hausaland were producing so many tonnes of <b>groundnuts</b> that the railway was unable to cope with the traffic. As a result, the European merchants in Kano had to stockpile sacks of <b>groundnuts</b> in the streets." [...] (Shillington 338).|$|R
40|$|This study uses a three-wave panel dataset from nationally {{representative}} surveys by the Central Statistical Office and Cragg's (1971) model for corner-solution problems {{to determine the}} effect of the government-sponsored maize input subsidy program on the production of <b>groundnuts</b> in Zambia. The results show that even though the maize subsidy programme, does not significantly affect the smallholder farmer’s decision to participate in <b>groundnuts</b> production, maize subsidies however do significantly influence the proportion of cultivated land area allocated to <b>groundnuts</b> production. This finding confirms that the current high subsidy levels targeted at maize are causing farmers to relocate their productive resources, particularly land, from other cropping enterprises towards maize production. The results also show that land allocation to <b>groundnuts</b> is also influenced by the household's labour endowment, level of activity of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) in the district, the household's access to market information, and the price of <b>groundnuts</b> relative to prices of other related commodities like maize, mixed beans, cowpeas and soyabeans...|$|R
5|$|The Thanjavur Marathas {{gained control}} during the later part of 18th century until its {{annexation}} by the British East India Company in 1799. It was constituted as a municipality during 1866 {{and was a}} part of the erstwhile Tanjore district. The town was the headquarters and the only town in Mannargudi taluk. The town emerged as one of the chief centres of inland trade in the district during the British rule. Rice, betel leaves, <b>groundnut,</b> oil, metal articles and clothes were the major exports. A Methodist mission was established in the town during the third decade of the 19th century. During 1944, Chinese copper coins were unearthed from Thaliketti village in the region, dated to Sui period (585 CE) to the end of Song period (1275 CE). The coins indicate a possible Buddhist influence in the region. Mannargudi continued to be part of Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district.|$|E
5|$|Zebu, {{a form of}} humped cattle, were {{introduced}} to the island around 1000CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought sorghum, goats, possibly Bambara <b>groundnut,</b> and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals. Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted {{a major part of the}} pastoralists' diet. Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands. Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo (ruled 1575–1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured polities in the highlands.|$|E

When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting {{to wait for the}} Senegalese marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to Banjul, where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian <b>groundnut</b> market was from smuggled Senegalese crops.|$|E
