40|$|The {{incidence}} of Listeria species in {{raw whole milk}} from farm bulk tanks and from raw milk in storage at a Swedish dairy plant was studied. Listeria monocytogenes was found in 1. 0 % and Listeria innocua was found in 2. 3 % of the 294 farm bulk tank (<b>farm</b> <b>tank)</b> milk specimens. One <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> specimen contained 60 CFU of L. monocytogenes ml− 1. L. monocytogenes was detected in 19. 6 % and L. innocua was detected in 8. 5 % of the milk specimens from the silo receiving tanks at the dairy (dairy silos). More dairy silo specimens were positive for both Listeria species during winter than during summer. Restriction enzyme analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were applied to 65 isolates of L. monocytogenes, resulting in 16 different clonal types. Two clonal types were shared by the <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> milk and the dairy silo milk. All except one clonal type belonged to serovar 1 / 2 a.

40|$|The {{refrigerated}} storage of raw milk throughout the dairy chain prior to heat treatment creates selective conditions for growth of psychrotolerant bacteria. These bacteria, mainly {{belonging to the}} genus Pseudomonas, are capable of producing thermoresistant extracellular proteases and lipases, which can cause spoilage and structural defects in pasteurized and ultra-high-temperature-treated milk (products). To map the influence of {{refrigerated storage}} on the growth of these pseudomonads, milk samples were taken after the first milking turn and incubated laboratory scale at temperatures simulating optimal and suboptimal preprocessing storage conditions. The outgrowth of Pseudomonas members was monitored over time by means of cultivation-independent {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE). Isolates were identified by a polyphasic approach. These incubations revealed that outgrowth of Pseudomonas members occurred {{from the beginning of the}} dairy chain (<b>farm</b> <b>tank)</b> under both optimal and suboptimal storage conditions. An even greater risk for outgrowth, as indicated by a vast increase of about 2 log CFU per ml raw milk, existed downstream in the chain, especially when raw milk was stored under suboptimal conditions. This difference in Pseudomonas outgrowth between optimal and suboptimal storage was already statistically significant within the <b>farm</b> <b>tank.</b> The predominant taxa were identified as Pseudomonas gessardii, Pseudomonas gessardii-like, Pseudomonas fluorescens-like, Pseudomonas lundensis, Pseudomonas fragi, and Pseudomonas fragi-like.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, many changes {{have taken place}} in the dairy {{industry}}. At the present time, the industry is endeavoring to improve the quality and handling of milk. This is being accomplished by new equipment and improved methods. In recent years the handling and transporting of milk by means of the ten gallon can is being replaced by the bulk tank system. With improved farm and truck tanks, milk can be cooled rapidly and stored at a lower temperature. There are a few problems pertaining to quality, fat tests and wights in handling milk in bulk tanks. Among the problems we may list the following; maintenance and improvement in the quality with reference to bacterial content and flavor, accurate composite fat tests and economy of investment and operation. The dairy industry along with other industries are striving to improve the equipment and methods of handling milk. With each improvement, there are many problems that must be overcome before the system can be considered successful. The tank system calls for every other day pick-up. The milk is pumped from the <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> into the tank truck before being transported to the dairy plant. With this new development came the problem of gathering the samples of milk for the fat test at the farm rather than at the factory. This study compares the daily fat test with the 15 day composite of <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> milk. If milk is cooled and allowed to stand for any period of time a cream layer will form {{on the top of the}} milk. To mix the milk thoroughly for the cooling and sampling, installation of a mechanical agitator was necessary. The milk is held on the farm two days before delivery. This may cause a problem in increased bacterial counts. With the use of the bulk tank trucks came the problem of proper cleaning and sanitizing. Only a small amount of research has been made on cleaning and sanitizing tanks. Along with this problem came the one of undesirable flavors in milk. The question of the effect of increased holding and agitation on the development of undesirable flavors becomes important. Without proper control a large tank of milk could very easily be contaminated with the milk from one patron. As these problems, among others, are successfully solved, the bulk tank system of handling milk will flourish throughout the dairy industry...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{contamination}} of <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> milk (FTM) with the spore-forming butyric acid bacteria (BAB) {{is important to}} prevent the late-blowing defect in semi-hard cheeses. The risk of late blowing can be decreased via control of the contamination level of FTM with BAB. A modeling approach was applied to identify an effective control strategy at the farm level. The simulation model developed {{was based on a}} translation of the contamination pathway into a chain of unit operations. Using various simulations, the effects of factors related to feed quality, feed management, cattlehouse hygiene, and milking practices on the contamination level of FTM were evaluated. Contamination level of silage was found {{to be the most important}} factor. When silage contains on average less than 3 log(10) BAB/g, a basic pretreatment of udder teats before milking (similar to 75 % removal of attached spores) is sufficient to assure an FTM contamination level below 1 BAB/mL. When silage contains more than 5 log(10) BAB/g, it should not be fed, because it then becomes almost impossible to assure an FTM contamination level below 1 BAB/mL. Measures aimed at improving cattlehouse hygiene, the contamination via soil, and the contamination level of other feeds contribute only marginally to the control of the contamination of FTM with BAB. Application of the modeling methodology could be beneficial for the control of the contamination of FTM with other microorganisms such as Bacillus cereus...|$|E
40|$|A year-long {{survey of}} 24 dairy farms was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of farm management on the concentrations of butyric acid bacteria (BAB) spores in <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> milk (FTM). The results were used to validate a control strategy derived from model simulations. The BAB spore concentrations were measured in samples of FTM, feces, bedding material, mixed corn and grass silage fed to cows in the barn, and soil. In addition, a questionnaire was used to gather farm management information such as bedding material used and teat cleaning method applied. The average BAB spore concentration in FTM was 2. 7 log(10) spores/L, and 33 % of the FTM samples exceeded a concentration of 3 log(10) spores/L. Control of the average spore concentration in mixed silage fed was the only aspect of farm management that was significantly related to the concentration of BAB spores in FTM. Farms that fed mixed silage with the lowest average BAB spore concentrations (3. 4 log(10) spores/g) produced FTM with the lowest average concentration (2. 1 log(10) spores/L). The efficiency of farm management in controlling the BAB spore concentration in FTM depended to a large extent on the ability of farmers to prevent incidents with elevated BAB spore concentrations in mixed silage (> 5 log(10) spores/g) and not on the average BAB spore concentration in mixed silage across the year. The survey showed that farmers should aim for a concentration in mixed silage of less than 3 loglo spores/g and should prevent the concentration from exceeding 5 log(10) spores/g to ensure a concentration in FTM of less than 3 loglo spores/L. These results correspond with the previously reported model simulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{shelf life}} of pasteurized dairy {{products}} depends {{partly on the}} concentration of Bacillus cereus spores in raw milk. Based on a translation of contamination pathways into chains of unit-operations, 2 simulation models were developed to quantitatively identify factors that have the greatest effect on the spore concentration in milk. In addition, the models {{can be used to}} determine the reduction in concentration that could be achieved via measures at the farm level. One model predicts the concentration when soil is the source of spores, most relevant during grazing of cows. The other model predicts the concentration when feed is the main source of spores, most relevant during housing of cows. It was estimated that when teats are contaminated with soil, 33 % of the <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> milk (FTM) contains more than 3 log(10) spores/L of milk. When feed is the main source, this is only 2 %. Based on the predicted spore concentrations in FTM, we calculated that the average spore concentration in raw milk stored at the dairy processor during the grazing period is 3. 5 log(10) spores/L of milk and during the housing period is 2. 1 log(10) spores/L. It was estimated that during the grazing period a 99 % reduction could be achieved if all farms minimize the soil contamination of teats and teat cleaning is optimized. During housing, reduction of the concentration by 60 % should be feasible by ensuring spore concentrations in feed below 3 log(10) spores/g and a pH of the ration offered to the cows below 5. Implementation of these measures at the farm level ensures that the concentration of B. cereus spores in raw milk never exceeds 3 log(10) spores/L...|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} tanks in the 241 -SY tank <b>farm.</b> <b>Tank</b> 241 -SY 101 and 241 -SY- 103 are {{flammable}} gas watch list tanks. Tank 241 -SY- 102 {{is included in}} the ventilation improvement process in an effort to further control air flow in the tank farm. This tank farm has only one outlet ventilation port for all three tanks. Flammable gas is released (may be steady and/or periodic) from the waste in the primary tank vapor space. The gas is removed from the tank by an active ventilation system. However, maintaining consistent measurable flow through the tank can be problematic due to the poor control capabilities of existing equipment. Low flow through the tank could allow flammable gas to build up in the tank and possibly exceed the lower flammability limit (LFL), prevent the most rapid removal of flammable gas from the tank after a sudden gas release, and/or cause high vacuum alarms to sound. Using the inlet and outlet down stream butterfly valves performs the current method of controlling flow in tank farm 241 -SY. A filter station is installed on the inlet of each tank, but controlling air flow with its 12 inch butterfly valve is difficult. There is also in-leakage through pump and valve pits. Butterfly valves on the downstream side of each tank could also be used to control air flow. However, their large size and the relatively low air velocity make this control method also ineffective. The proposed method of optimizing tank air flow and pressure control capability is to install an air flow controller on the inlet of each existing filter station in SY farm, and seal as best as practical all other air leakage paths. Such air flow controllers have been installed on 241 -AN and 241 -AW tanks (see drawing H- 2 - 85647) ...|$|E
40|$|River Protection Project (RPP) {{performance}} {{for the month of}} July 2000 was very good. The most significant accomplishments that occurred during the month include the following: The Interim Stabilization Project pumped approximately 30, 000 gallons from four tanks. Project-to-date (since June 1998) volume pumped is approximately 808, 000 gallons. Five tanks have been interim stabilized this fiscal year, and tanks 241 -S- 106, 241 -U- 103, and 241 -U- 105 are being evaluated to determine if the stabilization criteria have been met. Out of the 149 single-shell tanks (SSTs), 124 tanks have been stabilized. Pumping this waste from the single-shell tanks to more secure double-shell tanks (DSTs) supports stabilization of the waste tanks and mitigates leakage to the environment. The Interim Stabilization Project is planned to complete by September 2004. Waste Characterization obtained one grab sample in the month of July 2000. A total of 14 core samples, 12 grab samples, and 6 vapor samples have been taken fiscal year-to-date (FYTD) in support of three key FY 2000 sampling milestones. The Waste Treatment Plant Design and Operation organizations have been developed and staffed, including transitioning BNFL Inc. /Bechtel National Inc. employees to CHG.

40|$|Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC (WRPS) {{developed}} an enhanced single-shell tank (SST) integrity project in 2009. An expert panel on SST integrity {{was created to}} provide recommendations supporting {{the development of the}} project. One primary recommendation was to expand the leak assessment reports (substitute report or LD- 1) to include leak causes and locations. The recommendation has been included in the M- 045 - 9 IF Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement) as one of four targets relating to SST leak integrity. The 241 -SX Farm (SX Farm) tanks with leak losses were addressed on an individual tank basis as part of LD- 1. Currently, 8 out of 23 SSTs that have been reported to having a liner leak are located in SX Farm. This percentage was the highest compared to other tank farms which is why SX Farm was analyzed first. The SX Farm is comprised of fifteen SSTs built 1953 - 1954. The tanks are arranged in rows of three tanks each, forming a cascade. Each of the SX Farm tanks has a nominal I-million-gal storage capacity. Of the fifteen tanks in SX Farm, an assessment reported leak losses for the following tanks: 241 -SX- 107, 241 -SX- 108, 241 -SX- 109, 241 -SX- 111, 241 -SX- 112, 241 -SX- 113, 241 -SX- 114 and 241 -SX- 115. The method used to identify leak location consisted of reviewing in-tank and ex-tank leak detection information. This provided the basic data identifying where and when the first leaks were detected. In-tank leak detection consisted of liquid level measurement that can be augmented with photographs which can provide an indication of the vertical leak location on the sidewall. Ex-tank leak detection for the leaking tanks consisted of soil radiation data from laterals and drywells near the tank. The in-tank and ex-tank leak detection can provide an indication of the possible leak location radially around and under the tank. Potential leak causes were determined using in-tank and ex-tank information that is not directly related to leak detection. In-tank parameters can include temperature of the supernatant and sludge, types of waste, and chemical determination by either transfer or sample analysis. Ex-tank information can be assembled from many sources including design media, construction conditions, technical specifications, and other sources. Five conditions may have contributed to SX <b>Farm</b> <b>tank</b> liner failure including: tank design, thermal shock, chemistry-corrosion, liner behavior (bulging), and construction temperature. Tank design did not apparently change from tank to tank for the SX Farm tanks; however, there could be many unknown variables present in the quality of materials and quality of construction. Several significant SX <b>Farm</b> <b>tank</b> design changes occurred from previous successful tank farm designs. Tank construction occurred in winter under cold conditions which could have affected the ductile to brittle transition temperature of the tanks. The SX Farm tanks received high temperature boiling waste from REDOX which challenged the tank design with rapid heat up and high temperatures. All eight of the leaking SX Farm tanks had relatively high rate of temperature rise. Supernatant removal with subsequent nitrate leaching was conducted in all but three of the eight leaking tanks prior to leaks being detected. It is possible that no one characteristic of the SX Farm tanks could in isolation from the others have resulted in failure. However, the application of so many stressors - heat up rate, high temperature, loss of corrosion protection, and tank design - working jointly or serially resulted in their failure. Thermal shock coupled with the tank design, construction conditions, and nitrate leaching seem to be the overriding factors that can lead to tank liner failure. The distinction between leaking and sound SX Farm tanks seems to center on the waste types, thermal conditions, and nitrate leaching...|$|E
40|$|In {{a year-long}} survey on 24 Dutch farms, Bacillus cereus spore {{concentrations}} were measured in <b>farm</b> <b>tank</b> milk (FTM), feces, bedding material, mixed grass and corn silage, and soil from the pasture. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine, in practice, factors affecting the concentration of B. cereus spores in FTM throughout the year. In addition, the results of the survey were used in combination with a previously published modeling study to determine requirements for a strategy to control B. cereus spore concentrations in FTM below the MSL of 3 log(10) spores/L. The B. cereus spore concentration in FTM was 1. 2 +/- 0. 05 log(10) spores/L and in none of samples was the concentration above the MSL. The spore concentration in soil (4. 9 +/- 0. 04 log(10) spores/g) was more than 100 -fold higher than the concentration in feces (2. 2 +/- 0. 05 log(10) spores/g), bedding material (2. 8 +/- 0. 07 loglo spores/g), and mixed silage (2. 4 +/- 0. 07 log(10) spores/g). The spore concentration in FTM increased between July and September compared with the rest of the year (0. 5 +/- 0. 02 log(10) spores/L difference). In this period, comparable increases of the concentrations in feces (0. 4 +/- 0. 03 loglo spores/g), bedding material (0. 5 +/- 0. 05 log(10) spores/g), and mixed silage (0. 4 +/- 0. 05 log(10) spores/g) were found. The increased B. cereus spore concentration in FTM was not related to the grazing of cows. Significant correlations were found between the spore concentrations in FTM and feces (r = 0. 51) and in feces and mixed silage (r = 0. 43) when the cows grazed. The increased concentrations during summer could be explained by an increased growth of B. cereus due to the higher temperatures. We concluded that year-round B. cereus spores were predominantly transmitted from feeds, via feces, to FTM. Farmers should take measures that minimize the transmission of spores via this route by ensuring low initial contamination levels in the feeds...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{converts}} {{the high}} level waste slurries stored at the Savannah River Site into borosilicate glass for long-term storage. The vitrification process results in the generation of approximately five gallons of dilute recycle streams for each gallon of waste slurry vitrified.

Process changes to incorporate salt waste could {{increase the amount of}} effluent to approximately 2, 900, 000 gallons per year. The recycle consists of two major streams and four smaller streams. The first major recycle stream is condensate from the Chemical Process Cell (CPC), and is collected in the Slurry Mix Evaporator Condensate Tank (SMECT). The second major recycle stream is the melter offgas which is collected in the Off Gas Condensate Tank (OGCT). The four smaller streams are the sample flushes, sump flushes, decon solution, and High Efficiency Mist Eliminator (HEME) dissolution solution. These streams are collected in the Decontamination Waste Treatment Tank (DWTT) or the Recycle Collection Tank (RCT). All recycle streams are currently combined in the RCT and treated with sodium nitrite and sodium hydroxide prior to transfer to the tank <b>farm.</b> <b>Tank</b> Farm space limitations and previous outages in the 2 H Evaporator system due to deposition of sodium alumino-silicates have led to evaluation of alternative methods of dealing with the DWPF recycle. One option identified for processing the recycle was a dedicated evaporator to concentrate the recycle stream to allow the solids to be recycled to the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and the condensate from this evaporation process to be sent and treated in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). In order to meet process objectives, the recycle stream must be concentrated to 1 / 30 th of the feed volume during the evaporation process. The concentrated stream must be pumpable to the DWPF SRAT vessel and should not precipitate solids to avoid fouling the evaporator vessel and heat transfer coils. The evaporation process must not generate excessive foam and must have a high Decontamination Factor (DF) for many species in the evaporator feed to allow the condensate to be transferred to the ETP. An initial scoping study was completed in 2001 to evaluate the feasibility of the evaporator which concluded that the concentration objectives could be met. This initial study was based on initial estimates of recycle concentration and was based solely on OLI modeling of the evaporation process. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has completed additional studies using simulated recycle streams and OLI{reg_sign} simulations. Based on this work, the proposed flowsheet for the recycle evaporator was evaluated for feasibility, evaporator design considerations, and impact on the DWPF process. This work was in accordance with guidance from DWPF-E and was performed in accordance with the Technical Task and Quality Assurance Plan...|$|E
