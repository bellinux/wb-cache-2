While on sabbatical in Nepal, they {{recognized}} the desperate need for dental care in a country which, at the time, had 120 dentists for a population approaching 24 million. What started with a single makeshift clinic, serving children in the outskirts of Kathmandu, Nepal, has branched out to the mountains of India, the seaside of Vietnam, the Mayan Highlands of Guatemala, the Karen Hills of Kenya and the Angkor region of northwest Cambodia.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Measures {{used in the}} {{selection}} of <b>international</b> <b>dental</b> students to a U. S. D. D. S. program were examined to identify the grouping that most effectively and efficiently predicted academic performance and clinical competency. Archival records from the <b>International</b> <b>Dental</b> Program (IDP) at Loma Linda University provided data on 171 students who had trained in countries outside the United States. The students sought admission to the D. D. S. degree program, successful completion of which qualified them to sit for U. S. licensure. As with most dental schools, competition is high for admission to the D. D. S. program. The study’s goal was to identify what measures contributed to a fair and accurate selection process for dental school applicants from other nations. Multiple regression analyses identified National Board Part II and dexterity measures as significant predictors of academic performance and clinical competency. National Board Part I, TOEFL, and faculty interviews added no significant additional help in predicting eventual academic performance and clinical competency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Dental {{professionals}} are uniquely positioned to discourage smoking among their patients. However, {{little is known}} about the role of cultural background and attitudes towards smoking in the education of these professionals. Our study aimed to compare native Lithuanian and <b>international</b> <b>dental</b> students’ smoking habits, knowledge about the harmfulness of smoking and attitudes towards smoking cessation. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of smoking and its cessation among dental students at the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (Kaunas, Lithuania) in 2012. All Lithuanian and <b>international</b> <b>dental</b> students in each year of dental school were invited to participate in the survey during a compulsory practical class or seminar. Altogether 606 students participated in the survey with a response rate of 84. 2 %. Explanatory factorial analysis (EFA), multivariate Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) served for the statistical analyses. Results: The percentages of occasional/current regular smokers were 41. 1 % and 55. 7 % (p = 0. 068) among Lithuanian and international male students, and 22. 7 % and 22. 9 % (p = 0. 776) among Lithuanian and international female students, respectively. The <b>international</b> <b>dental</b> students had a deeper knowledge of the harmfulness/addictiveness of smoking and held more positive attitudes towards smoking cessation among their patients than did the native Lithuanian dental students. Conclusions: The findings of the study underscored the need to properly incorporate tobacco cessation training into the curriculum of dental education. However, consideration of the cultural background of dental students in building up their capacity and competence for intervening against smoking is essential...|$|R
