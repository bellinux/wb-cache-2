The paper reports on {{an analysis of the}} land-use patterns of four neighbourhoods developed at different times over the 20 th century. Data originate from field surveys and a systematic measurement of the land uses of the study areas. Findings paint a mixed picture. They show that some societal changes (rising affluence for example) have affected neighbourhood morphology, whereas others (such as cultural diversification) have left few traces. A comparison of different land-use features identifies both the advantages and downsides of each neighbourhood's morphology. It becomes difficult in this light to perceive {{the evolution of}} neighbourhood planning as a linear progression towards improved land-use efficiency and quality of life. ...|$|R

The proposed method concludes multiple methods instead of a single one. It consists ofa set ofsegmentation methods that are consulted in parallel.

40|$|Questions about {{knowledge}} in expert sport {{are not only}} of applied significance: they also {{take us to the}} heart of foundational and heavily-disputed issues in the cognitive sciences. To a first (rough and far from uncontroversial) approximation, we can think of expert ‘knowledge’ as whatever it is that grounds or is applied in (more or less) effective decision-making, especially when in a competitive situation a performer follows one course of action out of a range of possibilities. In these research areas, studies of motor expertise have for many years actively contributed to broader debates in philosophy and psychology (Abernethy, Burgess-Limerick, 2 ̆ 6 Parks, 1994; Williams, Davids, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 1999).

40|$|Abstract: H- 1 is a helical axis {{stellarator}} {{of major}} radius R= 1 m, and average minor radius ~ 0. 15 - 0. 2 m. Its flexible heliac coil set permits {{access to a}} wide range of magnetic configurations. RFgenerated plasma shows a very complex dependence on configuration of both the electron density and the nature of fluctuations. Magnetic fluctuations range from highly coherent, often multi-frequency in sequence or simultaneously, to approaching broad-band (df/f ~ 0. 02 - 0. 5), in the range 1 - 200 kHz. Application of datamining {{to a wide range}} of configurations classifies these fluctuations and extracts poloidal and toroidal mode numbers, revealing that a significant class of fluctuations exhibit scaling which is Alfvénic with electron density (within a constant factor) and shear Alfvénic in rotational transform. An array of optical and interferometric diagnostics is combined with the magnetic probe arrays to provide information on internal structure of the MHD modes, and associated 3 D effects. The configurational dependence is closely related to the presence of low order rational surfaces. The plasma density falls to very low values at these rationals prompting the question: <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> due to the effect of magnetic islands? Magnetic islands are expected to be relatively less important in a moderate shear device such as the heliac, than in conventional stellarators. Results from a uniquely accurate magnetic field mapping system, combined with a comprehensive model of the vacuum magnetic field in H- 1 show tha...|$|E

This is a cross sectional study to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of selected azithromycin tablet. The collected samples were analyzed according to USP specification. The MICs of azithromycin were determined by broth dilution method. MBCs were determined by the drop plate method from the tubes, where apparently no visible growth found. This study showed that MIC & MBC values of azithromycin tablet found highest against Pseudomonas spp., Shigella spp. and E. coli were> 64. 0 mg/ml (micro gram per milliliter) and lowest against B. pumillus was 1. 0 / 2. 0 mg/ml. MIC and MBC values {{higher than that of}} the peak serum concentration of azithromycin must have chance of therapeutic failure and development of azithromycin tolerance and resistance to the bacteria tested. To evaluate the efficiency of antibiotic there are two factors 2. Which influence potential utility of a antibiotics in a specific clinical situation. The first is the measure of potency of the antibiotic for the pathogen in question minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC).

40|$|Vietnam's ethnic minorities, {{who tend}} to live mostly in remote rural areas, {{typically}} have lower living standards than the ethnic majority. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> because of differences in economic characteristics (such as education levels and land) rather than low returns to characteristics? Is there a self-reinforcing culture of poverty in the minority groups, reflecting patterns of past discrimination? The authors find that differences in levels of living are {{due in part to}} the fact that the minorities live in less productive areas characterized by difficult terrain, poor infrastructure, less access to off-farm work and the market economy, and inferior access to education. Geographic disparities tend to persist because of immobility and regional differences in living standards. But the authors also find large differences within geographical areas even after controlling for household characteristics. They find differences in returns to productive characteristics to be the most important explanation for ethnic inequality. But the minorities do not obtain lower returns to all characteristics. There is evidence of compensating behavior. For example, pure returns to location-even in remote, inhospitable areas-tend to be higher for minorities, though not high enough to overcome the large consumption difference with the majority. The majority ethnic group's model of income generation is a poor guide on how to fight poverty among ethnic minority groups. Nor is it enough to target poor areas to redress ethnic inequality. Policies must be designed to reach minority households in poor areas and to explicitly recognize behavior patterns (including compensating behavior) that have served the minorities well in the short term but intensify ethnic inequalities in the longer term. It will be important to open up options for minority groups both by ensuring that they are not disadvantaged (in labor markets, for example), and by changing the conditions that have caused their isolation and social exclusion.
