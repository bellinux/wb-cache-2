25|$|Newcomb's snail {{probably}} shares {{life history}} similarities {{with other members}} of its family. Lymnaeid snails generally feed on algae and vegetation growing on submerged rocks. Snails attach eggs to submerged rocks or vegetation and larval stages do not disperse widely; the entire life cycle is tied to the stream system in which the adults live. Little is known about the biological or environmental factors affecting Newcomb's snail population size, however, important factors may include: annual, multi-year, or decadal changes in stream flows; severe weather, high flow, or channel-scouring events; and periods of prolonged drought. Snail dispersal both upstream and downstream within a stream system probably plays an important function in colonizing or recolonizing suitable habitat, particularly microhabitat protected from channel scour. Dispersal of Newcomb's snail between stream systems is likely infrequent because of their obligate <b>freshwater</b> <b>habitat</b> requirements; historic dispersal probably relied on long-term erosional events that captured adjacent stream systems. This life history differs greatly from the freshwater Hawaiian neritid snails (Neritina granosa, Neritina vespertina) that have marine larvae that migrate into and up streams following a period of oceanic dispersal. Most likely, the planktonic larvae of the neritid snails disperse across the oceanic expanses that separate the main Hawaiian Islands and can colonize streams on any or all of these islands. Newcomb's snail lacks this dispersal capacity.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} Paleogene, {{when the family}} presumably originated, much of Eurasia was covered by shallow seas, as the Indian Plate finally {{attached}} to the mainland. Lacking a detailed study, {{it may well be}} that the first [...] "modern" [...] cormorants were small species from eastern, south-eastern or southern Asia, possibly living in <b>freshwater</b> <b>habitat,</b> that dispersed due to tectonic events. Such a scenario would account for the present-day distribution of cormorants and shags and is not contradicted by the fossil record; as remarked above, a thorough review of the problem is not yet available.|$|E
2500|$|Copepods ( [...] ; meaning [...] "oar-feet") are a {{group of}} small {{crustaceans}} found in the sea and nearly every <b>freshwater</b> <b>habitat.</b> Some species are planktonic (drifting in sea waters), some are benthic (living on the ocean floor), and some continental species may live in limnoterrestrial habitats and other wet terrestrial places, such as swamps, under leaf fall in wet forests, bogs, springs, ephemeral ponds, and puddles, damp moss, or water-filled recesses (phytotelmata) of plants such as bromeliads and pitcher plants. Many live underground in marine and freshwater caves, sinkholes, or stream beds. Copepods are sometimes used as biodiversity indicators.|$|E

2500|$|The river {{provides}} {{wildlife habitat}} including warm and cold <b>freshwater</b> <b>habitat</b> for fish migration and spawning. Historically {{it is interesting}} as one of two Northern California coastal rivers mentioned {{in the early nineteenth}} century by Russian explorer K. T. Khlebnikov as hosting sturgeon, presumably White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), along with the Pajaro River. Khlebnikov stated in his [...] "1820 Travel Notes", [...] "Mr. Kuskov had sent two baidarkas to the Slavianka River to catch sturgeon, and they returned today with ten fish...the largest one exceeding two arshins (4.67 feet) long". Moyle's Inland Fishes of California states that there were historic runs of white, but not green, sturgeon in the Russian River. White sturgeon are the largest freshwater fish in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{is known}} for sure about the {{colouration}} of these birds, as they have not left living descendants. But some inferences can be made based on their phylogeny: {{if they were a}} member of the [...] "higher waterbird" [...] group (see below), they most probably had a plumage similar to that depicted in the reconstruction of Osteodontornis orri â€“ Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes in the modern sense (or Ciconiiformes, if Pelecaniformes are merged there) have hardly any carotenoid or structural colors at all in their plumage, and generally lack even phaeomelanins. Thus, the only colours commonly found in these birds are black, white and various shades of grey. Some have patches of iridescent feathers, or brownish or reddish hues, but these are rare and limited in extent, and those species in which they are found (e.g. bitterns, ibises or the hammerkop) are generally only found in <b>freshwater</b> <b>habitat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The river {{provides}} {{wildlife habitat}} for preservation of rare {{and endangered species}} including cold <b>freshwater</b> <b>habitat</b> for fish migration and spawning. The South Fork Eel was historically rich in salmon and other species of anadromous fish, and has been known as the [...] "most productive sub-basin for anadromous fish". The main anadromous fishes in the South Fork are chinook salmon, coho salmon and steelhead, and {{it is said that}} [...] "the South Fork Eel River once supported about half of the total coho run for the State of California". Historically, the population of chinook was 20,000 while coho averaged 16,000 at Benbow Dam in the 1930s. Since then, the population has steadily declined, with a current population of roughly 1,000. The reason for the decline is the high amount of silt carried into the river by logging activity and road construction. The silt has filled stream pools and caused higher turbidity, which has harmed fish. The South Fork {{is said to be the}} last habitat in the State of California for wild coho.|$|E

2500|$|Striped bass spawn {{in fresh}} water, and {{although}} they have been successfully adapted to <b>freshwater</b> <b>habitat,</b> they naturally spend their adult lives in saltwater (i.e., they are anadromous). Four important bodies of water with breeding stocks of striped bass are: Chesapeake Bay, Massachusetts Bay/Cape Cod, Hudson River, and Delaware River. Many of the rivers and tributaries that emptied into the Atlantic, had at one time, bred stock of striped bass. This occurred until the 1860s. [...] One of the largest breeding areas is the Chesapeake Bay, where populations from Chesapeake and Delaware bays have intermingled. [...] The very few successful spawning populations of freshwater striped bass include Lake Texoma, Lake Weiss (Coosa River), the Colorado River and its reservoirs downstream from and including Lake Powell, and the Arkansas River, as well as Lake Marion (South Carolina) that retained a landlocked breeding population when the dam was built; other freshwater fisheries must be restocked with hatchery-produced fish annually. Stocking of striped bass was discontinued at Lake Mead in 1973 once natural reproduction was verified.|$|E
