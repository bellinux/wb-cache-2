50|$|Balance is {{facilitated}} by larger volumes of water which dilute {{the effects of}} a systemic shock. For example, the death of the only fish in a 10 L tank causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 400 L tank that holds many fish may create only a minor imbalance. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks whenever possible, as they require less intensive attention. This same concept extends to the filtration system as well, external (outside of the tank) systems in particular. Generally speaking, the larger the filtration system depending on its configuration, the more capable it will be of properly maintaining an aquatic environment. External filtration systems provide the added benefit of increasing the overall volume of water and its dilution effect. For example, a 190 L aquarium with an <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> that holds 40 L creates a 230 L aquatic system, and increase of over twenty percent.|$|E
50|$|Dialysis {{works on}} the {{principles}} of the diffusion of solutes and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane. Diffusion is a property of substances in water; substances in water tend to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Blood flows by one side of a semi-permeable membrane, and a dialysate, or special dialysis fluid, flows by the opposite side. A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells, large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys, when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the glomerulus.The two main types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, remove wastes and excess water from the blood in different ways. Hemodialysis removes wastes and water by circulating blood outside the body through an <b>external</b> <b>filter,</b> called a dialyzer, that contains a semipermeable membrane. The blood flows in one direction and the dialysate flows in the opposite. The counter-current flow of the blood and dialysate maximizes the concentration gradient of solutes between the blood and dialysate, which helps to remove more urea and creatinine from the blood. The concentrations of solutes (for example potassium, phosphorus, and urea) are undesirably high in the blood, but low or absent in the dialysis solution, and constant replacement of the dialysate ensures that the concentration of undesired solutes is kept low {{on this side of the}} membrane. The dialysis solution has levels of minerals like potassium and calcium that are similar to their natural concentration in healthy blood. For another solute, bicarbonate, dialysis solution level is set at a slightly higher level than in normal blood, to encourage diffusion of bicarbonate into the blood, to act as a pH buffer to neutralize the metabolic acidosis that is often present in these patients. The levels of the components of dialysate are typically prescribed by a nephrologist according to the needs of the individual patient.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} leak-off of oil based drilling fluid sandstone cores is reported. First we revised the theoretical models for the rheology of the drilling fluid, the flow behavior of drilling fluids in the drill pipe and annulus, and filtration mechanisms. Then systematic static leak-off experiments were carried out using an innovative method where CT scans taken at time intervals were used to visualize and accurately quantify infiltration of fluids in a sandstone core. Different compositions of oil based drilling fluids were investigated, to examine the influence of various particles on the <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake and internal filtration. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake and internal filtration. The results give accurate measurements of the filtration volume of the drilling fluids. Depending on {{the composition of the}} drilling fluid, the formation of <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake could be visualized on CT images. The core flow experiments are matched to the theory for linear static filtration. The results lead to new insights concerning the build of <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake and internal filtration. The experiments use real sandstone cores giving more realistic data than using an API press test and filter paper. This work creates a basis for future improvement of oil based drilling fluid, by providing a better understanding of mechanisms involved in leak-off control.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the solution structure {{and stability of}} a semicon-ductor laser receiving time-delayed and frequency-filtered optical feedback from two <b>external</b> <b>filters.</b> This system {{is referred to as}} the 2 FOF laser, and it has been used as pump laser in optical telecommunication and as light source in sensor applications. The underlying idea is that the two filter loops provide a means of stabilizing and controling the laser output. The mathematical model takes the form of delay differential equations for the (real-valued) population inversion of the laser active medium and for the (complex-valued) electric fields of the laser cavity and of the two filters. There are two time delays, which are the travel times of the light from the laser to each of the filters and back. Our analysis of the 2 FOF laser focuses on the basic solutions, known as continuous waves or <b>external</b> <b>filtered</b> modes (EFMs), which correspond to laser output with steady amplitude and frequency.

40|$|The Star-C {{is a new}} {{multilevel}} converter topology that {{is characterized}} by presenting a close to perfect sinusoidal output voltage. Its main purpose {{is to reduce the}} electromagnetic emissions that can interfere with other equipment placed nearby and to provide a high output power quality without the need of <b>external</b> <b>filters.</b> At the same time, the Star-C requires a significantly lower amount of components than multilevel converters able to reach similar performance. This work introduces the novel converter topology, explains its control and modulation and compares it with conventional two- and three-level converters in terms of THD, efficiency, current ripple and cost. The results show that the Star-C offers a THD that is up to ten times lower than its closer contester. Additionally, its efficiency is slightly higher {{due to the fact that}} zero current switching is used. On the other hand, the cost and size of the Star-C is significantly higher than the other converters under comparison. However, this work does not include the cost of the <b>external</b> <b>filters</b> that each converter might require, which is expected to reduce the cost gap between the Star-C and conventional converters.

40|$|Buildup and {{stabilization}} of <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake {{is a well-known}} phenomenon in several environmental and industrial applications. Significant decline of the tangential rate along thick intervals in lengthy vertical wells yields a nonuniform <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake profile. We derive the mechanical equilibrium equations for the stabilized cake profile accounting for electrostatic particle−rock interaction, varying permeate factor, applying the torque balance to describe cake equilibrium, and calculating the lever arm ratio using Hertz’s theory for contact deformation of cake and particles. An implicit formula for the cake thickness along the well is derived. Two regimes of the stabilized cake buildup correspond to low rates, where the cake starts from the reservoir top, and for high rates, where the cake is formed in the lower well section only. The sensitivity analysis shows that the drag and permeate forces are the competitive factors affecting cake thickness under varying Young’s modulus, rate, and salinity. The main parameters defining external cake profile are injection rate, cake porosity, water salinity, and Young’s modulus.

40|$|Injectivity {{formation}} damage with waterflooding using sea/produced {{water has}} been widely reported in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Campos Basin in Brazil. The damage {{is due to the}} capture of solid and/or liquid particles by reservoir rock that consequently leads to the permeability decline. Another reason for the permeability decline is the formation of a low permeable <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake. However, moderate injectivity decline is not too damaging for a waterflood project with long horizontal injectors, where the initial injectivity index is high. In this case, the injection of raw or poorly treated water may significantly reduce the cost of water treatment, which is a cumbersome and expensive procedure in offshore projects. In this paper we investigate the effects of injected water quality on waterflooding using horizontal wells. An analytical model for injectivity decline, which accounts for particle capture and a low permeable <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake formation, has been implemented into black oil reservoir simulator. It was found that induced injectivity damage results in a noticeable reduction of water cut and in increased (although delayed) sweep efficiency. Pavel G. Bedrikovetsky, Thi K. P.

This is also a method of maintaining the reservoir pressure. Contaminations in the injected water will reduce the injectivity by plugging the porous media around the borehole and by creating an <b>external</b> <b>filter</b> cake, effectively reducing the porosity and permeability.
