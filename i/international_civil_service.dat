40|$|<b>International</b> {{comparisons}} of <b>Civil</b> <b>Services</b> usually overlook the difficulties due to differing {{definitions of the}} <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> in national legal systems. Comparative statistics are therefore extremely misleading, as they are at best based on formal-legal criteria instead of being based on functional definitions. Beyond the issue of numbers, comparing the legal regimes of <b>civil</b> <b>services</b> can also be misleading if the constitutional framework is ignored, {{as demonstrated by the}} link between the constitutional principles applying to the Royal prerogative in the UK,and if attention is centred on the source of regulation – as demonstrated by the case of the socalled privatisation of the Italian <b>civil</b> <b>service.</b> Furthermore, any comparison between <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> regimes should also take into account the content of the relevant regulations and compare them with the rules and principles applicable in the same country’s labour law.

The most significant actions related to communication-coordination-negotiation, in-house training, time management and strategic implementation. Following changes in this service the results show that the process makes it possible to improve the articulation of political programmes with every-day job performance and reallocate existing resources to increase the level of service to users without reducing the level of social performance.

40|$|In {{the most}} {{countries}} the deep modernization and reforming of <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> were launched in 70 ­ 80 {{years of the}} past century and now these processes have given good results. Therefore, it will be useful to adopt a foreign experience on reforming and <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> performance with the aim to determine effective components of <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> performance in Ukraine. The analysis shows that the process of the <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> reforming and development, improving of the performing process are characterized in the world practice as the continental and Anglo­Saxon models, but despite of this most countries have a mixed model of <b>civil</b> <b>service.</b> For modernization of the <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> and approximation to the most preferable type of management in Europe were developed different models, which named «new public administration». In the article the international experience of France, Germany, Great Britain, USA, Japan and other countries on <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> performance in terms of administrative reform was analyzed. It was founded that experience of these countries is very valuable for the development of <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> institute in Ukraine, in particular <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> performance, because these countries made an economic progress and ensured sustainable development. The generalization of the <b>international</b> experience on <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> performance allowed to systemize the development of <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> performance institute in the democratic countries, namely: development of the reform programme and <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> modernization and adoption of new legislation on civil service; optimization and creation new organizational entities in the <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> system; existing of the special institutes of the <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> management; gradual staff reduction of state apparatus; creation of the institute of senior leadership; application of the management methods by the example of private sector; staff rotation; existing of ethic code; ensuring of lifelong education for civil servants. The analysis of the international experience showed that: senior civil servants and special education programs for them should be created; must developed the professional competences to ensure successful cooperation with European institutions, international partners and organizations; it is important to develop a competency approach during implementation of the new education programs for the civil servants, in particular should be determined key issues in training, such as human resource management, change management, leadership...|$|R
