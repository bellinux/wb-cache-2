Due to poor bonding of {{a shield}} machine main drive leading to seal failure sealing {{fracture}} failure occurs, the proposed installation forms of adhesive sealing method {{is replaced by}} platen method, and seal material NBR replaced by a fluorine rubber, so {{that the combination of}} the <b>housing</b> <b>seal</b> is more reliable, avoiding the fracture caused by discontinuity of local sealing. Construction process increases the injection of three different oils enhancing the sealing effect. Through the application of practical project, no failure appears after sealing transformation...|$|E

40|$|A {{failure of}} an ISS intermodule Quick Disconnect (QD) during {{protoflight}} vibration testing of ISS regenerative Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) hardware {{led to the}} discovery of QD design, manufacturing, and test flaws which can yield the male QD susceptible to failure of the secondary <b>housing</b> <b>seal</b> and inadequate housing assembly locking mechanisms. Discovery of this failure had large implications when considering that currently there are 399 similar units on orbit and approximately 1100 units on the ground integrated into flight hardware. Discovery {{of the nature of the}} failure required testing and analysis and implementation of a recovery plan requiring part screening and review of element level and project hazard analysis to determine if secondary seals are required. Implementation also involves coordination with the Nodes and MPLM project offices, Regenerative ECLS Project, ISS Payloads, JAXA, ESA, and ISS Logistics and Maintenance...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 56 Ever since steam {{turbines}} have been built, {{contamination of the}} lube oil by water has been a persistent problem. Water contamination will result in rusting of ferrous components, accelerate sludging leading to sticking of mechanisms. In advanced cases, if water is pumped by the oil pump, immediate bearing failures result. Aeration of oil as it leaves the bearing {{is the reason why}} most forced feed (lube) turbines experience a constant in flow of air into the bearing housings. If this air has a dew point above the coolest place in the oil system, water contamination results. Raising oil reservoir temperatures and better flingers frequently help and sometimes eliminates the problem, but a dry gas purge, either dry nitrogen or dehydrated air, has been proven to be very effective. For best results and safety, the dry gas purge should be introduced into the bearing <b>housing</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} unit denoted the Miniature Intelligent Sensor Module performs sensor-signal-conditioning functions and local processing of sensor data. The unit includes four channels of analog input/output circuitry, a processor, volatile and nonvolatile memory, and two Ethernet communication ports, all {{housed in a}} weathertight enclosure. The unit accepts AC or DC power. The analog inputs provide programmable gain, offset, and filtering as well as shunt calibration and auto-zeroing. Analog outputs include sine, square, and triangular waves having programmable frequencies and amplitudes, as well as programmable amplitude DC. One innovative aspect of the design of this unit is the integration of a relatively powerful processor and large amount of memory along with the sensor-signalconditioning circuitry so that sophisticated computer programs {{can be used to}} acquire and analyze sensor data and estimate and track the health of the overall sensor-data-acquisition system of which the unit is a part. The unit includes calibration, zeroing, and signalfeedback circuitry to facilitate health monitoring. The processor is also integrated with programmable logic circuitry in such a manner as to simplify and enhance acquisition of data and generation of analog outputs. A notable unique feature of the unit is a cold-junction compensation circuit in the back shell of a sensor connector. This circuit makes it possible to use Ktype thermocouples without compromising a <b>housing</b> <b>seal.</b> Replicas of this unit may prove useful in industrial and manufacturing settings - especially in such large outdoor facilities as refineries. Two features can be expected to simplify installation: the weathertight housings should make it possible to mount the units near sensors, and the Ethernet communication capability of the units should facilitate establishment of communication connections for the units...|$|E

40|$|Industry {{sources have}} {{reported}} that over 90 percent of all rolling element bearings will not reach their projected design life. Millions will fail prematurely each year from such causes as dirt and moisture contamination. The overwhelming majority of these failures could be prevented {{through the use of}} appropriately engineered, properly selected, and suitably installed bearing <b>housing</b> <b>seals.</b> Associated savings in labor, materials, and energy would accrue due to extended oil change intervals and a portion of the energy savings component in this equation would consist of lubricant manufacturing cost avoidance. A second, significant portion would be {{associated with the use of}} synthetic lubricants. It has been ascertained that utilization of synthetic lubes would become far more practical if oil drain intervals could be extended.
