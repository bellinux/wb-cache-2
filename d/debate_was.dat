5|$|In the United States, laws {{regulating}} physician licenses {{are governed}} by the states. Between 1901 and 1989, osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a D.O. degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as those with an M.D. degree. In many states, the <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> long and protracted. Both the AOA and the AMA were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process. The first state to pass such a law was California in 1901, the last was Nebraska in 1989.|$|E

5|$|On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a {{dramatic}} gesture at the Sejm, {{is said to have}} bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in {{a dramatic}} attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> being held. Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|E

5|$|The first {{broadcast}} {{debate of}} the campaign took place on 28 September 2011, the day that nominations closed, on RTÉ Radio 1's News at One programme.

5|$|The {{return of}} Andrew Flintoff {{following}} an injury would reignite the ongoing debate about which two of Cook, Bell and Collingwood {{should be included}} in the team, with many speculating that Collingwood would be the man to miss out.

5000|$|The Bohr-Einstein <b>debates</b> <b>were</b> {{a series}} of public {{disputes}} about quantum mechanics between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. Their <b>debates</b> <b>are</b> remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. An account of the <b>debates</b> <b>was</b> written by Bohr in an article titled [...] "Discussions with Einsteinon Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics". Despite their differences of opinion regarding quantum mechanics, Bohr and Einstein had a mutual admiration that was to last {{the rest of their}} lives.|$|R
5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} much <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 {{war crimes}} conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law, that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E
5|$|During the 1894 {{legislative}} session, Brown advocated and won {{passage of}} several government efficiency measures, including {{a bill to}} transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a bill to reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions. The most significant bill, {{and the one that}} generated the most <b>debate,</b> <b>was</b> a law giving married women individual property rights {{for the first time in}} state history. Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding on tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.|$|E

5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536, the north of England was convulsed {{in a series of}} uprisings collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most serious {{opposition}} to Henry's policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters' fury. Cromwell and the king worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile. After it was clear that Henry's regime was safe, the government took the initiative to remedy the evident inadequacy of the Ten Articles. The outcome after months of <b>debate</b> <b>was</b> The Institution of a Christian Man informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church. Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September.|$|E
