40|$|Turbine vanes are {{typically}} assembled as a section containing single or double airfoil units in an annular pattern. First stage <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> results in two common mating interfaces - {{a gap between}} combustor and vane endwall while another from the adjacent sections, called slashface. High-pressure coolant could leak through these gaps to reduce the ingestion of hot gas and achieve certain cooling benefit. As vane endwall region flow field is already very complicated due {{to the presence of}} highly three-dimensional secondary flows, then a significant influence on endwall cooling can be expected due to the gap leakage flows. The entire study is divided into two parts. The first part of this dissertation investigates the endwall film cooling from gap leakage flows with the multiple rows of discrete film cooling holes inside the passages. The later part studies the film cooling performance of multiple endwall cooling designs including inlet leakage jet. Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) technique is used to obtain the detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions on the endwall of a scaled up mid-range industrial turbine vane geometry. Experiments are performed in a blow-down wind tunnel cascade facility at the isentropic exit Mach number of 0. 5 corresponding to Reynolds number of 3. 8 x 105 based on inlet conditions and axial chord length. Passive turbulence grid is used to generate freestream turbulence level about 19 % with an integral length scale of 1. 7 cm. The effect of coolant-to-mainstream mass flow ratio and density ratio on the film cooling have been studied.

40|$|Five-Hole Probes (FHP), being a {{dependable}} {{and accurate}} aerodynamic tool, {{are an excellent}} choice for measuring three-dimensional flow fields in turbomachinery. To improve spatial resolution, a subminiature FHP with a diameter of 1. 68 [*]mm is employed. High length to diameter ratio of the tubing and manual pitch and yaw calibration cause increased uncertainty. A new FHP calibrator is designed and built to reduce the uncertainty by precise, computer controlled movements and reduced calibration time. The calibrated FHP is then placed downstream of the nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (NGV) <b>assembly</b> of a low-speed, large-scale, axial flow turbine.

The three-dimensional time-averaged incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are adopted to numerically simulate the internal flow field of a tubular pump with fixed and adjustable <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> respectively.

40|$|In {{this project}} two pump mode tests {{has been carried}} out on a model RPT in the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. The {{measurement}} set up and execution of the tests were the same, except for the method of dissipating energy in the system. In the first test one of the feed pumps in the basement was used as energy dissipator. In the second test a throttle valve was used as energy dissipator. The objective has been to see how the Waterpower Laboratory is suited for such a test. It was also important to test the two different dissipation methods and evaluate which should be preferred when performing a pump mode test. During the tests it was observed that the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle kept changing. When the results were processed it became evident that the variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle during the tests had a big influence on the measured pump curves. Variations in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle has not previously been observed during turbine mode testing. It is presumed that the variation in <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angles is due to play in the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system and the design of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are Francis vanes, and not RPT vanes. It is assumed that it is the sharp trailing edge of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> that causes turbulence over the vanes in pump mode, thus making the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> move about within the play of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> system.

Due to the tip clearance of the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and the defect of the traditional <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> profiles, the mass flow regulation of VIGV is limited, resulting in a large waste of compressed gas.

Cooling effectiveness {{is a function of}} gas temperature, cooling air temperature and surface metal temperature. The objective of the current work was to study the effect of cooling air temperature on cooling effectiveness. Tests were conducted on a high pressure turbine nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> Gas pressure, gas temperature, cooling air pressure was kept constant and the cooling air temperature was varied as a ratio of gas temperature to cooling air temperature and its effect on metal temperature studied. It was seen that, over the range of cooling air temperature tested, cooling effectiveness remained sensibly constant. Such tests also assist in estimating the surface metal temperature of the nozzle <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> in the engine...|$|R

The pressure {{difference between the two}} sides of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> induces leakage flow through the gap. This flow enters into the suction side with high acceleration, disturbing the primary flow and causing more erosion and losses in downstream turbine components. A cascade rig containing a single <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> passage has been built to study the effect of the clearance gap using pressure sensors and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) technique. This study focuses on developing a numerical model of the test rig, validating the results with experiments and investigating the behavior of leakage flow numerically. It was observed from both CFD and experiment that the leakage flow forms a passage vortex, which shifts away from the wall while travelling downstream. The streamlines contributing to the formation of this vortex have been discussed. Furthermore, the reference <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> with symmetrical hydrofoil has been compared with four cambered profiles, in terms of the <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> loading and the consequent effect on the leakage flow. A dimensionless term called Leakage Flow Factor (Lff) has been introduced to compare the performances of hydrofoils. It is shown that the leakage flow and its effect on increasing losses and erosion can be minimized by changing the pressure distribution over the <b>guide</b> <b>vane...</b>|$|R
