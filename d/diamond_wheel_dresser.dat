40|$|AbstractThe {{engineering}} ceramic {{grinding process}} with an electroplated <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel</b> is significantly {{influenced by the}} detrimental effect of the grain dislodgement which causes surface roughness degradation and tool life decrease. Therefore, {{the thickness of the}} electroplated bond layer must be large enough to provide sufficient micro-bonding force to overcome the single grain micro-cutting force during grinding. However, large electroplated bond layer thickness hampers the protrusion condition of the grains, and causes insufficient active grains. The conventional „trial and error‟ method based on heuristic knowledge currently appears to be the only way in developing electroplated <b>diamond</b> <b>wheels.</b> The difficulty of a deterministic wheel design lies in the lack of an integrated model to predict micro-bonding force and the protrusion conditions of all diamond grains on the wheel surface for given a grain size, dimensional distribution, and bond layer thickness. In this paper, the digital grinding wheel model is developed for single layer electroplated <b>diamond</b> <b>wheels</b> by simulating each wheel fabrication procedure numerically. The model provides a 3 D view of the wheel surface condition and micro-bonding force, protrusion information in correlation with the wheel design parameters, e. g. grain size, dimensional distribution and bond layer thickness. Based on the analysis of the micro-cutting force on a single grain during grinding, the optimal electroplated bond layer thickness can be determined. Finally, a grinding experiment for an alumina engineering ceramic is carried out to verify the efficacy of the model in the development of dislodgement free <b>diamond</b> <b>wheels...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrochemical {{grinding}} (ECG) is {{a variation}} of electrochemical machining (ECM), in which material {{is removed from the}} workpiece by simultaneous electrochemical reaction and mechanically abrasive action. It offers a number of advantages over conventional grinding, such as low induced stress, large depths of cut, and increased wheel life. It has been reported that ECG was employed in machining stainless steel 304, metal-ceramic hard alloy of WC-Co groups, and Tungsten carbide. Inconel 718 is used extensively in aerospace because of their excellent combination of high specific strength (strength-to-weight ratio) which is maintained their fracture resistant characteristics, and their exceptional resistance to corrosion at elevated temperature. The machinability of Inconel 718 is generally considered to be poor owing to several inherent properties of the materials. Poor thermal conductivity, chemically reactivity and low elastic modulus are the common problems. In this paper, ECG is employed to process Inconel 718. To prolong the wheel life, the brazed <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel</b> is introduced to be a tool instead of the electrodeposited <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel.</b> Experiments illustrated that the tool durability has been improved from 15 hours to 50 hours when a brazed <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel</b> was employed to replace an electrodeposited <b>diamond</b> <b>wheel.</b> In addition, a proper high applied voltage and electrolyte temperature was verified to be conductive to improve the maximum electrode feed rate and material removal rate.
