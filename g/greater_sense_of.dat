5|$|Jonathan Blow, the game's lead designer, {{desired to}} create a game around non-verbal communication, wanting players to learn from {{observation}} and to come to epiphanies in finding solutions and leading to a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> involvement and accomplishment with each success. The game includes around 650 puzzles, though the player {{is not required to}} solve them all to finish the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended the}} game to have a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men to defeat a greater threat. High quality cinematics were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also added.|$|E
5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, lacquer and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the Four Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E

5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E
5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|Harmonix {{was formed}} in 1995 from a {{computer}} music group at MIT. Beginning in 1998, the company developed music games inspired by PaRappa the Rapper. In 2001, the company released Frequency, which puts the player in control of multiple instrument tracks. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the game provides a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> creative freedom than earlier rhythm titles. Frequency was critically acclaimed; however, marketing was made difficult by the game's abstract style, which removed the player's ability to perform for onlookers. In 2003, Harmonix followed up Frequency with the similar Amplitude. The company later released more socially driven, karaoke-themed music games in Karaoke Revolution and SingStar (2003 and 2004, respectively). Donkey Konga, a GameCube title developed by Namco and released in 2003, achieved widespread success by leveraging Nintendo's Donkey Kong brand.|$|E

5|$|Most Sri Lankan Tamils {{live in the}} Northern and Eastern {{provinces and}} in the capital Colombo, and most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands. Historically, both groups have seen {{themselves}} as separate communities, {{although there has been}} a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> unity since the 1980s. In 1948, the United National Party government stripped the Indian Tamils of their citizenship. Under the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and most of the remainder were repatriated to India. By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing {{up and down the}} valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
5|$|The plague in London largely {{affected}} the poor, as the rich {{were able to}} leave the city by either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin {{in other parts of the}} country. The subsequent Great Fire of London, however, ruined many city merchants and property owners. As a result of these events, London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the Rebuilding of London Act 1666. Although the street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged, some improvements were made: streets were widened, pavements were created, open sewers abolished, wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden, and the design and construction of buildings controlled. The use of brick or stone was mandatory and many gracious buildings were constructed. Not only was the capital rejuvenated, but it became a healthier environment in which to live. Londoners had a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community after they had overcome the great adversities of 1665 and 1666.|$|E

Those who have undergone a hysterectomy with both ovaries removed typically have reduced testosterone levels as compared to those left intact. Reduced levels of testosterone in women are predictive of height loss, which may occur as a result of reduced bone density, while increased testosterone levels in women are associated with a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> sexual desire.|$|E
25|$|Algonquin Park {{was named}} a National Historic Site of Canada in 1992 in {{recognition}} of several heritage values including: {{its role in the}} development of park management; pioneering visitor interpretation programs later adopted by national and provincial parks across the country; its role in inspiring artists, which in turn gave Canadians a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> their country; and historic structures such as lodges, hotels, cottages, camps, entrance gates, a railway station, and administration and museum buildings.|$|E
25|$|Several Kuwaiti {{museums are}} devoted to Islamic art, most notably the Tareq Rajab Museums and Dar al Athar al Islamiyyah {{cultural}} centres. The Dar al Athar al Islamiyyah cultural centres include education wings, conservation labs, and research libraries. There are several art libraries in Kuwait. Many museums in Kuwait are private enterprises. In contrast to the top-down approach in other Gulf states, museum development in Kuwait reflects a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic identity and demonstrates the strength of civil society in Kuwait, which has produced many independent cultural enterprises.|$|E

25|$|Some bands mark time by {{bringing}} their feet {{all the way}} up to their knee—known as high-mark time. Some bands practice marking time during concert arch with the toes coming off of the ground to give the marcher a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> marching while actually standing still. The heel should hit the ground on the beat. Some bands forgo marking time and instead come to a complete halt when not marching. Traditionally, the drumline would put their feet in a V-shape and lift their feet fully off the ground a few inches. This is to avoid hitting the drums.|$|E
25|$|Gloria Alvarez {{claims the}} riots {{did not create}} social {{distance}} between Hispanics and blacks, but rather united them. Although the riots were perceived in different aspects, Alvarez argues it brought a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> understanding between Hispanics and blacks. Even though Hispanics now heavily populate the area that was once predominantly black, such transition has improved over time. The building of a stronger and more understanding community could help to prevent social chaos arising {{between the two groups}}. Hate crimes and widespread violence between the two groups continue to be a problem in the L.A. area, however.|$|E

While still {{driven by the}} national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> distance and objectivity. Salvador de Madariaga, another prominent intellectual and writer, {{was one of the}} founders of the College of Europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the Liberal International.|$|E
