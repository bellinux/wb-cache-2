This study determined {{the effect of}} force level on <b>force</b> and position <b>reproduction,</b> when both target and <b>reproduction</b> <b>force</b> are self-generated with the same hand.

Subjects generated too high forces for low force levels (130 N). No effect of force level on the position reproduction error was found. Previous studies proposed that reafference feedback, i. e., the sensory prediction from self-generated forces, causes the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error.

40|$|Haptic {{technology}} {{is more and}} more widely used to improve human interaction with devices, for example in touch screens of smartphones that vibrate when touched. Another application is haptic-tele-manipulation where a human controls a slave manipulator (e. g. a surgical-robot) by using a master device (e. g. a joystick). In haptic-tele-manipulation, forces measured at the slave manipulator are fed back to the human operator is order to improve task performance. Currently, human force perception is neglected in haptic system design, implicitly assuming perfect force perception, requiring high performance of the master and slave devices. The goal of this thesis is to identify key factors that influence isometric (static) force perception, and to develop metrics and computational models that quantify and predict this influence. To reach this goal, isometric <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> experiments were performed in which subjects were asked to actively generate the target and <b>reproduction</b> <b>force</b> using the same hand. In this thesis, we analyzed the influences of different factors using the same experimental protocol. Subjects were asked to perform series of two interchanging trials: matching an onscreen force in magnitude and direction (target trial), and subsequently reproducing the same force vector without visual feedback (reproduction trial). The difference in forces exerted during the target and reproduction trial is called the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error. In chapter two, we analyzed the effect of force magnitude on the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error and position reproduction error in one degree of freedom (DOF). Subjects performed <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> tasks at different force levels (10 N – 160 N, with 30 N increments), against a fixed handle, and performed a position reproduction task against a haptic manipulator, which applied constant opposing forces. Subjects reproduced too high forces for low force levels (130 N). No effect of force level on the position reproduction error was found. If the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error is exclusively caused by the reafference feedback (by the CNS predicted sensory feedback caused by self-generated <b>forces),</b> the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error should disappear when both target and <b>reproduction</b> <b>force</b> are self-generated. The results of this study show an effect of force level on the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error, indicating that reafference feedback is not the sole factor in <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> tasks. In chapter three, we analyzed the effect of force direction and arm-posture on the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error in the horizontal plane. The <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> protocol was performed in eight force directions and in four arm postures at a force level of 10 N. Results showed that the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error depends on force direction. The orientation of the ellipses fitted through the <b>reproduction</b> <b>forces</b> changed with arm posture and the least accurate direction aligned with the shoulder in all postures. For each of the four arm postures, a joint torque scaling model based on arm biomechanics was fitted to the other three postures and was shown to accurately explain the reproduction ellipse. This chapter shows that <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> depends on <b>force</b> direction and arm posture, which corresponds with our model based on arm biomechanics and suggests that the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> errors at the endpoint originate at the joint torque level. Chapter four assesses the effect of force magnitude on the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error in the horizontal plane. Three groups of subjects performed the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> protocol in eight force directions and in two arm postures at three force levels (group 1 : 10 N, group 2 : 40 N and group 3 : 70 N). Results show that the orientation of the reproduction ellipses changes with arm posture but not with force level, indicating that the arm biomechanics (i. e. arm orientation) affect the directional and force effects. Additionally, the results show that force level affects the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error differently depending on the force direction, i. e. increased force magnitude increases the errors {{in the direction of the}} shoulder and decreases the errors in the perpendicular direction. To incorporate the force level dependency of the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error, a novel joint-torque-dependent joint-torque-scaling model is developed, which allows us to accurately predict the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> errors in the horizontal plane between 10 N and 70 N. In chapter five, we present an experimental study to examine whether the systematic errors result from an incorrect representation of forces or incorrect execution of correctly represented forces. In this experiment we asked the subjects to reproduce the same magnitude of force (5 N or 15 N) in either the same direction (reference trial) or in a 90 ?-counter-clockwise-rotated direction (CCW trial). We hypothesize that if the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> errors arose through an execution error, subjects would obtain the correct representation of target force but reproduce this incorrectly in the CCW trials, resulting in an identically oriented reproduction ellipse as in the reference trials. However, if these systematic errors arose through an incorrect representation, then we hypothesize that subjects would produce a 90 ?-rotated ellipse relative to the reference trials. The absence of any rotation in our results demonstrates that the forces were represented correctly, and the systematic errors arise as execution errors during reproduction. Moreover, the results suggest that the sensorimotor system does not attempt to match the sensory percept or the motor commands, but instead develops an internal representation of the forces. In chapter six the main results of the thesis are discussed, where we present three overall conclusions: 1) Human force perception comprises systematic errors; 2) Systematic errors in force perception originate at joint level and are predictable; 3) The systematic errors in force perception are execution errors. Based on these overall conclusions we provide two guidelines for haptic system design (H) and two guidelines for neuroscience (N) : H 1) Take the accuracy of human force perception into account to make haptic devices more affordable; H 2) Compensate for the systematic errors in human force perception; N 1) The errors for different modalities originate in different reference frames; N 2) The central nervous system does not simply compare sensory information or motor commands to control the body. The work described in this thesis provides novel insight in the accuracy of human force perception, presents a model that can accurately predict the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error, and provides the first steps in determining where the errors originate.

The Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous Anchor System offers an alternative, but it remains unclear to what extent it affects the perception and control of cable operation forces compared to the traditional shoulder harness. Objective: To compare cable force perception and control with the figure-of-nine harness versus the Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous Anchor System and to investigate force perception and control at different force levels. Study design: Experimental trial. Methods: Ten male able-bodied subjects completed a cable <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> task at four force levels {{in the range of}} 10 – 40 N using the figure-of-nine harness and the Anchor System. Perception and control of cable operating forces were quantified by the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error and the force variability. Results: In terms of <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error and <b>force</b> variability, the subjects did not behave differently when using the two systems. The smallest <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error and <b>force</b> variability were found at the smallest target force level of 10 N.

40|$|Background Compelling {{evidence}} {{points at}} both impaired proprioception and disturbed force control {{in patients with}} chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Because force modulation at least partly relies on proprioception, we evaluated if impaired sense of force production contributes to disturbances of force control in patients with CRPS. Methods Characteristics of voluntary force modulation were examined in the affected upper extremity in 28 CRPS patients with abnormal postures, in 12 CRPS patients without abnormal postures, and in 32 healthy controls. Isometric grip-force matching was compared between conditions with and without visual feedback to identify potential deficits {{in the sense of}} force production in terms of <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> errors. Results Voluntary force modulation was impaired in CRPS patients, but more so in patients with abnormal postures. In particular, CRPS patients with abnormal postures were characterized by reduced maximum force, reduced ability to increase force output according to task instructions, higher variability of force output and less adequate correction of deviations from the target force. Although effects of visual feedback removal appeared largely similar for the two patient groups and controls, our findings with respect to <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> errors suggested that an impaired sense of force production may contribute to the motor dysfunction in CRPS. Conclusions CRPS patients, in particular those with abnormal postures, showed impaired voluntary force control and an impaired sense of force production. This suggests that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoration of proprioceptive impairments, possibly using online visual feedback, may promote the recovery of motor function in CRPS. © 2014 European Pain Federation - EFIC®...|$|R

This study assessed the control of trunk force production in conditions with and without local erector spinae muscle vibration and evaluated the influence of muscle fatigue on trunk sensorimotor control. Twenty non-specific cLBP patients and 20 healthy participants were asked to perform submaximal isometric trunk extension torque with and without local vibration stimulation, before and after a trunk extensor muscle fatigue protocol. Constant error (CE), variable error (VE) as well as absolute error (AE) in peak torque were computed and compared across conditions. Trunk extensor muscle activation during isometric contractions and during the fatigue protocol was measured using surface electromyography (sEMG). <b>Force</b> <b>reproduction</b> accuracy of the trunk was significantly lower in the patient group (CE = 9. 81 ± 2. 23 Nm; AE = 18. 16 ± 3. 97 Nm) than in healthy participants (CE = 4. 44 ± 1. 68 Nm; AE = 12. 23 ± 2. 44 Nm). Local erector spinae vibration induced a significant reduction in CE (4. 33 ± 2. 14 Nm) and AE (13. 71 ± 3. 45 Nm) mean scores in the patient group. Healthy participants conversely showed a significant increase in CE (8. 17 ± 2. 10 Nm) and AE (16. 29 ± 2. 82 Nm) mean scores under vibration conditions. The fatigue protocol induced erector spinae muscle fatigue as illustrated by a significant decrease in sEMG median time-frequency slopes. Following the fatigue protocol, patients with cLBP showed significant decrease in sEMG root mean square activity at L 4 - 5 level and responded in similar manner with and without vibration stimulation in regard to CE mean scores. Patients with cLBP have a less accurate <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> sense than healthy participants. Local muscle vibration led to significant trunk neuromuscular control improvements in the cLBP patients before and after a muscle fatigue protocol.

For this purpose a gearshift simulator was developed based on 2 DOF haptic interface to evaluate users qualitative judgment of automatic gearshifts response. In fact, many car manufacturers use vehicle and primary controls simulators to evaluate the characteristics of a new model before building physical mock-ups or even prototypes. A dedicated control law was designed in order to reproduce different experimentally measured force profiles during forward and backward run of the gearshift handle. The force feedback control law was based on an impedance model with different stiffness values along the path of the gearshift. A state machine selects the characteristics of the force feedback profile according to lever position and velocity. An additional state machine implements the hysteresis behavior of the force profiles by a transition function. The transition algorithm and constraints related to stability are discussed in this paper. The rendered force/position profiles were obtained from experimental data using a real gearshift.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{approximately}} 3750 {{persons have}} an arm defect: they miss (part of) their hand, forearm or even their entire arm. The {{majority of these}} people are in the possession of a prosthesis. This prosthesis can be purely cosmetic, or offer the user some grasping function. The latter can either be a body-powered or a myo-electric prosthesis. A myo-electric prosthesis is controlled by electrical signals originating from the contraction of muscles of the user and is powered by electric motors. Body-powered prostheses are operated by body movements, which are captured by a harness and transmitted through a Bowden cable to the prehensor. Unfortunately, 23 - 45 % of the users are so dissatisfied with their chosen prosthesis that they decide not to wear it. Thus, prostheses need to be improved. This thesis focuses on the improvement of body-powered prostheses, which offer several advantages compared to myo-electric prostheses: they are much lighter, cheaper and more reliable and – perhaps most importantly – offer the user extended proprioceptive feedback about the prehensor’s movements and exerted grip force. On the down side, body-powered prostheses currently require high operation forces, causing pain and fatigue during or after use, and potentially limiting the inherent advantages in perception and control. Additionally, users complain about the comfort and outer appearance of the harness, the design of which still looks like that of the Count of Beaufort in 1860. Lowering the operation forces will most likely increase the pinch force control accuracy and reduce fatigue and pain during or after operation and therefore improve the prosthesis’ functionality. To which level cable forces need to be lowered is up till now unknown; it is assumed that lowering operation forces is effective, but only up the point where the control forces are still clearly distinguishable from noise (like inefficiencies in prehensor or cable friction). The goal of this thesis is to quantify the perception and control capabilities of prosthesis users as a function of body-powered prosthesis design elements, such as mechanical properties of the prehensor, or an alternative harness. The obtained quantified understanding is intended to guide improvements in body-powered prosthesis design, to enhance {{the quality of life of}} upper-limb prosthesis users and to prevent (repetitive strain) injuries. First, a range of maximum cable operation forces between 87 N and 538 N was established for a representative group of prosthesis users (Chapter 2). When the corrected values for fatigue-free operation (20 % of the individually measured maximum force) were compared to the required operation forces of ten commercially available body-powered prostheses, it was concluded that only one of these could be operated fatigue-free. Based on the available results, cable forces should not exceed 38 N for the average female, and 66 N for the average male for most activities in daily life, to enable users to operate their prosthesis fatigue-free. A second study investigated the effect of cable operation forces (15 N versus 51 N) on the ability to transport a test object (Chapter 3). The object was a mechanical egg: too high cable forces would ‘break’ the object; too low cable forces would cause the operator to drop it. The results indicated that the egg was transferred successfully more often at the low cable operation force settings than at the high force setting. A third study investigated users’ perception and control abilities by utilizing a <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> task (Chapter 4). For successful object manipulation we desire a small difference between the intended and actually applied force on an object, as well as only minor fluctuations in the applied force level. In a <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> task the <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error resembles the difference between the intended and actually applied force, whereas the force variability indicates the force fluctuations. The results showed a decreasing <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> error with increasing cable excursions for force levels of 10 and 20 N, and a decreasing force variability for decreasing operation force levels varying between 10 and 40 N. Thus, low force levels and large cable excursions contribute to improved force perception and control. In the fourth and final study an alternative harness design, the Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous Anchor System, was compared with the traditional figure-of-nine harness, as comfort of the harness was identified as being an issue in body-powered prosthesis (Chapter 5). In terms of perception and control capacities of users no differences between the two systems were found for operation forces ranging from 10 to 40 N. It could thus be concluded that the Anchor system appears to be a valid alternative to the traditional harness at low operation force levels as performance is comparable while comfort is reportedly better. In conclusion, this thesis shows that the operation forces which prosthesis users are required to exert are an important factor in body-powered prosthesis design. For most commercially available body-powered prostheses, the control cable forces are too high to be used on a daily basis. To enable users to operate a body-powered prosthesis fatigue-free during the day ‒ every day – with the provision of high quality feedback and adequate prehensor control, operation forces should not exceed 38 N for the average female and 66 N for the average male user. A long operation movement stroke and thus a large cable excursion does contribute to increased prehensor control. For the suggested low operation force levels the Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous Anchor System provides a good alternative for the traditional harness. Biomechatronics & Human-Machine Contro...|$|R

30|$|The {{academic}} literature on labor issues in China has extensively discussed the diversification of labor {{regimes in the}} last thirty years. Compared with the socialist period (1949 – 1978), economic reforms have restructured employment and created an increasingly complex landscape. The industrial state-owned sector is no longer dominant. Service industries account for a growing share of employment. Rural workers (nongmin gong), previously confined to the countryside by the household registration system (hukou), have poured into urban areas {{to form a new}} working class. Labor regimes today can basically be placed on a scale between two extremes depending on the firm’s type of ownership (public, collective, private, national or foreign), geographical location (western, eastern or central provinces), size and industry. At one end of the scale, employees still enjoy high wages and benefits. In some cases, especially in state-owned enterprises and administrations, the danwei system remains in use and some state-owned and foreign-owned enterprises continue to provide high wages and benefits {{with a high level of}} protection against risks (retirement, illness, etc.). At the other end of the scale, working conditions can be highly precarious. In small, private, sometimes foreign-invested, labor-intensive firms, disorganized despotism is particularly pronounced (Chan 2001; Chan and Zhu 2003; Lee 1999). In the case of enterprises that house workers on the production premises themselves, what Pun and Smith call the “dormitory labor regime” (Pun and Smith 2007), there is no long-term relationship between the enterprise and its employees (unlike the paternalistic labor control methods) and no concern with labor <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> (single workers are housed, but not families). The constant turnover of young, predominantly female workers makes this regime a unique factory system.|$|R

Results: Paired sample t-tests revealed that maximal voluntary isometric contraction decreased significantly after cryotherapy (p ≤. 001), or approximately 10 % of the reduction found in both muscular groups assessed. Shoulder position sense (p <. 001) and the threshold for detecting passive movement (p =. 010 and p=. 009 for lateral and medial shoulder rotator muscles, respectively) also suffered significant impairment.

Females were found more sensitive to vibratory stimulations and less asymmetric than males in movement reproduction. The asymmetry observed in males was related to handedness. Both asymmetry and sensitivity were primarily sensory in origin. The second study investigated asymmetries in the sense of effort andMode of access: Internet...|$|R

The performance of the force fields is compared to several popular dispersion corrected density functional methods. In addition, we present our implementation of lattice vibrational free energy calculations in the quasi-harmonic approximation, using several methods to account for phonon dispersion. This allows us to also benchmark the <b>force</b> fields' <b>reproduction</b> of finite temperature crystal structures. The results demonstrate that anisotropic atom-atom multipole-based force fields can be as accurate as several popular DFT-D methods, but have errors 2 - 3 times larger than the current best DFT-D methods. The largest error in the examined force fields is a systematic underestimation of the (absolute) lattice energy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the main features}} of a six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) flight simulation laboratory operated by the authors at the University of Naples. The aim of the flight simulator is twofold: serving as a research tool for model characterization and for the investigation of flying qualities of very-light and ultra-light aircraft; and offering a training options to the pilots of such airplanes. For these reasons the simulator cockpit has been conceived and set up as a generic cabin of a general aviation aircraft. The software suite that guides the various components {{of the system is}} based mainly on the features of FlightGear, an open-source flight simulation software. The simulation of aircraft motion, the cockpit instrument panel and flight controls, the outside scenery are all managed by a number of instances of FlightGear. All FlightGear instances are appropriately executed on different machines and communicate with each other via net protocols. Simulations are also supported by two other software modules. The first one controls the 6 DOF motion of the cockpit. The second module implements a <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> system on the cockpit controls. An overview of all these modules is given in the paper, along with the discussion of the advantages and potentialities given by the source code accessibility and the high configurability of FlightGear. The force feedback model is particularly important to the purposes that this flight simulation facility has being designed for. To obtain an enhanced realism in piloting efforts, particular care has been taken to implement hinge moment equations in the simulation software. The result is a reliable closed-loop force-feedback system on all aircraft commands. Two useful and noteworthy generalizations have been implemented in this context: the effect of the mechanical linkage dynamics on the control surface motion and the effects on the control displacement due to the mechanical friction and to the presence of springs. The geometric, mass, inertia characteristics of each control surface and the hinge moment coefficients are managed by the control loading software. All the details of this model are given in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetry {{in upper}} limb {{performances}} may have multiple origins. The {{aim of this}} research is to determine the contribution of sensory and motor processes to asymmetries in movement sense and sense of effort when considering gender and handedness. The distinction between gender and handedness effects, while often ignored, may shed new light on human performances. The first study investigated asymmetry in movement sense using contralateral reproductions of vibration induced illusions of movements in right (RH) and left (LH) handed young adults of both genders. Females were found more sensitive to vibratory stimulations and less asymmetric than males in movement reproduction. The asymmetry observed in males was related to handedness. Both asymmetry and sensitivity were primarily sensory in origin. The second study investigated asymmetries in the sense of effort and targeted the motor component. Both RH and LH adults were divided into three groups based on hand strength differences. A 20 % MVC reference grip force was matched with the same or opposite hand (of the reference). The matching error increased with hand strength differences for RH only, suggesting that the sense of effort is a consequence of both muscle strength differences and an intrinsic asymmetry of the motor component that may vary with handedness. The last study investigated the relative contributions of efferent copy and sensory feedback to the sense of effort. Vibration was used to distort the sensory information from muscles providing the reference in the grip matching task. Visual feedback of the reference hand was also manipulated. The hand/hemisphere systems were found to differ significantly in their dependence on proprioceptive information during <b>force</b> <b>reproduction,</b> with the left hand being more feedback dependent. These findings lead us to suggest that hand preference and gender contribute to differences in movement representation, force production and sense of effort that may result from the combination of cortical structural differences and information processing specific to each hemisphere, gender and handedness group...|$|R

However, there has been relatively little critical reflection on the postdoctoral experience. Through a self-reflexive autobiographical account of postdoctoral positionality I explore negotiations of the disciplining practices of the academy. In so doing, I consider competing understandings of the role(s) of postdoctoral fellows, the negotiations of differing academic cultures, {{and the ways in which}} <b>forces</b> of <b>reproduction</b> and initiation into the academy perpetuate the transgressive position of the postdoctoral fellow. The argument is made that postdoctoral fellows, particularly international fellows, are continually reinscribed as, simultaneously, an insider and outsider in the academic system, located in a double bind of absence which also offers a privileged moment through which to engage with and work across assumed divisions in the spaces and practices of knowledge production.

40|$|The direct {{simulation}} Monte Carlo (DSMC) {{method is}} a stochastic approach {{to solve the}} Boltzmann equation and is built on various numerical schemes for transport, collision and sampling. This work aims to compare and contrast two popular O(N) DSMC collision schemes - no-time-counter (NTC) and majorant collision frequency (MCF) - {{with the goal of}} identifying the fundamental differences. MCF and NTC schemes are used in DSMC simulations of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium gas to study convergence with respect to various collision parameters. While the MCF scheme <b>forces</b> the <b>reproduction</b> of the exponential distribution of time between collisions, the NTC scheme requires larger number of simulators per cell to reproduce this Poisson process. The two collision schemes are also applied to the spatially homogeneous relaxation from an isotropic non-Maxwellian given by the Bobylev exact solution to the Boltzmann equation. While the two schemes produce identical results at large times, the initial relaxation shows some differences during the first few timesteps...|$|R
40|$|Low {{back pain}} is a {{prevalent}} problem afflicting approximately 80 % {{of the population}} during their lives. Subjects with back pain demonstrate deficits in trunk proprioception. Spinal manipulation is a treatment with known effects in pain control, increased motion and other neurophysiological effects. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the treatment effects of spinal manipulation on trunk proprioception in subjects with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and to determine if those effects lasted one week. Thirty-three subjects with CLBP, aged 24 - 54 years participated in this unbalanced, randomized controlled crossover design. Subjects presented for two or three testing sessions and agreed to a general physical examination followed by proprioception testing with joint position sense (JPS), threshold to detect passive motion (TTDPM), direction of motion (DM) and <b>force</b> <b>reproduction</b> (FR). After proprioception testing, each subject received either a lumbar manipulation or a sham procedure followed by retesting of proprioception. This procedure was repeated the following week using the opposite treatment. Those subjects receiving spinal manipulation in the second session returned for a third session and received the sham procedure a second time. Spinal manipulation produced a significant effect for TTDPM in the Manip 1 st Group, the sham procedure produced a significant immediate effect for JPS in the Sham 1 st Group, and manipulation resulted in a significant one-week residual effect for the Manip 1 st Group. All other time comparisons were not significant. The results of this study minimally support the proposed hypotheses. The results of this study suggest that spinal manipulation has minimal effect on trunk proprioception in subjects with CLBP who are painfree at the time of testing. Subjects in this study did not demonstrate as large a deficit in proprioception as previously reported. This study might suggest that a lack of demonstrable deficit in painfree subjects at the time of testing is the result of diminished pain level. Strong conclusions cannot be made from these results but suggest further testing comparing manipulation with no intervention or other interventions while controlling for pain level, may be important for understanding the functional implications of the neurophysiological effect of spinal manipulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to treat the {{reproduction}} of manpower resources as a multiphase process occuring within a more general process of reproduction of social productive <b>forces.</b> The <b>reproduction</b> of manpower resources consists of three phases: 1) production of manpower resources being composed of: a) bioäogical reproduction of able-bodied population and b) its social preparation for work; 2) distaibution and redistribution of these resources among different sectors of human activity; 3) their utilization in production of goods and services as well as in process of forming the manpower. The structure of and factors acting in each phase are analysed in following parts of the paper in order to indicate the crucial problems of planning the reproduction of manpower resources. Potential structural imbalances between manpower needs and supply which can emerge on the stage of national plan elaboration and ways to overcome them are considered. Special attention is paid to interdependencies between the reproduction of manpower resources and the reproduction of means of production.

40|$|Despite a {{proliferation}} of critical studies on management education, there is a paucity of knowledge {{of the ways in}} which problematic beliefs, values and practices are reproduced in and through management education. By drawing on and extending Bourdieu’s seminal work, this paper offers a new perspective on reproduction on the global scale. Our framework spans three inter-related levels of analysis: the dominant beliefs, values and practices (nomos and doxa) of management in global society, the structuration of the field of management education on a global scale, and the prevailing pedagogical practices in management education programs. Our analysis adds to critical studies of management education by elucidating the overwhelming institutional <b>forces</b> of <b>reproduction</b> and thus explaining how difficult it is to effect change in the prevailing ideas, values and practices. Unlike most critical analyses, we also explain how change might take place and what it would require. Thus, our analysis advances studies of reproduction in this era of globalization more generally. It also provides an example of how Bourdieusian ideas can be applied and expanded upon in novel ways in research on education in general and management education in particular...|$|R
