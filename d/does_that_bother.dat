5000|$|The Hoods {{will usually}} show up several centuries after a race has been [...] "seeded" [...] {{to destroy it}} in their {{previous}} attempt to alter history.

This is heavy duty when you figure such a career is usually over when a player reaches his mid-thirties. This is {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> Hank.

5000|$|Miu {{is another}} twelve-year-old {{girl who is}} {{depicted}} in the story as having a problem-child personality. A childhood friend of Chika, she lives {{next door to the}} Ito house and attends the same class as Chika. Miu likes to say random things out of the blue and often plays pranks on Matsuri and Ana, but is most of the time interrupted by Nobue (and sometimes by Chika), ending up lying face-down on the floor. She has the least common sense or manners of the girls, and is rarely taken seriously because of her weird ideas and comments. She seems to harbor some sort of jealousy of Ana and Matsuri, because Nobue finds them cuter. She does not have any delicacy and tends to <b>do</b> things <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> people around her. Miu is nicknamed [...] "Mi-chan". Miu has been described as [...] "Yotsuba Koiwai with fangs".|$|R

Having <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> don't <b>bother</b> any more about your right hand. It {{has nothing to do}} with the correct pointing of your arrow, for it must be kept close to your right ear, just as if it were screwed there. Then with your left hand bring around the bow so that your fist--with the arrow-head, which is resting on top of it--shall point, as nearly as you can make it, directly at the centre of the target. Then let fly, and ten to one you'll make a hit. Now, what do you think of that for a discovery? I've thoroughly tested the plan, and it works splendidly." ...|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other segmental scripts. For example, the Meroitic script of ancient Sudan did not indicate an inherent a (one symbol stood for both m and ma, for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family of abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> to write the most common vowel.|$|R
50|$|As {{he did not}} {{consider}} {{the arts and crafts}} separate, he is also noted for the making of rugs and tapestries. He also built houses, stage sets, a semi-circular Greco-Roman theaters and created a ranch to be close to nature, with gardens, water works and an orchard. His wide range of interests attracted some negative criticism for not specializing while others depreciated his work because of his frequent travels, calling him “bohemian.” His art has also been classified as “handcraft” but <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> him, instead took pride in it.|$|R

I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet.|$|R
6000|$|And yet, somehow, the British doggedness {{does not}} always answer. [...] "Do you know that old woman in the drab jacket, Titmarsh?" [...] my {{hereditary}} legislator asks of me. [...] "What the devil is she bothering ME for, about my aunts, and setting her daughter at me? I ain't such a fool as that. I ain't clever, Titmarsh; I never said I was.

5000|$|Percy Brand is a crook, {{a veteran}} of various cons and schemes. Unfortunately, he is {{regularly}} sent to prison by judge Sir Edward Crichton. <b>That</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> Percy too much, but what does concern him is that his son, Colin, does not discover what his dad does for a living. Percy tells him tales about being a missionary in China when he is released in 1938, a military chaplain in North Africa in 1941, and a freed prisoner of war in 1946 to cover his absences in gaol. While Percy is [...] "away", Colin is cared for by Aunt Florence.|$|R
5000|$|Fregley is a {{child who}} lives in Greg's neighborhood. Greg is not {{particularly}} fond of him because he acts strangely. In Dog Days, Greg's mom tries to get him and Fregley together for a [...] "playdate". Greg neglects {{to do anything with}} Fregley, but <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> Fregley. He thinks that Greg is cool and wants to hang out with him. Greg is unaware of this and remains so throughout the books, although in Hard Luck, it is shown that Greg tries to make Fregley his best friend. However, this attempt fails, and somehow Fregley becomes the most famous student at Westmore Middle School and making Greg jealous.|$|R

[...] However, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake damaged many buildings {{in the area and}} devastated a number such as Plaza Washington. This and a severe economic crisis [...] started a process of deterioration, with many residents moving out.(lacustre) Street peddlers have significantly increased in number and many of the damaged structures are inhabited by squatters or have been converted into tenements, with absentee landlords <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> to collect the long-frozen rents. Most of the stately homes still in good condition have been converted into businesses such as nightclubs. Residents complain that infrastructure, especially lighting, has not been sufficiently maintained, leading to crime.|$|R
40|$|In a {{calculation}} involving imaginary numbers, {{we begin with}} real numbers that represent concrete measures and {{we end up with}} numbers that are equally real, but {{in the course of the}} operation we find ourselves walking “as if on a bridge that stands on no piles”. How is <b>that</b> possible? How <b>does</b> <b>that</b> work? And what is involved in the as-if stance that this metaphor introduces so beautifully? These are questions <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> Törless deeply. And <b>that</b> Törless is <b>bothered</b> by such questions is a central question for any reader of Törless.
