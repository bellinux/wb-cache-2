5000|$|Here, {{with respect}} to Chick Kam Choo's state-law {{wrongful}} death claim, the federal court's <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> <b>conveniens</b> determination that the case should be heard in Singapore rather than Texas did not preclude re-filing of the claim in Texas state court.

40|$|When U. S. {{corporations}} {{cause harm}} abroad, should foreign plaintiffs {{be allowed to}} sue in the United States? Federal courts are increasingly saying no. The courts have expanded the doctrines of <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> convenes and prudential standing to dismiss {{a growing number of}} transnational cases. This restriction of court access has sparked considerable tension in international relations, as a number of other nations view such dismissals as an attempt to insulate U. S. corporations from liability. A growing number of countries have responded by enacting retaliatory legislation that may ultimately harm U. S. interests. This article argues that the judiciary’s restriction of access to federal courts ignores important foreign relations, trade, and regulatory considerations. The article applies institutional choice theory to recommend a process by which the three branches of government can work together to establish a more coherent court-access policy for transnational cases...|$|R
40|$|Following a brief {{description}} of multi-state insolvency theories and the different types of jurisdiction exercisable by a court, this paper examines jurisdiction in corporate insolvency within Australia. It begins with the constitutional context and then addresses geographical jurisdiction; jurisdiction to prescribe conduct, and jurisdiction to adjudicate between parties. It briefly touches upon the notion of an inherent jurisdiction to adjudicate in liquidation and on jurisdiction for proceedings during the course of, rather than on the adjudication of, a liquidation. The discussion on jurisdiction to adjudicate in a multi-state liquidation in Australia addresses winding up of a foreign company under Part 5. 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) as well as topics such as <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> conveniens; lis alibi pendens; anti-suit injunctions; and the notion of discretion to exercise jurisdiction to wind up a company. The jurisdiction to provide aid and auxiliary assistance upon request from a foreign court is also touched upon briefly...|$|R

50|$|Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that a federal court's {{dismissal}} of a civil action on the ground that it should be heard in a foreign court, under the doctrine of <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> <b>conveniens,</b> does not preclude the plaintiff from filing the same action in a state court that applies different <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> <b>conveniens</b> rules.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} {{of a change in}} substantive law should ordinarily not be given conclusive or even substantial weight in the <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> <b>conveniens</b> inquiry. If conclusive or substantial weight were given to the {{possibility of}} a change in law, the <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> <b>conveniens</b> doctrine would become virtually useless. Jurisdiction and venue requirements are often easily satisfied. As a result, many plaintiffs are able to choose from among several forums. Ordinarily, these plaintiffs will select that forum whose choice-of-law rules are most advantageous. Thus, if the {{possibility of a}}n unfavorable change in substantive law is given substantial weight in the <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> <b>conveniens</b> inquiry, dismissal would rarely be proper. Additionally, this would lead to other practical problems. At least where the foreign plaintiff named an American manufacturer as defendant, a court could not dismiss the case on grounds of <b>forum</b> <b>non</b> <b>conveniens</b> where dismissal might lead to an unfavorable change in law. The American courts, already very attractive to plaintiffs, would become even more attractive. The flow of litigation into the United States would increase and further congest already crowded courts.|$|E
