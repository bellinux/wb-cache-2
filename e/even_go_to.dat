25|$|The Supercross season {{takes place}} during the winter and spring months, with races in a {{different}} city every weekend. There are 17 races in the 2011 and 2012 Monster Energy AMA/FIM Supercross schedule. The Supercross Lites riders series is split into two series—the East and the West Coast. The Supercross class has one large series where they travel {{from east to west}} for the race and <b>even</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Canada for a couple rounds. Racers only get a month or two off out of the year between the Supercross and the motocross series.|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the cast}} and crew are {{encouraged}} to contribute song suggestions, with many ideas coming from series creator Bill Lawrence, writer Neil Goldman, and actors Zach Braff (whose college friends Cary Brothers and Joshua Radin appear on the Scrubs soundtrack) and Christa Miller (who selected Colin Hay and Tammany Hall NYC). According to Lawrence, [...] "Christa picks so much of the music for the show {{that a lot of the}} writers and actors don't <b>even</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> me anymore when they have a song.

2500|$|Hip hop {{was thought}} to have {{originally}} become popular in Japan because the Japanese people wanted to imitate African-Americans. The Japanese would hear these rapper's music spinning in clubs, exposing to them a small, narrow view of West Coast hip hop. It {{was not only the}} music they latched onto, however. They came to love the entire hip hop culture, including the loose-fitting clothes, graffiti writing, and break dancing. Some Japanese hip-hop fans would <b>even</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> tanning salons to darken their skin, and style their hair in afros or dreadlocks to imitate the [...] "cool" [...] looks of African-Americans, although they are ridiculed by others, including other hip-hoppers.|$|E
2500|$|His perfectionism was legendary; however, his {{relentless}} {{insistence on}} rehearsals and retakes was {{a burden to}} some. When time approached for the shooting of a number, Astaire would rehearse for another two weeks and record the singing and music. With all the preparation completed, the actual shooting would go quickly, conserving costs. Astaire agonized during the entire process, frequently asking colleagues for acceptance for his work. As Vincente Minnelli stated, [...] "He lacks confidence to the most enormous degree {{of all the people}} in the world. He will not <b>even</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see his rushes... He always thinks he is no good." [...] As Astaire himself observed, [...] "I've never yet got anything 100% right. Still it's never as bad as I think it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|One defendant, Barbier, who had {{previously}} admitted playing {{an active part in}} the events of the 17 August, totally retracted his evidence and claimed he had never been there. Despite the efforts of the court, it was impossible to get from him anything other than abject denials. A French worker, Vernet, supposedly stabbed in the stomach and the side by an Italian, had not answered a witness summons. The prosecutor sent for him by telegraph. The following day, a 30-year-old Vernet was called to the stand and asked if he had been stabbed. He replied, [...] "I wasn't stabbed. I didn't <b>even</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the saltpans at Aigues-Mortes." [...] Asked if he was, indeed, Vernet from Saint-Laurent-du-Pont, he replied [...] "Certainly, but I'm a telegram postman in Grenoble and I have never set foot in the saltpans. I know another Vernet in Saint-Laurent-du-Pont and it's my uncle, a man of fifty years, a cultivater who has never left the land." [...] The court decided that someone had given a false name.|$|E
