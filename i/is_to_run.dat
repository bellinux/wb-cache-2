25|$|The correct method <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the longe {{line through}} the inside bit ring, over the poll, and attach it to the outside bit ring. This method of {{attaching}} the line requires it to be changed each time the horse changes direction. This method has a slight gag effect, raising the bit up and applying pressure on {{the corners of the}} mouth and placing pressure on the poll, but puts less lateral pressure on the bit. It is best for horses that pull, or when the trainer is longeing a rider, to ensure maximum control of the horse.|$|E

25|$|The {{incident}} of her running between the Al-Safa and Al-Marwah hills is remembered by Muslims when they perform their pilgrimage (Hajj) at Mecca. Part of the pilgrimage <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> seven times between the hills, in commemoration of Hājar's courage {{and faith in}} God as she searched for water in the desert (which {{is believed to have}} then miraculously appeared from the Zamzam Well), and to symbolize the celebration of motherhood in Islam as well as the leadership of women. To complete the task, some Muslims also drink from the Zamzam Well and take some of the water back home from pilgrimage in memory of Hājar.|$|E
25|$|A cross {{assembler}} (see also cross compiler) is an assembler that is {{run on a}} computer or operating system (the host system) of a different type from the system on which the resulting code <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> (the target system). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems {{that do not have}} the resources to support software development, such as an embedded system. In such a case, the resulting object code must be transferred to the target system, either via read-only memory (ROM, EPROM, etc.) or a data link using an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code, such as Motorola S-record or Intel HEX.|$|E
25|$|However, a bear's first {{reaction}} upon detecting a human <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away. Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory {{based more on}} intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from {{thousands of years ago}} when they had to be wary of larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before.|$|E

25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the optical path length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a spherical mirror). In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E
25|$|The {{traveling}} salesman {{problem is}} {{what is called a}} conventional optimization problem. That is, all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> through the possible travel choices {{to come up with the}} one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.|$|E

500|$|Periyar wanted {{thinking}} {{people to}} see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a government <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued {{that the government was}} not for the people, but, in a [...] "topsy-turvy" [...] manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage {{of a small group of}} people.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{opportunities}} for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate. With a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree, {{it is the most}} generous bursary scheme offered by any British university. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships. Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities. The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards. In 2016, Oxford University announced that it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> its first free online economics course as part of a “massive open online course" [...] (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.
