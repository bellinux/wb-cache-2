40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{workplace}} partnership delivers mutual gains is subject to considerable debate amongst practitioners and scholars. One {{of the oldest and}} largest examples of workplace partnership is the John Lewis Partnership that began using forms of non-union <b>employee</b> <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> 1929. Despite ongoing interest from researchers <b>in</b> <b>employee</b> <b>representation,</b> and specifically non-union forms of employee voice, there have been few in-depth studies of the Partnership's organisational structure and practices since the 1980 s. This paper explores in detail the operation of <b>representation</b> structures <b>in</b> the John Lewis Partnership, which is a significant case of non-union workplace partnership with the potential for mutual gains. A key finding of the paper was that the decision-making structures that characterise the Partnership, and that are protected by a constitution, are under constant threat from the discursive struggle to define partnership in a way that privileges managerial interests. The paper argues, therefore, that mutual gains need to be secured both structurally and discursively to address the tensions and paradoxes at the heart of debates about the meaning and aims of <b>employee</b> <b>representation.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{understands the}} Pact {{as a social}} {{contract}} shaping not only the status of employees of state enterprises in the transition period, but {{as an act of}} a wider scope.

The Pact is accompanied by several drafts of legal acts, which contain new elements of the employment system and are based on solutions adopted in the EEC countries. Evaluating these drafts from the point of view of market economy, the author is of the opinion that not all proposals contained in the Pact meet such requirements.

40|$|American {{labor law}} has largely {{failed to deliver}} a viable {{mechanism}} for <b>employee</b> <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> workplace governance, while the ever-expanding body of employment law does not even attempt to do so. The resulting “democratic deficit” in the workplace {{is a problem in}} part because, without <b>employee</b> <b>representation,</b> the rights and labor standards mandated by employment law are widely under-enforced. But that very problem could point toward a solution. For while employment law does not aim to give employees a role in workplace governance, it has in fact fostered the growth of new governance mechanisms within firms in the form of internal compliance programs that capitalize on and develop firms’ own regulatory capabilities. The law has encouraged this development in part by conferring regulatory advantages on firms that maintain “effective” self-regulatory structures. Missing, however, is the recognition that, for self-regulation to be effective in the realm of employment law, it must include an organized institutional voice for employees. In other words, there should be no self-regulation, and no self-regulatory privileges, without <b>employee</b> <b>representation.</b> These same mechanisms of “regulated self-regulation” and <b>employee</b> <b>representation,</b> coupled with an appropriately broad definition of employer liability, could also help {{to address the problem of}} widespread noncompliance with labor standards among the small contractors that supply labor to more visible and capable organizations. In short, existing developments within and among firms could and should be steered toward creating new mechanisms for collective employee participation in workplace governance.
