40|$|This study {{examined}} the hypothesis that cognitive resources {{may be involved in}} swallowing. The approach involved a dual-task, reaction time (RT) paradigm with 10 healthy, non-impaired (NI) control participants and 10 participants in early to middle stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). First, baseline measures were obtained for <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> anticipatory phase and oropharyngeal phase during swallowing and RTs to non-word, auditory stimuli. Next, a dual-task was introduced requiring participants to swallow 5 ml of water from a cup while listening for a target non-word presented auditorily during anticipatory or oropharyngeal phases. Target stimuli were randomized across 19 baseline/single-task and 19 dual-task trials. For the single-task data, repeated measures analyses of variance were used to assess differences in (a) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> the anticipatory phase across trials within and between participant groups; (b) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> the oropharyngeal phase across trials within and between participant groups; and (c) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> reaction times across trials within and between groups. For the dual-task data, analyses of variance were used to assess differences in (a) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> the anticipatory phase between baseline/single-task and dual-task conditions; (b) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> the oropharyngeal phase between baseline/single-task and dual-task conditions; and (c) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> reaction times between baseline/single-task and dual-task conditions for each of the two swallowing phases. Results showed slowed swallowing and RTs in participants with PD compared to controls in both anticipatory and oropharyngeal phases of swallowing. This effect was largely carried by participants in more severe, mid-stage disease as compared to early disease. The anticipatory phase was more affected than the oropharyngeal phase, suggesting that cognitive demands may be greater for that phase. Swallowing durations were similar for NIs and participants in early stage PD, underscoring the strength and persistent nature of swallowing...|$|R
30|$|The {{increment}} of {{the random}} traffic {{is larger than}} that of the uniform traffic. The reasons are as follows. Under uniform traffic, the transmission <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> links in a pairing are diverse in MPMH [1]. The diversities bring about the waste of time slots in a pairing. The differences among the transmission <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> links in a pairing under random traffic are worse, which result in further degradations in the throughput performance. However, the transmission <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> links in a pairing are the same under both traffic patterns in MPMH-SRSC. Thus, it outperforms the MPMH under uniform traffic and has greater performance increment under random traffic.|$|R
