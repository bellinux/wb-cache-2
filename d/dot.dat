5|$|<b>Dot</b> holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells <b>Dot</b> that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits <b>Dot,</b> who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells <b>Dot</b> she knows nothing about the dress but <b>Dot</b> then finds it in Dotty's school bag. <b>Dot</b> returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but <b>Dot</b> catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed <b>Dot.</b> <b>Dot</b> smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school.

5|$|<b>Dot</b> is {{introduced}} to EastEnders soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Lou Beale (Anna Wing) {{who works with}} Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie comes and goes, always treating <b>Dot</b> badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved in drugs, robberies and murder, and tries to cheat <b>Dot</b> out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, <b>Dot</b> believes he can be redeemed. <b>Dot</b> also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) and Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), who becomes addicted to drugs. <b>Dot</b> believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge. It is concluded that she died after choking on her own vomit, and <b>Dot</b> is devastated.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, <b>Dot</b> is {{released}} and shares her regret with Ian {{that she did}} not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells <b>Dot</b> he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells <b>Dot</b> that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. <b>Dot</b> takes salsa classes and works with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) up on a date. <b>Dot</b> receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. <b>Dot</b> discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. <b>Dot</b> and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses <b>Dot</b> of being too old to drive. <b>Dot</b> then locks her car key away. After Patrick and <b>Dot</b> go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. <b>Dot</b> is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. <b>Dot</b> says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. <b>Dot</b> reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that <b>Dot</b> cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books <b>Dot</b> a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed. <b>Dot</b> starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much.

5|$|Hurricane <b>Dot</b> of August 1959 was at {{its time}} the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Hawaiian history. <b>Dot</b> was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawaii on August1. The storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July24-27, but was never confirmed {{due to a lack}} of ship reports. <b>Dot</b> was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August3, <b>Dot</b> reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150mph (240km/h). Intensity leveled off afterwards as <b>Dot</b> tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August5, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. <b>Dot</b> made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August8.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, <b>Dot</b> is told by {{the police}} that Nick has died of {{respiratory}} failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to <b>Dot</b> is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent <b>Dot</b> from looking in the coffin. <b>Dot</b> is suspicious and invites Yvonne {{to tell the truth}} and she assures <b>Dot</b> that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon <b>Dot,</b> {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Saling, was the strongest storm of the 1985 season. <b>Dot</b> {{originated}} from a small area of thunderstorm activity in early to mid October. The system was first classified on October11, and steadily intensified {{over the next few}} days. <b>Dot</b> attained typhoon strength on October15, and subsequently entered a period of explosive deepening, which was not anticipated by forecasters. The next day the intensification rate slowed, but that evening, <b>Dot</b> attained its maximum intensify. A steady weakening trend began on October17, though the system maintained typhoon intensity through the passage of the Philippines. After entering the South China Sea late on October18, <b>Dot</b> briefly re-intensified, only to weaken as it approached Vietnam. On October21, <b>Dot</b> struck Vietnam while still a typhoon, but dissipated the next day over the high terrain of the nation.|$|E

5|$|When Nick returns after {{a seven-year}} absence, he tells <b>Dot</b> {{he has changed}} {{and is now a}} plumber, {{introducing}} her to his six-year-old daughter Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin). However, <b>Dot</b> discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. <b>Dot</b> gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill <b>Dot</b> for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage, resulting in an explosion in Kathy's café. Nick survives and after being disowned again by <b>Dot,</b> he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, Sandy (Caroline Pegg), following various devious deeds, such as accusing <b>Dot</b> of beating her, which leads to <b>Dot</b> being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, <b>Dot</b> is sorry to see Dotty go.|$|E

40|$|Two <b>Dots</b> is {{a popular}} single-player puzzle video game for iOS and Android. In its {{simplest}} form, the game consists of a board with <b>dots</b> of different colors, and a valid move consists of connecting a sequence of adjacent <b>dots</b> of the same color. We say that <b>dots</b> engaged in a move are "hit" by the player. After every move, the connected <b>dots</b> disappear, and the void is filled by new <b>dots</b> (the entire board shifts downwards and new <b>dots</b> appear on top). Typically the game provides {{a limited number of}} moves and varying goals (such as hitting a required number of <b>dots</b> of a particular color). We show that the perfect information version of the game (where the sequence of incoming <b>dots</b> is known) is NP-complete, even for fairly restricted goal types...|$|R

5|$|Abi invites <b>Dot</b> to Christmas in Exeter but <b>Dot</b> insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, <b>Dot</b> tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take <b>Dot</b> to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. <b>Dot</b> is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. <b>Dot</b> is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. <b>Dot</b> and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Aged 18, <b>Dot</b> married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock).

5|$|At 1800UTC on August1, an {{unidentified}} ship roughly 950mi (1,550km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii reported 70mph (110km/h) winds within a storm, prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm <b>Dot.</b> Despite an apparent correlation between <b>Dot</b> and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone, {{the lack of}} ship reports between July27 and August1 prevented the agency from confirming that the two systems were the same. Nonetheless, development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward, with reports from the SS Sonoma indicating that <b>Dot</b> had intensified to hurricane strength by August2. Rapid intensification continued, and at 0000UTC on August3, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952mbar (hPa; 28.11inHg), making <b>Dot</b> a Category4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later analysis indicated that these figures constituted the hurricane's peak intensity.|$|E

In addition to connecting the <b>dots,</b> when a player connects at least four <b>dots</b> to form a square, all of the <b>dots</b> in the game area with a color same as the <b>dots</b> used to form a square will disappear, and any <b>dot(s)</b> inside the square will become [...] "bomb(s)" [...] which will explode on all eight directions (even diagonally) just after being formed. If there are no two adjacent same color <b>dots</b> to connect, the <b>dots</b> are scrambled so that the player can make a valid move, similar to other games.|$|R

At the time, forecasters at the JTWC anticipated that <b>Dot</b> would interact with an approaching weather front and track north of Hainan Island. The front failed to materialize, however, and the storm resumed a west-northwesterly track. Owing to low wind shear and warm waters, <b>Dot</b> attained typhoon status on June8. Following {{the development of an}} eye, the storm reached its peak intensity later that day as a Category3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 185km/h (115mph).
