5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, proportional to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. <b>Intercoolers</b> and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E
25|$|It must {{be noted}} that all of the above WWII {{aircraft}} engines had mechanically driven centrifugal superchargers as-designed from the start, and the turbosuperchargers (with <b>Intercoolers)</b> were added, effectively as twincharger systems, to achieve desired altitude performance.|$|E
25|$|Turbocharger units {{often make}} use of an {{intercooler}} (also known as a charge air cooler), to cool down the intake air. <b>Intercoolers</b> are often tested for leaks during routine servicing, particularly in trucks where a leaking intercooler {{can result in a}} 20% reduction in fuel economy.|$|E

25|$|Much {{like the}} Charomskiy ACh-30, the M-40 was a {{development}} of the experimental AN-1RTK turbo-supercharged diesel engine that had begun development in the early 1930s. It dropped its predecessor's supercharger, but added another two E-88 turbochargers and two <b>intercoolers.</b> It failed its State acceptance testing in May 1940, but production began regardless at the Kirov factory in Leningrad which built 58 engines {{in the first half}} of 1941. Production ceased in the Fall after a total of 120 engines were finished.|$|E
25|$|Having had {{previous}} {{success with}} turbocharging Fiat Spiders, DeLorean {{entered into a}} contract with Legend Industries, based in Hauppauge, New York. DMC wanted to increase power without sacrificing fuel economy. DMC wanted a wide power band {{and did not want}} a surge of power similar to the Porsche 930 Turbo. Legend used twin IHI RHB52 turbos along with twin <b>intercoolers.</b> The results were an engine capable of accelerating smoothly in fifth gear from 1,500rpm to full turbo boost at 2,500rpm reaching 150mph at 6,500rpm.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} sign {{means that}} work is done on the gas by the surroundings. Process irreversibilities (such as in heat transfer) will result in less energy being recovered from the expansion process than {{is required for the}} compression process. If the environment is at a constant temperature, for example, the thermal resistance in the <b>intercoolers</b> will mean that the compression occurs at a temperature somewhat higher than the ambient temperature, and the expansion will occur at a temperature somewhat lower than ambient temperature. So a perfect isothermal storage system is impossible to achieve.|$|E
25|$|An intercooler, was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (pre-ignition knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The intercooler, which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the <b>intercooler's</b> excess charge heat.|$|R
40|$|A {{thermoelectric}} gas-solid {{heat transfer}} numerical model was established between an air-cooling tube-fin <b>intercooler’s</b> intake and cooling air passage channel on vehicle turbocharged diesel engine. The outlet temperature of intake air, the output {{power of the}} thermoelectric components and the thermal conversion efficiency are considered as the research objectives. When load value is constant, the outlet temperature of intake air decreases {{with the number of}} thermocouples increases and there exist maximum values for output power and thermal conversion efficiency; when the number of thermocouples is constant, there is little effect on the outlet temperature of intake air with the load value increases. When the load was been optimal designed, set the load value throughout equals to the value of thermoelectric component total internal resistance, the values of the maximum output power was increased by 20. 3 % and the thermal conversion efficiency was increased from 1. 78 to 3. 48 %...|$|R
5000|$|An {{unavoidable}} side-effect {{of forced}} induction is that compressing air raises its temperature. As a result, the charge density is reduced and the cylinders receive less air than the system’s boost pressure prescribes. The risk of detonation, or [...] "knock", greatly increases. These drawbacks are countered by charge-air cooling, which passes the air leaving the turbocharger or supercharger through a heat exchanger typically called an intercooler. This {{is done by}} cooling the charge air with an ambient flow of either air (air-air intercooler) or liquid (liquid-to-air intercooler). The charge air density is increased and the temperature is reduced. In this way an intercooler can greatly increase the ability to run higher absolute compression ratios and {{take full advantage of}} using compressors in series. The only drawbacks of intercooling are the <b>intercooler's</b> size (typically close {{to the size of a}} radiator), and the associated plumbing and piping.|$|R
25|$|In an {{isothermal}} compression process, the {{gas in the}} system is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange {{can be achieved by}} heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the <b>intercoolers</b> must be optimised for high heat transfer and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate {{isothermal compression}} even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.|$|E
25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding <b>intercoolers,</b> you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|E
25|$|Ecutek tuning on {{the other}} hand was the first company to {{manipulate}} and change shift points on the GTR in the TCM (Transmission Control Module) on automatic mode. This can be done at will by the driver. Ecutek also allows the driver to adjust launch control on the fly available with a wrap around boost gauge that can read over 20 PSI. Like COBB Tuning, Ecutek currently offers engine tuning on the ECU and TCM with different launch control software from LC1 up to LC5. Ecutek's RACEROM offers in addition Valet Mode, Per-Cylinder Fueling, RaceRom Launch Control, Speed Density, Map Switching, Enhanced Targeted Boost Control, Upshift boostspike prevention, Per-gear boost control limit, per-gear rev limits, RACEROM Boost control, MAF Left-Right Swap for Custom <b>Intercoolers,</b> Large Fuel Injector Support and Visual Knock Warning.|$|E
5000|$|Production of the GT-Four (or {{previously}} {{known as}} All-Trac in the US), continued for the Japanese, Australian, European, and British markets. This ST205 version {{was to be}} the most powerful Celica produced to date, producing [...] (export version) or [...] (Japanese market) from an updated 3S-GTE engine. Influenced strongly by Toyota Team Europe, Toyota's factory team in the World Rally Championship, {{the final version of the}} GT-Four included improvements such as an all-aluminum hood to save weight, four-channel ABS (with G-force sensor), an improved turbocharger (incorrectly known by enthusiasts as the CT20B), and Super Strut Suspension. The 2500 homologation cars built to allow Toyota to enter the GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water spray bar for the <b>Intercooler's</b> front heat exchanger, a water injection system for detonation protection, a hood spoiler mounted in front of the windscreen to stop hood flex at high speed and the standard rear spoiler mounted on riser blocks. The car proved to be quite competitive in the 1995 World Championship. However, the team was banned from competition for a year after the car's single victory due to turbocharger fixing - a device that meant there was no air path restriction on the intake - when the jubilee clip was undone this would flick back into place so as to go un-noticed by inspectors. Toyota has always claimed that they knew nothing of the fix - but opponents say it was one very cleverly engineered device. In some respects this car is a true sports car; in order to qualify for rallying it has a lot of special features and a unique strut arrangement.|$|R
25|$|Production was reinitiated in the {{evacuated}} workshops of Factory No. 82 by Factory No. 500 in June 1942, thirty-two engines being completed {{during the}} year. Development of supercharged versions began {{about the same}} time, using geared, centrifugal type superchargers adapted from the Mikulin AM-38 and the Klimov M-105 engines with <b>intercoolers.</b> That from the AM-38 was more successful and was put into production as the M-30B. Thirty-five incomplete M-30 engines were modified beginning in August into M-30Bs and then thirty-four M-30Bs were produced {{during the rest of}} 1942. Oddly the ACh-30B, as the engine was now known, was not formally accepted for series production until 19 June 1943, but production had begun quite a bit earlier than that. Factory No. 45 began production {{in the fourth quarter of}} 1943. Some 1450 ACh-30Bs were built before production ended at both factories in September 1945.|$|E
25|$|P-38s {{were popular}} contenders {{in the air}} races from 1946 through 1949, with brightly colored Lightnings making {{screaming}} turns around the pylons at Reno and Cleveland. Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier {{was among those who}} bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an air racer and stunt flyer. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the Confederate Air Force, bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it White Lightnin; he reworked its turbo systems and <b>intercoolers</b> for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F style air intakes for better streamlining. White Lightnin was severely damaged in a crash landing during an air show demonstration and was bought, restored and repainted with a brilliant chrome finish by the company that owns Red Bull. The aircraft is now located in Austria.|$|E
500|$|The {{turbocharged}} engine required larger air intakes {{to feed the}} two <b>intercoolers.</b> Situated between the doors and the rear wheels, the air intakes were larger on the production version of the XJ220 than on the concept car. A number of small design changes for the body were tested in the wind tunnel; the final version had a drag coefficient of 0.36 with downforce of [...] at [...] The XJ220 {{was one of the}} first production cars to intentionally use underbody airflow and the venturi effect to generate downforce. Additionally, some XJ220's could be ordered with optional BBS style rims for improved brake ventilation and aesthetics.|$|E
500|$|Design work on {{the chassis}} was split between Italian {{specialist}} racing car manufacturers Abarth and Dallara, [...] the latter of which built the aluminium monocoque and the kevlar and carbon fibre bodywork in their factory. The LC2 featured a large intake for the radiators {{in the center of}} the nose of the car just as the LC1 had, unlike the contemporary Porsche 956s which drew all their air from behind and to the sides of the cockpit. [...] This air was also directed through the side bodywork to feed the <b>intercoolers</b> for the turbochargers. [...] Inlets for the rear brake cooling ducts were also integrated onto the side bodywork of the car, immediately behind the doors. [...] At the rear, a pontoon-style design was adapted to the fenders with the large wing bridging across the pontoons. [...] The rear diffusers exited between the pontoons and underneath the wing.|$|E
2500|$|The P-38F was {{followed}} in early 1943 by the P-38G, using more powerful Allisons of [...] each and {{equipped with a}} better radio. A dozen of the planned P-38G production were set aside to serve as prototypes for {{what would become the}} P-38J with further uprated Allison V-1710F-17 engines ( [...] each) in redesigned booms which featured chin-mounted <b>intercoolers</b> in place of the original system in {{the leading edge of the}} wings and more efficient radiators. [...] Lockheed subcontractors, however, were initially unable to supply both of Burbank's twin production lines with a sufficient quantity of new core <b>intercoolers</b> and radiators. [...] War Production Board planners were unwilling to sacrifice production, and one of the two remaining prototypes received the new engines but retained the old leading edge <b>intercoolers</b> and radiators.|$|E
2500|$|The SLR {{sports a}} [...] hand-built , supercharged, all-aluminium, SOHC, V8 engine. The {{cylinders}} are angled at 90degrees with three valves per cylinder and lubricated via a dry sump system. The compression ratio is 8.8:1 and the {{bore and stroke}} is [...] The Lysholm-type twin-screw supercharger rotates at 23,000rpm and produces 0.9bar (13psi) of boost. The compressed air is then cooled via two <b>intercoolers.</b> The engine generates a maximum power of [...] at 6,500rpm and maximum torque of [...] at 3,250 to 5,000rpm.|$|E
2500|$|Cirrus {{introduced}} the SR22 Turbo in 2006, with a Tornado Alley turbonormalizing upgrade kit that is factory installed under a Supplemental Type Certificate. It included twin turbonormalizers and twin <b>intercoolers.</b> The conversion includes built-in oxygen and a Hartzell three-blade lightweight composite propeller. The {{weight of the}} conversion reduces the SR22's useful load. Air conditioning is available with the SR22 Turbo, but this further reduces the useful load. The turbo version has a certified ceiling of , a maximum cruise speed of 211 knots (391km/h), and {{a top speed of}} [...]|$|E
2500|$|The engine {{has four}} valves per cylinder, with {{chain-driven}} double overhead camshafts, and {{variable valve timing}} for both inlet and exhaust camshafts. [...] Charged intake air is cooled by two side-mounted <b>intercoolers</b> (SMIC)s. The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic ME9.1.2 engine control units, which act as 'master' and 'slave': two ECUs are required due to the high revs the engine can achieve. [...] It also uses mapped direct ignition system with ten individual direct-acting spark coils, an electronic drive by wire throttle (Bosch [...] "E-Gas"), cylinder-selective knock control, and cylinder bank adaptive lambda control, utilising eight lambda sensors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} <b>intercoolers,</b> it is common practice to add extra fuel to the intake air (known as [...] "running an engine rich") {{for the sole purpose of}} cooling. The amount of extra fuel varies, but typically reduces the air-fuel ratio to between 11 and 13, instead of the stoichiometric 14.7 (in petrol engines). The extra fuel is not burned (as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction), instead it undergoes a phase change from atomized (liquid) to gas. This phase change absorbs heat, and the added mass of the extra fuel reduces the average thermal energy of the charge and exhaust gas. Even when a catalytic converter is used, the practice of running an engine rich increases exhaust emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Between April 2004 and September 2004, {{there was}} a final limited run of an even higher-performance RS6, named the Audi RS6 Plus. [...] This had an {{increased}} engine power output (identification code: BRV), and produced [...] at 6,000-6,400rpm, with the same [...] of torque at 1,950-6,000rpm. This engine was also developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). The additional performance was achieved with a new engine control unit (ECU), and two additional coolant radiators behind the side-mounted <b>intercoolers</b> (these were standard fitment on the standard RS6 in hotter climate countries). [...] Official performance figures indicate the discipline of sprinting from standstill to [...] in 4.4seconds. [...] The RS6 Plus carries on to reach [...] in 20.36seconds, and has an official top speed of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Evolution Series {{locomotives}} {{are visually}} {{similar to the}} AC4400CW, although small differences are evident. [...] The most noticeable difference is the radiator section {{at the rear of}} the locomotive is larger to accommodate the GEVO's Air to air <b>intercoolers.</b> As with the AC6000CW the radiators project beyond the end of the hood, though not to the same extent, as the Evolution Series protrudes only a few inches out. Also, unlike previous GE locomotives, the grilles under the radiator are at two different angles. The increase in radiator size is due to the necessity for greater cooling capacity in the locomotive in order to reduce emissions. [...] The other major difference between the Evolution Series and earlier models are the vents below the radiators, which are larger than those on previous GE locomotives. In addition, most, if not all, Evolution Series units have air conditioners mounted below the cab on the conductor's side.|$|E
2500|$|Visually, the RS 6 {{differed}} from the related S6, having flared front and rear wheel arches (fenders), harking {{back to the original}} Audi Quattro, to allow for a wider wheel track. It also had no front fog lights to allow for larger frontal air intakes (for the two side-mounted <b>intercoolers</b> (SMICs), and additional radiators). [...] The ten (per side) front light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lights (DRLs) are located within the main headlamp housing on the RS 6 in order to increase the size of the air intakes, whereas similar LEDs (but five per side) on the related S6 are found adjacent to the fog lamps in the lower front bumper. [...] LED lighting technology was also used in the rear lights. [...] The RS 6 also included adaptive headlights, which swivel around corners in conjunction with steering wheel movements. The facelifted Audi A6, released as a 2009 model, received similar front and rear-end LED lighting styling to that pioneered on the RS 6.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{member of}} the PA-31 family to enter {{production}} was the PA-31P-350 Mojave. Like the T1040 the Mojave was a hybrid, but whereas the T1040 was essentially a turboprop Chieftain the Mojave {{was more or less}} a piston-engined version of the Cheyenne. The Mojave combined the fuselage of the Cheyenne I with the tail of the Chieftain. The wings were similar to the Chieftain's, but with greater structural strength, a [...] increase in wingspan and greater fuel capacity of [...] The engines were slightly different variants of the Chieftain's TIO-540 and LTIO-540, being fitted with <b>intercoolers,</b> and like the Chieftain, had baggage lockers on the rear part of the nacelles. The Mojave's MTOW of [...] was [...] higher than the Chieftain's. Certified in 1983, like the T1020 and T1040 the Mojave was introduced at a time of economic recession and was produced only in 1983 and 1984; combined production of the T1020, T1040 and Mojave amounted to fewer than 100 aircraft. Two experimental PA-31-353s were also built in the mid-1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Diabatic storage dissipates much of {{the heat}} of {{compression}} with <b>intercoolers</b> (thus approaching isothermal compression) into the atmosphere as waste; essentially wasting, thereby, the renewable energy used to perform the work of compression. [...] Upon removal from storage, the temperature of this compressed air is the one indicator {{of the amount of}} stored energy that remains in this air. Consequently, if the air temperature is low for the energy recovery process, the air must be substantially re-heated prior to expansion in the turbine to power a generator. This reheating can be accomplished with a natural gas fired burner for utility grade storage or with a heated metal mass. As recovery is often most needed when renewable sources are quiescent, fuel must be burned {{to make up for the}} wasted heat. [...] This degrades the efficiency of the storage-recovery cycle; and while this approach is relatively simple, the burning of fuel adds to the cost of the recovered electrical energy and compromises the ecological benefits associated with most renewable energy sources. [...] Nevertheless, this is thus far the only system which has been implemented commercially.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine was}} {{developed}} from the 2.7litre 90° V6 'biturbo' used in the B5 S4. It displaced [...] and had five valves per cylinder. The parts code prefix was 078 and the identification codes were: early version, 2000 (EU2 compliant): ASJ, and later version, 2000-01 (to EU3 standard): AZR. [...] This engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain).

[...] The engine oil was cooled by a dual oil:water cooler and an oil:air cooler.|$|E
2500|$|Surprisingly, {{the last}} flying {{example of the}} entire P-61 line was a rare F-15A Reporter (RF-61C) (s/n 45-59300), the first {{production}} model Reporter to be built. The aircraft was completed on 15 May 1946, and served with the USAAF and later the U.S. Air Force until 6 February 1948, when it was reassigned to the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory at Moffett Field in California. There it was reconfigured {{to serve as a}} launch vehicle for air dropped scale models of experimental aircraft. It served in this capacity until 1953, when it was replaced by a mammoth wind tunnel used for the same testing. In April, 1955, the F-15 was declared surplus along with a [...] "spare parts" [...] F-61C (s/n 43-8357). The F-15 was sold, along with the parts P-61, to Steward-Davis Incorporated of Gardena, California, and given the civilian registration N5093V. Unable to sell the P-61C, Steward-Davis scrapped it in 1957. Steward-Davis made several modifications to the Reporter to make it suitable for aerial survey work, including switching to a canopy taken from a T-33, and to propellers taken from an older P-61. The plane was sold in September, 1956 to Compania Mexicana Aerofoto S. A. of Mexico City and assigned the Mexican registration XB-FUJ. In Mexico, the Reporter was used for aerial survey work, the very role for which it was originally designed. It was bought by Aero Enterprises Inc. of Willets, California and returned to the USA in January 1964 carrying the civilian registration number N9768Z. The fuselage tank and turbosupercharger <b>intercoolers</b> were removed; and the plane was fitted with a 1,600gal (6,056l) chemical tank for fire-fighting. It was purchased by Cal-Nat of Fresno, California at the end of 1964, which operated it as a firefighting aircraft for the next 3 years. In March 1968, the F-15 was purchased by TBM, Inc., an aerial firefighting company located in Tulare, California (the company's name representing the TBM Avenger, their primary equipment), who performed additional modifications on the aircraft to improve its performance, including experimenting with several types of propellers before deciding on Curtiss Electric type 34 propellers taken from a late model Lockheed Constellation.|$|E
