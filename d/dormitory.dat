5|$|The monks' <b>dormitory</b> {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the {{transept}} wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the <b>dormitory</b> was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the <b>dormitory</b> at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the <b>dormitory,</b> preumably located for security at night.|$|E

Smith had $250,000 earmarked for <b>dormitories.</b> Heard sold Smith {{on the idea that}} the president could have his <b>dormitories</b> simply by raising the stands {{on both sides of the}} stadium and extending them to each goal line. This not only enabled the <b>dormitories</b> to be built underneath the stands, but it also expanded the stadium by 10,000 seats from 12,000 to 22,000. The <b>dormitories</b> were inhabited until the 1980s and were used for offices and storage until some time in the 2010s.|$|R

Bill, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new <b>dormitory</b> building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new <b>dormitory.</b> Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.|$|E

During the Vietnam War, students protested US involvement, and Adkins and trustees resigned; James E. Stewart became president. In 1969, twelve students, led by student president Edie Cullen, stole the college mimeograph machines and gave nine demands to the college. The next day, around 50 students participated in a 48-hour sit-in at Dow Hall.

The college had 350 students in 1977, and students enjoyed half-empty <b>dormitory</b> buildings.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{heating period}} is very long in Harbin in China. This paper {{describes}} a field study in university classrooms and <b>dormitories</b> in heating period in Harbin. The survey {{shows that the}} neutral temperature in classrooms at 3 periods was 17. 7 ̊C, 19. 3 ̊C and 19. 4 ̊C, and in <b>dormitories</b> the neutral thermal temperatures were 20. 9 ̊C, 21. 8 ̊C and 21. 2 ̊C, respectively. The neutral temperatures were on the rising trend, which reflected human thermal adaptation to the heating environment. The different neutral temperatures in classrooms and <b>dormitories</b> were mainly caused by 2 aspects: Classrooms were warmer than <b>dormitories,</b> so more students could not accept classroom environment psychologically; Students have different regulative methods to the indoor environment. Clothing insulation in classrooms was bigger than in <b>dormitories.</b> Because of above reasons, students felt more comfortable in <b>dormitories</b> than in classrooms...|$|R
