At 10:30p.m., Bankhead gave the order for the red distress lantern to be hoisted atop the turret. The engines were slowed to preserve steam for the pumps. However, the reduced speed made the towline very taut, causing the Monitor to become unstable and almost impossible to control. Bankhead ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers to go out onto the deck to carry out the task. Stodder and two other volunteers came forward.

40|$|Ice {{accretion}} on {{offshore structures}} {{is a problem}} that must be considered by rig designers, rig operators, and regulatory agencies. For ground-based structures, the problem relates to increased cross-sectional area of the support members with a consequent increase in lateral forces generated by wave-structure interactions. For semi-submersible rigs, there is the added concern of increased dead weight due to accreted ice resulting in reduced <b>freeboard</b> or reduced <b>deck</b> load. A computer program called RIGICE was developed in the late 80 s to simulate ice accretion on offshore structures (Brown et al. 1988). Since then the code has undergone modifications to some of the algorithms, particularly those dealing with spray generation due to wave-structure impact. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{theory is}} presented for {{the accumulation of}} water on the deck of a damaged Ro-Ro passenger vessel. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between results obtained from extensive time domain simulations and corresponding results obtained from integrals in the probability domain. Comparison is also made to results obtained during free floating model tests in waves at National Research Council Canada, Institute for Marine Dynamics (IMD). The mathematical theory presented leads to a simple curvilinear relationship between the accumulated depth of water on <b>deck,</b> <b>freeboard,</b> and significant wave height. Also briefly addressed are out-flow processes through freeing ports. The water-on-deck analysis methods presented potentially have application in other maritime areas of inquiry such as oil outflow from damaged tankers and water-on-deck accumulation on production platforms.

2500|$|The {{class was}} much criticised, being {{popularly known as}} 'coffin brigs', {{following}} the loss by wrecking or foundering {{of a number of}} them. There seems to have been no particular fault in their design, but they were considered to be somewhat too small for the global duties that were assigned to them. Almost a quarter of them were lost, and they were also nicknamed [...] "Half Tide Rock" [...] as they had low <b>freeboard</b> so the <b>deck</b> was frequently awash with water, and solid [...] preventing the water from being shed quickly. [...] William James, in his Naval History written before May 1827, dismissed the supposed design faults, and said that it would be [...] "surprising indeed that the navy board would continue adding new individuals by dozens at a time" [...] to [...] "this worthless class". These open flush-decked ships lacked a forecastle to deflect heavy seas crashing over the bow: one was added to HMS Beagle in 1825 before its first voyage, together with a mizzen mast which improved the handling. Despite these modifications to the design, Captain Pringle Stokes protested that [...] "our decks were constantly flooded".|$|R
40|$|AbstractOffshore {{operational}} availability {{was investigated}} {{for the proposed}} handling system consisting of the carrier vessel equipped with dynamic positioning capability, on-board manual operation of picking-up the sea-surface float connected to the upstream end of the flexible riser pipe laid-dawn on sea floor. An offshore site was selected to collect the oceanographic off {{the southern part of}} Japan facing to the Pacific Ocean. The response amplitude operator of the proposed CO 2 carrier vessel was calculated based on 3 -D Singularity Distribution Method. Based on the result of the interview survey with captains of research vessels which showed that for offshore operations a vessel's pitch motion and service deck wetness are dominant factors which define a vessel's operational availability, the RAO of the pitch and relative wave elevation was evaluated. The hull motions and the relative wave elevation in unidirectional irregular waves and in multidirectional irregular waves were calculated by a conventional method based on the seakeeping theory using the RAOs, the wave spectrum and the directional wave spectrum. Under the assumption that the operational availability of the proposed CO 2 carrier vessel is constrained by the pitch motion and the service deck wetness, the allowable upper limit values of the significant wave height were calculated by a conventional method based on the sea keeping theorem using the 1 / 10 maximum expected response value of pitch motion and the relative wave elevation evaluated in the above-mentioned calculation. The threshold value of operation availability was set at the pitch of 3. 0 degrees and the relative wave elevation at the freeboard to the service deck, based on the result of the interview survey with captains of research vessels. Finally, the overall operational availability was estimated, {{on the assumption that the}} threshold value of operation availability was set at the pitch of 3. 0 degrees and the relative wave elevation at the freeboard to the service deck. We concluded that the operational availability of the proposed CO 2 carrier vessel reaches a target value of nearly 90 % for both full year and four seasons in the case that <b>freeboard</b> of service <b>deck</b> for offshore buoy picking-up operations set greater than 2. 3 m as a service platform...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. There {{is a good deal}} of uncertainty and sensitivity in the results for wave impact. In a practical situation, many parameters such as the wave climate will not be known with any accuracy especially the frequency and severity of wave breaking. Even if the wave spectrum is known, this is usually recorded offshore, requiring same sort of (linear) transfer function to estimate the wave climate at the seawall. What is more, the higher spectral moments will generally be unknown. Wave breaking, according to linear wave theory, is known to depend on the wave spectrum, see Srokosz (1986) and Greenhow (1989). Not only is the wave climate unknown, but the aeration of the water will also be subject to uncertainty. This affects rather dramatically the speed of sound in the water/bubble mixture and hence the value of the acoustic pressure that acts as a maximum cutoff for pressure calculated by any incompressible model. The results are also highly sensitive to the angle of alignment of the wave front and seawall. Here we consider the worst case scenario of perfect alignment. Given the above, it seems sensible to exploit the simple pressure impulse model used in this thesis. Thus Cooker (1990) proposed using the pressure impulse P(x, y) that is the time integral of the pressure over the duration of the impact. This results in a simplified, but much more stable, model of wave impact on the coastal structures, and forms the basis of this thesis, as follows: Chapter 1 is an overview about this topic, a brief summary of the work which will follow and a summary of the contribution of this thesis. Chapter 2 gives a literature review of wave impact, theoretically and experimentally. The topics covered include total impulse, moment impulse and overtopping. A summary of the present state of the theory and Cooker’s model is also presented in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, we extend the work of Greenhow (2006). He studied the berm and ditch problems, see Chapter 3, and the missing block problem in Chapter 4, and solved the problems by using a basis function method. I solve these problems in nondimensionlised variables by using a hybrid collocation method in Chapter 3 and by using the same method as Greenhow (2006) in Chapter 4. The works are extended by calculating the total impulse and moment impulse, and the maximum pressure arising from the wave impact for each problem. These quantities will be very helpful from a practical point of view for engineers and designers of seawalls. The mathematical equations governing the fluid motion and its boundary conditions are presented. The deck problem together with the mathematical formulation and boundary conditions for the problem is presented in Chapters 5 and 6 by using a hybrid collocation method. For this case, the basis function method fails due to hyperbolic terms in these formulations growing exponentially. The formulations also include a secular term, not present in Cooker’s formulation. For Chapter 5, the wave hits the wall in a horizontal direction and for Chapter 6, the wave hits beneath the deck in a vertical direction. These problems are important for offshore structures where providing adequate <b>freeboard</b> for <b>decks</b> contributes very significantly to the cost of the structure. Chapter 7 looks at what happens when we have a vertical baffle. The mathematical formulation and the boundary conditions for four cases of baffles which have different positions are presented in this chapter. We use a basis function method to solve the mathematical formulation, and total impulse and moment impulse are investigated for each problem. These problems are not, perhaps, very relevant to coastal structures. However, they are pertinent to wave impacts in sloshing tanks where baffles are used to detune the natural tank frequencies away from environmental driving frequencies (e. g ship roll due to wave action) and to damp the oscillations by shedding vortices. They also provide useful information for the design of oscillating water column wave energy devices. Finally, conclusions from the research and recommendations for future work are presented in Chapter 8.
