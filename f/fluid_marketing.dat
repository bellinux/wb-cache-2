The {{purpose of the}} paper is to underline the need for flexible usage-rights policies, as a core facilitator of such markets {{as well as to}} stress the need for a greater technical input to the debate. The paper builds on current work in the field of spectrum property rights and exclusive usage-rights. The first half of the paper captures the current state-of-play and presents a framework for visualizing the concepts involved. The paper goes on to make a clear distinction between the defining of a set of exclusive usage-rights and the exercising of those rights. This leads to a discussion of policies that are not alone about defining metrics and setting their desired values but are also about behaviors that involve negotiation and interaction. Through-out the paper the evolution of technology and its affect on the progress towards the goal of <b>fluid</b> spectrum <b>markets</b> is emphasized, as is the need for a very multifaceted approach to the challenges involved.

Market demand is modeled using flexible nested logit demand system and processor level cost is modeled using flexible generalized Leontief cost function. Our modeled is flexible enough to capture the nature of competition between brands within store and across stores. We find that the brands compete much more vigorously within store and than across stores. This structure of competition fits squarely with Slade's (1995) assumption on retail competition. We also explore strategic implications of the North East Dairy Compact on retailers and processors using emerging methodologies of antitrust simulation. The predictions from the antitrust simulation analysis {{are consistent with the}} concept of "focal point pricing" at the Compact implementation, suggesting an increase of market power in the <b>fluid</b> milk <b>marketing</b> channel.

By using structural demand and supply specification we estimate and test for the pass through rates {{at different stages of}} <b>fluid</b> milk <b>marketing</b> channels, and for firm specific as well as industry wide cost shocks. The former are useful for analyzing whether firm specific cost changes due to a merger or leveraged recapitalization are passed forward to consumers.

We model households as families and not as individual agents which provides a rationale for the existence of life insurance. Moreover, our structure also allows us to incorporate altruism towards dependents, providing for a unified picture of the various risks associated to the timing of death. The simultaneous existence of widespread life insurance and very limited annuities holdings is part of our quest. We want to know whether the lack of annuities {{is a product of the}} existence of social security or whether it is due to more fundamental problems (the moral hazard of house ownership, the adverse selection that it is way harder to detect in the case of long lived than in those that are likely to die soon). In our research we will explore various possible configurations of privately provided annuities (from inexistence to fully and cheaply provided to expensive and limited to financial and non housing levels), and how their existence is affected by Social Security, both in its basic form and in its Survivors Benefits program.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{issues related}} to a market channel. The first essay uses IRI coffee data to estimate six games that model retail-manufacturer interaction with a mixed Logit demand specification. The six games include a vertical integration model, a vertical Nash game, a manufacturer Stackelberg game, a generalized manufacturer Stackelberg game, a retailer Stackelberg game and a generalized retail Stackelberg. The best-fit generalized manufacturer Stackelberg game indicates that coffee manufacturers have significant channel power and price transmission is very poor in the US ground coffee market.

RAs are powerful procurement tools that leverage the power of <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> conditions through a dynamic pricing environment. This project examines the use of RAs within the Army Contracting Command (ACC) using E. Cory Yoder's Three Integrative Pillars for Success. Research questions focus on identifying best practices currently used within the contracting field.

Interview questions target three key focus areas: personnel, platforms, and protocols. If the ACC is to utilize RAs in {{the most effective and}} efficient manner, it is essential to select the appropriate RA type, field the best platform, and implement the correct protocols to maximize the use of RAs. These three factors together will yield maximum savings while generating new process improvements that will enable the ACC to become a more efficient and lean organization.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used measure of milk hygiene is Somatic Cell Count (SCC), where low SCC values {{indicate}} more wholesome milk. Dirt, often associated with grazing, carry bacteria and these bacteria can cause mastitis. Milk from cows with mastitis generally has higher SCC levels and cows with mastitis are most readily treated with antibiotics. Milk with high SCC is penalized by distributers as {{it is difficult to}} process and is not considered as wholesome in <b>fluid</b> <b>markets.</b> Grazing cows is common for many organic farmers. However, regulators prohibit antibiotic use under organic production. Intensive management protocols, maintaining equipment, and closely managing the herd’s environment offer substitutes for antibiotics use. Organic milk carries with it a substantial premium but may be at higher risk of discounts or penalties if the milk is more likely to have higher SCC levels. There are two forces at play concerning the quality of organic milk relative to conventional milk. For one, required and proscribed production practices create significant problems when managing milk quality. Secondly, a large premium exists to produce organic milk of high quality.

The study {{was carried out in}} Dar es Salaam; the most populated city in the country (about 4 million residents). Specifically, the study sought to (i) explore locally and imported milks brands in the market; (ii) to examine fluid milk intake level amongst consumers (iii) examine characteristic features of locally processed milk products present in the market (iv) assess consumer choice responses to characteristic features of fluid milk products. A survey of 384 consumers was conducted, complemented by interviews of key stakeholders; importers of milk product, processors and wholesalers of local brands. It was found that the Dar es Salaam <b>fluid</b> <b>market</b> is dominated by imported milk brands and products mainly from Kenya and South Africa. The dominant imported fluid milk was Ultra Heat Treated (UHT) with 6 to 12 months shelf-life. Local processors had limited access to UHT technology and thus produced short-lived milk which was dependent on refrigeration. A number of intrinsic and extrinsic consumption drivers which determined consumer responses were identified to include product form, price, packaging, taste/flavour and availability. Milk consumption was far lower than recommended by FAO/WHO mainly due to low level of consumer income and awareness/education. The study concludes that consumer responses to fluid milk products is determined driven mainly by intrinsic and extrinsic product characteristics and there is low consumption rate of milk in the market.

40|$|The {{recording}} industry and Hollywood in general {{have responded to}} declining music sales by attempting to expand excessively intellectual property protection, domestically through the proposed, yet indefinitely postponed, Stop Online Piracy Act and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act, and internationally through the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and the intellectual property provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Such legislation restricts free speech, reduces innovation, and weakens due process rights on the internet. This paper proposes an alternative revenue-generating strategy—bespoke musical recordings that would be privately auctioned rather than publicly released. For example, a recording of Anne-Sophie Mutter playing a piece she has never publicly performed would be sold to a music lover or an investment fund as a one-of-a-kind recording, as unique as an Artemisia Gentileschi painting or a Camille Claudel sculpture. Besides providing the {{recording industry}} with additional revenue, bespoke recordings would generate more income for musicians, augment funds for music outreach programs and other music nonprofits, and increase the chances of discovering new musical talent. Similarly to many new markets, it would take time for such recordings to generate substantial revenue.
