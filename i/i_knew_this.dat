Contrary to official Soviet statements at the time, he recalled telling ground controllers that there were [...] "blinking lights". He continued, saying that [...] "I saw two rows of windows and knew that this was a Boeing. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was a civilian plane. But for me this meant nothing. It is easy to turn a civilian type of plane into one for military use." [...] He furthermore did not provide {{a detailed description of the}} aircraft to the ground controllers: [...] "I did not tell the ground that it was a Boeing-type plane; they did not ask me." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 2007, Abrams {{accepted}} Paramount's {{offer to}} direct the film, after having initially been attached to it solely as a producer. He explained that he had decided {{to direct the}} film because, after reading the script, he realized that he [...] "would be so agonizingly envious of whoever stepped in and directed the movie." [...] Orci and Kurtzman said that their aim had been to impress a casual fan like Abrams with their story. Abrams noted that, during filming, he had been nervous [...] "with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet' [...] <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> would work, because the script Alex and Bob wrote was so emotional and so relatable. I didn't love Kirk and Spock when I began this journey – but I love them now." ...|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] was {{originally}} intended for inclusion on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud, the song's accompanying daytime video {{was used as}} part of Doritos Late Night Campaign. Jonas Åkerlund directed both daytime and nighttime versions for the song, which featured different colors and styles. The daytime video leaked onto the Internet on September 17, 2010, before it was given an official release. In a press statement given by Rihanna, the singer revealed how she was exited to work with Doritos on the project, saying: [...] "I'm really excited about 'Who's That Chick?' and {{wanted to find a}} fresh and unique way to share it with my fans... When I saw how cool the augmented reality performance Doritos created was, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was it. This was the way I wanted to make 'Who's That Chick?' available to the world, and I can't wait to see how my fans get engaged in this innovative experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|At age 12, Tallchief {{began to}} work with Bronislava Nijinska, a renowned {{choreographer}} who had recently opened her own studio in Los Angeles, and David Lichine, a choreographer and former dancer. Nijinska [...] "was a personification of what ballet was all about", Tallchief recalled. [...] "I looked at her, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was what I wanted to do." [...] Nijinska imparted {{a strong sense of}} discipline and the belief that being a ballerina was a full-time task. [...] "We didn't concentrate only {{for an hour and a}} half a day", Tallchief recalled. [...] "We lived it". It was under Nijinska that Tallchief decided ballet was what she wanted to devote her life to. [...] "Before Nijinska, I liked ballet but believed that I was destined to become a concert pianist", she recalled. [...] "Now my goal was different." [...] Nijinska saw Tallchief was serious and began devoting great attention to her.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Fowler said [...] "O Biclops, Where Art Thou?" [...] {{was another}} [...] "mostly flat" [...] episode and that {{while a few}} jokes connect, most are obvious and infantile. Fowler also said he was growing tired of Kröd's {{constant}} prudishness around sexual norm-breakers, and that the Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce characters are growing unnecessary because, [...] "not every joke needs to have {{each member of the}} gang chime in with a comment telling us what the joke is." [...] However, Fowler said he enjoyed the subplot with Dongalor and his unnamed girlfriend, and said Lucas and McQueen work very well together. Doug Knoop of The Seattle Times, however, singled this episode out as {{one of the main reasons}} he liked the series: [...] "It may not be to everyone's taste, but in last week's episode when (Krod) and his band of warriors ended up in a hot tub with a Cyclops, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> new outrageous parody series had found a place in my heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 2006–2009, Morpurgo, Lee Hall and Revel Guest {{worked on}} a {{proposed}} film version of War Horse, which Morpurgo and Hall would write and Guest produce. Lack of finances meant {{that it was an}} informal arrangement, with the film rights not formally sold by Morpurgo to Guest's production company and no one being paid for the work they undertook. In 2009, film producer Kathleen Kennedy saw the critically acclaimed production of War Horse in London's West End with her husband, fellow producer Frank Marshall and their two daughters. They were very impressed by the story and Marshall has recalled how he was amazed that no one had already bought the film rights to the book. Steven Spielberg was told about War Horse by several people, including Kennedy, who was his colleague at Amblin Entertainment. After discussions with Revel Guest, it was announced on 16 December 2009 that DreamWorks had acquired the film rights to the book, with Spielberg stating: [...] "From the moment I read Michael Morpurgo's novel War Horse, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was a film I wanted DreamWorks to make ...

The pair had then thrown her body into a location {{at or near the}} San Dimas Canyon. In {{reference to}} the murder of Andrea Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for [...] "over a day" [...] before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that [...] "I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> was coming, so I agreed." [...] Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.|$|E
