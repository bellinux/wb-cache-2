5|$|In 1902 {{the theatre}} closed {{for nine months}} to enable {{extensive}} building work {{to be carried out}} in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson.|$|E

50|$|Otto Strack {{employed}} many {{technological innovations}} when designing the theater, {{including one of}} the country's first <b>fire</b> <b>curtains,</b> all-electrical illumination, and a very early air conditioning system which employed fans and large amounts of ice. The theater also contained an electric organ, an innovation at that time. The theater is believed the first to employ a counterweight system for hoisting scenery, which was installed after World War I and remains in use today.|$|R

50|$|Here, Pedrick {{suggests}} that <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> could be secured at the roof {{level of a}} high-rise building. When released, they would envelope substantially the entire building. The curtains could be provided with apertures which when the curtain is released are located opposite rooms in the building, these rooms being designated as ones in which the occupants should congregate {{in the event of}} fire. The concern however was that such large curtains would have prevented escape from the building as well as increase the risk of suffocation.|$|R

2500|$|... {{non-flammable}} fire curtains; other {{openings in}} the proscenium wall required self-closing fire-resistant doors. Heat activated sprinkling systems were required for the fly space above the stage. At this time in New York City, uniformed fire department officers became permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These 'Theatre Detail Officers' were required {{to be in the}} theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect fire wall doors and the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{volume of}} fire was notable and of consequence. The Allied Supreme Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower later wrote, [...] "the final assault was {{materially}} assisted by heavy and accurate naval gunfire." [...] von Schlieben reported to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel that further resistance had been useless {{due in part}} to [...] "heavy fire from the sea", while Admiral Theodor Krancke recorded for his war diary, that one of the contributing causes to Cherbourg's fall was a [...] "naval bombardment of a hitherto unequalled fierceness." [...] German reports of the effect of naval bombardment were broadcast over the German telegraph service in the German Military Journal. According to these reports, the Allied naval <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> was one of their trump cards and in a crisis, it was more accurate and it could be sustained on target, fulfilling the role of a floating artillery arm. The reports also discuss the role of the smaller Allied vessels, remarking that they had firepower that should not be underestimated: [...] "a torpedo boat ... had the firepower of a howitzer battery, a destroyer that of a battery of artillery." [...] The reports go on to compare a cruiser to a regiment of artillery and state that battleships with 38 to 40-cm guns had no equal in land warfare, and could only be matched [...] "by an unusual concentration of very heavy batteries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, Joseph Henning's {{financial}} struggles {{caught up}} to him, and he handed over {{the management of the}} theatre to John T. Jackson in 1894, who married Joseph's daughter, Huldah Henning. Together they managed the theatre with Henning ultimately handing over ownership of the theatre to John and Huldah in 1904. They owned and operated the theatre until its sale to Dennis Vanes in 1920. In later years Huldah's younger sister Josephine Henning Beyer {{had this to say about}} the Jackson management: [...] "Under the superb management of John T. Jackson, Coldwater received the joy of witnessing the very best of dramas, operas, bands and orchestras, and various other amusements in a then modern theatre." [...] With knowledge and experience that previous managers lacked, Jackson, the [...] "first 'theatrical man' to manage the Tibbits", was able to make the opera house financially successful for the first time and at a time when other opera houses were on the wane. Not only was he more successful at booking groups for performance, but in the 1890s, he also made improvements to the theatre to give it every modern advantage. Jackson redesigned scenery mechanisms, moved girders to add wing space, made ticket sales more efficient, installed electric fans for the comfort of the audience, added a sprinkler system and steel <b>fire</b> <b>curtain,</b> and updated the available electric current. He may be responsible for the theatre's longevity, since many other theatres were destroyed by fire.|$|E
50|$|A {{permanently}} installed <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> line set, though not used for productions, {{is a typical}} element of a theatrical rigging system installation.

50|$|Probably {{because of}} his early Chicago based background, Guérin was a {{frequent}} collaborator with the Chicago architectural firm (and the successor firm to Daniel Burnham’s practice) Graham, Anderson, Probst & White.

50|$|During {{construction}} of the theatre, some acoustic tests were carried out with the <b>fire</b> <b>curtain</b> in place while technical work was carried out on stage, but great consideration was given to balance between pit and stage.

50|$|In {{the event}} of a fire, the use of smoke doors and <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> means that the stage area {{effectively}} functions as a chimney. The heated air rises and leaves through the smoke doors, and this puts the building into negative pressure, which in turn draws fresh air in through any open exit doors. Patrons waiting to exit will have fresh breathing air until the exit doors close. The exit doors which open out will be drawn closed tightly by this draft once they are no longer held open by evacuees. Once the doors are closed, the fire loses its oxygen source. If the doors are then opened again, a backdraft can occur.|$|R

5000|$|In 1995, Moore {{returned}} to his roots in documentary practice as the texture of New York’s 42nd Street was rapidly changing. With all of the theaters between 7th and 8th avenues scheduled to be razed or refurbished, Moore sought permission to photograph the torn seats and faded <b>fire</b> <b>curtains</b> which told the stories of those spaces. In 1997, Moore showed these photographs at Yancey Richardson Gallery in New York. Despite his change of style, the work was well received; in a review for The New Yorker, Andrew Long noted, “The straight forward treatment is a departure for the photographer, who characteristically produces multi-image evocations of New York City. Nothing is lost however— his earlier poetic constructs now give way to broader arenas for the imagination to roam.” ...|$|R
