25|$|The <b>desk</b> <b>pad</b> (Chinese T: 畫氈, S: 画毡, Pinyin: huàzhān; Japanese: 下敷 shitajiki) is a pad made of felt. Some {{are printed}} with grids on both sides, {{so that when}} it is placed under the {{translucent}} paper, {{it can be used}} as a guide to ensure correct placement and size of characters. However, these printed pads are used only by students. Both desk pads and the printed grids come in a variety of sizes.|$|E

50|$|The ink brush, ink, paper, and inkstone are {{essential}} implements of Chinese calligraphy. They are known together as the Four Treasures of the Study. In {{addition to these}} four tools, a water-dropper, <b>desk</b> <b>pads</b> and paperweights are also used by calligraphers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>desk</b> <b>pad</b> or blotter is a table {{protector}} {{used when}} work such as painting or writing would otherwise damage the table or desk. Different desk pads have specific uses, for example Chinese calligraphy uses a black velour <b>desk</b> <b>pad</b> since Chinese calligraphy is written using an ink brush. Westerners use simpler writing pads with disposable paper surfaces {{that can be}} used for writing, note taking, and scribbling. Often these pads are pre-printed with calendar pages.|$|E

50|$|The US {{government}} reestablishes the SAC airbase {{chain of}} command, {{but the general}} who launched the attack, the only man knowing the recall code, kills himself before capture and interrogation. His executive officer correctly deduces the recall code from among the general's <b>desk</b> <b>pad</b> doodles. The code is received by the surviving bomber airplanes, and they are successfully recalled, minutes before bombing their targets in the Soviet Union, save for the Alabama Angel, whose earlier-damaged radio prevents its recalling; it progresses to its target.|$|E

5000|$|Chinese {{calligraphy}} is the stylized, artistic {{writing of}} Chinese characters; the written form of Chinese that unites the languages spoken in China. Calligraphy is considered supreme among {{the visual arts}} in China and sets the standard for which Chinese painting is judged. Chinese calligraphy and painting are closely related. [...] Each era of Chinese calligraphy has different styles and forms. Chinese calligraphy originated in ancient China around 4000 BC and is still used today. In ancient China, characters were painted on stones, steles, or bones and the brushstrokes were later carved out. Later on, calligraphy was written on paper or scrolls. Cursive, handwritten, and computer-generated are a few different styles of Chinese calligraphy {{that could be used}} on scrolls or paper. Nowadays, Chinese calligraphy can be painted on scrolls and paper or typed and printed off of computers. Handwritten was most common because it could be used on anything and it could be put anywhere. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is made using brushes, ink, paper, paperweights, and <b>desk</b> <b>pads.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} feature of face-to-face communications is the prescnce of a shared space, which in general might be the direct environment and !. he present facilities {{in support of the}} communication, including <b>desks,</b> writing <b>pads</b> and chalk boards. We study the use of audio/video facilities, which attempt to enrich two-way telecommunications with a similar 'sharing' feature. Our initial exploratory research addresses the 'sharing' of object manipulation and gcsturing related to a spoken diaJogue, in a situation where subject pairs telecommunicate when performing a given task; the video images of the two spatially separated workspaces have been fused to make up one virtually-shared workspace at both sites, enabling gesturing in relation to all present objccts; actual manipulation is. of course, related to local objects only...|$|R
60|$|Where are all {{the people}} who on busy working-days pervade these scenes? The {{locomotive}} banker's clerk, who carries a black portfolio chained to him by a chain of steel, where is he? Does he go to bed with his chain on--to church with his chain on--or does he lay it by? And if he lays it by, what becomes of his portfolio when he is unchained for a holiday? The wastepaper baskets of these closed counting-houses would let me into many hints of business matters if I had the exploration of them; and what secrets of the heart should I discover on the 'pads' of the young clerks-- the sheets of cartridge-paper and blotting-paper interposed between their writing and their <b>desks!</b> <b>Pads</b> are taken into confidence on the tenderest occasions, and oftentimes when I have made a business visit, and have sent in my name from the outer office, have I had it forced on my discursive notice that the officiating young gentleman has over and over again inscribed AMELIA, in ink of various dates, on corners of his pad. Indeed, the pad may be regarded as the legitimate modern successor of the old forest-tree: whereon these young knights (having no attainable forest nearer than Epping) engrave the names of their mistresses. After all, it is a more satisfactory process than carving, and can be oftener repeated. So these courts in their Sunday rest are courts of Love Omnipotent (I rejoice to bethink myself), dry as they look. And here is Garraway's, bolted and shuttered hard and fast! It is possible to imagine the man who cuts the sandwiches, on his back in a hayfield; it is possible to imagine his desk, like the desk of a clerk at church, without him; but imagination is unable to pursue the men who wait at Garraway's all the week for the men who never come. When they are forcibly put out of Garraway's on Saturday night--which they must be, for they never would go out of their own accord--where do they vanish until Monday morning? On the first Sunday that I ever strayed here, I expected to find them hovering about these lanes, like restless ghosts, and trying to peep into Garraway's through chinks in the shutters, if not endeavouring to turn the lock of the door with false keys, picks, and screw- drivers. But the wonder is, that they go clean away! And now I think of it, the wonder is, that every working-day pervader of these scenes goes clean away. The man who sells the dogs' collars and the little toy coal-scuttles, feels under as great an obligation to go afar off, as Glyn and Co., or Smith, Payne, and Smith. There is an old monastery-crypt under Garraway's (I have been in it among the port wine), and perhaps Garraway's, taking pity on the mouldy men who wait in its public-room all their lives, gives them cool house-room down there over Sundays; but the catacombs of Paris would not be large enough to hold the rest of the missing. This characteristic of London City greatly helps its being the quaint place it is in the weekly pause of business, and greatly helps my Sunday sensation in it of being the Last Man. In my solitude, the ticket-porters being all gone with the rest, I venture to breathe to the quiet bricks and stones my confidential wonderment why a ticket-porter, who never does any work with his hands, is bound to wear a white apron, and why a great Ecclesiastical Dignitary, who never does any work with his hands either, is equally bound to wear a black one.|$|R
