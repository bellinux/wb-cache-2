40|$|There is {{a current}} {{need for the}} {{development}} of new computational tools to model the seakeeping performance of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> in support of the US Navy’s Landing Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and possibly {{the development of a new}} connector as part of the Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC) program. Much of the existing simulation capability for <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> was developed in the 1960 ’s, 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s to support the design of the LCAC and are coefficient-based models derived from small-scale experiments. The general utility of these simulations is limited in the design of new <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles,</b> especially for innovative concepts or new components for increased performance capability. Advances in computing power and algorithms for free surface flows have made possible the development of new simulation tools to quantitatively assess design modifications and complement model tests of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In this paper we describe the formulation, implementation and verification of a new computational model, called ACVSIM, to simulate the dynamics of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> operating in waves. The primary components of ACVSIM include a high-order Rankine panel method for the hydrodynamic solution, an immersed boundary model for the solution of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> dynamics, and a structural dynamics model of the bag-and-finger skirt system. Several semi-empirical models for other force components, such as the aerodynamic drag, are planned for a future release of the code...|$|R
40|$|The LACV- 30 - 07 <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> <b>Vehicle</b> was {{instrumented}} {{and tested}} at Fort Story, VA {{during the months}} of August-September 1993 by Ed. Thomas, NSWC- Cardrock Division, Annapolis Detachment, Annapolis, MD. The tests include 27 cuts with vehicle speed ranging from 0 to 42 knots and approximate wave height of 0 to 2. 5 feet. Two triaxial accelerometers, and a pitch and roll transducer were installed to measure axial, transverse and vertical accelerations and pitch and roll (in degree) of the vehicle. The test results clearly show that the vibration g-amplitude is extremely low (fraction of 1 -g level) for <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> and <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> itself is acting as a super-damper to reduce the wave-induced vibration response amplitude. The vibration amplitude in terms of g-level {{may not be the}} controlling factor, but the combined vehicle dominant frequencies, vibration g-level, and duration may be the definite factors that the superconductor magnet must persist. <b>Air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle,</b> Vibration criteria, Wave height, Vibration g-level pitch and rollNaval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division - Annapolis Detachment[URL]...|$|R

40|$|An <b>Air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> is {{a vehicle}} that flies like a plane but can float like a boat, can drive like a car but will {{traverse}} ditches and gullies {{as it is a}} flat terrain. An <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> also sometimes called an <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> because it can hover over or move across land or water surfaces while being held off from the surfaces by a <b>cushion</b> of <b>air.</b> A Hovercraft can travel over all types of surfaces including grass, mud, muskeg, sand, quicksand, water and ice. Hovercraft prefer gentle terrain although they are capable of climbing slopes up to 20 %, depending upon surface characteristics. Modern Hovercrafts are used for many applications where people and equipment need to travel at speed over water but be able load and unload on land. For example they are used as passenger or freight carriers, as recreational machines and even use as warships. Hovercrafts are very exciting to fly and feeling of effortlessly traveling from land to water and back again is uniqu...|$|R
