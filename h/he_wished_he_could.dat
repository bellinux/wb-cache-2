25|$|He {{first thought}} of {{studying}} medicine while at The Leys School, {{a boarding school}} in Cambridge, when he fractured his clavicle and recorded in his diary that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> treat himself. He began pre-clinical studies at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1914 but, {{with the onset of}} World War I, his studies were interrupted when he was made a medical trainee at the temporary hospital in Cambridge. In 1917, he joined the Royal Navy as a medical officer on the destroyer HMS Lucifer.|$|E
500|$|The BBC website {{called the}} episode [...] "One {{of the most}} memorable episodes, if not one of the greatest– the satire on youth {{counterculture}} is well handled, and Homer's flashback to his youth is fabulous." [...] and IGN said the episode {{was one of the best}} of season seven. In a list of the 25 greatest guest voices on the show, released September 5, 2006, IGN ranked the Hullabalooza performers 23rd. The noise rock version of the end credits performed by Sonic Youth has been ranked among the best versions of the theme by Matt Groening and also by Chris Turner in his book Planet Simpson. Bill Oakley has said that Peter Frampton is one of his favorite guest stars and <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have done a TV show with him.|$|E

5000|$|The poem {{describes}} a child's {{longing for the}} freedom he sees {{in the lives of}} those around him. When the gong sounds ten in the morning, he walks to his school and sees the hawker crying [...] "Bangles, crystal bangles!" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be a hawker. At four in the afternoon, while coming back from school, he sees the gardener digging the ground and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> were a gardener. When dusk falls his mother sends him to bed and he sees the watchman through the window and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be a watchman.|$|R
500|$|Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry {{opined that}} with [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] Archer [...] "gives FX {{something}} that the drama-heavy channel hasn't enjoyed for awhile — namely, a sharp comedic arrow in its quiver." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad applauded the character development in the [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] as it [...] "was fairly impressive." [...] Moreover, though, Toomey praised the dialogue, saying [...] "The {{back and forth between}} Archer and Figgis and Archer and Lana were laugh out loud funny," [...] and noted that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> incorporate the phrase [...] "baby town frolics" [...] from the episode into a conversation. Toomey did, however, say that he felt that the plotting was [...] "a bit of a stretch," [...] and noted that the realization that Krenshaw was actually a Russian spy named Kremenski was [...] "out of nowhere" [...] and [...] "a bit confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> [...] "get {{rid of them}} all". He had talked disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, {{who were trying to}} [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had taught him {{that he would not be}} able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} motif and [...] "casual {{approach}} to" [...] bisexual characters in his novels, continued in Imperial Bedrooms, Ellis stated he [...] "really [...] know", and that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> provide [...] "an answer – depicting [...] as extremely conscious of those choices". He believes {{it to be}} an [...] "interesting aspect of [...] work". Details notes how Ellis' own sexuality, frequently described as bisexual, has been notoriously hard to pin down. Reviewers have long tried to probe Ellis on autobiographical themes in his work. He reiterates to Vice that he is not Clay. Ellis says that other contemporary authors (naming Michael Chabon, Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Lethem as examples) don't get asked if their novels are autobiographical. (However, Ellis tells one interview, that he [...] "cannot fully" [...] say that [...] "I'm not Clay" [...] because of their emotional [...] "connections".) Vice attributes this streak to Ellis' age when Less Than Zero came out, which led to him being seen as a voice-of-the-generation. Ellis feels that the autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes, which to him are like emotional [...] "exorcisms". Crace's abovementioned parody suggests that Less Than Zero Clay was originally a flattering portrayal of Ellis. Ellis discusses lightly the kinds of self-insertion present in the book. While Clay is clearly (parodically) working on the film adaptation of The Informers, he {{is at the same time}} fully aware that he has been a character in Less Than Zero, and that ostensibly, Ellis is 'the author' whom Clay knew. However, there are clear differences to the characters, as well. For example, Ellis had to omit lines from the book he felt Clay would never have thought of, on subjects he would never have noticed. Ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle-age very well; Clay, however, isn't.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2006, Michael {{was arrested}} for {{possession}} of Class C drugs, an incident that he described as [...] "my own stupid fault, as usual".

In 2007, he pleaded guilty to drug–impaired driving after obstructing the road at traffic lights in Cricklewood in northwest London, and was subsequently banned from driving for two years and sentenced to community service.

2500|$|Brennan's {{short stories}} {{are written in}} a simple, direct, and elegant style. She writes {{with a minimum of}} {{characters}} and plot. Some of her stories are quietly tender and poignant while others are satirical. The characters are emotionally unreachable and often lead stagnant lives where everything remains much the same. She often repeats characters from story to story, for example, Hubert and Rose Derdon, whose marriage is examined over stories set years apart. In the final Derdon story, The Drowned Man, Rose has died and Hubert has to pretend that he is overwhelmed with grief for his dead wife, [...] "...she was gone, she had been good, and <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> miss her." ...|$|E

2500|$|On gender roles, he is a complementarian, that is, men {{and women}} have equal worth, but {{different}} roles within the family and the church. He endorses male headship of the home and church. According to a Mother Jones profile on Driscoll in 1998, he may have held egalitarian views at one time. He offered church courses in [...] "evangelical feminism" [...] and is quoted as saying [...] "the Bible is clear that {{men and women}} are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way." [...] In 2003, Driscoll said that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> change the parts of the Bible that he believes restrict women from being pastors.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, Weiss {{created the}} title MaHaRaT for Sara Hurwitz. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have {{called her a}} rabbi, stating [...] "She can do 95 percent of what other rabbis do". She was later titled [...] "Rabba", a {{feminine}} version of the word [...] "rabbi", despite female rabbis in other movements being called [...] "rabbi". This led to complaints from the RCA, which led to Weiss stating he would not name future graduates as [...] "rabba". Weiss subsequently resigned from the RCA. However, in 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat, which Weiss founded. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi.|$|E
