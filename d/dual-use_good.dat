40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{delineate}} some preliminary factors and working methods that {{could work in}} favour of establishing a workable international export control regime for <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> and technologies. Drawing on the work initiated by various United Nations initiatives and the Wassenaar Agreement, but specifically looking at the European Union export regime model, this working paper asks if and how a similar model could be adopted at the international level. Far from suggesting that the EU regime should of could be adopted on a global basis or that the regime is full-proof, the authors acknowledge that EU regulations are seen as among the most stringent of frameworks on <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> and technologies available. Accordingly, this paper asks what elements of the EU’s control regime could be of international benefit after the ATT negotiations and {{how it could be}} adopted on a more international basis. Indeed, any future ATT control mechanism for dual-use items will have to draw on existing arms transfers and control regimes. It does this through an analysis of the ATT and the current discourse on <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> and technologies in the negotiations, an stocktaking of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the EU’s export control regime and by asking what elements of the EU’s regime could be utilised for international control mechanisms after a future ATT is negotiated...|$|R

5000|$|Before 1998, the Russian Federation did {{not have}} a {{comprehensive}} export control law, inheritance from the Soviet Union, in which legal basis for many things was unclear or secret. The legal basis for export control procedures rested on several presidential decrees, government resolutions and a federal law on state regulation of foreign economic activity (1995). From 1992 to 1997 Russia developed control lists for missile, biological, chemical, nuclear and dual-use related items and issued regulations governing the export of these items. At the time, Russian exporters of controlled items were required to obtain two licenses, one from the Federal Service for Currency and Export Control (VEK, under the authority of the Ministry of Defence), and another from the Ministry of Trade. Since 3 July 1998 (the date on which the State Duma adopted a comprehensive federal law on ‘Military-Technical Cooperation of the Russian Federation with Foreign States’), the only body competent to delivera license has operated under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. With regard <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> and services, the Russian government issued a [...] "catch all" [...] export control regulation in a resolution signed on 22 January 1998.

The law provides, that export control lists should be drawn up by the President, in consultation with the Parliament and industry representatives. This represents a significant change from previous regulations, which gave the executivebranch sole discretion over the contents of the lists. In this respect, the law provides a new foundation for export control policy, empowering other actors than those from simply the executive branch.|$|R

In 2008 Israel started enforcing severe restrictions on the import of selected <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> and materials, de facto banning a number of production inputs from entering the West Bank. We show that after 2008 (i) output and wages decrease in those manufacturing sectors that use those materials more intensively as production inputs, (ii) wages decrease in those localities where employment is more concentrated in these sectors, and (iii) episodes of political violence {{are more likely to}} occur in these localities.

More specifically, the EU also promotes policy convergence on the basis of international and bilaterally developed rules. These analytical claims for explaining rule selection are checked against empirical data. We compare policy convergence between the EU and four neighbouring countries (Morocco, Ukraine, Georgia, and Russia) in three subfields within foreign and security policy: foreign policy dialogue, control of export of <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> in the context of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and crisis management.

40|$|<b>Dual-use</b> {{items are}} <b>goods</b> and {{technologies}} with civil and military uses. In several countries, including the EU Member States, {{the export of}} <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> is controlled by national licensing processes {{as a measure of}} non-proliferation. Dual-use items relate to a variety of generally high-tech goods falling in diverse categories: nuclear materials, facilities and equipment; special materials and related equipment; materials processing; electronics; computers; telecommunications and information security; sensors and lasers; navigation and avionics; marine; aerospace and propulsion. In connection to the ongoing review of the EU export control policy, currently based on Regulation 428 / 2009 and amendments, it is of relevance to know the size of the EU dual-use sector and have a method to assess, in a quantitative way, the impact of export controls on trade. Because the dual-use trade draws from a range of industrial sectors, no single trade statistics exists today to portrait this cross-cutting sector ‘as a whole’. In this report we estimate the total intra- and extra-EU Dual-Use Export Value (DUEV). DUEV is meant to be an indicator of the relevance of the dual-use sector to the EU economy. To estimate DUEV, lower and upper bound values are first derived based on license data provided by EU Member States and on COMEXT export data available from Eurostat. The bounds are then combined in a single estimate to DUEV. As a result, DUEV is estimated to be at most 3. 3 % of the total intra- and extra-EU export in 2013, equivalent to about 150 Billion of Euros. The report explains the method used to derive these figures by qualitative reasoning on quantitative data. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R

Lightning-fast technological progress and the ubiquity of the Internet have made it easy for our imaginations, as well as our political leaders, to conjure up realistic images of cyber nightmares come true.

My analysis of the December 2013 amendment—which was passed to prevent certain dual-use cyber technologies from falling into the wrong hands—proceeds in three parts. First, I argue that history teaches that cyber products are not generally amendable to export controls. Second, I find that the Wassenaar Arrangement’s institutional flaws are so enfeebling that the Arrangement’s very utility is questionable. Third, I assert that economic incentives, globalization, and the intangibility of cyber technology all present formidable obstacles to the December 2013 amendment’s success. Although the December 2013 amendment is likely doomed to irrelevance, I conclude that concerted action—rather than passive pessimism—must be our response to cyber threats...|$|R
40|$|The Free Open Source Software (FOSS) seem {{far from}} the {{military}} field but in some cases, some technologies normally used for civilian purposes may have military applications. These products and technologies are called dual-use. Can we manage to combine FOSS and dual-use products? On one hand, we {{have to admit that}} this kind of association exists - dual-use software can be FOSS and many examples demonstrate this duality - but on the other hand, dual-use software available under free licenses lead us to ask many questions. For example, the dual-use export control laws aimed at stemming the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction. Dual-use export in United States (ITAR) and Europe (regulation 428 / 2009) implies as a consequence the prohibition or regulation of software exportation, involving the closing of source code. Therefore, the issues of exported softwares released under free licenses arises. If software are <b>dual-use</b> <b>goods</b> and serve for military purposes, they may represent a danger. By the rights granted to licenses to run, study, redistribute and distribute modified versions of the software, anyone can access the free dual-use software. So, the licenses themselves are not at the origin of the risk, it is actually linked to the facilitated access to source codes. Seen from this point of view, it goes against the dual-use regulation which allows states to control these technologies exportation. For this analysis, we will discuss about various legal questions and draft answers from either licenses or public policies in this respect...|$|R
