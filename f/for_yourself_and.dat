It's a surprisingly filmic effort, with a sepia mid-century creepiness that calls to mind [...] "Mad Men" [...] plus [...] "Justified," [...] with a little [...] "Walking Dead" [...] thrown in for good measure." [...] The Smoking Section commented, [...] "he premise might sound out there, until you watch <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> your assumptions become trumped by the visually and mentally stimulating succession of supernatural events." [...] Prefix Magazine gave the video a positive review, writing [...] "the vid sets Ocean's doe-eyed crooning against something of an inter-dimensional love story, that or a dreamcatcher-inspired fever dream. Either way, pioneer triage and white-eyed shaman were not what we we're expecting, but we couldn't be more pleasantly surprised." ...|$|E
500|$|Many albums feature {{one or more}} {{songs in}} which the band lampoons itself, notably in the lyrics to [...] "Sucks" [...] and [...] "Inane". The band's [...] "cynical detachment" [...] has been {{compared}} to Steely Dan. Lyrics often express political concerns and call for the rejection of and resistance to terrorism, violence, oppression, censorship, and war. In the 1995 song [...] "Terror", Konietzko specifically warns, [...] "Fundamentalist forces are undermining the integrity of liberal and democratic political structures". Samples of news broadcasts and speeches by political leaders are sometimes featured in songs. Konietzko has said that while the 2003 album WWIII is critical of then-president George W. Bush, who was sampled extensively for the album, [...] "It's not an anti-Bush record per se, it's an anti-stupidity record", and, [...] "If we had a message, it would be: Think <b>for</b> <b>Yourself</b> <b>and</b> Don't Believe the Bullshit." ...|$|E
500|$|Hearing of its release, {{neighbors of}} Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book {{would be an}} exposé of the people there. [...] Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing. [...] Clifton Fadiman wrote a one-sentence review in The New Yorker, which Geisel could still quote {{near the end of}} his life: [...] "They say it's for children, but better get a copy <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' {{impossible}} pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2009, Milian {{began working}} with The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, and L.O.S. Da Maestro, which led to her signing a deal with Radio Killa Records. Milian {{revealed}} that aside from [...] "Us Against the World", The-Dream and Tricky Stewart would be producing all the songs on her album. In March 2009, Milian changed the album's title to Elope. Regarding the album's title change, Milian explained, [...] "the definition of elope is to run away secretly with one's beloved. This next album is about taking responsibility <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> making your own decisions." [...] In June 2009, The-Dream said that the album was finished. Upon completion of the album, Milian said it represented [...] "independence, not having to answer to any type of 'authority', being a woman at her best and feeling very confident". She said that fans could expect an [...] "edgy sound with lots of strong powerful anthems. Big up tempos, R and Pop at [...] best and two big ballads".|$|E
500|$|... "Better Off This Way" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} written for the album, and re-written [...] "at least 3 {{different}} times". The song was the final one finished for the album. The title for [...] "All Signs Point to Lauderdale" [...] came from an occasion when McKinnon and bassist Joshua Woodard were in a rough neighborhood in West Palm Beach, Florida. A piece of the song came from a recording session for Homesick when Gilbert said he had an idea for the melody, which McKinnon took a while to write over: [...] "Chad had a cool idea, vocally, for something". In an interview with PopCrush in 2011, McKinnon said the song was when you get the [...] "feeling like you're stuck in a place that's leading you nowhere" [...] and [...] "standing up <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> taking charge of your life." [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] was written with the band's former guitarist, Tom Denney; the song was made up of several separate pieces from different song ideas, with a chorus McKinnon had re-written 4 times.|$|E
500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E

A plaque on her house in Wrzeszcz, a borough of Gdańsk, has recently been dedicated and the city of Gdynia named an intersection after her. Michael Szporer, Professor of Communications at University of Maryland wrote about her: [...] "Her life was very much like Poland's, never nothing, but if you are not afraid to speak up <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> care for others, just look what you can become, Pani Ania, a worthier role model than most, because an honest one.
