An increase in intracellular free [Ca 2 +] induces both dephosphorylation of calpastatin, through the action of a phosphoprotein phosphatase, and its redistribution as a soluble inhibitor species. cAMP, but not PMA-induced phosphorylation, reverses calpastatin distribution favouring its aggregation.

40|$|International audienceDermaseptin S 9 (Drs S 9) is an {{atypical}} cationic antimicrobial peptide {{with a long}} hydrophobic {{core and}} with a propensity to form amyloid-like fibrils. Here we investigated its membrane interaction {{using a variety of}} biophysical techniques. Rather surprisingly, we found that Drs S 9 induces efficient permeabilisation in zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles, but not in anionic phosphatidylglycerol (PG) vesicles. We also found that the peptide inserts more efficiently in PC than in PG monolayers. Therefore, electrostatic interactions between the cationic Drs S 9 and anionic membranes cannot explain the selectivity of the peptide towards bacterial membranes. CD spectroscopy, electron microscopy and ThT fluorescence experiments showed that the peptide adopts slightly more β-sheet and has a higher tendency to form amyloid-like fibrils in the presence of PC membranes as compared to PG membranes. Thus, induction of leakage may be related to peptide aggregation. The use of a pre-incorporation protocol to reduce peptide/peptide interactions characteristic of aggregates in solution resulted in more α-helix formation and a more pronounced effect on the cooperativity of the gel-fluid lipid phase transition in all lipid systems tested. Calorimetric data together with (2) H- and (31) P-NMR experiments indicated that the peptide has {{a significant impact on the}} dynamic organization of lipid bilayers, albeit slightly less for zwitterionic than for anionic membranes. Taken together, our data suggest that in particular in membranes of zwitterionic lipids the peptide binds <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> resulting in membrane leakage.

40|$|AbstractSurfactant {{proteins}} A and D (SP-A and SP-D) are lung collectins {{composed of}} two regions, a globular head domain that binds PAMPs and a collagenous tail domain that initiates phagocytosis. We provide evidence that SP-A and SP-D act in a dual manner, to enhance or suppress inflammatory mediator production depending on binding orientation. SP-A and SP-D bind SIRPα through their globular heads to initiate a signaling pathway that blocks proinflammatory mediator production. In contrast, their collagenous tails stimulate proinflammatory mediator production through binding to calreticulin/CD 91. Together a model is implied in which SP-A and SP-D help maintain a non/anti-inflammatory lung environment by stimulating SIRPα on resident cells through their globular heads.

Here we identify a hydrophobic amino acid tetrad (ILLV) close to the C terminus of the secretory Na+-K+- 2 Cl- cotransporter (NKCC 1) that is important for the proper intracellular processing of this protein. This tetrad appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> C-terminal sequence pattern that is conserved across species <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of members of the NKCC 1 gene family (slc 12) of electroneutral salt transporters. We studied the effects of various mutations of these amino acids on NKCC 1 transiently transfected into HEK- 293 cells. Our results show that mutation of two of these residues to alanine leads to a > 50 % reduction in expression and complex glycosylation levels and that multiple mutations to alanine have cumulative effects. By contrast, scrambling of these amino acids, or mutation of other nearby conserved C-terminal residues, has little effect on these parameters. Mutation of ILLV to AAAA reduces complex glycosylation of NKCC 1 by ∼ 90 % and results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> protein that does not form stable dimers and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum <b>in</b> <b>a</b> highly <b>aggregated</b> <b>state.</b> Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mutation of the hydrophobic tetrad ILLV to AAAA leads to the ab initio misfolding and concomitant aggregation of this NKCC 1 mutant, resulting in its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the potential of}} asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation coupled with online multi-angle light scattering, differential refractive index and UV detection for the fractionation and analysis of macromolecules in beer regarding their composition, molar mass (M) and relative concentration. The macromolecules in the liquid and foam of two types of beer, light lager and porter, were analysed in their native state with minimal sample preparation. The results showed the presence of three major populations of macromolecules. In lager beer liquid, the early eluting population has an average M of 2 x 10 (4) g/mol and an intense UV absorbance at 280 nm suggesting the presence of proteinaceous macromolecules. The second and the third populations, which elute at consecutively longer retention times, have M ranging from 10 (5) to 10 (7) g/mol. They are not UV-active at 280 nm, suggesting the elution of polysaccharides. The second population was identified as -glucans {{as a result of}} -glucanase treatment. The third population was not identified in the present study. The results show that similar populations are present in lager beer foam and that the macromolecules appear to be present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more <b>aggregated</b> <b>state.</b> The M range of macromolecules in porter beer liquid ranged from 10 (5) to 10 (8) g/mol.

We propose to call such stones ABC diamonds for short. These diamonds are characterized by a color, luminescence, and anomalous double refraction distribution which results from mixed growth: a center core formed by cuboid growth, rich in nitrogen, covered by an outer rim of “normal” octahedral growth, with much less nitrogen. Nitrogen in the core is present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> than <b>in</b> the rim, which is practically pure type Ib.

The 905 nm absorption can possibly be attributed to a hydrogen-related center.

In this thesis, we investigate aggregation in conjugated polymers {{and how it}} affects the optical properties of these organic materials. We discuss how aggregation enhances exciton transport properties in fluorescent polymers, thereby increasing the probability of excitons reaching low-energy sites in the polymer. A consequence of this aggregation-enhanced exciton migration is that low-energy defect sites in a conjugated polymer can dramatically alter the polymer's fluorescence properties when it is <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> <b>state.</b> In a poly(pphenylene ethynylene) (PPE) that was previously proposed to form green-emitting excimers, we found that a small concentration of anthryl defects in the polymer emitted green fluorescence that was only noticeable when the polymer was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> (otherwise the polymer was fluorescent blue). After elucidating {{the origin of the}} green fluorescence, we purposely added more emissive anthryl units into the polymer to enhance the blue-to-green fluorescence color change that accompanied polymer aggregation. (cont.) Using this anthryl-doped conjugated polymer, we developed aggregationbased chemical sensors that exhibited a visually noticeable fluorescence color change upon addition of poor solvents or biologically relevant, nonquenching, multicationic analytes (e. g., polyamines, neomycin) to the polymer solution. We also studied the effects of aggregation on the optical properties of a chiral poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivative in solutions and in films. We found that the organizations and functional properties existing in aggregated polymer solutions can be transferred to the film state by controlling the processing conditions. Using the same polymer, we were able to obtain films with different architectures and luminescence properties simply by adjusting the spin-casting solvent and film annealing conditions. Controlling the organizations and functional properties of conjugated polymer films is important in the fabrication of conjugated polymer-based optoelectronic devices. by Andrew Satrijo. Thesis (Ph.

Several putative members of this family were selected as potential targets for research {{with the intent of}} removing difficult targets as problems arose. Of particular interest was the smallest target, MmCDF 3, from Maricaulis maris, due to having no apparent C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, yet seemingly maintaining the tetrahedral zinc-coordinating active site and six transmembrane helices found in all known CDFs. This study focused on the expression, purification, characterisation and crystallisation of members of the CDF family, specifically targets from M. maris. High level expression (6 - 7 mg/L) and purity has been obtained for the MmCDF 1 and MmCDF 3 proteins, although both could only be obtained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavily <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> when purified in DDM. Acquiring CDF proteins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-aggregated stable form was necessary for repeatable crystallisation experiments and was accomplished by means of <b>a</b> detergent exchange <b>in</b> the presence of high salt concentrations.

Transmission electron microscopy of exposed regions of the cell cortex revealed networks containing arrays of filamentous structures. Networks were present in sheared spermatocytes at all stages of meiosis. The networks of dividing spermatocytes (meta- through telophase) were denser and appeared to contain more aggregated material then networks of prophase cells. The appearance of networks in spermatocytes resembled actin-containing networks of sheared and detergentextracted human erythrocytes. Networks treated with myosin subfragment 1 under conditions in which muscle F-actin was clearly decorated were not distinguishable from those of untreated cells. Exposure to deoxyribonuclease-I caused the disruption of networks in sheared spermatocytes {{as well as in}} erythrocytes.

Owing to very high van der Waals force of attraction, these nanoparticles exist <b>in</b> <b>a</b> highly <b>aggregated</b> <b>state.</b> It is often required to break these aggregates to truly experience the ?nanosize? effect for any required end use. There are several strategies proposed for dispersing/exfoliating nanoparticles but limited progress has been made towards controlling their dispersion state. The ability to tailor nanoparticle dispersion state in liquid and solid media can ultimately provide a powerful method for tailoring the properties of solution processed nanoparticle-filled polymer composites. This dissertation reports the use of a variety of stimuli-responsive polymers to control the dispersion state of single-walled carbon nanotubes. Stimuli-responsive polymers exhibit conformational transitions as a function of applied stimulus (like pH, temp, chemical etc.). These variations in conformations of the polymer can be used tailor nanotube dispersion state in water and solid composites. The use of pH and temperature responsive polymers to stabilize/disperse single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in water is presented. Non-covalent functionalization of SWNTs using pH and temperature responsive polymer show tailored dispersion state as a function of pH and temperature, respectively. Carbon nanotube microstructure in these aqueous suspensions was characterized using several techniques (cryo-TEM, viscosity measurements, uv-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements and settling behavior). Furthermore, nanotube dispersion state in aqueous suspensions is preserved to <b>a</b> large extent <b>in</b> the composites formed by drying these suspensions as evidenced by SEM images and electrical conductivity measurements.

We evaluated the effect of Tau phosphorylation on both tubulin assembly and MT binding. We show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 /cyclin A 3 kinase complex can generate the AT 8 and AT 180 AD-specific phospho-epitopes and use NMR spectroscopy to validate qualitatively and quantitatively the phosphocontent of our samples. The simultaneous presence of both epitopes disables the tubulin assembly capacity of Tau in conditions whereby Tau is the driving force for the assembly process but does not, however, inhibit MT assembly when the latter is driven by an increased tubulin concentration. When compared to the isolated MT binding repeats (Kd= 0. 3 microM), the phospho-Tau retains a substantial affinity for preformed MTs (Kd= 11 nM), suggesting that the phosphorylated proline-rich region still participates in the binding event. Our results hence indicate that the sole phosphorylation at the AT 8 /AT 180 epitopes, although leading to a functional defect for Tau, is not sufficient for its dissociation from the MT surface and subsequent aggregation as observed in AD. -Amniai, L., Barbier, P., Sillen, A., Wieruszeski, J. -M., Peyrot, V., Lippens, G., Landrieu, I.

40|$|The {{human eye}} lens is {{composed}} of fiber cells packed with crystallins up to 450 mg/ml. Human γD-crystallin (HγD-Crys) is a monomeric, two-domain protein of the lens central nucleus. Both domains of this long lived protein have double Greek key β-sheet folds with well packed hydrophobic cores. Three mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions in the γ-crystallin buried cores (two in the N-terminal domain (N-td) {{and one in the}} C-terminal domain (C-td)) cause early onset cataract <b>in</b> mice, presumably <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> of the mutant crystallins. It has not been possible to identify the aggregating precursor within lens tissues. To compare in vivo cataract-forming phenotypes with in vitro unfolding and aggregation of γ-crystallins, mouse mutant substitutions were introduced into HγD-Crys. The mutant proteins L 5 S, V 75 D, and I 90 F were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. WT HγD-Crys unfolds <b>in</b> vitro through <b>a</b> three-state pathway, exhibiting an intermediate with the N-td unfolded and the C-td native-like. L 5 S and V 75 D in the N-td also displayed three-state unfolding transitions, with the first transition, unfolding of the N-td, shifted to significantly lower denaturant concentrations. I 90 F destabilized the C-td, shifting the overall unfolding transition to lower denaturant concentrations. During thermal denaturation, the mutant proteins exhibited lowered thermal stability compared with WT. Kinetic unfolding experiments showed that the N-tds of L 5 S and V 75 D unfolded faster than WT. I 90 F was globally destabilized and unfolded more rapidly. These results support models of cataract formation in which generation of partially unfolded species are precursors to the <b>aggregated</b> cataractous <b>states</b> responsible for light scattering...|$|R
40|$|Regulated {{secretory}} proteins {{are thought}} to be sorted in the trans- Golgi network (TGN) via selective aggregation. The factors responsible for this aggregation are unknown. We show here that two widespread regulated secretory proteins, chromogranin B and secretogranin II (granins), remain <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> when TGN vesicles from neuroendocrine cells (PC 12) are permeabilized at pH 6. 4 in 1 - 10 mM calcium, conditions believed to exist in this compartment. Permeabilization of immature secretory granules under these conditions allowed the recovery of electron dense cores. The granin aggregates in the TGN largely excluded glycosaminoglycan chains which served as constitutively secreted bulk flow markers. The low pH, high calcium milieu was sufficient to induce granin aggregation in the RER. In the TGN of pituitary GH 4 C 1 cells, the proportion of granins conserved as aggregates was higher upon hormonal treatment known to increase secretory granule formation. Our data suggest that a decrease in pH and an increase in calcium are sufficient to trigger the selective aggregation of the granins in the TGN, segregating them from constitutive secretory proteins...|$|E
40|$|The adenosone 5 '-triphosphate-insensitive glucose 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} from Pseudomonas cepacia {{has been}} found to be strongly inhibited by long-chain fatty acids and their acyl coenzyme A esters, suggesting that an important role of this isoenzyme might be to provide reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate for reductive steps in fatty acid synthesis. The enzyme, which has been redesignated the fatty acid-sensitive glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, has been purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography with nicotinamide adenine dinulceotide phosphate-substituted Sepharose as a key step in the purification. The purified preparations were used to study the immunological properties and subunit composition of the enzyme and its relationship to the adenosine 5 '-triphosphate-sensitive glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase present in extracts of P. cepacia. Although both enzymes were found to be composed of similar size subunits of about 60, 000 daltons, immunological studies failed to demonstrate any antigenic similarity between them. Studies of the sedimentation behavior of the fatty acid-sensitive enzyme in sucrose gradients indicated that its apparent molecular weight is increased in the presence of glucose 6 -phosphate and suggest that it may exist <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> in vivo.

40|$|AbstractMembranes {{containing}} either {{negatively charged}} lipids or glycolipids can be aggregated by millimolar concentrations of Ca 2 +. In {{the case of}} membranes made from the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine, aggregation leads to vesicle fusion and leakage. However, some glycolipid-containing biological membranes such as plant chloroplast thylakoid membranes naturally occur <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> <b>state.</b> In the present contribution, the effect of Ca 2 +-induced aggregation on membrane stability during freezing and in highly concentrated salt solutions (NaCl±CaCl 2) has been determined in membranes containing different fractions of uncharged galactolipids, or a negatively charged sulfoglucolipid, or the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG), in membranes made from the uncharged phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC). In {{the case of the}} glycolipids, aggregation did not lead to fusion or leakage even under stress conditions, while it did lead to fusion and leakage in PG-containing liposomes. Liposomes made from a mixture of glycolipids and PG that approximates the lipid composition of thylakoids were very unstable, both during freezing and at high solute concentrations and leakage and fusion were increased in the presence of Ca 2 +. Collectively, the data indicate that the effects of Ca 2 +-induced aggregation of liposomes on membrane stability depend critically on the type of lipid involved in aggregation. While liposomes aggregated through glycolipids are highly stable, those aggregated through negatively charged lipids are severely destabilized...|$|E
40|$|Polarized {{fluorescence}} recovery after photobleaching (pFRAP) {{was used}} to monitor the effects that condensation, i. e. compaction and aggregation, have on the ([mu]s and ms) internal dynamics of chromatin in intact nuclei. When divalent cations were present with physiological ([approximate] 90 m) monovalent salt the chromatin was found to exist <b>in</b> <b>a</b> compact and <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> which was characterized by rotational immobilization over timescales that range from 10 microseconds to 40 milliseconds. This immobilization is attributed to suppression of internal dynamics by intermolecular interactions. When the divalent cations were removed, the compact fibers no longer aggregated and were free to reorient with a characteristic decay time of about 1. 2 milliseconds. It is shown that this millisecond relaxation could represent rigid rotation of topologically independent structural domains. Dilution of the monovalent salt induced <b>a</b> gradual change <b>in</b> the structural state of the chromatin that was manifest as <b>a</b> dramatic increase <b>in</b> internal flexibility. At the lowest salt concentration studied (11 m-monovalent salt) the chromatin reorients in fewer than ten microseconds. These changes in flexibility are continuous with salt concentration, indicating {{that there are no}} well-defined endpoints to structural transitions and that the microsecond-millisecond internal dynamics of chromatin are a sensitive measure of structure. Measurements made on nuclei from cells that are either transcriptionally quiescent or active indicate that the dynamics mirrors biological activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{recorded}} 13 C NMR spectra of the [3 - 13 C]Ala, [1 - 13 C]Val-labeled pharaonis transducer pHtrII(1 – 159) {{in the presence}} and absence of phoborhodopsin (ppR or sensory rhodopsin II) in egg phosphatidylcholine or dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers by means of site-directed (amino acid specific) solid-state NMR. Two kinds of 13 C NMR signals of [3 - 13 C]Ala-pHtrII complexed with ppR were clearly seen with dipolar decoupled magic angle spinning (DD-MAS) NMR. One of these resonances was at the peak position of the low-field α-helical peaks (αII-helix) and is identified with cytoplasmic α-helices protruding from the bilayers; {{the other was the}} high-field α-helical peak (αI-helix) and is identified with the transmembrane α-helices. The first peaks, however, were almost completely suppressed by cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} ppR or by DD-MAS NMR in the absence of ppR. This is caused by an increased fluctuation frequency of the cytoplasmic α-helix from 105 Hz in the uncomplexed states to > 106 Hz in the complexed states, leading to the appearance of peaks that were suppressed because of the interference of the fluctuation frequency with the frequency of proton decoupling (105 Hz), as viewed from the 13 C NMR spectra of [3 - 13 C]Ala-labeled pHtrII. Consistent with this view, the 13 C DD-MAS NMR signals of the cytoplasmic α-helices of the complexed [3 - 13 C]Ala-pHtrII in the dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer were partially suppressed at 0 °C due to a decreased fluctuation frequency at the low temperature. In contrast, examination of the 13 C CP-MAS spectra of [1 - 13 C]Val-labeled complexed pHtrII showed that the 13 C NMR signals of the transmembrane α-helix were substantially suppressed. These spectral changes are again interpreted in terms of the increased fluctuation frequency of the transmembrane α-helices from 103 Hz of the uncomplexed states to 104 Hz of the complexed states. These findings substantiate the view that the transducers alone are <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aggregated</b> or clustered <b>state</b> but the ppR-pHtrII complex is not aggregated. We show that 13 C NMR is a very useful tool for achieving a better understanding of membrane proteins which will serve to clarify the molecular mechanism of signal transduction in this system...|$|R
