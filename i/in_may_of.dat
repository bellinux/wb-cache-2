5|$|As Cimaron emerged {{over the}} South China Sea, {{officials}} in Vietnam began preparing for possible {{effects from the}} storm. Authorities began evacuating residents in flood-prone areas along the coast from Quảng Bình Khánh Hòa, including 12,500 in Thừa Thiên–Huế Province. Fishermen were urged to seek shelter at nearby ports until the storm subsided. The Vietnamese Government also requested the deployment of the nation's Army, Coast Guard, and Navy to assist in evacuation efforts. Residents still recovering from Typhoon Xangsane in early October were forced to secure their homes and evacuate once again. An estimated 218,000people were planned to be relocated across Vietnam: 68,000 in Quảng Nam, 60,000 in Quảng Trị, 50,000 in Thừa Thiên–Huế, and 40,000 in Quảng Bình. Appeals were made to roughly 3,500vessels, with a collective crew count of 32,285, to return to port. The Navy deployed 42ships for possible search and rescue missions. Following Cimaron's change in course and cessation of movement, the Vietnamese Government suspended all evacuation plans on November2; however, fishermen were urged to remain at port in fears of repeating the incidents during Typhoon Chanchu <b>in</b> <b>May</b> <b>of</b> that year where over 200fishermen lost their lives.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice for the first time <b>in</b> <b>May</b> <b>of</b> that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E
5|$|Biograph films before 1903 {{were mostly}} actualities (documentary footage of actual persons, places and events), but Sherlock Holmes Baffled {{is an example}} of an early Biograph comedy {{narrative}} film, produced at the company's rooftop studio on Broadway in New York City. According to Christopher Redmond's Sherlock Holmes Handbook, the film was shot on April 26, 1900. Julie McKuras states that the film was released <b>in</b> <b>May</b> <b>of</b> the same year. Despite being in circulation, Sherlock Holmes Baffled was only registered on February 24, 1903, and this is the date seen on the film's copyright title card. The occasionally suggested date of 1905 is probably due to confusion with a Vitagraph film titled Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom (1905).|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s, Pohl {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), where he would again work with Tirpitz after the latter was appointed as the State Secretary of the Navy. In 1900, Pohl {{was assigned to the}} fleet that was sent to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion. While in China, he commanded the protected cruiser , which bombarded the Taku Forts. <b>In</b> <b>May</b> <b>of</b> that year, Pohl was promoted to Korvettenkapitän. He was promoted to the rank of Konteradmiral in 1906. Thereafter he served as the commander of the reconnaissance forces of the German fleet. Pohl was promoted again, to Vizeadmiral, in January 1913. That year, he was elevated to the nobility and, in April, became the Chief of the Admiralty Staff, a position he would hold for two years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and <b>in</b> <b>May</b> <b>of</b> that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} published in bedsheet format, {{the same size}} as the early sf magazines such as Amazing, perhaps in order to attract fans who were nostalgic for the larger format. It started as a bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly. The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format, since that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land, and had a cover by J. Allen St. John; the combination proved to be so popular that October sales were twice the August figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was restarted in January 1941as a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly again <b>in</b> <b>May</b> <b>of</b> that year.|$|E
