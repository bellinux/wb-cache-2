25|$|One {{may then}} define ζ(s) for all {{remaining}} nonzero complex numbers s by assuming that this equation holds outside the strip as well, and letting ζ(s) equal {{the right-hand side}} of the equation whenever s has non-positive real part. If s is a negative even integer then ζ(s) = 0 because the factor sin(πs/2) vanishes; these are the trivial zeros of the zeta function. (If s is a positive even integer this argument does not apply because the zeros of the sine function are cancelled by the poles of the gamma function as it takes negative integer arguments.) The value ζ(0)nbsp&=nbsp&−1/2 is not determined by the <b>functional</b> <b>equation,</b> but is the limiting value of ζ(s) as s approaches zero. The <b>functional</b> <b>equation</b> also implies that the zeta function has no zeros with negative real part other than the trivial zeros, so all non-trivial zeros lie in the critical strip where s has real part between 0 and 1.|$|E

Moreover, the real zeros of Z(t) are precisely the zeros of the zeta-function along the critical line, and complex zeros in the Z-function critical strip correspond to zeros off the critical line of the Riemann zeta-function in its critical strip.|$|E
