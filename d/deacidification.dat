2500|$|Diethylzinc is {{not limited}} to only being used in chemistry. Because of its high {{reactivity}} toward air, it was used in small quantities as a hypergolic or [...] "self igniting" [...] liquid rocket fuel—it ignites on contact with oxidizer, so the rocket motor need only contain a pump, without a spark source for ignition. Diethylzinc was also investigated by the United States Library of Congress as a potential means of mass <b>deacidification</b> of books printed on wood pulp paper. Diethylzinc vapour would, in theory, neutralize acid residues in the paper, leaving slightly alkaline zinc oxide residues. Although initial results were promising, the project was abandoned. A variety of adverse results prevented the method's adoption. Most infamously, the final prototype suffered damage in a series of explosions from contact between trace amounts of diethylzinc and water vapor in the chamber.

50|$|<b>Deacidification</b> washes {{are usually}} {{a viable option}} for most {{repositories}} as books can be sent in bulk; however, only books of excellent physical quality may be sent. The wash process is rather aggressive and any deformities in a book may cause damage to already brittle specimens.

Studies conducted by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center and the General State Archive of the Netherlands found the DEZ method, properly used, might be particularly applicable to archival materials.

[...] During 1995-1997, the Library of Congress received $2 million in appropriations to deacidify 72,000 books using the Bookkeeper commercial method and evaluate alternative methods. The actual cost per book was $11.70. Finally, a recent cost comparison with reformatting options per volume yielded $125 for microfilming, $50 for scanning and minimal indexing, and, based on a New York Public Library project, $16.20 for <b>deacidification.</b>|$|E

5000|$|While <b>deacidification</b> {{has been}} adopted by major {{research}} libraries such as the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library, {{it is not clear}} that many archives, particularly those in the United States, have followed suit.

In 2000, the Chief of the NARA Document Conservation Laboratory defended the lack of a mass <b>deacidification</b> program by pointing to differences between library and archival collections, for example noting that many of the papers coming to NARA were of a higher quality than those in library collections; that the Archives does not receive records from federal government agencies until they are at least 30 years old, by which time acidic paper will have already beenirrevocably weakened; and that limited resources might best be applied elsewhere, such as climate control, as under the Archives' Twenty-Year Preservation Plan, the emphasis was on [...] "maximum benefit for the greatest number of records." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mass <b>deacidification</b> is a {{term used}} in Library and Information Science for one {{possible}} measure against the degradation of paper in old books (the so-called [...] "slow fires"). The goal of the process {{is to increase the}} pH of acidic paper on a large scale. Although acid-free paper has become more common, a large body of acidic paper still exists in books made after the 1850s because of its cheaper and simpler production methods. Acidic paper, especially when exposed to light, air pollution, or high relative humidity, yellows and becomes brittle over time. During mass <b>deacidification</b> an alkaline agent is deposited in the paper to neutralize existing acid and prevent further decay.|$|E

50|$|Pulp paper, however, {{contains}} acid {{which eventually}} destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used limestone rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp.

50|$|One {{technique}} proposed was {{to place}} books in an evacuated chamber, then introduce diethylzinc (DEZ). In theory, the diethylzinc would react with acidic residues in the paper, leaving an alkaline residue {{that would protect}} the paper against further degradation. In practice, the heating required to remove trace water from the books before reaction (DEZ reacts violently with water) caused an accelerated degradation of the paper, {{and a range of}} other chemical reactions between DEZ and other components of the book (glues, bindings) caused further damage and the production of unpleasant smells. Regardless, in the 1980s, a pilot plant for mass <b>deacidification</b> using this process was constructed by NASA and was tested on books provided by the Library of Congress. However, it was discovered in 1986 that the DEZ had not been removed in one of the <b>deacidification</b> runs and was pooled {{in the bottom of the}} chamber, and probably remained within some of the plumbing. DEZ is violently flammable when it comes in contact with either oxygen or water vapor, so the vacuum chamber could not be opened to remove the books within. Eventually, explosives were used to rupture the suspect plumbing; suspicions of the presence of residual DEZ were confirmed by the subsequent fire that destroyed the plant. In his book Double Fold, Nicholson Baker discusses the failure of the NASA program at great length.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} {{half of the}} 20th century {{it became apparent that}} the use of acidic wood-pulp paper, common since the 1850s, was causing paper materials to slowly burn. This has been referred to as the slow fire. A statement submitted to the House of Representatives estimated that there were 80 million brittle books in North American libraries, 12 million of which were unique titles. As mass <b>deacidification</b> efforts proved costly and inconsistent, librarians and archivists began looking for more practical ways to preserve the intellectual content of the decaying material. Microfilm, one of the most stable and durable mediums around at the time, was decided to be the most reasonable alternative.|$|E
50|$|Wimmis' {{location}} {{at the entrance}} to the Simmental made it into an important local trading center. In 1815 the construction of the Simmental road allowed more traffic to travel through Wimmis. A village school opened in 1859. In the 1870s it was envisioned as a railroad hub, before the hub was moved to Spiez. Between 1897 and 1902 the Spiez-Zweisimmen railway passed through the village and built stations at Wimmis and Eifeld. The railroad helped factories move into Wimmis. In 1919 the Swiss military established the Federal Gunpowder factory at Wimmis. In the 1990s it became Nitrochemie Wimmis, which in addition to producing smokeless powder, explosives and industrial chemicals is the world's largest paper <b>deacidification</b> facility.|$|E

It was then that the following were built: the stamping room where metal sheets were processed, prepared and pressed, the <b>deacidification</b> facility (varnishing) where the vessels were bathed in a solution of sulfuric acid to remove all impurities and grease, and the enamel shop, where enamel was laid {{in a number of}} layers: the priming coat first, then the colour, and finally another protective coat.|$|E
