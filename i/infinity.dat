5|$|The game is {{designed}} as an action-oriented alternative to other <b>Infinity</b> Engine games, with {{less emphasis on}} exploration and story. It uses a real-time adaptation of the Dungeons & Dragons (D) Third Edition ruleset. The <b>Infinity</b> Engine was extensively modified {{to comply with the}} Third Edition, but the team was forced to remove certain rules because of the engine's outdated nature. It was the final game to be developed using the <b>Infinity</b> Engine.|$|E
5|$|A novella {{by author}} Brandon Sanderson was {{released}} prior to both <b>Infinity</b> Blade II and III {{to serve as}} a story bridge between the games. <b>Infinity</b> Blade: Awakening was released as an e-book on October 4, 2011 to correspond with the announcement of <b>Infinity</b> Blade II. The story gives the protagonist of the first game a name, Siris, introduces the idea that the God King was one of multiple Deathless in the world, as is Siris, and has Siris and the assassin Isa journey to find the Worker of Secrets in order to kill the resurrected God King and the other Deathless. The second e-book novella, <b>Infinity</b> Blade: Redemption, was released on September 9, 2013 just prior to the third game. In it, Siris and the God King escape from their imprisonment by the Worker of Secrets, while extensive flashbacks show the rise of the Deathless in a future-Earth analogue. While Siris disrupts the Worker of Secret's plans, the God King confronts and is killed by the Worker.|$|E

40|$|Several {{examples}} {{are used to}} illustrate how we deal cavalierly with <b>infinities</b> and unphysical systems in physics. Upon examining these examples {{in the context of}} <b>infinities</b> from Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers, the only known mathematical theory of <b>infinities,</b> we conclude that apparent inconsistencies in physics are a result of unfamiliar and unusual rules obeyed by mathematical <b>infinities.</b> We show that a re-examination of some familiar limiting results in physics leads to surprising and unfamiliar conclusions. It is not the purpose of this work to resolve the problem of <b>infinities</b> but the intent of this analysis is {{to point out that the}} study of real <b>infinities</b> in mathematics may be the first step towards delineating and understanding the problem of <b>infinities</b> in physics.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that Aristotle rules out the {{existence}} of actual <b>infinities</b> but allows for potential <b>infinities.</b> However, precisely why Aristotle should deny {{the existence of}} actual <b>infinities</b> remains somewhat obscure and has received relatively little attention in the secondary literature. In this paper I investigate the motivations of Aristotle’s finitism and offer a careful examination {{of some of the}} arguments considered by Aristotle both in favour of and against the existence of actual <b>infinities.</b> I argue that Aristotle has good reason to resist the traditional arguments offered in favour of the existence of the infinite and that, while there is a lacuna in his own ‘logical’ arguments against actual <b>infinities,</b> his arguments against the existence of infinite magnitude and number are valid and more well grounded than commonly supposed...|$|R

The game is played on a 46-inch screen rigged with optical sensors so as to mimic a large iPhone or iPad screen. Each arcade stand contains up to three screens, and players can play against each other or in the single-player game. A sequel to the iOS game, <b>Infinity</b> Blade II, was announced on October 4, 2011, during the Apple iPhone 4S keynote presentation. It was released on December 1, 2011, and features enhanced graphics, a new storyline, and new fighting styles. A spinoff game, <b>Infinity</b> Blade: Dungeons, was in development for iOS by Epic Games subsidiary Impossible Games, but was cancelled in February 2013 when Impossible Games was shut down. A final game in the trilogy, <b>Infinity</b> Blade III, was released on September 18, 2013.|$|E
