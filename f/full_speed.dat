5|$|The {{attacker}} consciously stops {{just short}} of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> and power. The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other. This is normally the practice when one training partner is a beginner.|$|E

5|$|USB2.0 was {{released}} in April 2000, adding a higher maximum signaling rate of 480Mbit/s (High Speed or High Bandwidth), {{in addition to the}} USB1.x <b>Full</b> <b>Speed</b> signaling rate of 12Mbit/s. Due to bus access constraints, the effective throughput of the High Speed signaling rate is limited to 280Mbit/s or 35MB/s.|$|E
5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> signal from the host.|$|E

5|$|During trials, Delaware was run at <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> for 24 hours {{straight}} {{to prove that}} her machinery could handle the stress. She was the first American battleship to achieve the feat. Late in 1910, Delaware sailed to Europe, followed by a trip to South America early in 1911. She made a further two voyages to Europe in 1912 and 1913, {{before returning to the}} US Atlantic Fleet for training exercises that were conducted in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. Delaware took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in April–May 1914.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A China-V Heavy-duty {{diesel engine}} fueled with blends of 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 50 % waste cooking oil {{biodiesel}} and diesel(marked separately BD 5, BD 10, BD 20, BD 50), pure biodiesel (BD 100) and pure diesel (D 100), was tested on <b>full</b> load <b>speed</b> characteristics and 1400 r/min and 2200 r/min load characteristics to study influence of biodiesel fuel and engine conditions on particle size distributions and particle number concentration. The {{results show that}} when fueled with blends containing less than 50 % biodiesel, the particle number concentrations show single peak distribution curves(nucleation mode), for the pure biodiesel, particle number concentrations show bimodal distribution including nucleation mode and accumulation mode on <b>full</b> load <b>speed</b> characteristics and 1400 r/min and 2200 r/min load characteristics; on <b>full</b> load <b>speed</b> characteristics, for BD 100, the peak of particle number concentration of BD 100 is lowest, compared with D 100, it is about one order of magnitude lower; on 1400 r/min load characteristics, with the biodiesel proportion increasing, the number of nucleation mode and accumulation mode particles decreases; on lower than 1800 r/min <b>full</b> load <b>speed</b> characteristics and 1400 r/min and 2200 r/min load characteristics, with the biodiesel proportion increasing, the particle number concentration decreases...|$|R

5|$|The La-7 {{ended the}} superiority in {{vertical}} maneuverability that the Messerschmitt Bf 109G had previously enjoyed over other Soviet fighters. Furthermore, it was fast enough at low altitudes to catch, albeit with some difficulties, Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers that attacked Soviet units on the frontlines and immediately returned to German-controlled airspace at <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b> The Yakovlev Yak-3 and the Yakovlev Yak-9U with the Klimov VK-107 engine lacked {{a large enough}} margin of speed to overtake the German raiders. 115 La-7s were lost in air combat, only half the number of Yak-3s.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at <b>full</b> <b>speed,</b> adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E

5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 {{feet into the air}} and run faster than a train.

Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at <b>full</b> <b>speed,</b> when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E

5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b> However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> of being cowards.|$|E
5|$|New Zealands first wartime {{action was}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, {{as part of}} the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty.

When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} Jade estuary.|$|E
