40|$|Synopsis: The FRP {{system is}} a good {{alternative}} of the traditional shear strengthening technique. This study evaluates the shear strengthening effects on the reinforced concrete beams strengthened with varying types of FRP materials, CFRP, CFS and GFRP. The entire strengthened specimens were failed {{in the mode of}} brittle shear failure with debonding of the FRP materials. The shear capacities were improved mostly by more than 54 %. The different types of the strengthening materials did not yield a noticeable difference in the shear strengthening effect. The orientation of the fibers, however, was found to be an important factor. With a 45 ° fiber orientation, greater strengthening effect and better control on the shear crack propagation were observed. A numerical model predicting the shear capacity of the shear-strengthened beams was suggested along with the strength <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> from the <b>test</b> results.

40|$|Extracellular enzymes from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) {{involved}} in the degradation of nodulation (Nod) factors could be distinguished by their different cleavage specificities and were separated by lectin affinity chromatography. A particular glycoprotein was able to release an acylated lipo-disaccharide from all <b>tested</b> Nod <b>factors</b> having an oligosaccharide chain length {{of four or five}} residues. Structural modifications of the basic lipo-chitooligosaccharide did not affect the cleavage site and had only weak influence on the cleavage <b>efficiency</b> of Nod <b>factors</b> <b>tested.</b> The acylated lipo-trisaccharide was resistant to degradation. When alfalfa roots were preincubated with Nod factors at nanomolar concentrations, the activity of the dimer-forming enzyme was stimulated up to 6 -fold within a few hours. The inducing activity of Nod factors decreased in the order NodRm-IV(C 16 : 2,Ac,S) > NodRm-IV(C 16 : 2,S) and NodRm-V(C 16 : 2,Ac,S) > NodRm-V(C 16 : 2,S) > NodRm-IV(C 16 : 0,S) > NodRm-IV(C 16 : 2). Pretreatment with NodRm-III(C 16 : 2) as well as unmodified chitooligosaccharides did not stimulate the dimer-forming enzyme.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} the annual collected energy and the annual average optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> is suggested. The radiation distribution on the absorber of an asymmetric CPC collector with a flat bi-facial absorber is measured for three different absorber mounting angles using a photo diode. The annual optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factors</b> and a relative measure of the annual collected energy are determined for collectors with the absorber fin thickness 0. 5 and 1 mm, and for a collector with a teflon convection suppression film mounted around the absorber. With the local optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factors</b> and the annual incident solar energy distribution considered, the analysis indicates that the energy gain for a mounting angle of 20 is higher than for a collector with 65 absorber mounting angle. The annual collected energy is increased with 6 - 8 % if the absorber fin thickness is increased from 0. 5 to 1 mm. The annual average optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> is relatively independent of the absorber mounting angle. It {{was found to be}} 0. 87 - 0. 88 for a collector with a 0. 5 mm thick absorber fin and 0. 92 for a collector with a 1 mm thick absorber fin or for a collector with 0. 5 mm thick absorber fin with a teflon convection suppression film added. The low annual average optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> is not caused by the uneven irradiance distribution but by the relatively high U-L-values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In the {{equation}} for thermal energy output from a flat-plate solar collector (written {{as a function}} of the collector mean heat carrier temperature), both the gain and the loss terms are multiplied by the collector <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor,</b> F'. For a concentrating collector with an uneven (non-uniform) irradiation on the absorber, the <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> for the gain term, here called the optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor,</b> F-c', is different from F' and is a function of the irradiation distribution on the absorber. If the heat loss coefficient is assumed to be constant across the fin, the optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> for absorbed irradiation at a certain distance from the edge of the absorber is independent of absorbed irradiation at other locations and can therefore be expressed F-c'(x), where x is the distance from the edge of the absorber. Close to the edge, F-c'(x) F'. In this paper formulas are derived for calculating F-c'(x) for a fin absorber with constant fin thickness. By weighting F-c'(x) with the absorbed irradiance, S-c(x), and integrating across the absorber, an absorber average optical <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor,</b> F-c,F-a', is obtained. This value replaces F' in the gain term of {{the equation}} for thermal energy output. If, instead, the energy output equation is expressed {{as a function of}} the inlet temperature, F-c,F-a' can be used for calculating a corresponding heat removal factor for uneven irradiation, F-R,F-c. Formulas for calculating the temperature distribution across the absorber for the case of uneven irradiation are also derived. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiative}} {{properties of}} bubbles or particles embedded in an absorbing medium are investigated. We aim first {{to determine the}} conditions under which absorption by the surrounding medium must be accounted for in the calculation of the <b>efficiency</b> <b>factors</b> by comparing results from Mie theory and the far-field and near-field approximations. Then, we relate these approximations for a single particle to the effective radiation characteristics required for solving the radiative transfer in an ensemble of scatterers embedded in an absorbing medium. The results indicate that the <b>efficiency</b> <b>factors</b> for a spherical particle can differ significantly from one model to another, in particular for large particle size parameter and matrix absorption index. Moreover, the effective scattering coefficient should be expressed based on the far-field approximation. Also, the choice of the absorption <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> depends on the model used for estimating the effective absorption coefficient. However, for small void fractions, absorption by the matrix dominates, and models for the absorption coefficient and <b>efficiency</b> <b>factor</b> are unimportant.
