40|$|This paper studies {{political}} support in advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> Our {{goal is to}} determine how citizens in these nations judge the democratic process today. Is there a popular "crisis of democracy'? This paper first provides a framework for assessing public support for democratic politics in advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> Then, we demonstrate a broad decline in support for politicians, parties, and political institutions across these nations. However, democratic values and community support have not declined significantly. The paper discusses {{the implications of these}} findings for politics in advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Past {{comparative}} voting-behavior {{research has}} revealed that electoral institutions can explain much {{of the variation in}} voter turnout between nations. This study takes an alternative and dynamic approach by identifying and explaining a pattern of turnout decline within <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies,</b> which is beyond purely institutional explanation. Multivariate analysis of a pooled cross section of 18 <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies</b> between 1950 and 1997 suggests that turnout decline can best be explained in terms of changing patterns of group mobilization and electorate demo-graphics. The authors specifically point to the decline of unions and labor parties, which have traditionally been associated with the mobilization of peripheral voters and the real increases in the cost of mobilization. The authors control for institutional changes and find that they are less useful in explaining variation in turnout within advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Low turnout is {{a growing}} concern among the <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> Compulsory voting has {{achieved}} very high turnouts in several countries, but it has been mostly neglected as {{a solution to the problem}} of low turnout elsewhere. This thesis considers the usefulness of compulsory voting for <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> I argue that, for it to be useful, compulsory voting must be effective on two levels. First, compulsory voting must be effective in increasing turnout. Second, the high turnout resulting from compulsory voting must improve the total utility of the people-defined here as the well-being of the people-otherwise compulsory voting will not ultimately be useful. Rational choice models are constructed and operationalised in order to describe, explain and evaluate compulsory voting. Although data analysis is undertaken for a range of <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies</b> in order to test these rational choice hypotheses, the major focus of this research is on Australia, which has achieved very high turnout levels (around 95 % of the registered voters) since the introduction of compulsory voting for federal elections in 1924. Furthermore, by examining the case of Australia, this thesis determines the conditions and necessary adjustments for compulsory voting to work effectively in practice. Finally, compulsory voting is tested with rational choice theory and data analysis on the actual <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies</b> in order to see whether this system is applicable under globally varying conditions. The conclusion of the analysis is that compulsory voting seems to be useful for several <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies</b> in theory and also seems to be workable in practice. However, some subjective judgement needs to be introduced for a full cost-benefit analysis to be made about compulsory voting...|$|R
40|$|Most {{researchers}} {{interested in}} the relationship between global markets and public policy focus on advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> In contrast, we examine competing hypotheses as to globalization s effect on governments by expanding the scope of the discussion to include developing nations. More specifically, we investigate the relationship between international market integration and the evolving burden of taxation on capital, as well as the subsequent response of markets to shifts in tax policy in Latin America since the late 1970 s. Consistent with our theoretical expectations, we find that global market forces are more constraining vis- -vis tax policy in Latin America than in the world s wealthiest nations. Despite these market-based pressures, however, national politics continue to influence tax policy in Latin America {{in a manner consistent with}} findings on advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> As such, developing nations continue to have some room to manipulate policy, though within the context of a more strictly neoliberal context than their counterparts in advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> The authors would like to thank Layna Mosley, Kenneth Roberts, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on this article.

40|$|Increased {{levels of}} {{economic}} openness in the <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies</b> have heightened {{the potential for}} intra-party and intra-coalition policy conflicts, hurting the ability of parties to win and retain office.

To determine the political value of these commitments, we test the effect of fixed exchange rates and central bank independence on cabinet durability using a set of 193 cabinets in 16 parliamentary democracies across the period 1972 - 1998. The results indicate that monetary commitments are associated with higher cabinet durability, particularly for coalition governments. We then use {{the results of our}} statistical models to generate expected cabinet durability under alternative institutional configurations. By comparing these expected values, we show that actual monetary reforms in the <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies</b> have helped (or at least not hurt) the ability of political parties to remain in office...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Despite much {{attention}} to global markets and domestic politics, political scientists {{know very little about}} how globalization influences the most fundamental aspect of representative democracy, the vote. This article presents a model of party choice when the capacity of elites to deliver policy is limited by the global economy. I argue that voters evaluate parties differently when elected representatives are perceived to be constrained by exogenous conditions. Voters respond to globalization by reducing the weight assigned to economic performance evaluations and to party positions on economic issues. To compensate, they increase the salience of non-economic issues. Analyses of French and British survey data support theoretical claims. Results show that market integration carries greater consequences for domestic politics than implied by recent work on the political economy of <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies.</b> Hellwig 2 The consequences of economic globalization for advanced <b>industrial</b> <b>democracies</b> remain a source of much debate among students of comparative and international political economy...|$|R
