5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but <b>in</b> <b>depression</b> as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E
5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help <b>in</b> <b>depression</b> by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke {{in the first two}} days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E

Several days afterwards, four regents– Suradiningrat from Tuban, Martapura from Grobogan, Suradimenggala from Kaliwungu, and Awangga from Kendal– arrived at Semarang, reporting that the 6,000 promised troops were on their way.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>depression</b> {{and grief}} syndromes, crying is {{typically}} {{a sign of}} sadness, whereas the pathological displays of crying which occur in PBA are often {{in contrast to the}} underlying mood, or greatly in excess of the mood or eliciting stimulus. In addition, a key to differentiating depression from PBA is duration: PBA episodes are sudden, occurring in a brief episodic manner, while crying <b>in</b> <b>depression</b> is a more sustained presentation and closely relates to the underlying mood state. The level of control that one has over the crying episodes in PBA is minimal or nonexistent, whereas for those suffering from depression, the emotional expression (typically crying) can be modulated by the situation. Similarly, the trigger for episodes of crying in patients with PBA may be nonspecific, minimal or inappropriate to the situation, but <b>in</b> <b>depression</b> the stimulus is specific to the mood-related condition. These differences are outlined in the adjacent Table.|$|E
