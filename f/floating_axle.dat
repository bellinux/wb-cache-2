50|$|The Dana 60 {{rear axle}} was first {{introduced}} in 1955 as a full <b>floating</b> <b>axle</b> in Ford F-250's and is still used today.|$|E
50|$|The common {{drive axle}} {{used on the}} C3500 HD was the Dana 80, an 85.8-inch-wide full <b>floating</b> <b>axle</b> with an 11-inch ring gear fitted with 19.5-inch x 6.0 wheels. The front axle was a solid I-beam drop axle, similar to the axles of medium and heavy duty trucks. Both front and rear leaf sprung axles had disc brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The Sterling 10.5 axle is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Ford Motor Company at the Sterling Axle Plant in Sterling Heights, MI. It {{was first used}} in model year 1985 Ford trucks. The axle was developed to replace the Dana 60 and Dana 70. The Sterling 10.5 axle is currently only made as a full <b>floating</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Manufactured in both full float and semi float variations. The semi <b>float</b> <b>axles</b> have GAWR up to 5,500 lbs and {{the full}} <b>float</b> <b>axles</b> were rated up to 6,500 lbs.|$|R
5000|$|The motor is {{arranged}} between the <b>floating</b> <b>axles.</b> A common pinion or a pinion on both motor end drives the gear {{wheels of the}} neighbouring axes. [...] described this design, but vehicles implementing it are not known.|$|R
500|$|A Reuleaux {{triangle}} (along {{with all}} other curves of constant width) can roll but makes a poor wheel {{because it does not}} roll about a fixed center of rotation. An object on top of rollers that have Reuleaux triangle cross-sections would roll smoothly and flatly, but an axle attached to Reuleaux triangle wheels would bounce up and down three times per revolution. This concept was used in a science fiction short story by Poul Anderson titled [...] "Three-Cornered Wheel". A bicycle with <b>floating</b> <b>axles</b> and a frame supported by the rim of its Reuleaux triangle shaped wheel was built and demonstrated in 2009 by Chinese inventor Guan Baihua, who was inspired by pencils with the same shape.|$|R
50|$|The Buchli {{drive is}} a {{transmission}} system used in electric locomotives. It was named after its inventor, Swiss engineer Jakob Buchli Deutsch. The drive is a fully spring-loaded drive, in which each <b>floating</b> <b>axle</b> has an individual motor, that {{is placed in the}} spring mounted locomotive frame. The weight of the driving motors is completely disconnected from the driving wheels, which are exposed to movement of the rails.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame was}} a widened chassis of the Halford-Cross Rotary Special race car, it was painted green and rechristened as Chassis #WT-68. The rear {{section of the}} car was a second series of the {{distinctive}} MG Airline coupe with a sliding sunroof and an enclosed rear spare manufactured by Carbodies, now known as Manganese Bronze Holdings (traded as London Taxi Company). The fenders and bonnet (hood) were unique to the HRG and were formed by A. Crofts of the Crofts Coachbuilding firm which also assembled the body. Brakes are 4 wheel mechanical drum, suspension is independent up front with Semi-Elliptical leaf springs with <b>floating</b> <b>axle</b> in the rear.|$|E
50|$|In {{other types}} of {{suspension}} systems, the axles serve only to transmit driving torque to the wheels; the position and angle of the wheel hubs is an independent function of the suspension system. This {{is typical of the}} independent suspensions found on most newer cars and SUVs, and on the front of many light trucks. These systems still have differentials, but will not have attached axle housing tubes. They may be attached to the vehicle frame or body, or integral in a transaxle. The axle shafts (usually constant-velocity type) then transmit driving torque to the wheels. Like a full <b>floating</b> <b>axle</b> system, the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight.|$|E
50|$|The Bedford OB was {{designed}} as a successor to the Bedford WTB. It had a wheelbase of 14 ft, and was a semi-forward control model, designed to carry 26 to 29-passenger bodywork. It was fitted with a 27.34 horsepower petrol engine, and had a four-speed manual gearbox and fully <b>floating</b> rear <b>axle.</b> The brakes were of the vacuum servo-assisted hydraulic type.|$|R
5000|$|The Bedford M {{series is}} a {{commercial}} vehicle chassis, the first variants {{of which were}} made in 1939 by Bedford. It is a normal control 4-wheel chassis designed to carry loads of 2-3 tons. There were two wheelbase lengths offeredâ€”10' 0" [...] or 11' 11" [...] -- and each was fitted with the standard 6-cylinder 27.34 hp petrol engine. A 4-speed gearbox with single dry plate clutch delivered power to a <b>floating</b> rear <b>axle</b> with spiral bevel final drive. Brakes were Lockheed hydraulic type and servo assisted operating on all four wheels.|$|R
50|$|A new {{designed}} chassis {{with straight}} box section sidemembers having six tubular cross-members is particularly stiff so the {{independent front suspension}} can work properly. Steering is carried out by worm and nut. Automatic chassis lubrication {{is controlled by the}} clutch pedal. The car is fitted with a Smiths hydraulic jacking system. The independent front suspension to Alviss own design is by transverse leaf springs. The semi-elliptic rear springs are underslung. Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers control the springing. A fully <b>floating</b> rear <b>axle</b> is fitted. Wire wheels with bolt-on hubs are supplied fitted with extra low-pressure tyres. Four-wheel, self-energising Girling brakes have large diameter drums which are ribbed for cooling.|$|R
5000|$|September 5, 2003, Disneyland: A 22-year-old {{man died}} after {{suffering}} severe blunt trauma and extensive internal bleeding in a derailment that also injured 10 other riders. [...] The {{cause of the}} accident {{was determined to be}} improper maintenance. [...] Investigation reports and discovery by the victim's attorney confirmed the fatal injuries occurred when the first passenger car collided with the underside of the locomotive. The derailment {{was the result of a}} mechanical failure which occurred due to omissions during a maintenance procedure. Fasteners on the left side upstop/guide wheel on the <b>floating</b> <b>axle</b> of the locomotive were not tightened and safetied in accordance with specifications. As the train entered a tunnel the axle came loose and jammed against a brake section, causing the locomotive to become airborne and hit the ceiling of the tunnel. The locomotive then fell on top of the first passenger car, crushing the victim.|$|E

Some people blamed the new cost-conscious maintenance culture brought in by Paul Pressler and consultants McKinsey & Company in 1997, which included Reliability-centered maintenance.|$|E
50|$|NoSno trucks use two 'kingpin'-type bolts {{to create}} a <b>floating</b> pivot, an <b>axle</b> with a plate into which the bolts go, an angled base plate that {{attaches}} to the deck, and polyurethane bushings to dampen the turn. The amount of turn available in the trucks can be adjusted by tightening the bolts or by using bushings of different hardness. A similar design was adopted by Howla Mountainboards for the limited time that they manufactured boards.|$|R
50|$|The Dana S110 {{is used in}} Class 4 and Class 5 applications. Dodge, Ford and General Motors {{use this}} axle as well as various other companies. The Dana S110 is a full <b>floating,</b> {{drop-out}} <b>axle.</b> Dana S110 axles are a step up in overall strength compared to the Dana 80. Ford started using this axle in 2005 model F-450 and F-550 trucks. Replacing the Dana 80 in some class 4 trucks, and the Dana S 135 {{in the rest of}} the trucks. Dodge started using the Dana S110 in their 2008 model 4500 and 5500 trucks. Although this axle is designed for medium-duty, commercial-trucks, Ford did put the S110 in 2008-2010 & 2015-2016 F-450 Pick up trucks. The Dana S110 has a GAWR up to 14,706 lbs but is frequently, de-rated by vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons. This axle is not used in 1 Ton trucks (Class 3).|$|R
5000|$|Carrying four {{passengers}} the taxicab had [...] "plenty of speed" [...] {{and four}} forward gears and was {{suitable for the}} country as well as London. The engine's four cylinders had a bore and stroke of 80 and 125 mm giving a displacement of [...] and a tax rating of 15.87 h.p. The engine had side valves with tappets easily reached for adjustment, the generator and magneto being driven in tandem. The cooling water circulated naturally. Such parts as the carburettor were easily accessible. The speed lever worked in a visible gate with a stop for reverse. The three-quarter <b>floating</b> back <b>axle</b> was driven by overhead worm gear from an enclosed propellor shaft. The springs were semi-elliptical and beneath the frame, those in front were flat and splayed while those at the back were underhung. Shock absorbers were provided. The chassis weighed 18 cwt 2016 lb.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 80 is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation {{and has been}} used in OEM heavy duty applications by Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford. It can be identified by its straight axle tubes, 10 bolt asymmetrical cover, and a [...] "80" [...] cast into the housing. Dana 80's are made as full <b>floating,</b> rear <b>axles</b> only and are step up in overall strength compared to the Dana 70. 1988 Ford was the first company to use the Dana 80. The Dana 80 has a GAWR up to 11000 lb, however it is common practice among manufacturers to derate Dana 80's. Gross axle weight ratings are lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons. The OEM Limited slip differential originally was a [...] "Power Lok" [...] until 1998 when the [...] "Trac Lok" [...] phased it out. Trac Loks are currently a $350.00 USD option with Ford Super Duty trucks. [...] The Dana 80 Trac Lok is unique being it is a 4 pinion unit, unlike other Dana Trac Lok units with 2 pinions. This was the only rear axle available for the 2nd generation Dodge Ram 3500 trucks.|$|R
5000|$|The M-970 Semi-Trailer Refueler is a 5,000 gal fuel {{dispensing}} tanker {{designed for}} under/overwing refueling of aircraft. It {{is equipped with}} a filter/separator, recirculation system and two refueling systems, one for underwing and one for overwing servicing. The tanker is designed to be towed by a 5-ton, 6x6 truck tractor or similar vehicle equipped with a fifth wheel. The M-970 can be loaded through the bottom or through the top fill openings. A ladder is provided {{at the front of the}} semitrailer for access to the top manhole, and a 4-cylinder diesel engine and pump assembly provides self load/unload capability. The body of the refueler is a 5,000-U.S.-gallon, single compartment, stainless steel tank. The chassis is of welded steel construction and is equipped with full <b>floating</b> tandem <b>axles</b> and a manually operated landing gear. There has been talk of retiring the M-970, but a suitable off-road replacement has not been found. The Marine Corps also uses R-9 and R-10 tankers, but they are not capable of off road use. The M-970 is a part of the [...] "United States Marine Corps Maintenance Center - Albany, Georgia, USA - An Integrated Enterprise Scheduling Case Study" [...] which is working to upgrade the Semitrailer for future use.|$|R
