5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or <b>in-kind</b> <b>contributions.</b> Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that <b>in-kind</b> <b>contributions</b> be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating {{the value of a}} building {{to make sure that it}} meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of <b>in-kind</b> <b>contributions,</b> which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E

40|$|<b>Contribution</b> <b>in-kind,</b> {{innovative}} project, <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution</b> {{capacity of}} innovation outputs, valuation of innovation outputs. Summary The paper presents {{a method for}} the valuation of innovative project outputs {{as the object of}} <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution</b> to a commercial company. <b>In-kind</b> <b>contribution</b> of an innovative project can be treated as a form of technology transfer. The realisation of technology transfer {{in the form of the}} <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution</b> requires an estimate of its value. Assuming that a research project is a value carrier in the process of valuation, this value should be estimated in terms of its ability to cover liabilities, which is the attribute of each <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution.</b> The presented valuation method is based on the philosophy adopted within the framework of the income valuation methods, i. e. on the capacity of innovative project outputs to generate current cash flows from the company profits in the future. Innovation in itself is not, however, the source of profits. It is, in addition to financial capital, part of the overall capitals that finance operational assets. Thus, the process of innovative project valuation must be preceded by the measurement of innovation outputs generated by the project, i. e. its innovation potential. “The duration of the competitive advantage ” achieved through the implementation of innovation in the compan...|$|R
