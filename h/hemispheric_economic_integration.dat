40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 2000 Dr. Philip Andrew MacDonaldThis thesis is {{an examination of the}} forces behind the increasing levels of intra-regional <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> in East Asia. <b>Economic</b> <b>integration</b> in Europe, {{and to a lesser extent}} in North America, was preceded by an adaptation of political agreements and institutions which, in turn, largely determined the further pattern of <b>economic</b> regionalisation. <b>Economic</b> <b>integration</b> in East Asia did not experience such a prerequisite settlement. East Asian <b>economic</b> <b>integration,</b> unlike <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> in other regions around the globe, is being driven by the growing interdependence between transnational corporations (TNCs), and in many instances, small-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), strategies, and regional governments policies. The thesis examines the process of intra-regional <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> in East Asia from three levels of analysis: state-state, state-firm and firm-firm. The discussion seeks to go beyond the “state versus market” analysis of regional <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> and aims to present an ‘alternative’ framework of analysis by discussing the dynamics of the growing relationship between states and firms. In order to ‘capture’ this relationship, the dissertation examines the interplay between the forces of globalisation and regionalisation. The findings of the three case studies, together with the analysis of globalisation and regionalisation, have demonstrated the need to move beyond the state versus market dichotomy. East Asian <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> is occurring at three levels: state-state, state-firm and firm-firm. The forces behind East Asian <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> include cooperation and competition between states, bargaining between states and firms, and the activities of TNCs and SMEs. Changes in the global economy affect the pattern of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> at the regional level. Understanding how these changes impact on state policies and firm strategies is vital to analysing regional <b>economic</b> <b>integration.</b> Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Economics) The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} the role of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> in the <b>economic</b> development of the member states of an envisaged economically integrated Southern African bloc, that would include South Africa. The study contends that economic development will be aided, if <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> were implemented correctly. <b>Economic</b> <b>integration</b> will influence both the allocation and distribution elements of the involved countries' wealth. Since economic development is inextricably entwined with the distribution of wealth, <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> would have to give special attention to its effect on the distribution of wealth between countries. The mainstream theory of <b>economic</b> <b>integration,</b> however, places much more emphasis on the allocation aspect of integration than the distribution aspect. This imbalance means that <b>economic</b> <b>integration,</b> implemented according to the guidelines of the mainstream theory, will be detrimental to the economic development of especially the less developed countries. The orthodox approach to <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> should therefore be adapted to the circumstances of developing countries. A suitable <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> approach should comprise two steps. The first step involves the identification of areas for profitable specialisation, and the second the formulation of an <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> strategy within the framework of a dirigiste approach to economic development.

40|$|A {{well-established}} {{strand of}} the literature on regionalism and <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> has made clear that economic, geopolitical, and socio-cultural relationships across the globe, for which Africa is no exception, have been changing rapidly in the last few decades. African leaders have been embracing these concepts as vital elements of their development agenda and have engaged their countries in a number of integration arrangements. This study has investigated regionalism and <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> in Africa from a conceptual and theoretical perspective. The study identified that (i) the rationalist’s theory of neorealism and neoliberalism, (ii) the social constructivism theory, and (iii) several theories of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> are very relevant in explaining the formation of regional and economic blocs in Africa.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} whether and how the degree of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> may affect central government tax revenues {{and the intensity of}} decentralisation. To this purpose, we empirically test the direct impact of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> on central tax revenues using the concept of implicit tax rates (ITRs) updated to take into account mobile and immobile capital taxation. On this basis we derive a country-specific measure of tax erosion that is used as a determinant of the decentralisation of the public sector in an Arellano-Bond environment. We find that: i) an increase of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> generates a downward pressure on ITRs on mobile capital, which is growing at increasing rates as far as <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> increases; ii) the process of tax erosion gives rise to a corresponding process of increasing public sector decentralisation. <b>Economic</b> <b>integration,</b> Fiscal federalism, Tax competition. ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the idea}} of <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> may be straightforward, but {{measuring}} it is not. The academic literature has identified {{a wide range of}} measures that capture various aspects of integration. Of these, the four most frequently used measures are product-level prices, factor markets, trade volumes, and product availability. All four are valuable measures that effectively capture different aspects of <b>economic</b> <b>integration.</b> The differences between the measures suggest that some might be more useful in certain contexts than in others. A comparison between the different measures suggests that the last two might generate the most meaningful insights into North American <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> because conditions in Mexico, a developing country, are quite different than in Canada and the United States.
