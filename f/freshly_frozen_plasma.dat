40|$|Objective: to {{introduce}} blood saving technologies {{and to develop}} algorithms for management of patients with pelvic fractures. Subjects and methods. Sixty patients aged 40. 6 ± 2. 3 years with pelvic fractures were examined. The banking of packed autoerythrocytes and auto <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> (AutoFFP), intraoperative acute hypervolemic hemodilution (AHH), and instrumental reinfusion of washed autoerythrocytes were made in all the patients. Blood loss volume averaged 32. 1 ± 1. 7 ml/kg. The parameters of central hemodynamics (CH), blood oxygen-transport function, the blood system (red blood cells, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, and platelets) were studied. AutoFFP was transfused in the most traumatic period of surgery, autoblood was on completion of surgical hemostasis, and washed autoerythrocytes were within 3 — 4 hours after surgery. Postoperative reductions in hemoglobin to below 80 g/l and packed cell volume below 25 % are indications for packed autoerythrocyte transfusion. Results. During preoperative autoblood banking, the parameters of CH and the blood system underwent no changes, all variations in the parameters were within the normal range and compensatory. When AHH and instrumental washed erythrocyte reinfusion were conducted, {{there was a significant}} increase in cardiac index (CI), stroke index by 37 and 30 %, respectively; reductions in total peripheral vascular resistance index by 38 %, mean blood pressure by 18 %, moderate hypercoagulation, and significant decreases in hemoglobin, packed cell volume, red blood cells by 17, 15, and 18 %, respectively. The values of acid-base condition and homeostasis underwent no considerable changes. Arterial blood O 2 content was significantly lowered by 16 %; however, global O 2 uptake remained unchanged at the baseline levels due to the increase of CI by 30 % of the baseline level. Conclusion. The application of blood saving technologies, preoperative autoblood banking in particular, AHH, and instrumental washed autoerythrocyte reinfusion allowed a refusal to use allo-geneic blood components during pelvic repair, by preventing the development of hemotransfusion complications.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{pyometra}} syndrome with endotoxemia and/or sepsis in bitches may impair different organ systems and functions including haemostasis, which may considerably influence the outcome if overlooked or underestimated. The present clinical study was carried out on thirty-seven clinical patients admitted to the Clinic for Small Animal Medicine and Surgery at the Veterinary Faculty in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Preoperative diagnosis was based on clinical signs, haematology results and ultrasonographic examination. Ovariohysterectomy was performed as final treatment. The study is aimed at the effects of pyometra syndrome on haemostatic functions {{as well as at the}} comparison between haemostatic functions and haematology and biochemistry results. Acute phase reaction with leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and hyperfibrinogenemia was identified preoperatively and up to 24 hours postoperatively. Changes in the haemostatic profile - prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, shortened thrombin time, increased concentration of D-dimeres and thrombocytopenia - which were confirmed in the study, suggest the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), most likely due to influence of E. coli endotoxin. The changes of haemostatic profile and concurrent acute phase reaction suggest the connection between inflammation and coagulopathy. Attention and early recognition of haemostatic function impairment should be addressed in pyometra syndrome patient in order to be able to timely substitute coagulation and anticoagulation factors with fresh blood, fresh or <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> or added heparin when appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} with congenital factor I deficiency associated with different clinical manifestations are described. Case 1 had one single episode of meningococcal disease, case 2 experienced four episodes of meningococcal disease {{and several other}} severe infections, whereas case 3, without known predisposition for infections, died from a subacute immune-complex mediated syndrome, resembling polyarteritis nodosa. Family studies in cases 1 and 2 revealed healthy individuals with factor I concentrations below the lower reference limit, indicating heterozygous carriers. The pedigree analyses were consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance. The estimated minimal frequency of the deficient gene was 0. 002. Pedigree analysis was not performed in case 3 but the father and sister {{was found to be}} probable heterozygous carriers. Cases 2 and 3 were treated with infusions of <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> (FFP) (40 and 27 ml/kg bodyweight) during acute illness and the immunochemical complement profile was monitored. Following plasma infusion factor I was cleared from the circulation with a half-life of 29 - 45 h. The plasma infusions induced generation of C 3 d and C 4 d, increase in native factor B and C 3 concentrations and disappearance of Ba split products. Native C 3 and C 4 increased to normal concentrations and remained normal till 16 days after the plasma infusions, whereas native factor B decreased to preinfusion levels 8 days after plasma infusion. It is concluded, that congenital factor I deficiency can present with different clinical manifestations and may be more prevalent than hitherto anticipated. Furthermore, infusion of blood products containing small amounts of functional factor I can partly normalize the complement profile, with a more prolonged effect on C 3 and C 4 than on factor B metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Human Papillomavirus (HPV) {{detection}} results comparing paraffin embedded cervical {{tissue and}} other cervical specimens {{have been done}} {{with varying degrees of}} agreement. However, studies comparing <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> specimens and paraffin embedded specimens of invasive cervical carcinomas are lacking. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare HPV detection using SPF 10 broad-spectrum primers PCR followed by DEIA and genotyping by LiPA 25 (version 1) between <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> cervical tissue samples and paraffin embedded blocks of cervical tissue from the same patient. There were 171 pairs of paraffin embedded and <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> samples analyzed from cervical carcinoma cases from Kampala, Uganda. Results 88. 9 % (95 % CI: 83. 2 %- 93. 2 %) of paraffin embedded samples were HPV positive compared with 90. 1 % (95 % CI: 84. 6 %- 94. 1 %) of <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> samples, giving an overall agreement in HPV detection between fresh tissue and paraffin embedded tissue at 86. 0 % (95 % CI: 79. 8 %- 90. 8 %). Although the proportion of HPV positive cases in <b>freshly</b> <b>frozen</b> tissue was higher than those in paraffin blocks, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). In both types of tissues, single HPV infections were predominant, with HPV 16 accounting for 47 % of positive cases. Comparison in the overall agreement, taking into accounts not only positivity in general, but also HPV types, showed a 65 % agreement (complete agreement of 59. 7 %, partial agreement of 5. 3 %) and complete disagreement of 35. 0 %. HPV detection in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and adenocarcinomas (ADC) was similar in fresh tissue or paraffin blocks (p ≥ 0. 05). p 16 immunostaining in samples that had at least one HPV negative results showed that 24 out of 25 cases had an over-expressed pattern. Conclusions HPV DNA detection was lower among ADC as compared to SCC. However, such differences were minimized when additional p 16 testing was added, suggesting that the technical issues may largely explain the HPV negative cases. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse and compare the {{activity}} of factor V, VIII and fibrinogen level in fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> and <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>frozen</b> after 8 hrs but within 24 hours after phlebotomy. Materials and Methods: Fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> separated from whole blood within 8 hours was compared with plasma separated within 24 hours after phlebotomy in terms of coagulation factors V and VIII and level of fibrinogen by standard methods using semi automated coagulometer sysmex CA 50. Results: Longer storage of whole blood before processing resulted in significant decrease (18. 4 %) in activity of factor VIII but the fall in activity of factor V (6. 52 %) or level of fibrinogen (1. 81 %) was not significant. Discussion: These data suggest that there is good retention of coagulation factors in both types of plasma. Although there is significant fall in activity of factor VIII, but it is an acute phase reactant and raised in most of the diseases so it is suggested that <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> would be an acceptable product for most patients requiring fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{patients}} with {{various types of}} chronic liver disease and a prothrombin time prolonged for four or more seconds who required needle liver biopsy for diagnostic purposes were given either fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> or a concentrate of clotting factors as a prophylactic measure. The prothrombin time returned to within normal limits in seven of the 15 patients given the concentrate and in three of those receiving fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma.</b> Levels of factors II, IX, and X showed increases of about 30 % following concentrate administration; corresponding rises in the group given fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> were less. This {{was because of the}} smaller quantity of clotting factors administered with fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> and the increase in factor II and IX activity/kg body weight/unit of clotting factor injected was greater when fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> was used. In neither group was there clinical evidence of bleeding, but it was of interest that most of the clotting factor levels, except in factor II, before biopsy were above those normally required for haemostasis. No evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was found with the concentrate injection, and the most worrying finding was the appearance of HBAg some months later in three patients, two from the concentrate group and one from those given fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma.</b> However, the conversion of these patients to HBAg positive may be unrelated to the clotting factor replacement therapy...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in general supportative measures, the mortality from acute pancreatitis in the United Kingdom, still approaches 10 %. Although many specific therapies have been proposed, none has consistently {{been shown to}} improve outcome in controlled clinical trials. Intravenous fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> has been advocated as a therapy for acute pancreatitis. It may supplement declining natural antiprotease capacity, particularly alpha 2 macroglobulin which {{appears to have a}} central role in the elimination of disseminated pancreatic enzymes in man. Initially, the effect of fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> therapy on survival in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis was studied. A rat model of acute pancreatitis was established including the facility for continuous intravenous infusion of fluid. Intravenous therapy including fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> significantly improved survival at 72 hours in the model when compared with crystalloid (p 0. 001) and colloid (p 0. 01) controls. Subsequently a controlled clinical trial was performed involving five hospitals over a twenty three month period. Two hundred and two patients admitted with acute pancreatitis were randomised to receive either low volume fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> therapy (two units daily for three days) or colloid control. The major serum antiproteases were measured during the course of the disease. There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in terms of clinical outcome. Serum alpha 2 macroglobulin levels were reduced in both groups on day one and continued to fall significantly Iron; day one to day three in the colloid control group (p 0. 005) whilst remaining substantially unaltered in patients receiving fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> (p = 0. 6527). The ability of relatively low volumes of fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> to supplement declining alpha 2, macroglobulin levels in the early stages of acute pancreatitis has therapeutic implications. The administration of larger volumes of fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> or alpha 2 macroglobulin concentrates may improve clinical outcome...|$|R

40|$|The {{early use}} of fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> as a {{resuscitative}} agent after hemorrhagic shock {{has been associated}} with improved survival, but the mechanism of protection is unknown. Hemorrhagic shock causes endothelial cell dysfunction and we hypothesized that fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> would restore endothelial integrity and reduce syndecan- 1 shedding after hemorrhagic shock. A prospective, observational study in severely injured patients in hemorrhagic shock demonstrated significantly elevated levels of syndecan- 1 (554 ± 93 ng/ml) after injury, which decreased with resuscitation (187 ± 36 ng/ml) but was elevated compared to normal donors (27 ± 1 ng/ml). Three pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferon-γ, fractalkine, and interleukin- 1 β, negatively correlated while one anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10, positively correlated with shed syndecan- 1. These cytokines all {{play an important role in}} maintaining endothelial integrity. An in vitro model of endothelial injury then specifically examined endothelial permeability after treatment with fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> orlactated Ringers. Shock or endothelial injury disrupted junctional integrity and increased permeability, which was improved with fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma,</b> but not lactated Ringers. Changes in endothelial cell permeability correlated with syndecan- 1 shedding. These data suggest that plasma based resuscitation preserved endothelial syndecan- 1 and maintained endothelial integrity, and may help to explain the protective effects of fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> after hemorrhagic shock...|$|R

Compared with control infants, infants with suspected infection had increased concentrations of C reactive protein, reduced concentrations of fibronectin, and increased concentrations of the complement activation marker C 3 d, but similar concentrations of IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA, and IgM.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of the administration of fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> after cardiopulmonary bypass on blood loss, transfusion requirements, and a number of coagulation parameters. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial 50 patients (mean age 63 years; 35 men/ 15 women) undergoing elective operation with cardiopulmonary bypass were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two groups: group I (n = 24) received 3 units of fresh <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> after operation and group II (n = 26) received an equal amount of Gelofusine plasma substitute.
