5000|$|Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times {{described}} Lorelai and Rory as [...] "unsentimental brainiacs" [...] who, if {{they could}} see Gilmore Girls, would hate its sentimentality of the last and final season. Also, the character talks fast and uses words to keep her [...] "loneliness at bay" [...] which, while opinion, {{seems to be a}} relatively insightful view of her. Lorelai feels that to [...] "swoon, even once," [...] would make her lose her verbal power and her [...] "reason for being." [...] On the characteristic of talking fast, Sherman-Palladino noted: [...] "Just by listening to Lorelai's vocal patterns, it says volumes about this woman: First of all, that she's bright enough to put that many words together that quickly... and it says a lot about her emotionally, that she's got a <b>deflection</b> <b>shield</b> that's sort of the way she gets through the world, which says survivor." [...] She also said of the character: [...] "Lorelai's humor was her guard and her deflection and what kept her strong. It was her Wonder Woman cuffs." ...|$|E
50|$|The player pilots the Skyfox, {{the most}} {{advanced}} attack fighter plane available to the fictional government, the Federation. The plane has armaments consisting of radar guided missiles, heat-seeking missiles, laser cannons and <b>deflection</b> <b>shields,</b> and has {{a top speed of}} Mach 4. Gameplay consists of finding and destroying enemy tanks, planes and motherships. The game has 15 scenarios that can be played at five skill levels.Featuring a view from the cockpit of the jet, this game is recognized as popularizing this view. The cockpit featured radar which showed incoming missiles and other threats. Flying above the clouds, the player fights hordes of enemy planes. Flying below them, the player is attacked by enemy tanks. Hailed upon its release, most criticisms of the game cited repetitive gameplay as the only drawback.|$|R
25|$|The Breton-Prétot {{machine was}} a saw {{designed}} {{to cut the}} barbed wire protecting enemy trenches of World War I. The first version consisted of a small circular saw, driven by a six hp engine, attached to a long lever that was placed on a small cart with four wheels, {{that had to be}} pushed towards its objective. Breton proposed the machine to the French government in November 1914 and a prototype was tried in January 1915, when it was shown that the system in this form had little practicality. The use of caterpillar tracks was discussed that same month, but since none was available at that time, the system was then mounted at Liancourt {{on the back of a}} Bajac tractor in an attempt to obtain all-terrain mobility, towards the end of February 1915. The small circular saw was replaced by a large vertical saw with thirteen teeth, but a larger horizontal circular saw was added, just above ground level to cut the barbed-wire poles. In July the system was again changed, the horizontal saw being left out and large <b>deflection</b> <b>shields</b> being placed to protect the wheels. Eight small bronze cannon were used as simulation weights.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIf mankind is {{to explore}} the solar system beyond the {{confines}} of our Earth and Moon the problem of radiation protection must be addressed. Galactic cosmic rays and highly variable energetic solar particles are an ever-present hazard in interplanetary space. Electric and/or magnetic fields have been suggested as <b>deflection</b> <b>shields</b> in the past, but these treated space as an empty vacuum. In fact it is not empty. Space contains a plasma known as the solar wind; a constant flow of protons and electrons coming from the Sun. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of a “mini-magnetosphere” acting as a radiation protection shield. We explicitly include the plasma physics necessary to account for the solar wind and its induced effects. We show that, by capturing/containing this plasma, we enhance the effectiveness of the shield. Further evidence to support our conclusions can be obtained from studying naturally occurring “mini-magnetospheres” on the Moon. These magnetic anomalies (related to “lunar swirls”) exhibit many of the effects seen in laboratory experiments and computer simulations. If shown to be feasible, this technology could become the gateway to manned exploration of interplanetary space...|$|R

40|$|The ceramic yttria-stabilized tetragonal {{zirconia}} polycrystal (Y-TZP) {{has been}} used as a dental biomaterial for several decades. The strength and toughness of this material can be accounted for by its toughening mechanisms, which include transformation toughening, crack <b>deflection,</b> zone <b>shielding,</b> contact shielding, and crack bridging. Prevention of crack propagation is of critical importance in high-fatigue situations, such as those encountered in mastication and para-function. However, the poor translucence of Y-TZP in polycrystalline form is such that it may not meet the aesthetic requirements due to its white/grey appearance. To improve the optical properties of Y-TZP, more detailed study of the optical properties is required; in particular, precise evaluation of the refractive index, absorption coefficient, and scattering coefficient are necessary. The measurement of the optical parameters has been based on the assumption that light scattered from biological media is isotropically distributed over all angles. In fact, the optical behavior of real biological materials depends on the angular scattering of light due to the anisotropic nature of the materials. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the optical properties (including color, opacity/translucence, scattering, and fluorescence) of zirconia dental ceramics and their control through modification of the chemical composition, phase composition, and surface microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of aluminium}} piston alloys comprises primary and eutectic silicon together with numerous intermetallics. Previous {{research has shown}} that primary silicon strongly influences both fatigue crack initiation and subsequent propagation behaviour, however, the detailed effects of varying silicon volume fraction and morphology have not been fully addressed. Therefore, the fatigue properties of a number of candidate piston alloys with varying volume fractions of silicon have been studied. Long crack fatigue tests have been performed at room and elevated temperature typical of the gudgeon pin boss (200 8 C) using a test frequency of 15 Hz (a typical engine frequency at engine idle condition). Microstructural characterisation using image analysis approaches combined with optical profilometry has been used to assess the fracture surfaces of test samples. The role of primary Si in enhancing crack growth rates at high DK levels, whilst affording improvements in crack growth rates at lower DK levels due to local crack <b>deflections</b> and <b>shielding,</b> has been confirmed. In the absence of primary Si (lower Si content alloys) the low DK level crack growth behaviour is dominated by matrix properties (intra-dendritic crack growth pre-dominates) whilst the high DK level crack growth behaviour is inter-dendritic and occurs along the weak path of the eutectic Si and/or intermetallic network...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a new deflection structure which deflects {{a beam of}} charged particles, such as {{an electron}} beam, includes a serpentine set for transmitting a <b>deflection</b> field, and <b>shielding</b> frame for housing the serpentine set. The serpentine set includes a vertical serpentine deflection element and a horizontal serpentine deflection element. These deflection elements are identical and are interdigitatedly and orthogonally disposed relative to each other, for forming a central transmission passage, through which the electron beam passes and is deflected by the deflection field to minimize drift space signal distortion. The shielding frame includes a plurality of ground blocks and forms an internal serpentine trough within these ground blocks for housing the serpentine set. The deflection structure further includes a plurality of feedthrough connectors which are inserted through the shielding frame and which are electrically connected to the serpentine set...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} thermoplastic particle interlayer toughening effect on compression strength after impact (CAI) and damage resistance under quasi-static concentrated force, both non-interleaved and interleaved specimens of {{three types of}} carbon-fiber epoxy composites, HT 7 / 5228, HT 3 /NY 9200 G, and HT 3 / 5224, are fabricated. Mode II fracture toughness test and quasi-static indentation (QSI) test are conducted. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} interlayer zones formed by particles and matrix can significantly suppress delamination; mode II delamination resistance and damage resistance are significantly enhanced. The interleaved specimen can achieve small damage area at the expense of greater indent depth in local region. The toughening mechanisms are chiefly as follows: geometrical effect of interlayer, crack path <b>deflection,</b> and crack-tip <b>shielding.</b> Furthermore, a large amount of energy is absorbed by ductile deformation and ultimate failure of thermoplastic particles.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of relatively portable, transparent shields for protecting personnel was evaluated for the unintentional reaction of explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics {{in a laboratory}} setting. Measurements of blast overpressure, heat flux, and temperature were made at the head positions of a sitting operator, a standing operator, and a standing observer with the energetic materials placed at a comfortable position for hands-on operations {{on the other side}} of the shield. High-speed and video photography showed <b>shield</b> <b>deflection</b> from blast and the position of the most intense heat from detonating and burning energetic materials. After each test the shield was photographed and evaluated for fragment penetration, charring, and structural damage. Up to 11. 7 g of explosive was detonated to simulate the probable event when handling primary explosives and the maximum event that could occur when handling secondary explosives. An explosive powder, a pyrotechnic, and a composite propellant (up to 244 g) were ignited and burned to simulate many of the incidents that could occur when handling unconfined energetic materials, except for primary explosives. The propelling charge in a 12 -gauge shotshell, containing an 8 g cylinder of explosive instead of lead shot...|$|R
40|$|Regardless of its {{successful}} clinical applications, load-bearing implant {{applications of}} hydroxyapatite (HA) remain problematic {{due to its}} intrinsic property limitations. Recent findings of the promising biocompatibility of graphene imply the possibilities of it being potentially used as additives for HA-based composites with enhanced mechanical properties. Here we report HA–reduced graphite oxide nanocomposites synthesized by a liquid precipitation approach followed by spark plasma sintering consolidation. The reduced graphite oxide (rGO) consisted of 2 – 6 layers of graphene. Rod-like HA grains with the dimensions of 9 nm in diameter and 20 – 45 nm in length exhibited oriented nucleation and epitaxial growth on graphene flakes. The (300) plane of HA crystals formed a coherent interfacial bond with the graphene wall and {{the section of the}} graphene sheet built a strong interface with the (002) plane of HA crystals. These structural features gave rise to enhanced densification and precluded grain growth of HA in the spark plasma sintered pellets. Fracture toughness of the HA–rGO composites reached 3. 94 MPa m 1 / 2, showing a 203 % increase compared to pure HA. Crack <b>deflection,</b> crack tip <b>shielding</b> and crack bridging at the HA–rGO interfaces were disclosed as the major strengthening regimes in the composites. The enhanced mechanical properties together with the improved proliferation and ALP activity of the human osteoblast cells suggest a great potential of the composites for biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{environmental}} concerns encourage the cement industry {{to improve its}} environmental performance, which in turn renews the interest in clinker grinding efficiency. Current knowledge on clinker grinding was built over the past decades, but contributions from fracture mechanics remained limited. This research aimed to contribute to this field by investigating industrial clinkers with innovative techniques such as multiscale microscratching and statistical electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA). Microstructure investigations were first performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and three characteristic length scales were defined for clinkers: the nodules at the macroscale, the clinker matrix and porosity at the intermediate scale, and the clinker phases at the microscale. A statistical EPMA method was developed to allow simultaneous determination of the clinker bulk chemistry, the chemistry of the clinker phases, and their abundance. The microscratch test method was downscaled to measure the fracture properties at each characteristic scale of clinkers. Measurements on single silicate grains provided access to the intrinsic fracture toughness, which was three to four time lower than the macroscale fracture toughness. A combination of microstructure effects and toughening mechanisms (crack <b>deflection,</b> crack tip <b>shielding</b> by microcracks, crack trapping, and crack pinning) explained this behavior. Comparison of industrial clinkers showed that higher macroscale toughness (i. e., poor coarse grindability) was associated with oversized alite crystals, which was explained by the increase of microcracks toughening with larger grain size. In contrast, lower macroscale fracture toughness (i. e., better coarse grindability) was associated with either poorly burned clinkers showing excessive porosity or well burned clinkers having a good repartition of small silicates. However, difficulties in fine grinding were expected for the poorly burned clinkers because of the increased amounts of clustered belite. Overall, this thesis presents new experimental methods to investigate clinkers, as well as links between clinkers properties and grindability, both of which hold interest to the scientific community and the cement industry. by William Wilson.
