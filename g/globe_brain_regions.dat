40|$|Diversity in {{vertebrate}} brain {{size and}} composition {{is thought to}} arise from either developmental constraints that cause coordinated changes between <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> or a mosaic model, whereby changes in individual <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> are independent of changes in other <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> These two mechanisms were tested in birds using multiple regression analyses. Across 13 orders, significant correlations were present between some <b>brain</b> <b>regions,</b> but not all. Most of the correlated changes reflect the connectivity between different brain components, such that regions with the most interconnections are correlated with one another but not other <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> Whether mosaic changes are characteristic of <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> or systems in birds, however, to our knowledge, remains to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Exploring {{functional}} {{interactions among}} various <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> is helpful {{for understanding the}} pathological underpinnings of neurological disorders. Brain networks provide an important representation of those functional interactions, and thus are widely applied in the diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative diseases. Many mental disorders involve {{a sharp decline in}} cognitive ability as a major symptom, which can be caused by abnormal connectivity patterns among several <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> However, conventional functional connectivity networks are usually constructed based on pairwise correlations among different <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> This approach ignores higher-order relationships, and cannot effectively characterize the high-order interactions of many <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> working together. Recent neuroscience research suggests that higher-order relationships between <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> are important for brain network analysis. Hyper-networks have been proposed that can effectively represent the interactions among <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> However, this method extracts the local properties of <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> as features, but ignores the global topology information, which affects the evaluation of network topology and reduces the performance of the classifier. This problem can be compensated by a subgraph feature-based method, but it is not sensitive to change in a single <b>brain</b> <b>region.</b> Considering that both of these feature extraction methods result in the loss of information, we propose a novel machine learning classification method that combines multiple features of a hyper-network based on functional magnetic resonance imaging in Alzheimer's disease. The method combines the <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> features and subgraph features, and then uses a multi-kernel SVM for classification. This retains not only the global topological information, but also the sensitivity to change in a single <b>brain</b> <b>region.</b> To certify the proposed method, 28 normal control subjects and 38 Alzheimer's disease patients were selected to participate in an experiment. The proposed method achieved satisfactory classification accuracy, with an average of 91. 60...|$|R

40|$|Diet-induced obesity (DIO) {{resulting}} from consumption {{of a high}} fat diet (HFD) attenuates normal neuronal responses to leptin and {{may contribute to the}} metabolic defense of an acquired higher body weight in humans; the molecular bases for the persistence of this defense are unknown. We measured the responses of 23 <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> to exogenous leptin in 4 different groups of weight- and/or diet-perturbed mice. Responses to leptin were assessed by quantifying pSTAT 3 levels in brain nuclei 30 minutes following 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal leptin. HFD attenuated leptin sensing throughout the brain, but weight loss did not restore central leptin signaling to control levels in several <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> important in energy homeostasis, including the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei. Effects of diet on leptin signaling varied by <b>brain</b> <b>region,</b> with results dependent on the method of weight loss (restriction of calories of HFD, ad lib intake of standard mouse chow). High fat diet attenuates leptin signaling throughout the brain, but some <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> maintain their ability to sense leptin.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} posterior <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> related to task-relevant stimulus processing in task preparation, we used a cued task-switching paradigm in which a pre-cue informed participants about the upcoming task on a trial: face discrimination or number comparison. Employing an event-related fMRI design, we examined for changes of activity in face- and number-related posterior <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> (right fusiform face area (FFA) and right intraparietal sulcus (IPSnum), respectively), and explored the functional connectivity of these areas with other <b>brain</b> <b>regions,</b> during the (preparation) interval between cue onset and onset of the (to-be-responded) target stimulus. The results revealed task-relevant posterior <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> to be modulated during this period: activation in task-relevant stimulus-specific regions was selectively enhanced and their functional connectivity to task-relevant anterior <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> strengthened (right FFA – face task, right IPSnum – number task) while participants prepared for the cued task. Additionally, activity in task-relevant posterior <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> was influenced by residual activation from the preceding trial in the right FFA and the right IPSnum, respectively.

However, if the reward is related like the above roulette, which <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> are activated when we win or lose the game? "Win" means the reward, and "lose" means no reward.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There {{is a lack}} of {{information}} with regard to normal metabolic ratios acquired with MR spectroscopy utilizing a long echo time technique. Our purpose was to measure metabolic ratios in healthy adults to determine whether the metabolites varied across <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> and by sex. METHODS: Single voxel proton spectra were acquired with an echo time of 135 milliseconds in 10 <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> of 72 healthy subjects ranging in age from 20 to 44 years. Six gray matter sites in the cerebrum included four cortical areas in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, and two deep nuclear sites in the basal ganglia and the thalamus. Two subcortical white matter regions were in the parietal and the frontal lobes. Two posterior fossa sites included the pons and the cerebellum. All 10 <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> were not studied in each subject. For each spectrum, the metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and choline (Ch) were identified and ratios of NAA/Cr and Ch/Cr calculated for each <b>brain</b> <b>region.</b> A multifactorial analysis of variance was performed with the two metabolic ratios as dependent variables and with <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> and sex as independent variables.

To understand the possible physiological roles of these rhythm-related genes, we examined expression of these genes in different <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> at various time points in male Sprague [...] Dawley rats. Using semi quantitative in situ hybridization with 35 S-riboprobes to evaluate mRNA levels, the diurnal rhythmicity of rPer 1, and rPer 2 mRNA levels was found in the SCN, arcuate nucleus, and median eminence/pars tuberalis. Expression patterns of mRNA for rPer 1 and rPer 2, however, were not similar in these <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> The rhythmicity in these <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> was specific, because it was not observed in the cerebellum or hippocampus. Moreover, diurnal changes in rClock mRNA expression were not detected in any of the <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> examined.

Twenty healthy volunteers (ten females) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging in resting conditions. Half an hour after scanning, we administered thermal pain on the back of their right hand and collected pain and relief ratings in two separate runs of twelve stimuli each. Across the whole group, mean pain ratings were associated with decreased connectivity at rest between <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> belonging to the default mode and the visual resting-state network.
