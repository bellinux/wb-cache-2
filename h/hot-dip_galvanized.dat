50|$|<b>Hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> {{surfaces}} are not generally {{tested in a}} salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). Hot-dip galvanizing produces zinc carbonates when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate. The zinc carbonates are not produced when a <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> specimen is exposed to a salt spray fog, therefore this testing method does not give an accurate measurement of corrosion protection. ISO 9223 gives the guidelines for proper measurement of corrosion resistance for <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> specimens.|$|E
