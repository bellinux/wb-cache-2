40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} the EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{to perform a}} pest categorisation of Atropellis spp., the fungal pathogens responsible for causing cankers in several Pinus species. The pathogens are listed in Annex IIAI of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. The pathogens {{have been identified as}} A. apiculata, A. pinicola, A. piniphila and A. tingens. Detection, identification and differentiation of Atropellis species is based on their morphological and cultural characteristics. A. apiculata is present in North Carolina and Virginia (USA), and A. pinicola, A. piniphila and A. tingens are present in Canada and the USA. Atropellis spp. are not known to occur in the EU Member States so far. Several Pinus species have been reported to be hosts of Atropellis spp., with some of them being present in the EU Member States. However, the susceptibility to infection with these pathogens of pine species native to Europe and Eurasia, such as Pinus brutia, P. cembra, P. mugo, P. peuce, P. pinaster and P. sibiricais not yet known. There are no obvious eco-climatic factors limiting the potential establishment and spread of the pathogens in the risk assessment area. The pathogens can spread over short distances by ascospores that are dispersed primarily by wind and secondarily by rain. Spread of Atropellis spp. over long distances may occur by means of movement of infected host plants for planting (especially asymptomatic), cut branches, and wood or <b>isolated</b> <b>bark.</b> Control methods used against Atropellis spp. include cultural practices and sanitary measures. No chemical control measures, resistant host genotypes or biological control measures exist. Potential consequences of the damage caused by Atropellis spp. include malformation of the trees resulting in lower wood quality or tree marketability...|$|E

40|$|Two {{inoculation}} {{techniques were}} applied to investigate the effects of season and isolate variability on apple rootstocks in response to Phytophthora cactorum infection. Shoots of rootstocks MM 106 and MM 109 were inoculated in vitro with a single P. cactorum isolate once a month for 26 months. Rootstock susceptibility measured as lesion lengths generally cycled to a low level during dormancy in winter and to a high level during active growth in summer. Direct inoculation on excised stems {{was used to assess}} the relative aggressiveness of P. cactorum <b>isolates.</b> <b>Bark</b> was removed and stems were inoculated with mycelial discs of various P. cactorum isolates. Rootstock × isolate interactions complicated this evaluation, causing variable results. However, differences in relative aggressiveness of isolates were apparent during the dormant stage of apple stems. It was shown that the season during which evaluation was performed and variation of isolate aggressiveness affected the host reaction to P. cactorum infection. © Australasian Plant Pathology Society 2007.
