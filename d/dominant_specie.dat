The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the differences appearing in the use of different vegetation measurement methods (i. e. loop, transect, wheel point (WP) and modified wheel point (MWP). It was also aimed to determine the optimum number of sample for each method, and to improve the arrangements to compare the data from different methods on the same vegetation. The data were collected from 60 lines. Regression formulas were generated regarding canopy coverage ratios. In all methods, it was observed that grass family made up of an important part of the whole vegetation while the Festuca ovina was <b>dominant</b> <b>specie.</b> Other families and legumes followed in diminishing order. The difference between the methods was found to be statistically significant (p< 0, 01). In all methods the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> had the contagious distribution. It was found that 55 - 30, 55 - 35, 55 - 25 and 50 - 45 samples should be collected for loop, transect, WP and MWP methods respectively in order to determine the condition of the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> in the vegetation with the deviation of 5 and 10 per cent. Rangeland quality degree was found to be 3, 45; 4, 44; 3, 49 and 3, 08 for loop, transect, WP and MWP methods respectively.

The results confirm the major tenets of polar wind theories; namely, that an upward flow of both H(+) and He(+) ions exists at all times over the entire polar region; H(+) fluxes are of the order of 10 to the 8 th ions/sq cm s in both summer and winter polar regions. O(+) is the <b>dominant</b> ion <b>specie</b> at 1400 -km altitude in regions of strong H(+) flows, and H(+) is depleted over the entire region where the polar wind flows. H(+) fluxes tend to be lower in winter than in summer, whereas He(+) fluxes are a factor of 10 higher in winter and tend to follow the neutral helium concentration near the F 2 maximum. The latter agree well with model calculations of flux in the winter but lie above the model values by a factor of 2 in the summer. H(+) fluxes also agree well with ion flow models...|$|R
30|$|The {{ability of}} the {{chemicals}} to sustain microbial respiration {{in the presence of}} toxicity was significant at the lower concentrations, with the exception of 4, 7 -phen; differences in N-atom position and/or sensitivity of micro-organisms to the chemicals may be attributable. Thiele-Bruhn and Beck (2005) reported that shifts in microbial community structure could compensate for effects on species, in which case the tolerance of the <b>dominant</b> microbial <b>specie</b> determines the respiration. It is possible that at the lowest concentration, the microbes may be compensated by a higher C turnover and so lead to a gradual change in viability. However, at much higher concentrations, the contaminants caused inhibitions, cell death and disruptions in the normal functioning of the microbial community. Further, the higher CFUs observed in phenanthrene amended soils than the N-PAH soils (in this study), may be attributed to biodegradation and/or adaptation to toxicity. For example, it has been reported that when a chemical is added to soil, the microorganisms may have different responses: some may lyse, while others may be resistant to the pollutant thereby resulting in an increase in cell numbers because of reduced competition. In this current study, however, it may be that stress due to nutrient deficits caused the microbial populations to become vulnerable to the toxic chemicals (Gong et al. 2000).|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to isolate, characterized and identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in spontaneous fermentation of Cucumber. Cucumber samples were purchased from a vegetable stand in Watt market, Cross River State, Nigeria. They were fermented spontaneously for 7 days in 7 % brine solution and samples were taken at 24 h intervals for LAB analysis. Thirty bacterial strains were isolated from different phases of the fermentation of cucumber and were characterized by the API 50 CHL System of identification. Three lactic acid bacteria species were identified and included Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus pentosus. After 24 h fermentation, Leuconostoc mesenteroides was isolated as the <b>dominant</b> LAB <b>specie</b> of the fermentation period. This trend continued until the fourth day where Lactobacillus plantarum became the dominant LAB isolate in the fermenting cucumber. As the fermentation proceeded, Lactobacillus pentosus, was then involved. The results also revealed a decrease in the occurrence of Leuconostoc mesenteroides as the fermentation period increases. The present research thus shows the presence of LAB at different phases of fermenting cucumber.

Results: Most of sampled animals in this area were infested. We also encountered with a wild goat (Capra hircus aegagrus) in Kolah Qazi national park in this part that was infested intensively by Boophilus kohlsi. Fifteen ixodid tick species were identified over the study period from cattle, sheep and domestic and wild goats namely B. kohlsi (3. 6 %) Rhipicephalus sanguineus (4. 5 %), Rh. bursa (21. 9 %), Rh. turanicus (2. 9 %), Dermacentor niveus (12. 9 %), D. raskemensis (4. 1 %), D. marginatus (7. 3 %), Haemaphysalis punctata (3. 5 %), H.

Four vertical tillage treatments with three repeats were evaluated: two with rigid chisel, 30 cm - 60 cm and two with grassland renovator, horizontal distance 30 and 60 cm, and 30 cm depth. Two levels of fertilization were evaluated: F 1 : 300 kg ha- 1 of DAP (18 % N - 46 % P 2 O 5), 200 kg ha- 1 of KCl (60 % K 2 O) and 150 kg ha- 1 of urea (46 % N) and F 2 : 50 % of the previous described treatment. In a split plot design experiment, the effect of vertical tillage and fertilization during 18 months over soil density, penetration resistance and root biomass growth were tested by ANOVA and average Duncan comparison. No independent effect of tillage or fertilization on grasses was observed, but there are significant interaction between tillage and grasses, fertilization and grasses and tillagefertilization and grasses. It is concluded that differences in the variables soil density, penetration resistance and root biomass were due to grazing effect and tillage-fertilization-grass interaction...|$|R
40|$|Atomic Oxygen is the <b>dominant</b> {{atmospheric}} <b>specie</b> at low {{earth orbit}} altitudes for spacecraft orbiting the earth. This altitude range of atomic oxygen dominance extends from 120 km to 900 km. Other species such as helium, molecular oxygen and nitrogen make {{up the bulk of}} the rest with the densities corresponding to high to ultrahigh vacuum levels. Spacecraft orbiting at this altitude need to travel at a velocity of 8 km/sec to maintain orbit and therefore spacecraft encounter a high fluence of impinging rarefied atmosphere in a short time period. This gas-surface interaction has several effects which affect the space vehicle. They include aerodynamic drag, surface reaction and surface glow. The need to model these effects on spacecraft surfaces has resulted in the design, development and construction of an advanced facility to simulate these L. E. O. atmospheric effects. This facility utilizing an arc heated source can produce high energy species of the common atmospheric species at a velocity of up to 4. 5 km/sec with fluxes comparable to orbit. This particular type of source is unique in Europe with two similar types reported in the U. S. A. Considerable effort was expended in optimizing the source for atomic oxygen production via beam characterization and stagnation condition measurement. This has enabled the radial and axial temperature profiles in the source to be deduced, thus providing a clearer idea of the processes in the source and therefore benefits future users of this technique. In addition, alternative routes of producing atomic oxygen were pursued via nitrous oxide and nitrous oxide/nitrogen seeding. Extensive work on developing reliable beam characterization equipment resulted in the comparison of two methods of beam analysis. This involved {{the development of a new}} method of beam mass/energy analysis, which has several advantages over current instruments. Conclusions are made on the suitability of mass spectroscopic detection of reactive specie beams. Finally, atomic oxygen degradation tests were pursued on a variety of surfaces including the polyimide Kapton-H. It was concluded from these tests that Kapton-H erosion has a form of energy dependence, with an energy threshold to erosion of approximately 0. 5 eV. The erosion rate above this energy rises rapidly to rates comparable to those of orbit. The Southampton results agree reasonably with the very few results on Kapton-H in this energy range.

40|$|Kikuyu is well {{adapted to}} the main milk {{producing}} areas of the Southern Cape region of South Africa. The strategic incorporation {{of different types of}} temperate grasses into kikuyu pastures can increase the seasonal dry matter production, pasture quality, and milk production attainable from these pastures. To determine whether there is production and economical differences between kikuyu based pasture systems, a trial was conducted on the Outeniqua Research Farm near George. The three pasture treatments, namely italian, westerwold, and perennial ryegrass over-sown into kikuyu, were tested. Forty-five Jersey cows were blocked and cows within blocks were randomly allocated to the treatments. The cows received 9 kilograms of pasture (on a dry matter basis) per cow per day, and four kilograms of concentrate per cow per day. Milk production was recorded daily, and milk composition was determined monthly. The cows were weighed and body condition scored monthly. The perennial ryegrass pasture treatment had a higher milk production per hectare (32288 kg/ha) than the westerwold ryegrass pasture treatment (29761 kg/ha) but did not differ from the italian ryegrass pasture treatment (30446 kg/ha). The italian ryegrass pasture treatment had a higher milk protein percentage than the perennial ryegrass pasture treatment (3. 84 % vs. 3. 64 %) but did not differ from the westerwold ryegrass pasture treatment (3. 75 %). When the three pasture treatments were economically compared, the italian ryegrass pasture treatment had the highest margin over specified costs per hectare (R 36, 565. 03), followed by the perennial (R 33, 889. 14) and westerwold (R 29, 468. 09) ryegrass pasture treatments. From the results it seems that the italian ryegrass pasture treatment is the best choice for a kikuyu based pasture system in the Southern Cape region of South Africa. A high level of concentrate supplementation could increase energy intake of grazing dairy cows, but might also reduce fibre digestion within the rumens of high producing dairy cows. To test this hypothesis, two trials were conducted, one during October and November 2007, and the other during March 2008. In both trials twelve rumen cannulated cows were allocated to four groups. Two groups were allocated to each pasture treatment, namely perennial and westerwold ryegrass over-sown into kikuyu. Within each pasture treatment, one group received 4 kg of concentrate per cow per day, and the other 8 kg of concentrate per day. Pasture was allocated at 9 kg per day (DM). Cows were adapted for ten days, after which ruminal pH, and ammonia nitrogen and volatile fatty acid concentration data was collected. An in sacco study was conducted to determine the neutral detergent fibre degradability. After the data was collected, the two groups within each pasture treatment swapped concentrate levels; were adapted, and the same data as described above was collected. During both trials reductions in ruminal pH were observed when a higher amount of concentrate was supplemented. During the first trial there was {{a significant increase in the}} time that the ruminal pH remained below pH 5. 8 on the westerwold ryegrass pasture treatment (from 80 minutes when the cows received 4 kg of concentrate per day, to 375 minutes when it was increased to 8 kg of concentrate per day). A decrease in neutral detergent fibre degradability was also seen. During the second trial, the percentage of NDF disappearance decreased from 8. 45 % over a twelve hour period when 4 kg of concentrate was fed, to 4. 51 % when 8 kg of concentrate was fed on the perennial ryegrass pasture treatment. From the results it appears that feeding a higher level of concentrate supplementation to high producing dairy cows grazing kikuyu pasture systems has a negative effect on neutral detergent fibre digestion within the rumen. It appears that feeding a moderate level of concentrate supplementation when cows are on pasture based systems is more beneficial to the rumen environment and decreases the possibility of sub-clinical ruminal acidosis when cows grazed ryegrass dominant pastures, but had a less pronounced effect when the <b>dominant</b> pasture <b>specie</b> was kikuyu. Future research could examine the relationship between the level of concentrate supplementation and pasture specie more closely, as it would be interesting to find the optimal ratios for each pasture specie.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a coupled model for the analysis of a novel polymer/metal composite (IPMC) actuator under large external voltage. A general continuum model describing the transport and deformation processes of solid polymer electrolyte is proposed. The formulation is based on global integral postulates for the mass conservation, charge conservation, momentum equilibrium, the first law of thermodynamics, and the second law of thermodynamics. The global equations are localized in the volume and on the material surfaces bounding the polymer. The model is simplified to a three-component system comprised of a fixed negatively charged polymeric matrix, protons, and free water molecules within the polymer matrix. Among these species, water molecules are considered as the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> responsible for the deformation of the IPMC actuators. In this work, the electrochemical process occurring at both electrodes is analyzed as boundary conditions during the deformation of actuator in the regime of large voltage (over 1. 2 V). These are used in the framework of overpotential theory to develop boundary conditions for the water transport in the bulk of polymer. The proposed coupled model successfully captures the stress relaxation phenomenon due to water redistribution governed by diffusion. The fabrication process are described, and experiments including the role of initial water content on the electro-mechanical response of the actuator are also discussed. Comparison of simulations and experimental data showed good agreement...|$|E

The air stream was characterized by a very high variability of the inlet concentrations of toluene (range: 4. 35 - 68. 20 mg Nm- 3) with an average concentrations of 16. 41 mg Nm- 3. The pilot plant has proved its effectiveness in toluene removal, along a 90 days experimentation period, in steady-state conditions. The scrubbing pre-treatment has achieved an average removal efficiency of 69. 9 %, but in particular it has proven its suitability in the rough removal of the toluene peak concentrations, allowing a great stability to the following biological process. The biotrickling stage has achieved an additional average removal efficiency of 75. 6 %, confirming the good biodegradability of toluene. The biofilm observation by a scanning confocal laser microscope has evidenced a biofilm thickness of 650 µm fully penetrated by toluene degrading bacteria. Among the micro-population Pseudomonas putida resulted the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie.</b> This bacterium can therefore be considered the responsible for most of the toluene degradation.

We expected a reduction in germination and seedling establishment in R radiata plantations, due to documented allelopathic inhibition. We only found differences in germination probabilities during the 2001 / 2002 period, whereas seedling establishment did not vary. In addition, in the laboratory we found that watering with leachate from P. radiata plantations produced an equivalent reduction in C. alba seed germination when compared with watering with native forest litter leachate. We did not find allelopathic effects on seedling survival nor growth. P. radiata plantations might be a suitable habitat where, in some years, C. alba can regenerate. P radiata plantations should be incorporated in the conservation scenario of the Maulino Forest plant species, introducing new procedures to reduce the impact of forest replacement on native plant dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTo highlight in a qualitative manner the kinetics of an excimer laser, a simple computer model for calculating the species populations in a KrF laser cavity is developed; subsequently {{a computer program}} originally developed at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is modified to calculate the population of different electronic configurations of excited neon present in a XeF laser. When modified, the NRL program accounts for 185 reactions and requires 9. 5 minutes of CPU time using the IBM 360 - 67. The populations obtained are applied to the calculation of the index of refraction in the laser cavity. the phase shift is determined per unit length for the two laser wavelengths; one laser wavelength is non-resonance with neon {{and the other is}} at resonance. Neon is the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> relative to concentration and within the population distribution the neon ground state dominates by a factor of a million. The calculations show that the ground state neon determines the index of refraction; an exception occurs if the laser wavelength is near resonance to any of the transitions in the 3 s. 4 p array.

40|$|Biological pre- and postharvest {{disease control}} {{strategies}} depend on successful colonisation and {{survival of the}} introduced antagonists on the infection court. Effective and economical applications involve targeting the antagonists where they are critically needed i. e. the infection court. Honeybee dispersal is one method of antagonist application to such specific sites. In view of this, an in vitro experiment was conducted to investigate attachment, colonisation and survival of Bacillus subtilis on avocado flowers. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed that the bacterium could attach and colonise avocado flower surfaces. It can also survive on the flowers {{for longer periods of}} time. In vivo mode of action of the antagonist against stem-end rot (SER) pathogens was also studied where results showed lysis and degradation of hyphae and conidia. However, no viable colonies were retrieved from bee antagonist dispersal under field conditions. Bee antagonist dissemination was compared with antagonist and fungicide spray applications in terms of SER control and the added effect on other diseases such as Cercospora spot and anthracnose. Spray applications of the antagonist were more effective in reducing the incidence of SER than bee dissemination. Integrated sprays of the antagonist and fungicides significantly reduced the incidence of both pre- and postharvest diseases. The identity of Dothiorella aromatica, {{one of the most important}} SER pathogens, was investigated at a molecular level. RAPD techniques using the discriminatory OPC 02 primer successfully separated isolates into three groups based on banding profiles. A further study using RFLP identified the pathogen as a Botryosphaeria spp. The most <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> was B. parva followed by B. rhodina. Further studies should focus on assessing the distribution of these pathogens within avocado-growing regions of South Africa. Dissertation (MSc (Plant Pathology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|Dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblages {{have been}} widely used over the Arctic Ocean to {{reconstruct}} sea-surface parameters on a quantitative basis. Such reconstructions provide insights into the role of anthropogenic vs natural forcings in the actual climatic trend. Here, we present the palynological analysis of a 36 cm-long core collected from the Mackenzie Through in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Dinocyst assemblages were used to quantitatively reconstruct the evolution of sea surface conditions (temperature, salinity, sea ice) and freshwater palynomorphs influxes were used as local paleo-river discharge indicators over the last ~ 150 yr. Dinocyst assemblages are dominated by autotrophic taxa (68 to 96 %). Pentapharsodinium dalei is the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> throughout most of the core, except at the top where the assemblages are dominated by Operculodinium centrocarpum. Quantitative reconstructions of sea surface parameters display a serie of relatively warm, lower sea ice and saline episodes in surface waters, alternately with relatively cool and low salinity episodes. The warm episodes are characterized with high dinocyst productivity. Variations of dinocyst influxes and reconstructed sea surface conditions are closely linked to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and to a lesser degree, the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Positive phases of the PDO correspond to increases of dinocyst influxes, warmer and saltier surface waters, which we associate with upwelling events of warm and relatively saline water from Pacific origin. Freshwater palynomorph influxes increased in three phases from AD 1857 until reaching maximum values in AD 1991, suggesting that the Mackenzie River discharge followed the same trend when its discharge peaked between AD 1989 and AD 1992. The PDO mode seems to dominate the climatic variations at multi-annual to decadal timescales in the Western Canadian Arctic and Beaufort Sea areas...|$|E
40|$|Another mock bank note parodying the "shinplasters" of the 1837 panic. Such {{small-denomination}} {{notes were}} based on the division of the Spanish dollar, the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> of the time. Hence they were issued in sums of 6 (more accurately 6 1 / 4), 25, 50, and 75 cents. These fractional notes proliferated during the Panic of 1837 with the emergency suspension of specie (i. e., money in coin) payments by New York banks on May 10 of that year. "Treasury Note" and "Fifty Cents Shin Plaster" (nos. 1837 - 9 and - 11) also use the bank note format to comment on the dismal state of American finances. Unlike these, however, "Humbug Glory Bank" is actually the same size as a real note. The note is payable to "Tumble Bug Benton," Missouri senator and hard-money advocate Thomas Hart Benton, and is signed by "Cunning Reuben [Whitney, anti-Bank adviser to Jackson and Van Buren] Cash'r" and "Honest Amos [Kendall, Postmaster General and influential advisor to Van Buren] Pres't. " It shows several coins with the head of Andrew Jackson at left, a jackass with the title "Roman Firmness," a hickory leaf (alluding to Jackson's nickname "Old Hickory"), and a vignette showing Jackson's hat, clay pipe, spectacles, hickory stick, and veto (of the 1832 bill to recharter the Bank of the United States) in a blaze of light.

40|$|The {{population}} of mysid Metamysidopsis sp. nov. 4 b {{has been studied}} in the sandy beach of San Pedro village in the Guayas Province (Ecuador). It’s been sampled on a fortnightly basis from June 2000 to July 2001 at low water and high water. This study covers {{the composition of the}} hyperbenthic community and the population dynamics of the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> Metamysidopsis sp. nov. 4 b. Are involved the density, biomass and their relation with environmental parameters, population structure, size at maturity, sex ratio, fecundity and secondary production by the size-frequency method, using three CPI to estimate maximum, minimum and average secondary production. The hyperbenthos was dominated by the group Mysidacea representing 98 % of the total density. Three species were found in this group; Bowmaniella sp, Mysidopsis sp and the dominant in the group: Metamysidopsis sp. nov. 4 b. Three peaks of abundance of Metamysidopsis sp. nov. 4 b were found during the dry season, at June (> 26000 N/m- 2 at low water and > 3000 N/m- 2 at high water), October (> 16000 N/m- 2 at low water and > 7000 N/m- 2 at high water) and November (> 26000 N/m- 2 at low water and > 400 N/m- 2 at high water), and were almost absent during the wet season. A dominance of females over males along the year has been found as well as a larger size for female adults than for male adults. The sex ratio fluctuated at samplings with a tendency towards female dominance (1 : 1. 5 at low water and 1 : 2. 6 at high water). The number of embryos carried by a single female goes from 1 to 7, proportionally to their size. The estimate of secondary production yielded results for annual estimate between 3000 mg ADW. m- 2. yr- 1 and 15000 mg ADW. m- 2. yr- 1 at low water and 1000 mg ADW. m- 2. yr- 1 and 5000 mg ADW. m- 2. yr- 1, and a P/B ratio between 19 and 80 at low water and between 20 and 90 at high water...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to elucidate the ecological relations of Bromus inermis and Festuca altaica subsp. hallii. Germination ecology, water relations and growth following spring or fall burning, glyphosate application on B. inermis, F. hallii seedling survival, and seedbank composition were studied in a F. hallii grassland in central Saskatchewan where B. inermis is an agressive invader. Bromus inermis had greater and more rapid germination over a broader range of temperatures and water stress than F. hallii. Germination was lower for F. ballii under decreasing temperatures and similar for B. inermis under decreasing and increasing temperature regimes. Light did not influence germination in F. hallii; however, germination of B. inermis was higher under darkness. Osmotic potentials, relative water content and stomatal conductance were lower for B. inermis in Fall burns in 1987, but similar to Control and Spring burns in 1988. Fall burns reduced tiller densities of native graminoids and F. hallii. Tiller densities of native graminoids were not affected by spring burning, but F. hallii tillered 40 % more after spring burns. There was a burn x glyphosate interaction for the reduction of B. inermis; spring burning and glyphosate combined reduced B. inermis most. species richness and diversity were similar between treatments in F. hallii and B. inermis stands. Tiller densities of B. inermis were higher on burned plots in 1987. In 1988, burning had no impact on tillering and growth of B. inermis. Leaf area indices and biomass following burning were generally higher in Spring than in Fall burns and Control. The seedbank composition was similar between B. · inermis and F. hallii stands averaging 1, 900 seeds per m 2 • B. inermis seeds were found only in B. inermis stands, representing less than 1 % of the total seedbank. Seedling survival of F. hallii was higher with early spring planting than late spring with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) improving survival. Burning alone did not control B. inermis in F. hallii grassland. However, spring burning combined with a wicking of glyphosate reduced B. inermis and increased tillering of F. hallii. Festuca hallii should be seeded in the spring when soil temperatures are increasing and soil moisture is favorable. Seedlings of this native perennial should be inoculated with VAM and planted early in the spring. Reduced germination of B. inermis under high water stress and in the presence of light suggests that prescribed burning may reduce the availability of "safe sites" for germination. Bromus inermis is well adapted to grassland dominated by F. hallii and it apparently can outcompete the <b>dominant</b> <b>specie.</b> Therefore, if grasslands dominated by F. hallii are to be preserved for future generations, proactive management strategies must be employed to limit invasions by B. inermis and enhance the vigor of F. hallii...|$|E
40|$|A simbiose entre as formigas Attini e o fungo cultivado permitiu a expansão das suas colônias e a utilização dos fungos como parte da dieta alimentar dos adultos e como {{principal}} alimento das larvas. Em troca, as formigas suprem os fungos com substrato vegetal, dão abrigo, os dispersam para novas localidades e oferecem proteção contra seus predadores e patógenos. Apesar dos diversos mecanismos para manter o ninho livre de outros micro-organismos, bactérias, leveduras e fungos filamentosos podem ser encontrados. Na literatura, há pouca informação sobre a presença e o papel biológico das leveduras em ninhos de Attini. Portanto, neste trabalho a ênfase foi isolar e identificar as leveduras encontradas em jardins de fungo e em alguns materiais de descarte de ninhos de Attini. Esta abordagem permitiu a criação de um banco de estirpes específico que deverá ser utilizado em outras pesquisas que possam possibilitar uma análise mais apronfundada sobre a participação delas na simbiose. Foram analisados quarenta e quatro ninhos pertencentes a espécies de Attini de sete gêneros distintos, a saber: Mycocepurus, Myrmicocrypta, Mycetophylax, Sericomyrmex, Trachymyrmex, Acromyrmex e Atta. Deles, foi isolado um total de cento e cinqüenta e duas estirpes, distribuídas em trinta e três espécies, as quais foram identificadas por análises morfológicas, fisiológicas e pelo seqüenciamento dos domínios D 1 /D 2 da região 26 S do rDNA; contudo, em alguns casos, foi necessário seqüenciar a região ITS. A espécie mais encontrada nos ninhos de Mycocepurus goeldii, Trachymyrmex sp e Acromyrmex sp foi Pichia guilliermondii, prevalente nos ninhos dos dois últimos gêneros. Houve predominância das espécies Pichia caribbica e Candida railenensis no único ninho de Myrmicocrypta sp e de Cryptococcus flavescens nos ninhos de Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Observamos também a dominância [...] . The symbiosis {{between the}} Attini ants and their cultivated fungi allowed {{the expansion of}} their colonies {{as well as the}} use of fungi as part of the adults’ diet and the main food of the larvae. In return, the ants supply the fungi with plant substrates, provide shelter, disperse the fungi to new locations and offer protection against predators and pathogens. Although several mechanisms to keep the nest free of other microorganisms, several bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi can be found. In literature, there is little information about the presence and biological role of yeasts in Attini nests, therefore, the emphasis {{of this study was to}} isolate and identify yeasts in fungus gardens and in some waste deposits of Attini ants. This approach permitted a database creation of specific strains which can be used in other researchs that may facilitate a deeper analysis about their participation in symbiosis. Forty-four nests of seven different attine genera were analyzed, which are: Mycocepurus, Myrmicocrypta, Mycetophylax, Sericomyrmex, Trachymyrmex, Acromyrmex e Atta. A total of one hundred and fifty-two strains were isolated, belonging to thirty-three yeasts species, wich were identified by morphological and physiological analysis and the D 1 /D 2 domains of the nuclear large subunit (26 S) ribosomal DNA were sequenced; however, in some cases, it was necessary to identify the ITS region of the ribosomal DNA. Pichia guilliermondii was the most <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> encountered in nests of Mycocepurus goeldii, Trachymyrmex sp and Acromyrmex sp, with prevalence in the nests of the last two genera. Pichia caribbica and Candida railenensis predominated in the single Myrmicocrypta sp nest studied while Cryptococcus flavescens dominated in the Atta sexdens rubropilosa nests. It was observed that basidiomycete yeasts were most associated with leaf-cutting ant nests. The genera Moniliella, Torulaspora [...] . (Complete abstract click electronic access below...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho foi realizado numa paisagem composta por 7 diferentes fisionomias de cerrado e uma floresta homogênea de eucaliptos, {{adjacente}} ao cerrado. Durante 12 meses amostrou-se os mamíferos mensalmente, por 3 noites consecutivas, procurando cobrir as variações sazonais de períodos secos e chuvosos, utilizando-se 2 tipos de armadilhas para os pequenos mamíferos: gaiola, dispostas ao longo das trilhas, de 25 em 25 m, totalizando 114 armadilhas, amostrando todas diferentes fisionomias; e uma estação de pitfall, com 4 baldes de 40 cm cada um, em cada fisionomia. O esforço de coleta foi de 4. 896 trapnigths e 324 estações/ dia de pitfall, onde capturou-se 121 indivíduos de 12 gêneros, sendo 8 de roedores (Oligoryzomys sp, Calomys sp, Akodon sp, Oryzomys sp, Bolomys lasiurus, Pseudoryzomys simplex, Oxymicterus sp, Nectomys squamipes) e 4 de marsupiais (Didelphis albiventris, Marmosa sp, Gracilinanus microtarsus, Micoureus cinereus). A espécie dominante da comunidade é do gênero Oligoryzomys sp. O N. squamipes aparece sempre intimamente relacionado à água, já os gêneros B. lasiurus, Pseudoryzomys sp, Oxymicterus sp ocorrem em regiões de campo aberto. Os marsupiais G. microtarsus e Marmosa sp preferem fisionomias arbustivas de cerrado, já o M. cinereus, P. opossum, e D. albiventris preferem formações mais florestais, sendo este último, ao lado do Oligoryzomys sp os únicos a utilizar o reflorestamento. O maior número de capturas ocorreu no período seco e o nímero de roedores capturados foi muito maior que o de marsupiais. O maior valor de H apareceu na fisionomia de mata de transição entre cerradão e floresta ripária. Apesar do pitfall parecer um método muito mais eficiente que as armadilhas de gaiola, este estudo mostrou que os dois métodos são complementares, pois aquelas espécies que são capturadas nos pitfalls, com raras exceções, são capturadas também pelas gaiolas. As espécies de menor tamanho corporal foram capturadas nos pitfalls, como Oligoryzomys sp, Calomys sp, Gracilinanus microtarsus, Marmosa sp, já aquelas de maior tamanho corporal foram capturadas nas gaiolas, como Nectomys squamipes, Pseudoryzomys simplex, Oryzomys sp, Oxymicterus sp, Micoureus cinereus, Didelphis albiventris. Somente duas espécies foram capturadas tanto nas armadilhas quanto nos pitfalls, o Akodon sp e o Bolomys lasiurus. O cálculo do índice da Jaccard (= 0, 17) forneceu um resultado que corrobora a idéia de que os dois tipos de armadilhas são complementares num estudo da comunidade de pequenos mamíferos. The {{work has}} been performed in a landscape coposed of seven different Brazilian savanna physiognomie and an eucalyptus forest, adjacent of the Brazilian savanna. Small mammals, during 12 moths, were sampled, every 30 days for 3 consecutive nights, in dry and wet seasons, through 2 kinds of small mammal traps: Tomahawk style, arranged along trails, every twenty 5 meters, amounting a 114 traps sampling all physiognomies; and a pitfall satation, with four 40 centimeter deep buckets each, in each physiognomy. The capture effort was 4 896 tapnights and 324 pitfall/stations/day where a 121 individuals were captured, in 12 genera, with 8 rodents (Oligoryzomys sp, Calomys sp, Akodon sp, Oryzomys sp, Bolomys lasiurus, Pseudorizomys simplex, Oxymicterus sp, Nectomys squamipes) and 4 marsupials (Didelphis albiventris, Marmosa sp, Gracilinanus microtarsus, Micouerus cinereus). The community <b>dominant</b> <b>specie</b> is Oligoryzomys sp. The N. squamipes always appears closely related to water. In contrast, B. lasiurus, P. simplex and Oximycterus sp occur in open field regions. The marsupials G. microtarsus and Marmosa sp prefer Brazilian savannas shrubby vegetation, whereas M. cinereus, P. opossum and D. albiventris commonly use forested vegetation, and the llatter, side with the Oligoryzomys sp {{are the only ones}} to exploit the reforest areas. The largest number of captures occurred in the transition forest between the cerradão and the riparian forest. Despite of the fact that, pitfalls may seem a much more efficient method than Tomahawk traps themselves, said work has proved both methods to be complementary for those species were captured through pitfalls, with rare exceptions, were captured through Tomahawk traps as well. The smaller body mass species were captured through pitfalls, like Oligoryzomys sp, Calomys sp, G. microtarsus, Marmosa sp, whereas the bigger body mass ones were captured through Tomahawk traps, such as N. squamipes, P. simplex, Oryzomys sp, Oxymicterus sp, M. cinereus, D. albiventris. Only two species were captured through both methods Akodon sp and B. lasiurus. The Jaccard index (= 0, 17) performed a result that corroborates the idea that the two kinds of traps are complementary in a small mammals community study...|$|E
