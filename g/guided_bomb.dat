5|$|In January 2017, {{during a}} special forces raid in Yemen, two MV-22s {{were called in}} to {{evacuate}} the special forces troops. One Osprey suffered an engine failure causing a hard landing which injured two of the crew, and was later destroyed with a <b>guided</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|The B-1B {{underwent}} {{a series of}} flight tests using a 50/50 mix of synthetic and petroleum fuel; on 19 March 2008, a B-1B from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, became the first USAF aircraft to fly at supersonic speed using a synthetic fuel during a flight over Texas and New Mexico. This was conducted {{as part of an}} ongoing Air Force testing and certification program to reduce reliance on traditional oil sources. On 4 August 2008, a B-1B flew the first Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod equipped combat sortie where the crew successfully targeted enemy ground forces and dropped a GBU-38 <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or <b>guided</b> <b>bomb,</b> this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Italian Tornado IDS and ECR {{aircraft}} {{participated in}} the enforcement of a UN no-fly zone during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Various coalition aircraft operated from bases in Italy, including RAF Tornados. Italian military aircraft delivered a combined 710 <b>guided</b> <b>bombs</b> and missiles during the strikes against Libyan targets. Of these Aeronautica Militare Tornados and AMX fighter-bombers released 550 <b>guided</b> <b>bombs</b> and missiles, and Italian Navy AV-8Bs delivered 160 <b>guided</b> <b>bombs.</b> Italian Tornados launched 20 to 30 Storm Shadow cruise missiles with the rest consisting of Paveway and JDAM <b>guided</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2011, Italian AMX {{aircraft}} {{were employed}} during the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya. Italian military aircraft deployed 710 <b>guided</b> <b>bombs</b> and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers deployed 550 bombs and missiles, while Navy AV-8Bs deployed 160 <b>guided</b> <b>bombs.</b> The conflict saw the first use by AMX aircraft of Litening targeting pods paired with Paveway and JDAM <b>guided</b> <b>bombs.</b> In early 2016, due to the declining stability of Libya, Italy opted to station additional aircraft, including four AMX fighters, to Bassi Airbase, Trapani, Sicily.|$|R
5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} {{the lessons of}} the Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget <b>guided</b> <b>bomb,</b> {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group would have to produce the assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. The designs were frozen in July. Green Bamboo was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with the design continued. On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or <b>guided</b> <b>bomb,</b> this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested.

25|$|In 1965, the Air Force was {{initiating}} {{development of}} a low-cost <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> capability for its aircraft. Aiding that effort, Texas Instruments {{conducted a series of}} tests at the Armament Development and Test Center at Eglin AFB. These tests incorporated laser technology to guide free falling ordnance. This classified project received the code name PAVE and was the beginning of what would later become a series of sensors and precision-guided munitions.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group, {{apart from}} {{receiving}} nationwide attention for completing the drone flight from Eglin to Washington D.C. on a simulated bombing mission, the Group received little notice {{in its own}} right. Without higher supply and personnel priorities, very little else could be accomplished. The situation began to change in March 1947, when the Group moved to Eglin's main base and received its first series of test projects. The Group was given the JB-2 and it got involved in VB-6 Felix, VB-3 Razon, and VB-13 Tarzon <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> activities.|$|E
500|$|Development of the VB-13 Tarzon {{began in}} February 1945, with Bell Aircraft being awarded a {{contract}} by the United States Army Air Forces {{for the development}} of a very large <b>guided</b> <b>bomb.</b> The VB-13 was a combination of a radio-command guidance system as used on the smaller VB-3 Razon ('Range And azimuth only') <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> with the British-developed Tallboy [...] "earthquake" [...] bomb, known to the USAAF as M112. The 'Tarzon' name was a portmanteau, combining Tallboy, range and azimuth only, describing the weapon and guidance system; and was pronounced similarly to that of [...] "Tarzan", the popular [...] "ape-man" [...] fictional character.|$|E

500|$|The ASM-A-1 Tarzon, {{also known}} as VB-13, was a <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> {{developed}} by the United States Army Air Forces during the late 1940s. Mating the guidance system of the earlier Razon radio-controlled weapon with a British Tallboy [...] bomb, the ASM-A-1 saw brief operational service in the Korean War before being withdrawn from service in 1951.|$|E
500|$|The German V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{demonstrated}} a serious omission in OSRD's portfolio: guided missiles. While the OSRD {{had some success}} developing unguided rockets, it had nothing comparable to the V-1, the V-2 or the Henschel Hs 293 air-to-ship gliding <b>guided</b> <b>bomb.</b> Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas, this represented an entire field {{that had been left}} to the enemy. Bush did not seek the advice of Dr. Robert H. Goddard. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, [...] "I don't understand how a serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2. Bush could only recommend that the launch sites be bombed, which was done.|$|E

5000|$|These {{guidance}} technologies can {{generally be}} divided {{up into a}} number of categories, with the broadest categories being [...] "active," [...] "passive" [...] and [...] "preset" [...] guidance. Missiles and <b>guided</b> <b>bombs</b> generally use similar types of guidance system, {{the difference between the two}} being that missiles are powered by an onboard engine, whereas <b>guided</b> <b>bombs</b> rely on the speed and height of the launch aircraft for propulsion.|$|R
50|$|The need {{to destroy}} {{precision}} targets such as bridges had driven development of rudimentary <b>guided</b> <b>bombs</b> in the Second World War, and Korea accelerated this interest. In Korea, Air Force B-29's dropped the Razon and {{the much larger}} and more powerful Tarzon <b>guided</b> <b>bombs</b> on North Korean bridges, destroying at least 19 of them. The disappointing Korean bridge-bombing experience stimulated the Navy to pursue development of the postwar Bullpup program, the first mass-produced air to surface guided missile.|$|R

2500|$|The SAAW is a {{lightweight}} high precision <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> designed to destroy ground targets, such as runways, bunkers, aircraft hangers and other reinforced structures. Weighing [...] it has deep penetration capabilities, carries a high explosive warhead {{and has a}} long standoff range of , which will allow the Indian Air Force to strike targets, such as enemy airfields, {{at a safe distance}} without putting pilots and aircraft at risk.

2500|$|The UAE's Mirage 2000-9s are {{equipped}} for the strike mission, with the Shehab laser targeting pod (a {{variant of the}} Damocles) and the Nahar navigation pod, complementing the air-to-ground modes of the RDY-2 radar. They are also equipped with a classified countermeasures system designated [...] "IMEWS", which {{is comparable to the}} ICMS 3. Emirati Mirage 2000s are armed with weapons such as the PGM 500 <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> and the [...] "Black Shaheen" [...] cruise missile, which is basically a variant of the MBDA Apache cruise missile. All 30 survivors of this first batch have been extensively refurbished and upgraded, bringing them to the same standard as Mirage 2000-9.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 July 2006 four UNTSO {{observers}} from Austria, Canada, China and Finland {{were killed}} by Israeli strikes on an OGL (Observer Group Lebanon) patrol base near Khiam in southern Lebanon. According to the UN, the Israelis stated they were responding to [...] "Hezbollah fire from that vicinity" [...] and the four had taken shelter in a bunker under the post. The area around the site {{was hit by a}} precision <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> from an Israeli jet and shelled a total of 14 times by Israeli artillery throughout the day despite warning calls made by UN personnel to the IDF. However, General Alain Pellegrini, then commander of UNIFIL, claims that he attempted to call Israeli officials [...] "five or six times", but never got past their secretaries. Later, Israeli artillery shelling resumed as a rescue team tried to clear the rubble.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards the Grenville {{took part}} in Operation Tunnel, (see Battle off Sept-Îles) with night sweeps to sink Axis {{shipping}} trying to reach Biscay ports. The Grenville was present when the cruiser [...] was sunk, leaving Hill as Senior Officer {{to deal with the}} aftermath and to give evidence in a subsequent court martial. Immediately after this action, the Grenville was ordered to the Mediterranean, where {{she was one of the}} supporting ships off the Anzio beachhead. Hill was transferred to the command of the destroyer HMS Jervis, which was repaired after having her bows blown off by a <b>guided</b> <b>bomb,</b> in which he supported the Normandy landings in June 1944. By September 1944, Jerviss engines were heavily worn, and the destroyer took a long refit in Belfast. Hill was Mentioned in Despatches for his part in the Normandy landings. Hill was then sent to command an Air Station. Then, as a passenger in an ambulance, Hill sustained head injuries which led to his being invalided out of the service. [...] He was placed on the retired list on 30 July 1946.|$|E
2500|$|Following bombing {{difficulties}} in Operation Desert Storm, the Air Force sought an all-weather [...] "smart" [...] bomb that could work regardless of smoke, fog, dust, and cloud cover, with research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT) of an [...] "adverse weather precision guided munition" [...] beginning in 1992. Several proposals were considered, including a radical concept that used GPS. [...] To identify the technical {{risk associated with}} an INS/GPS guided weapon, the Air Force created in early 1992 a rapid-response High Gear program called the [...] "JDAM Operational Concept Demonstration" [...] (OCD) at Eglin Air Force Base. Honeywell, Interstate Electronics Corporation, Sverdrup Technology, and McDonnell Douglas were hired to help the 46th Test Wing demonstrate the feasibility of a GPS weapon within one year. The OCD program fitted a GBU-15 <b>guided</b> <b>bomb</b> with an INS/GPS guidance kit and on 10 February 1993, dropped the first INS/GPS weapon from an Air Force F-16 on a target [...] downrange. Five more tests were run in various weather conditions, altitudes, and ranges. The OCD program demonstrated an 11-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP).|$|E
