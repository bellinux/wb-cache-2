[...] A thyristor is not a proportional device like a transistor. In other words, a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an activity-sensitive clock tree construction technique for {{low power design}} of VLSI clock networks. We introduce the term of node difference based on module activity information, and show {{its relationship with the}} power consumption. A binary clock tree is built using the node difference between different modules to optimize the power consumption due to the interconnections (i. e., clock <b>gating</b> <b>signals</b> and clock edges). We also develop a method to determine <b>gating</b> <b>signals</b> with minimum number of transitions.

50|$|In a {{multiple}} input AND/OR <b>gate,</b> a <b>signal</b> {{at one of}} the inputs triggers the passage of a signal at other inputs; i.e., it passes through or blocks the signal at other inputs. Such a signal is called a <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|CV/gate (an {{abbreviation}} {{of control}} voltage/gate) is an analog method of controlling synthesizers, drum machines {{and other similar}} equipment with external sequencers. The control voltage typically controls pitch and the <b>gate</b> <b>signal</b> controls note on-off.|$|E
5000|$|Normal {{thyristors}} (silicon-controlled rectifiers) are {{not fully}} controllable switches (a [...] "fully controllable switch" [...] can be turned on and off at will). Thyristors can only be turned ON using the gate lead, but cannot be turned OFF using the gate lead. Thyristors are switched ON by a <b>gate</b> <b>signal,</b> but even after the <b>gate</b> <b>signal</b> is de-asserted (removed), the thyristor remains in the ON-state until a turn-off condition occurs (which can be {{the application of a}} reverse voltage to the terminals, or a decrease of the forward current below a certain threshold value known as the [...] "holding current"). Thus, a thyristor behaves like a normal semiconductor diode after it is turned on or [...] "fired".|$|E

40|$|Cardiac imaging using {{magnetic}} resonance requires a <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> {{in order to}} compensate for motion. Human patients are routinely scanned using an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> during imaging. However, we found that in sheep the ECG is not a reliable method for gating. We developed a software based method that allowed us to use the left ventricular pressure (LVP) as a reliable <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b> By taking the time derivative of the LVP (dP/dt), {{we were able to}} start imaging at both end-diastole for systolic phase images, and end-systole for diastolic phase images. We also used MR tissue tagging to calculate 3 D strain information during diastole. Using the LVP in combination with our digital circuit provided a reliable and time efficient method for ovine cardiac imaging. Unlike the ECG signal the left ventricular pressure was a clean signal and allowed for accurate, nondelay based triggering during systole and diastole. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> is {{a digital}} signal or pulse (sometimes called a [...] "trigger") that {{provides}} a time window so that a particular event or signal from among many will be selected and others will be eliminated or discarded.|$|R
50|$|The driver may employ many {{transistors}} connected parallel and serial.The transistors are floating {{and need}} DC isolation for their gates.To do this, the <b>gate</b> <b>signal</b> is connected via optical fiber, or the gates {{are driven by}} a large transformer.In this case, careful compensation for feedback is needed to prevent oscillation.|$|E

5000|$|The next {{interesting}} {{structure is}} a transparent latch; {{it will pass}} the input to the output when the <b>gate</b> <b>signal</b> is set for [...] "pass-through", and captures the input and stores it upon transition of the <b>gate</b> <b>signal</b> to [...] "hold". The output will remain stable regardless of the input signal while the gate is set to [...] "hold".

40|$|The {{behavior}} of some well-known pulsewidth modulation (PWM) techniques is investigated under perturbation conditions of power semiconductor <b>gating</b> <b>signals.</b> An evaluation of different PWM techniques is performed considering {{the effect of}} PWM timing errors on the output spectra of switch-mode converters...|$|R
30|$|The {{implementation}} of the gating+ algorithm involves assessment of signal at every voxel in every frequency, selectively including the fluctuating signal due to respiratory motion only when {{and where it is}} not confounded by noise. To characterize the difference between useful signal and noise in a per-voxel per-frequency basis, we used an estimated threshold of 1.2 × effective noise. The effective noise is derived from the randomly gated image. The constant 1.2 was derived from Monte Carlo simulations: 108 combinations of ranging magnitude and phase scenarios for motion and noise vectors were simulated. Both motion and noise vectors contain an element of noise which comes with random phase. We modeled this random process and found that when the ratio between motion and noise vector magnitudes is greater than approximately 1.2, then it becomes more probable (P > 0.5) that the <b>gated</b> <b>signal</b> is closer to the true signal than the ungated signal. In essence, the unknown phase of the noise is managed through knowledge of its magnitude, random phase, and statistical behavior, which allows us to make a binary determination as to its likely benefit on the accuracy of the <b>gated</b> <b>signal.</b> The concept may be understood as such: intuitively, where the true motion signal vectors are much greater in magnitude than the noise vectors, the <b>gated</b> <b>signal</b> is more reliable regardless of the noise and should be used. When the signal-to-noise ratio is poor, then useful fluctuations will be indiscernible through the noise, thus the <b>gated</b> <b>signal</b> provides no added value and should not be used. The implication of this strategy is that a gating+ voxel value will, on average, have improved accuracy relative to its ungated value.|$|R

Power electronic applications such as three-phase inverter require highly accurate switching frequency.

50|$|In particular, if {{the pulse}} {{width of the}} gate current is {{sufficiently}} large (generally some tens of microseconds), the TRIAC has completed the triggering process when the <b>gate</b> <b>signal</b> is discontinued and the latching current reaches a minimum level called holding current.

40|$|Our work {{concentrates}} on high-level optimization {{of the power}} of clock network, which is a relatively new area. Our work includes two parts: activity-sensitive clock design for low power and low power clock based on clock frequency reduction. In the activity-sensitive clock design, we introduce the term of node difference based on module activity information, and show its relationship with power consumption. Merging power is used to measure the power cost of merging two nodes. A binary clock tree is built based on the merging power between different modules to optimize the power consumption due to interconnections (i. e., clock <b>gating</b> <b>signals</b> and clock edges).

40|$|Proceedings of: 11 th International Meeting on Fully Three-Dimensional Image Reconstruction in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine (Fully 3 D 2011). 11 - 15 July, 2011, Potsdam, Germany. This work {{presents}} {{a method to}} obtain automatically the cardiac <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> in a PET study of rats, by employing the variation with time of the counts in the cardiac region, that can be extracted from list-mode data. In an initial step, the cardiac region is identified in the image space by backward-projecting {{a small fraction of}} the acquired data and studying the variation with time of the counts in each voxel inside said region, with frequencies within 2 and 8 Hz. The region obtained corresponds accurately to the left-ventricle of the heart of the rat. In a second step, the lines-of-response (LORs) connected with this region are found by forward-projecting this region. The time variation of the number of counts in these LORs contains the cardiac motion information that we want to extract. This variation of counts with time is band-pass filtered to reduce noise, and the time signal so obtained is used to create the <b>gating</b> <b>signal.</b> The result was compared with a cardiac <b>gating</b> <b>signal</b> obtained from an ECG acquired simultaneously to the PET study.

40|$|Abstract — Mandatory {{restrictions}} for {{a current}} source inverter’s (CSI’s) proper operation, like {{continuity of the}} DC link current, complicate the corresponding PWM generation {{especially in the case}} of single phase systems.

Analysis of two independent fhy 3 alleles links enhanced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in response to red light with an arrhythmic pattern of hypocotyl elongation. Both alleles also show disrupted rhythmicity of central-clock and clock-output gene expression in constant red light. fhy 3 exhibits aberrant phase advances under red light pulses during the subjective day. Release-from-light experiments demonstrate clock disruption in fhy 3 during {{the early part of the}} subjective day in constant red light, suggesting that FHY 3 is important in <b>gating</b> red light <b>signaling</b> for clock resetting. The FHY 3 gating function appears crucial in the early part of the day for the maintenance of rhythmicity under these conditions.
