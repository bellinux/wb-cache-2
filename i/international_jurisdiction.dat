25|$|Since the ICTR was {{established}} as {{an ad hoc}} <b>international</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> the ICTR is scheduled to close {{by the end of}} 2014, after it completes trials by 2009 and appeals by 2010 or 2011. Initially, the U.N. Security Council established the ICTR in 1994 with an original mandate of four years without a fixed deadline and set on addressing the crimes committed during the Rwandan Genocide. As the years passed, it became apparent that the ICTR would exist long past its original mandate. However, with the announcement of its closing, there is a concern over whether the Rwandan genocide will still have an authority like that of the ICTR in prosecuting high-ranking fugitives and with access to international sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules on}} {{litigation}} jurisdiction over contractual matters will apply to disputes arising from civil or commercial international contracts between private-law legal entities or individuals provided that: They are domiciled or headquartered in different member states: At {{least one of}} the parties to the contract is domiciled or headquartered in any member state and, additionally, has made a choice of jurisdiction in favor of a court in one of the member states. In this case, there must be a reasonable connection between the jurisdiction chosen and the controversy. The scope of the application of the <b>international</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> guidelines over contractual matters excludes the following: legal relationships between bankrupt entities/individuals and their creditors and any other analogous proceedings (especially concordatas composition with creditors); matters under agreements involving family and succession law; social security contracts; administrative contracts; employment contracts; consumer sales contracts; transport contracts; insurance policies; and rights in rem.|$|E

However, the whole thing {{turns out to be}} a trap; the Baron and his stockholders intend to transport the children to an offshore factory, outside of <b>international</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Furthermore, the entire Blackmore family has been taken hostage, watched over by the Baron's henchmen, the Generals. Charlie manages to subdue them individually and free his family, including his father. Unfortunately, they are unable to stop the train before it reaches its destination, and the Baron reveals his true plan: to turn the factory into an artificial island and sell the children as a cheap labor force.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, the United Nations {{commissioned}} {{an investigation}} on past {{human rights violations}} in Somalia, specifically {{to find out if}} [...] "crimes of <b>international</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> (i.e. war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide) had been perpetrated during the country's civil war". The investigation was commissioned jointly by the United Nations Co-ordination Unit (UNCU) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The investigation concluded with a report confirming the crime of genocide to have taken place against the Isaaqs in Somalia. United Nations investigator, Chris Mburu, stated:Based on the totality of evidence collected in Somaliland and elsewhere both during and after his mission, the consultant firmly believes that the crime of genocide was conceived, planned and perpetrated by the Somali Government against the Isaaq people of northern Somalia between 1987 and 1989.|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese Crown {{claimed it}} had {{territorial}} {{rights in the}} area visited by Cabot. In 1493 Pope Alexander VI – assuming <b>international</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> – had divided lands discovered in America between Spain and Portugal. The next year, in the Treaty of Tordesillas, these two kingdoms decided to draw the dividing line running north–south, 370 leagues (from [...] approximately depending on the league used) west of the Cape Verde Islands. Land to the west would be Spanish, to the east Portuguese. Given the uncertain geography of the day, this seemed to give the [...] "new founde isle" [...] to Portugal. On the 1502 Cantino map, Newfoundland appears on the Portuguese {{side of the line}} (as does Brazil). An expedition captured about 60 Aboriginal people as slaves who were said to [...] "resemble gypsies in colour, features, stature and aspect; are clothed in the skins of various animals ...They are very shy and gentle, but well formed in arms and legs and shoulders beyond description ...." [...] Some captives, sent by Gaspar Corte-Real, reached Portugal. The others drowned, with Gaspar, on the return voyage. Gaspar's brother, Miguel Corte-Real, went to look for him in 1502, but also failed to return. Scholars believe that Miguel Corte-Real carved inscriptions on the controversial Dighton Rock.|$|E

40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{regulatory process}} is global. Markets {{and the problems}} they generate—consumer privacy, chemicals safety, and many others—cross borders and so too do regulatory efforts to address those problems. The process, however, by which national and <b>international</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> decide common regulatory problems defies the traditional mold of hierarchical state law. There is no world government {{with the power to}} impose a single set of principles and procedures on the multiple jurisdictions, and therefore the global regulatory process is characterized as much by diversity and discord as it is by coordination and convergence. The new field of comparative law and regulation is devoted to understanding the global regulatory process. This introductory essay lays the groundwork for the volume and future research in the field by defining the object of study and by identifying three important avenues of theoretical inquiry. Comparative law and regulation covers the law of the regulatory function—legislative and administrative rulemaking, oversight, enforcement, and judicial review—in both domestic and <b>international</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> and involving both public and private actors. Theoretically, the field tackles three critical features of the global regulatory process—jurisdictional variation, convergence (anddivergence) over time, and legal prescription based on comparison. Jurisdictional variation is best captured by classifications based on paradigms of public law and models of legitimate private involvement in public regulation. The question of whether and how convergence occurs should be studied using causal theories of legal transplants and diffusion. And legal prescription based on comparison, a favorite rhetorical device in the global regulatory process, should be evaluated based on a normatively explicit and empirically sensitive functional method of comparative law research. These conceptual and theoretical tools apply equally to domestic and <b>international</b> <b>jurisdictions...</b>|$|R

This research involved three study components: - The safety performance at worksites in Australia and New Zealand was qualitatively benchmarked with comparable <b>international</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> - Best practice in road worksite safety management was identified through a comprehensive literature review, including manuals from <b>international</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> with comparable or better safety performance, and consultation with 13 international experts. - The {{findings of the}} first two studies informed the development of recommendations for improving safety at Australian and New Zealand worksites. The identified best practices are presented in six groups: regulation, traffic signs and informational controls; enforcement related controls; traffic related operational controls; worksite/worker related operational controls; physical protection and separation related controls; and driver education and awareness campaigns. Initial recommendations were discussed with Austroads member agencies to understand degrees of applicability, feasibility, expected potential impact, and level of support in and relevance to their jurisdictions. The final recommendations were developed based on the feedback obtained from these consultations...|$|R
