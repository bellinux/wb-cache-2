The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E

5|$|Further, scrutinizing {{legislation}} {{to determine if}} it contravenes fundamental liberties is traditionally {{the function of the}} judiciary. Even though the PCMR can potentially prevent an unconstitutional piece of legislation from coming into force, there is doubt as to whether the Council's members <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> legal training to undertake the burdensome task.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolinas {{also did}} not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> space to act as fleet flagships, so the lead ship of the new class was {{designed}} with an extra deck on the conning tower specifically for this purpose, although the increase in space and weight from this necessitated removal of two twin 5-in DP mounts.|$|E

5|$|Under the Act, {{regulations}} and rules came into force on 2 December 1802 {{and applied to}} all mills and factories employing three or more apprentices (unless the total workforce was less than twenty). It stated that all mills and factories should be cleaned at least twice yearly with quicklime and water; this included ceilings and walls. There was a requirement that the buildings <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> windows and openings for ventilation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E

5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August. She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They put back in to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking Dakar. Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} {{there was no immediate}} prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War but there was an immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first {{permanently}} {{settled in}} Zagreb {{in the late}} eighteenth century, and founded the Jewish community in 1806. In 1809 the Jewish community had a rabbi, and by 1811 it had its own cemetery. As early as 1833, the community was permitted to buy land for construction of a synagogue, but did not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> money to finance one at the time.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, 2013, Hickenlooper {{asked the}} Colorado Supreme Court to clarify if a voter had {{to vote for}} recall in order {{to vote for a}} {{replacement}} candidate. At the same time, Libertarian Jan Brooks turned in petitions to be on the ballot against Morse while Democrat Richard Anglund announced his write-in candidacy against Giron. On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order to vote for a replacement, but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Services were {{originally}} flown using a Dornier Do 328 operated by Sun Air of Scandinavia. Later in that year, Krohn Air acquired a Jetstream 32 and started flights from Molde to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola, but these services did not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> patronage and were later terminated. By 2011, the aircraft operation {{was transferred to}} Helitrans. In the spring of 2013 the aircraft operation was transferred to AIS Airlines, using two British Aerospace Jetstream 32. The airline started a service from Ålesund Airport, Vigra to Trondheim in March 2013, but pulled out in September. The airline ceased operations on 4 February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down {{to command}} the next {{available}} moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment {{would have gone to}} Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E
5|$|To <b>have</b> <b>sufficient</b> {{space for}} the planned New Orleans Square section, the Disneyland Railroad's track on {{the western edge of}} its route was {{expanded}} outwards again in 1962, Frontierland Station's depot building in that same vicinity was moved across the DRR's track, and a covered platform with no station building was built on the opposite side to serve as the new Frontierland Station. Although the station was no longer in the Frontierland section, its name was not changed to New Orleans Square Station until September 1996.|$|E
