Recent work by Domberger and Sherr’ explored price discrimination in the legal profession and concluded that deregulation <b>in</b> the market <b>for</b> <b>conveyancing</b> services has reduced the extent to which price discrimination is possible. In this paper we argue that the data used by Domberger and Sherr are unequal to the task of examining the presence, or otherwise, of price discrimination and present results from an alternative data set that is better equipped for so doing...|$|R

It is cost less than other communication approach and for better bandwidth efficiency OFDM based PLC system is used. In real PLC environment some electrical appliances will produce noise. To mitigate this noise filter kernel design is used, so periodic impulsive noise and Gaussian noises are removed from PLC communication system by using this filter kernel design. MATLAB {{is used for the}} simulation and the result shows that filter kernel is simple and effective noise mitigation technique. Further in future, interference due to obstacles also wants to be mitigated for the better data transmission without noise...|$|R
