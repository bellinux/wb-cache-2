500|$|After {{returning}} home, Thomas {{worked on}} Under Milk Wood in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953. It was copied {{and returned to}} Thomas, who lost it in a pub in London and required a <b>duplicate</b> <b>to</b> take to America. Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour. He died in New York before the BBC could record [...] "Under Milk Wood". Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954, and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film. In 1954 the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes.|$|E
60|$|The castle {{was indeed}} {{in all respects}} an almost exact <b>duplicate</b> <b>to</b> that of Cliffe. They were {{received}} as before by the Flemish steward. There were {{the same number of}} men-at-arms and servitors, and the fittings and furnishings were as perfect as those of Cliffe. After going over it, Edgar drew Sir Ralph aside.|$|E
5000|$|In the Hebrew, {{reduplication}} {{is used in}} nouns and adjectives.

60|$|He remembered with darkening {{eyes and}} impeded breath how his close {{companionship}} and daily {{care of this}} helpless child had revealed to him the fascinations of that paternity denied to him; how he had deemed it his duty to struggle against the thrill of baby fingers laid upon his yellow cheeks, the pleading of inarticulate words, the eloquence of wonder-seeing and mutely questioning eyes; how he had succumbed again and again, and then struggled no more, seeing only in them the suggestion of childhood made incarnate in the Holy Babe. And yet, even as he thought, he drew from his gown a little shoe, and laid it beside his breviary. It was Francisco's baby slipper, a <b>duplicate</b> <b>to</b> those worn by the miniature waxen figure of the Holy Virgin herself in her niche in the transept.|$|E
6000|$|She knew he {{referred}} to the schedules, based on the current prices of cotton, made out in the agent's office and sent in <b>duplicate</b> <b>to</b> the selling house, in Boston. She got them from the shelf; and as he went over them she heard him repeating the names of various goods now become familiar, pongees, poplins, percales and voiles, garbardines and galateas, lawns, organdies, crepes, and Madras shirtings, while he wrote down figures on a sheet of paper. So complete was his absorption in this task that Janet, although she had resented the insinuating pressure of his former attitude toward her, felt a paradoxical sensation of jealousy. Presently, without looking up, he told her to call up the Boston office and ask for Mr. Fraile, the cotton buyer; and she learned from the talk over the telephone though it was mostly about [...] "futures"--that Ditmar had lingered for a conference in Boston on his way back from New York. Afterwards, having dictated two telegrams which she wrote out on her machine, {{he leaned back in his}} chair; and though the business for the day was ended, showed a desire to detain her. His mood became communicative.|$|E
60|$|My {{letter to}} Madam Esmond, announcing my revolt and disobedience (perhaps I myself {{was a little}} proud of the {{composition}} of that document), I showed in <b>duplicate</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Lambert, because I wished him to understand what my relations to my mother were, and how I was determined, whatever of threats or quarrels the future might bring, never for my own part to consider my separation from Theo as other than a forced one. Whenever I could see her again I would. My word given to her was in secula seculorum, or binding at least {{as long as my}} life should endure. I implied that the girl was similarly bound to me, and her poor father knew indeed as much. He might separate us; as he might give her a dose of poison, and the gentle, obedient creature would take it and die; but the death or separation would be his doing: let him answer them. Now he was tender about his children to weakness, and could not have the heart to submit any one of them--this one especially--to torture. We had tried to part: we could not. He had endeavoured to separate us: it was more than was in his power. The bars were up, but the young couple--the maid within and the knight without--were loving each other all the same. The wall was built, but Pyramus and Thisbe were whispering on either side. In the midst of all his grief and perplexity, Uncle Lambert had plenty of humour, and could not but see that his role was rather a sorry one. Light was beginning to show through that lime and rough plaster of the wall: the lovers were getting their hands through, then their heads through--indeed, it was wall's best business to retire.|$|E

[...] Trudaine obeyed. [...] "This is the first step," [...] continued Lomaque, putting the book in his pocket, [...] "toward the accomplishment of my purpose--my uncertain purpose, remember! Now, listen; I am going to put my own head in danger for the chance of saving yours and your sister's by tampering with the death-list. Don't interrupt me! If I can save one, I can save the other. Not a word about gratitude! Wait till you know the extent of your obligation. I tell you plainly, at the outset, there is a motive of despair, {{as well as a}} motive of pity, {{at the bottom of the}} action in which I am now about to engage. Silence! I insist on it. Our time is short; it is for me to speak, and for you to listen. The president of the tribunal has put the deathmark against your names on the prison list of to-day. That list, when the trials are over and it is marked to the end, will be called in this room before you are taken to St. Lazare. It will then be sent to Robespierre, who will keep it, having a copy made of it the moment it is delivered, for circulation among his colleagues--St. Just, and the rest. It is my business to make a duplicate of this copy in the first instance. The duplicate will be compared with the original, and possibly with the copy, too, either by Robespierre himself, or by some one in whom he can place implicit trust, and will then be sent to St. Lazare without passing through my hands again. It will be read in public the moment it is received, at the grating of the prison, and will afterward be kept by the jailer, who will refer to it, as he goes round in the evening with a piece of chalk, to mark the cell doors of the prisoners destined for the guillotine to-morrow. That duty happens, to-day, to fall to the hunchback whom you saw speaking to me. He is a confirmed drinker, and I mean to tempt him with such wine as he rarely tastes. If--after the reading of the list in public, and before the marking of the cell doors--I can get him to sit down to the bottle, I will answer for making him drunk, for getting the list out of his pocket, and for wiping your names out of it with the prescription you have just written for me. I shall write all the names, one under another, just irregularly enough in my <b>duplicate</b> <b>to</b> prevent the interval left by the erasure from being easily observed. If I succeed in this, your door will not be marked, and your names will not be called to-morrow morning when the tumbrils come for the guillotine. In the present confusion of prisoners pouring in every day for trial, and prisoners pouring out every day for execution, you will have the best possible chance of security against awkward inquiries, if you play your cards properly, for a good fortnight or ten days at least. In that time--" ...|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the spring}} and summer of 1939 the Territorial Army (formerly the Territorial Force until renamed in the 1920s) was ordered by the British {{government}} to be doubled in size, in order to meet the increasing threat being posed by Nazi Germany. As a consequence, all Territorial formations were ordered to form a 2nd Line duplicate and so the 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division formed an exact mirror <b>duplicate,</b> <b>to</b> be known as the 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division.|$|E

50|$|The section from Bowen Hills to Eagle Junction was {{duplicated}} in 1886, {{extended to}} Northgate in 1890 and Caboolture in 1917. The section from Roma Street to Bowen Hills was opened as double track, {{one of the}} few lines in Queensland so built, in 1890. The line from Caboolture to Beerburrum was duplicated when realigned in 2009, meaning the first 65 km of the NCL is duplicated.

50|$|In the {{formation}} of gene families, four levels of duplication exist: 1) exon duplication and shuffling, 2) entire gene duplication, 3) multigene family duplication, and 4) whole genome duplication. Exon duplication and shuffling gives rise to variation and new genes. Genes are then duplicated to form multigene families which <b>duplicate</b> <b>to</b> form superfamilies spanning multiple chromosomes. Whole genome duplication doubles the number of copies of every gene and gene family. Whole genome duplication or polyploidization can be either autopolyploidization or alloploidization. Autopolyploidization is the duplication of the same genome and allopolyploidization is the duplication of two closely related genomes or hybridized genomes from different species.|$|E

50|$|A {{slide copier}} {{is a simple}} optical device which can be {{fastened}} to the lens mount of a camera <b>to</b> enable slide <b>duplicates</b> <b>to</b> be made. Whilst these devices were formerly used <b>to</b> make <b>duplicates</b> on <b>to</b> slide film, they are often now {{used in conjunction with}} digital cameras to digitize images from film-based transparencies. This method usually gives better resolution than using attachments for digital A4 flat-bed scanners.|$|R
