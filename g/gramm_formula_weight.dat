40|$|An osmotic-protection {{method has}} been used to study the {{permeability}} of rat liver lysosomes to 43 organic non-electrolytes of <b>formula</b> <b>weights</b> ranging from 62 to 1000. A lysosome-rich centrifugal fraction of rat liver homogenate was resuspended in an unbuffered 0. 25 M solution of test solute, pH 7. 0, and incubated at 25 degrees C for 60 min. The free and total activities of 4 -methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase were measured after incubation for 0, 30 and 60 min. Three patterns of results were seen. In pattern A the percentage free activity remained low throughout the 60 min incubation, indicating little or no solute entry into the lysosomes. In pattern B, the percentage free activity was initially low, but rose substantially during the incubation, indicating solute entry. In pattern C there was not even initial osmotic protection, indicating very rapid solute entry. The rapidity of solute entry into the lysosomes showed no correlation with the <b>formula</b> <b>weight,</b> but a perfect inverse correlation with the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the solutes.

40|$|Although {{a formula}} should be adequate, {{inadequate}} formulae had often {{to be used}} through lack of knowledge. With adequate <b>formulae</b> <b>weighting</b> of data was dependent on error expectation. With inadequate <b>formulae</b> <b>weighting</b> should be focused on representativeness. Some other pitfalls were discussed. Correlation analysis was contrasted with regression analysis. These two models had in common that items of a universe were stochastically dependent on a functional relationship. Essential for correlation was that both correlated variables obeyed a probability distribution; for regression analysis this {{did not need to}} be true. In correlation the principal axis was a sound base for understanding relationships, while the regression line was a sound base for predictions. The contrast between understanding and prediction was discussed at large. Special problems of pooling experiments were discussed. In principle a transformation of yield data was advisable if the interaction variety x experiment could be thus reduced. Yet the transformed yields remained inadequate. So weighting, if used, had to improve representativeness. A missing-plot technique for pooling was given. A separate part deals with the reduction of residual error by drawing freehand fertility maps. This may be much more effective than the corrections provided by the design. A criterion was developed for avoiding undue detail in free-hand curves. /HTML>...|$|R
