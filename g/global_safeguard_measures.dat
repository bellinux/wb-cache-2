40|$|This study surveys {{safeguard}} provisions on {{trade in goods}} in 232 regional trade agreements (RTAs) notified to the GATT/WTO up to 31 December 2012. In particular, it identifies those RTAs that modify the conditions applicable to the RTA partner (either substantively or procedurally) {{in the event that}} a <b>global</b> <b>safeguard</b> is invoked. In the case of bilateral (or intra-RTA safeguards), the study analyses provisions governing injury assessment, causation, conditions for the invocation of a measure and the types of measures that may be employed. We use the yardstick of GATT Article XIX and the WTO Safeguards Agreement to determine whether the provisions applicable to bilateral <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> are more or less stringent than the corresponding multilateral rules. The study also includes an inventory of infant industry, balance of payments, and special safeguards applicable to agricultural products found in RTAs. We demonstrate through various examples that {{safeguard provisions}} have become more prescriptive in recent years, though little homogeneity in their design is found even for a given country. In the case of <b>global</b> <b>safeguards,</b> roughly a quarter of RTAs provide for the possible exclusion of the RTA partner, subject to certain criteria, thus discriminating against non-parties. In the case of bilateral safeguards, some RTAs use looser language to define the trigger mechanism to invoke a safeguard and to determine injury standards, thus potentially offering greater scope to use such measures. We found wide variety in the types of bilateral <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> that are permitted in RTAs. A number of more recent RTAs tighten the conditions for application of a bilateral safeguard through limiting the duration of the <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure,</b> allowing the use of tariff-based measures only, and binding the use of the measure to the transition period. Other RTAs specify neither the length of the bilateral <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> nor the conditions for its reapplication, thus providing greater scope to impose such measures than in the multilateral context...|$|R

40|$|The recent WTO {{dispute between}} the United States and eight {{complainant}} nations over protective measures for the steel industry brought widespread attention to a little known area of WTO law—the rules governing 2 ̆ 2 <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures,</b> 2 ̆ 2 the temporary protection of troubled industries against import surges.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the multi-party consultative process of designing <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> and the necessary safeguards infrastructure for the Encapsulation Plant (EP) and the Geological Repository (GR) in Finland. These facilities, now under design and construction, {{are the first}} of this type in the world. After a Decision-in-Principle by the Finnish Government in 2001, the spent nuclear fuel management company Posiva provided a construction license application for the encapsulation plant and geological repository to the Government in December 2012. In November 2015 the Government granted the license to construct the EP and the GR. The operator (Posiva), Finnish State Regulatory Authority (STUK), IAEA and the European Commission are cooperating on developing <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> and on designing the necessary safeguards infrastructure for these facilities. The international and national <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> have to create confidence that no nuclear material is diverted and no undeclared nuclear activities {{take place at the}} facilities. The spent fuel disposed of will not be accessible for verification using traditional <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures.</b> Moreover, the operational phase of the facilities will last over a century, thus the safeguards-related technological infrastructure should be flexible and upgradable.

Cost-efficiency is assured by including into the facility design safeguards equipment such as cameras, radiation detectors, cables and conduits etc. The experience gained so far with this project has confirmed once more that the early provision of design information and safeguards by design dialogue between international and national actors is mutually beneficial and essential for the overall success of safeguards...|$|R

40|$|Japan {{has been}} one of the major GATT/WTO member {{countries}} with relatively little experience in implementing protectionist measures. However, in April 2001, for the first time in its history, Japan invoked provisional <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> against imports of Welsh onions, Shiitake mushrooms and Tatami mats mainly from China. This paper reviews and evaluates the chain of events regarding these safeguard actions, and considers the means by which Japan might be able to deal with its 'trilemma' policy problem involving how to coordinate the promotion of trade liberalisation, the administration of WTO-consistent safeguards and responses to domestic political demands for protection. The paper first attempts to review the theoretical rationale for implementing <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> and counterarguments against these measures. Second, it discusses the economic circumstances in which Japan implemented the <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> and evaluates these measures critically from the standpoint of economic efficiency and the political economy interests involved. Finally, it concludes with a recommendation that the aforementioned 'trilemma' policy problem in Japan can be best addressed by means of the introduction of a 'well-institutionalised' domestic programme to provide adjustment assistance to ameliorate the displacement resulting from import surges.

40|$|The use of <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> {{provides}} trading {{nations with}} a unique and powerful “escape clause ” for certain domestic industries. Safeguards are intended to serve as emergency measures that temporarily protect a domestic industry from the serious injury that is experienced {{as a result of}} an increase in imports. Unlike other trade remedies available under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework such as antidumping and countervailing duties, the initiation of a safeguard investigation does not require the existence of unfair trade practices on the part of exporters. As such, <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> are the only form of trade law that permits protection for injury caused by fair trade. Therefore, the potential for safeguards to be the subject of widespread abuse by trading nations has been well recognised. Despite this threat, the use of <b>safeguard</b> <b>measures</b> has actually been quite rare in the multilateral trading system to date. Until 1995, Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) governed the “escape clause ” of international trade. However due to significant difficulties encountered with the application of Article XIX including the widespread use of market distorting “grey area measures”, extensive negotiations took place during the Uruguay Roun...|$|R
