5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their <b>environment.</b> An organism shares an <b>environment</b> that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the <b>environment</b> are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its <b>environment</b> as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E

In this paper, neurocontrollers were evolved to position the end effector of a robot arm close to a target in three different environments: <b>environments</b> without obstacles, <b>environments</b> with stationary obstacles, and <b>environments</b> with moving obstacles. The evolved neurocontrollers perform qualitatively like inverse kinematic controllers in <b>environments</b> with no obstacles and like path-planning controllers based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees in <b>environments</b> with obstacles.

40|$|Use of {{appropriate}} nursery <b>environments</b> will maximize gain from selection for yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{in the target}} population of <b>environments</b> of a breeding program. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how well-irrigated (low-stress) nursery <b>environments</b> predict yield of lines in target <b>environments</b> that varied in degree of water limitation. Fifteen lines were sampled from the preliminary yield evaluation stage of the Queensland wheat breeding program and tested in 26 trials under on-farm conditions (Target <b>Environments)</b> across nine years (1985 to 1993) and also in 27 trials conducted at three research stations (Nursery <b>Environments)</b> in three years (1987 to 1989). The nursery <b>environments</b> were structured to impose different levels of water and nitrogen (N) limitation, whereas the target <b>environments</b> represented a random sample of on-farm conditions from the target population of <b>environments.</b> Indirect selection and pattern analysis methods were used to investigate selection for yield in the nursery <b>environments</b> and gain from selection in the target <b>environments.</b> Yield under low-stress nursery conditions was an effective predictor of yield under similar low-stress target <b>environments</b> (r = 0. 89, P 0. 05; severe stress r = - 0. 08, P > 0. 05). Yield in the stress nurseries was a poor predictor of yield in the target <b>environments.</b> Until there is a clear understanding of the physiological-genetic basis of variation for adaptation of wheat to the water-limited <b>environments</b> in Queensland, yield improvement can best be achieved by selection for a combination of yield potential in an irrigated low-stress nursery and yield in on-farm trials that sample the range of water-limited <b>environments</b> of the target population of <b>environments...</b>|$|R
