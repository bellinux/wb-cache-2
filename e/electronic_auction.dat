Little {{attention has been}} given to how new access technologies affect or could affect the functioning and outcome of these type of auctions. In this article different exchange processes in <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> are classified and analyzed. The impact on the stakeholders of e-auctions has been examined by using buyer-seller relationship literature.

40|$|Summary An {{investigation}} of the pervasive impact of multi-access technologies, i. e. the internet, wireless data, wired and wireless voice, and interactive TV, on consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> {{was carried out in}} the Dutch market by some researchers. This article extends the analytic generalizability of their research findings through a replication study in the emerging markets of China. By comparing the empirical research findings, we reveal that there is {{no significant difference in the}} impacts of multi-access technologies on consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> within dissimilar contexts; as long as both the business and the technologies are prevalent. This affirms the argument that the use of more sophisticated multi-access technologies has positive effects on the maturity level of exchange processes and stakeholders interactions in consumer <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> thereby leading to an increase in the expected success of the <b>auctions.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> Multi-access technologies Maturity level Exchange process Stakeholders Customer perceived value...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Researchers {{studying}} on-line auction venues {{have focused}} on the business-to-consumer (B 2 C) auction and overlooked consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) auctions. Since these two venues differ significantly in consumer type and auction rules, they are expected to generate different levels of consumer surplus. This paper explores the extent to which consumers in each type of auction experience the winner’s curse—that is, pay more than the minimum fixed price for identical products. The paper also examines how product value, information asymmetry, and type of auction affect the occurrence of the winner’s curse. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES: <b>Electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> <b>electronic</b> bidding, information asym-metry, product value, search costs, winner’s curse. Despite the recent slowdown of e-commerce, <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> remain strong and have far exceeded expectations of revenue growth. For example, eBay’s second-quarter revenue in 2001 jumped to $ 180. 9 million, more than 80 per-cent above the same quarter a year earlier, and posted net income of $ 24. 6 million [44].
