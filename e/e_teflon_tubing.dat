The tubing was cut at a 45 o angle, inserted into the outlet of the microfluidic device up to the inlet junction, and sealed into the device by using PDMS prepolymer (10 : 1 elastomer to curing agent). To aid in imaging of the plugs, the <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> was wound in a spiral on a glass slide, and PDMS prepolymer was poured over the tubing to fix it in place. The device with attached tubing was then autoclaved at 135 oC for 10 min to sterilize. Once sterilized, the glass slide containing the tubing was transferred to a sterile Petri dish.

5000|$|Cryoloops are cooling {{devices that}} use 23 gauge {{stainless}} steel hypodermic tubing shaped into a loop that can fit into sulci {{or on the}} gyri of the section of interest of the cerebral cortex. A pump draws methanol from a reservoir, and the fluid flows through a dry ice bath to be cooled. The cooled methanol flows through <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> into the cryoloop’s metal tubing, which is secured by passing through a threaded post. A thermocouple connector receives the wires from a microthermocouple {{at the base of}} the loop (where the inflow and outflow tubes meet) that measures the tubing temperature. The post, the thermocouple connector, and heat-shrink <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing,</b> which envelopes the microthermocouple wires and the inflow and outflow tubes between the post and microthermocouple, are sealed using dental acrylic. [...] After implantation, when the animal is not participating in an experiment, a protective cap is placed over the open inflow and outflow tubes. During experimentation, the inflow and outflow tubes are attached to the <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> connected to the reservoir setup. The thermocouple connector is connected to a switchbox and a thermometer so cryoloop temperature can be monitored. [...] Cryoloops are considered the most adaptable form of cooling available due to the customization necessary for each experiment. The investigator must form the functional cooling loop of the cryoloop to fit with whatever part of the brain he/she wishes to study, and several cryoloops can be used for one brain. Each device can cool a range of tissue areas from less than 10 mm3 to 75 mm3. Although it may be considered a hassle to have to form each device for each section of interest, this customization allows for a more controlled region of cooling and for more efficient animal use because of the possibility for multiple cooling sites within each animal. Head restraint is unnecessary because the loops are chronically implanted and secured to the skull by screws and dental acrylic.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that organic compounds can partition from the gas phase to the walls in Teflon environmental chambers and that the process can be modeled as absorptive partitioning. Here these studies were extended to investigate gas–wall partitioning of organic compounds in <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> and inside a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) used to monitor compound concentrations. Rapid partitioning of C 8 –C 14 2 -ketones and C 11 –C 16 1 -alkenes was observed for compounds with saturation concentrations (c ∗) in the range of 3  ×  10 4 to 1  ×  10 7  µg m − 3, causing delays in instrument response to step-function changes in the concentration of compounds being measured. These delays vary proportionally with tubing length and diameter and inversely with flow rate and c ∗. The gas–wall partitioning process that occurs in tubing is similar to what occurs in a gas chromatography column, and the measured delay times (analogous to retention times) were accurately described using a linear chromatography model where the walls were treated as an equivalent absorbing mass that is consistent with values determined for Teflon environmental chambers. The effect of PTR-MS surfaces on delay times was also quantified and incorporated into the model. The model predicts delays of an hour or more for semivolatile compounds measured under commonly employed conditions. These results and the model can enable better quantitative design of sampling systems, in particular when fast response is needed, such as for rapid transients, aircraft, or eddy covariance measurements. They may also allow estimation of c ∗ values for unidentified organic compounds detected by mass spectrometry and could be employed to introduce differences in time series of compounds for use with factor analysis methods.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2012. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Michael T. Bowser. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 103 pages. A novel, microfluidic platform for segmented flow assays {{has been developed}} using commercially available <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> and PEEK connectors. Such a system {{can be used to}} generate arrays of nano to pico liter sized droplets separated from each other by plugs of a fluourous solvent. Each droplet becomes an individual reaction vessel suitable for high-throughput applications. We have applied this method {{to the development of a}} single enzyme molecule fluorescence assay. Characterization of the droplet generation platform was done with the use of a 100 μm ID PEEK T-junction connector. When two immiscible streams, such as water and a fluorous solvent, meet at the T-junction an array of aqueous droplets separated by plugs of the solvent is generated inside the <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing.</b> Experiments have shown that, like previous microfabricated segmented flow devices, our system can control the size of the droplets generated solely by changing the ratio of the flow rates of the two phases. Using this approach droplets can be produced with good reproducibility (better than 6 % in all cases and better than 3 % in most) over a wide range of flow rates. Rates of droplet generation of 10. 37 ± 0. 17 drops/s are easily achieved for good high-throughput potential. Fast on-line mixing of reagents and long term droplet stability of up to 7 days has also been demonstrated. The discovery of the heterogeneity of enzyme molecules with respect to activity has resulted in the development of a variety of single enzyme molecule assays, with the aim of investigating the prevalence and origin of this phenomenon. The segmented flow platform we have developed is well suited to the application of single enzyme assays. It has the advantage of high-throughput, as well as ease of fabrication compared to PDMS or silica based devices and elimination of exposure of the enzyme analyte to the walls of the channel or well. A segmented flow, single molecule assay has been developed for the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP). Single AP molecules were sequestered inside 100 pL droplets generated in a PEEK tee and stored in a length of 50 μm ID <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing.</b> The droplet array was allowed to incubate for a suitable time period, during which the AP molecules converted the weakly fluorescent substrate AttoPhos® into a strongly fluorescent product. AP molecules were found, as in previous studies, to display heterogenous activity with up to a 9 -fold difference between individual enzymes In the last section of this work we have used the commercial glass treatment Aquapel as a capillary wall coating agent to reduce protein absorption in capillary electrophoresis (CE). Due to their large number of potential sites for interactions with the fused-silica wall, protein separations with CE can often be difficult. For this reason, much effort is expended on the development on wall coating agents for the prevention of such interactions. Aquapel is a fluorous polymer used commercially to render glass surfaces hydrophobic. The efficacy of the coating was investigated using a suite of three basic proteins: lysozyme, cytochrome c and α-chymotrypsinogen. Separation efficiencies of up to 130, 000 theoretical plates were achieved over a pH range of 4. 0 to 7. 0, a significant improvement over bare fused silica capillary. Electroosmotic flow (EOF) was reduced by the Aquapel coating but not entirely suppressed. The stability of the coating was also examined. 62 protein injections were performed over a two day period during which analyte migration times varied by less than 3. 5 %. Due to the ease of application and low cost, coating with Aquapel is an attractive alternative to available capillary coatings...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{two-phase}} flow in lab-on-chip devices, where {{chemical and biological}} reagents are enclosed within plugs separated from each other by an immiscible fluid, offers significant advantages {{for the development of}} devices with high throughput of individual heterogeneous samples.

The operating conditions were examined to apply the determination of COD in wastewaters by using glucose as a standard COD substance. The procedures recommended are as follows: Both 4. 9 x 10 (- 4) M potassium permanganate and 6. 7 % sulfuric acid solutions are individually pumped, 20 μl of a sample solution is injected into the flow of the sulfuric acid solution, and then mixed with a mixing joint. The mixed solution is transported to a flow cell situated in a spectrophotometer fixed at a wavelength of 525 nm, and decrements of absorbance are recorded. The peaks were reproducibly obtained at a concentration range of 10 - 200 mg-COD 1 (- 1). Chloride up to 1000 mg 1 (- 1) was not interfered at all. Various wastewater samples were analyzed by the proposed method at a sampling rate of 30 samples per hour, and the apparent COD values obtained were compared with the manual COD ones obtained by JIS method...|$|R
40|$|A special {{concentric}} spinneret with {{a section}} of <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> as sheath nozzle was manufactured and used to perform coaxial electrospinning for generating biphasic-release core-sheath nanofibers of helicid. Two experiments were designed to investigate the interfacial interactions of working fluids with {{the components of the}} spinneret nozzle. Appropriate solvent systems were selected and used to prepare (1) an electrospinnable sheath fluid consisting of helicid and polymer filament-forming matrix, and (2) an unspinnable core fluid consisting of Eudragit® L 100 - 55 and a relatively high content of helicid. At 5 : 1 sheath-to-core flow-rate ratio, helicid-loaded nanofibers with an average diameter of 660 ± 210 nm, clear core–sheath structure, as well as smooth surface and cross-section were successfully produced, as verified by SEM amd TEM observations. DSC and XRD analyses indicated that the nanofibers were essentially polymeric matrix composites with homogeneously distributed guest helicid molecules on the sheath and core part. ATR–FTIR spectra verified that hydrogen bonding occurred between the drug and core-sheath matrices. In vitro dissolution tests showed that the core–sheath nanofibers can provide biphasic-release profiles with 52. 4 % immediate release in simulated gastric fluid and 46. 3 % sustained release of the remaining drug in pH 7 simulated gastric fluid. These findings indicated that the non-metallic concentric spinneret could be exploited to couduct coaxial electrospinning and facilitated the smooth and continuous preparation of electrospun core-sheath nanofibers for providing biphasic drug release profiles...|$|R
40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a human tooth slice organ culture assay to measure the response of the cells of the dental pulp to commonly used dental materials. Background. New more clinically relevant methods to screen the biocompatibility of dental materials are needed. Methods. The following common types of dental materials; calcium hydroxide [CH] (Dycal, Dentsply, Milford, DE), composite resin [CR] (One Step, Bisco, Schaumburg, IL), zinc oxide eugenol [ZOE] (Kalzinol, Dentsply, Milford, DE) and resin-modified glass ionomer [RMGI] (Vitremer, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN) were aseptically packed into <b>teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> and cut into 1 mm pellets. The pellets were placed in contact with third-molar human tooth slices (n= 40) and submerged in culture media for 2 or 7 days. After culture, the tooth tissues were processed for histological staining and the responses of the odontoblasts were analyzed histomorphometrically. The data was analyzed with analysis of variance (P value) statistics. Results. Some pulp necrosis and a loss of odontoblast survival was observed according to the type of dental materials tested (ANOVA, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). From the most to the least destructive to the odontoblasts was; ZOE, CH, RMGI and CR. Conclusion. This human tooth slice organ culture screening method {{has the potential to be}} used as a rapid, inexpensive and easily-available method for measuring the biocompatibility of dental materials. Grants. This study was funded by NIH/NIDCR grant DE 015573...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{two phase flow}} in {{lab-on-chip}} devices, where {{chemical and}} biological reagents are enclosed within plugs separated from each other by an immiscible fluid, offers significant advantages {{for the development of}} devices with high throughput of individual heterogeneous samples. Lab-on-chip devices designed to perform the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are a prime example of such developments. The internal circulation within the plugs used to transport the reagents affects the efficiency of the chemical reaction within the plug, due to the degree of mixing induced on the reagents by the flow regime. It has been hypothesised in the literature that all plug flows produce internal circulation. This work demonstrates experimentally that this is false, and seeks to elucidate the parameters influencing the internal circulation of plugs. The particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique offers a powerful non-intrusive tool to study such flow fields. This paper presents micro-PIV experiments carried out to study the internal circulation of aqueous plugs in two phase flow within 762 μm internal diameter FEP <b>Teflon</b> <b>tubing</b> with FC- 40 as the segmenting fluid. Experiments have been performed and the results are presented for plugs ranging in length from 1 mm to 13 mm with an average fluid velocity ranging from 0. 3 mm/s to 50 mm/s. The results demonstrate that circulation within the plugs is not always present and requires design considerations to benefit from this phenomenon. Copyright © 2006 by ASME...|$|R
