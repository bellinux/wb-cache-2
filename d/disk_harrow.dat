50|$|Discada {{is a mixed}} meat dish {{popular in}} the {{northern}} Mexican states of Baja California, Sinaloa, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. The dish includes a mixture of grilled meats cooked on an agricultural plow <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> hence its name. The basic meats for a traditional discada include beef (usually a flank cut), bacon, ham, sausage, and Mexican chorizo. The disk is placed over an open flame, and the ingredients are introduced one at a time. The meats are seasoned and marinated according to the cook's preference and usually include salt, pepper, lime juice, and garlic. Aromatics including white or purple onions, bell peppers, Jalapeno or Serrano peppers, and tomatoes are also used to add flavor and color to the dish. It is usually served with tortillas in tacos or separately on a plate.|$|E
50|$|Tine harrows {{are used}} to refine {{seed-bed}} condition before planting, to remove small weeds in growing crops and to loosen the inter-row soils to allow for water to soak into the subsoil. The fourth is a chain <b>disk</b> <b>harrow.</b> Disk attached to chains are pulled at an angle over the ground. These harrows move rapidly across the surface. The chain and disk rotate to stay clean while breaking up the top surface to about 1 in deep. A smooth seedbed is prepared for planting with one pass.Chain harrowing {{can be used on}} pasture land to spread out dung, and to break up dead material (thatch) in the sward, and similarly in sports-ground maintenance a light chain harrowing is often used to level off the ground after heavy use, to remove and smooth out boot marks and indentations. Used on tilled land in combination with the other two types, chain harrowing rolls remaining larger soil clumps to the surface where weather breaks them down and prevents interference with seed germination.|$|E

Los tratamientos fueron: incorporación del fertilizante a 10 cm con rastrillo pulidor, a 15 cm con rastra-arado, a 25 cm con arado de discos y a 30 cm con cincel-abonador; testigo absoluto sin fertilizar. Se presentaron incrementos en rendimiento a la incorporación del fertilizante a 30 cm, mostrando diferencias altamente significativas con la fertilización a 10 cm y el testigo, los incrementos en rendimiento fueron de 64. 9 % y 109. 7 % en promedio para cada uno de los semestres. Igualmente, se observaron aumentos en el diámetro del capítulo, en el peso de 1. 000 semillas, en la altura de planta y disminución en el porcentaje de semillas vanas en el capitulo. Los porcentajes de cáscara, almendra, aceite y proteína no respondieron a la fertilización profunda. Desde el punto de vista económico, la mejor alternativa correspondió a la fertilización a 30 cm con cincel-abonador; la incorporación a 15 cm, con la rastra-arado, se presentó como según da opción con una tasa de retorno {{marginal}} aceptable, la cual para la región se estimó en 100 % como valor mínimo.

40|$|The {{influence}} of agricultural production systems on greenhouse gas generation and emission {{is of interest}} as it may affect potential global climate change. Agricultural ecosystems can {{play a significant role}} in production and consumption of greenhouse gases, specifically, carbon dioxide. Information is needed on the mechanism and magnitude of gas generation and emission from agricultural soils with specific emphasis on tillage mechanisms. This work evaluated four different tillage methods on the short-term CO 2 and water vapor flux from a clay loam soil in the Northern Cornbelt of the USA. The four tillage methods were moldboard plow only, moldboard plow plus <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> twice, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> and chisel plow using standard tillage equipment following a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop compared with no tillage. The CO 2 flux was measured with a large portable chamber commonly used to measure crop canopy gas exchange initiated within 5 minutes after tillage and continued intermittently for 19 days. The moldboard plow treatment buried nearly all of the residue and left the soil in a rough, loose, open condition and resulted in maximum CO 2 loss. The carbon released as CO 2 during the 19 days following the moldboard plow, moldboard plow plus <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> chisel plow and not tilled treatments would account for 134 %, 70 %, 58 %, 54 % and 27 % respectively of the carbon in the current year’s crop residue.

Therefore, understanding soil displacement through tillage translocation {{is an important}} step toward developing tillage practices that do not degrade soil resources. Our primary objective was {{to determine the effects of}} soil condition (i. e. grassland stubble versus previously tilled soil), opening angle, and harrow speed on soil translocation. A second field study also conducted on a Lixisol but only in the stubble field, quantified displacement effects of mouldboard ploughing. The field studies were located 12 km South of Évora, Portugal. Soil displacement or translocation after each tillage operation in both studies was measured using aluminium cubes with a side length of 15 mm as ‘tracers’. Offset angles for the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk</b> were 20 ◦, 44 ◦ and 59 ◦; tractor velocities ranged from 1. 9 to 7. 0 km h− 1 and tillage depth ranged from 4 to 11 cm. The depth of mouldboard ploughing was approximately 40 cm with a wheel speed of 3. 7 km h− 1. The translocation coefficients for the two implements were very different averaging 770 kgm− 1 for the mouldboard plough and ranging from 9 to 333 kgm− 1 for the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk.</b> This shows that the mouldboard plough was more erosive than the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk</b> in these studies. All three variables (soil condition, opening angle, and tillage velocity) were critical factors affecting the translocation coefficient for the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk.</b> Displacement distances were the largest for compacted soils (stubble field), with higher opening or offset angles, and at higher velocities. The results also showed significant correlation for (a) mean soil displacement in the direction of tillage and the slope gradient and (b) soil transport coefficient and the opening angle. Our results can be used to predict the transport coefficient (a potential soil quality indicator for tillage erosion) for the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk,</b> provided tillage depth, opening angle, and tool operating speed are known...|$|R

Legumes with a climbing growth habit established more quickly where only the disk was used. All legume/pangolagrass associations yielded more DM and CP than grass only. Plots with C. plumieri or S. guianensis gave double the DM yield and triple the CP yield of grass only. The maximum DM yield of 1. 8 metric tons/ha per 6 wks was produced by an S. guianensis/pangolagrass association which produced 0. 33 metric tons of CP/ha per 6 wks.

Four replicates of untreated (control), mowed and <b>disked</b> (dixie <b>harrow)</b> plots were sampled in 2005 (pre-treatment) and in 2006 and 2007. We located nests using the systematic walk and incidental flush method. We revisited nests every {{three to five days}} to determine nest fate. We located 142 nests of nine species in 90 nest searches and expended over 600 man hours. Mayfield nest success (proportion of nests that successfully hatch at least one young) and clutch size were similar among treatments. Nest success of artificial nests also was similar among treatments. Predation was the leading cause of nest failure accounting for 71 to 77 percent of all nest failures and small mammals were implicated in 76 percent of the depredations. Least chipmunks may have been the principle predator of sagebrush bird nests in our study. Small scale mechanical treatments to restore sagebrush apparently do not negatively affect sagebrush birds within two years post-treatment, but longer duration studies and larger sample sizes are required to better assess the impact of treatments on sagebrush avifauna...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} three tillage {{implements}} (field cultivator, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> rotary harrow) {{on the soil}} incorporation of various herbicides and consequently on the efficacy of these herbicides against the weeds and on their selectivity on cotton, was evaluated in four field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2003 and 2004. All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (field cultivator, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron. The incorporation of herbicides in the soil with <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> or field cultivator compared to rotary harrow, provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> and field cultivator were {{lower than that of}} rotary harrow. The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton. Finally, drip irrigation combined with the PPI application of s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron and incorporated in the soil with field cultivator or <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> should be the first choice of cotton growers in integrated crop management systems. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} soil management systems on population of white grubs, (Phyllophaga cuyabana Moser), and on its damage in soybean, experiments were set up under no-tillage and conventional tillage (one disk plow, and a leveling <b>disk</b> <b>harrow)</b> areas. Primary tillage equipment, used in other soil management systems, such as moldboard plow, disk plow, chisel plow and heavy duty <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> were also tested. Fluctuation of P. cuyabana population {{and the extent of}} its damage to soybean was similar under no-tillage and conventional tillage systems. Results comparing a range of primary tillage equipment showed that it affected soil insect populations differently, depending on the time during the season in which tillage was executed. Larval mortality could mostly be attributed to their exposure to adverse factors, soon after tillage, than to changes in soil conditions. Reduction of white grub population was more evident in plots managed by heavier equipment, such as the moldboard plow. Soil tillage could be one component within the soil pest management system in soybean, however, its use can not be generalized. 200...|$|E
40|$|A {{two year}} field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of different tillage methods on soil physical properties and crop yield of melon. Tillage treatments {{in the study were}} moldboard plow + two passes of <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> as conventional tillage (CT), two passes of <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> as reduced tillage (RT), one pass of <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> as minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT) as direct drilling method. The statistical results of the study indicated that tillage method significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) affected crop yield, fruit weight, fruit length, fruit diameter, total soluble solids and root dry matter, but there was no significant differences in other components such as number of plants per hectare, number of fruits per plant and root length. The maximum value of crop yield (27. 2 t ha- 1), number of plants per hectare (6360) and number of fruits per plant (1. 9) was obtained in case of CT treatment, while maximum value of fruit weight (3. 6 kg), total soluble solids (10. 25 %), root length (42. 3 cm) and root dry matter (72. 5 %) was observed in case of RT treatment. Also, maximum value of fruit length (29. 0 cm) and fruit diameter (17. 2 cm) was noted in case of MT treatment. Conversely, the minimum value of crop yield (20. 6 t ha- 1), number of plants per hectare (5910), fruit weight (1. 9 kg), fruit length (26. 4 cm), fruit diameter (14. 1 cm), root length (36. 6 cm) and root dry matter (54. 1 %) was obtained in case of NT treatment, while minimum value of number of fruits per plant (1. 2) was observed in case of RT treatment. Moreover, minimum value of total soluble solids (9. 75 %) was noted in case of MT treatment. The statistical results of the study also indicated that tillag...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two tillage systems, {{conventional}} (mold board plow) and reduced (<b>harrow</b> <b>disk),</b> on soil organic carbon and microbial biomass and activity were evaluated. Total organic carbon and microbial biomass were {{not affected by}} tillage, whereas carbon in the soil light fraction was higher in depth in plowed plots. Respiration os incubated samples and the specific ativity of the microbial biomass were also higher in subsurface soil under conventional tillage. This was associated (r= 0, 80) with carbon availability {{as indicated by the}} ratio light fraction-C/biomass-C. the CO 2 -C produced by the soil was originated from both a labile and a resistant pool. Conventional tillage determined an increase of the labile one. The CO 2 -C production in hte field was positively correlated with soil temperature and rainfall (r 2 = 78 - 89). During summer, plowed plots generated 44 % more CO 2 -C than umplowed ones. Plowing increased the available carbon pool size for microorganisms in depth but had no effect on CO 2 -C emission to the atmosphere on a year basis. 199...|$|R
40|$|Sugarcane {{production}} {{has increased in}} recent years {{mainly because of the}} demand for ethanol. Soil preparation in areas where sugarcane has not been planted yet can increase productivity by improving physical and chemical characteristics. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of soil tillage on agronomic traits and productivity of sugarcane. The experiment was conducted in the municipality of Goianésia (GO) on a Red-Yellow Latosol of medium texture using the CTC- 2 variety. The experimental design was randomized blocks with six treatments and four replications. The treatments were: T 1) desiccation + moldboard plow + harrow, T 2) moldboard plow + harrow, T 3) harrow + moldboard plow + harrow, T 4) no-till, T 5) subsoiler, and T 6) harrow + disc plow + harrow. The number, diameter, height and productivity of stalks were evaluated. The treatment which resulted in the highest number of stalks was harrow + moldboard plow + harrow; however, this treatment was differed only from the treatment with moldboard plow + harrow. The seedbed preparation with desiccation + moldboard plow + harrow and also <b>harrow</b> + <b>disk</b> plow + <b>harrow</b> provided the highest yield of sugarcane stalks. The no-till treatment proved to be a viable alternative, since it did not differ in productivity from treatments that provided the highest yields. It is a more economical form of cultivation when compared to the other treatments studied in this work. ...|$|R
40|$|No-till (NT) {{adoption}} {{is an essential}} tool for development of sustainable agricultural systems, and how NT affects the soil organic C (SOC) dynamics is {{a key component of}} these systems. The effect of a plow tillage (PT) and NT age chronosequence on SOC concentration and interactions with soil fertility were assessed in a variable charge Oxisol, located in the South Center quadrant of Parana State, Brazil (50 degrees 23 `W and 24 degrees 36 `S). The chronosequence consisted of the following six sites: (i) native field (NF); (ii) PT of the native field (PNF- 1) involving conversion of natural vegetation to cropland; (iii) NT for 10 years (NT- 10); (iv) NT for 20 years (NT- 20); (v) NT for 22 years (NT- 22); and (vi) conventional tillage for 22 years (CT- 22) involving PT with one disking after summer harvest and one after winter harvest to 20 cm depth plus two <b>harrow</b> <b>disking.</b> Soil samples were collected from five depths (0 - 2. 5; 2. 5 - 5; 5 - 10; 10 - 20; and 20 - 40 cm) and SOC, pH (in H(2) O and KCl), Delta pH, potential acidity, exchangeable bases, and cation exchangeable capacity (CEC) were measured. An increase in SOC concentration positively affected the pH, the negative charge and the CEC and negatively impacted potential acidity. Regression analyses indicated a close relationship between the SOC concentration and other parameters measured in this study. The regression fitted between SOC concentration and CEC showed a close relationship. There was an increase in negative charge and CEC with increase in SOC concentration: CEC increased by 0. 37 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for every g of C kg(- 1) soil. The ratio of ECEC:SOC was 0. 23 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for NF and increased to 0. 49 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for NT- 22. The rates of P and K for 0 - 10 cm depth increased by 9. 66 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and 17. 93 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively, with NF as a base line. The data presented support the conclusion that long-term NT is a useful strategy for improving fertility of soils with variable charge. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
