40|$|Part of Hyatt’s {{community}} research impact project {{across the}} Rossendale Valley, aiming to increase tourism and boost {{the local economy}} through arts engagement. Hyatt used his research into a painting from the museum collection of Betty Treacle (a local 19 th century character) as a question-raising device: Betty asked questions of whomever she met. "What do you see? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> Do we see the same thing?" These are the research questions explored. Hyatt turned the Museum into a Treacle extravaganza: Treacle themed food in the café, a Treacle tree trail, Treacle activities at weekend and throughout half-term for children alongside the exhibition itself. In August 2015, as a direct impact, Hyatt used the research {{to work on a}} new movie with children and young homeless people from communities where funding for creative projects has all-but disappeared as social housing funding is diminished. The film was a collaboration with REELmcr, a not-for-profit social enterprise, giving a voice to the most alienated, deprived, under represented and vulnerable communities; fully funded through St Vincent’s Housing Association by Young Roots Heritage Lottery Fund and included young people from the Blackburn Foyer, a supported housing scheme. Hyatt delivered a talk to arts/film and drama workers, homeless youth and community children, followed by running an art making and creative writing session inspired by his research into Betty Treacle. This led to an original film script which then formed the basis for a movie, Trick or Treacle, made by the participants. The project went on to lead the group through the front of camera and behind camera processes and experiences of making their movie, culminating in a free premiere screening at The Boo Theatre, Waterfoot, on 23 rd January 2016.

40|$|During {{the last}} 15 years the Swedish media market has {{developed}} a great deal, thanks {{to the rise of}} new media. Literature, articles and investigations have contributed to producing the chapter of background of this essay. How the local newspaper and its organization has changed over time is being accounted in this essay. From the newspaper being the only product on the market to now having a spread out product portfolio. By doing the qualitative interview with research representatives of six local newspapers the aimis to answer the following questions: Who were your competitors 15 years ago? Who are your competitiors today? In what way has the increased competition changed your way of working at the division of advertisement and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> consider the the increase of mediachannels having affected the customer? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the future? The main results show that all six representatives agree {{on the fact that the}} competition has increased during the last 15 years. To be able to survive on a tougher market it is necessary to have a product portfolio containing other media apart from the newspaper. All six representatives mention the importance of parallel publication. The result of this research also shows on discrepancies in customers awareness...|$|R
40|$|Repeated {{exposures}} to thin-idealized body shapes may alter women’s perceptions of what normal (e. g., accepted) and ideal (e. g., desired) bodies {{in a cultural}} environment look like. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether exposure to thin and round body shapes may change the subsequent esthetic appreciation of others’ bodies and the perceptual and cognitive–affective dimensions of self-body image in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN). Thirteen AN patients and 13 matched healthy controls were exposed to pictures of either thin or round unfamiliar body models and, before and after exposure, they were required to either express liking judgments about round and slim figures of unfamiliar bodies (esthetic task) or to adjust distorted pictures of their own body to their perceptual (<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> yourself?), affective (<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel yourself?), metacognitive (<b>How</b> <b>do</b> others <b>see</b> <b>you?)</b> and ideal (How would you like to look like?) body image (self-body adjustment task). Brief {{exposures to}} round models increased liking judgments of round figures in both groups. However, only in AN patients, exposure to round models induced an increase in thin figures liking, which positively correlated with their preoccupation with dieting. Furthermore, exposure to round bodies in AN patients, but not in controls, increased the distortion for the perceptual body image and decreased the size of the ideal one. No differences between the two groups were obtained after adaptation to thin models. Our results suggest that AN patients’ perception of their own and others’ body is more easily malleable by exposure to round figures as compared to controls. Crucially, this mechanism may strongly contribute to the development and maintenance of self-body image disturbances. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
