Maximum load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 9 was 36 % lower than that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 13 - 17. Energy capacity of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 9 was 58 % lower than that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lm/d of 13 - 15. Regardless of nail length projecting from the main member (lnp), initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lnp was close to that of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without lnp. When the ratio of the sum of lm and lnp to nail diameter ratio (lr/d) was 10 - 11, maximum load and energy capacity of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with lnp were close to those of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without lnp.

When <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> have a member thickness according to the standard for structural design of timber structures edited by Architectural Institute of Japan, initial stiffness and yield load are little affected by member thickness but maximum load and energy capacity are greatly affected by member thickness. 主材と側材の厚さや主材からの釘の突き出し長さが 1 面せん断釘接合部のせん断性能に及ぼす影響を調べた。剛性係数は主材中の釘長さと釘径の比（lm/d）が 7 ～ 14 のとき概ね一定の値を示し、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。降伏荷重はlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 10 ～ 14 のときに一定、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。最大荷重と吸収エネルギーはlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 13 ～ 17 のとき最大荷重が、lm/dが 13 ～ 15 のとき吸収エネルギーが最も大きな値を示した。主材からの釘の突き出し長さにかかわらず剛性係数は概ね一定の値を示した。釘の突き出し長さが長い接合部の最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは突き出していない接合部より低い値となった。日本建築学会の木質構造設計規準・同解説に準じ、主材中の釘長さが釘径の 9 倍以上、側材厚が釘径の 6 倍以上であるとき、釘接合部の剛性係数と降伏荷重には大きな変化は見られないが、最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは部材の厚さによって大きな差が生じた...|$|R

30|$|Shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> in wood that were loaded perpendicular to the grain; these joints had 21 specifications depending on different combinations of wood species, nail dimensions, number of nails, and edge distances of the main members, and their effects on the shear resistance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were also investigated. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with CN 75 nails had higher initial stiffness than the joints with CN 50 nails, provided the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected with 3 or 5 nails was not always a simple product {{of the number of}} nails and the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> connected with a nail, and instead depended on the combination of wood species of the main member and nail dimensions. When the edge distance decreased, the maximum load and energy capacity decreased, thereby affecting the energy capacity. The maximum load of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with CN 75 nails may be smaller than those with CN 50 nails depending on the combination of wood species and nail dimensions. When the edge distance of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> was less than 26  mm, the energy capacity of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with CN 75 nails was less than or similar to those with CN 50 nails.|$|R
30|$|Nail-head pull-through, lateral nail resistance, {{and single}} shear <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> tests were {{conducted}} on medium density fiberboard (MDF) with different density profiles, and {{the relations between the}} results of these tests and the density profiles of MDF were investigated. The maximum load of nail-head pull-through and the maximum load of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were little affected by the density profile. However, the ultimate strength of lateral nail resistance, the stiffness, and the yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were affected by the density profile of MDF and showed high values when the surface layer of the MDF had high density. It is known that bending performance is also influenced by density profile. Therefore, the stiffness and the yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> were compared with the bending performance of MDF. The stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> was positively correlated with the modulus of elasticity (MOE); in the case of CN 65 nails, the initial stiffness of joints changed little in response to changes in MOE. The yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> had a high positive correlation with the modulus of rupture (MOR). The stiffness and the yield strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> showed linear relationships with MOE and MOR, respectively.|$|R

30|$|<b>Nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used joints in wooden houses, and they show shear resistance to lateral force. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> under lateral force are designed to avoid the brittle failure of wood while designing timber joints. It is known that split failures in <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> loaded perpendicular to the grain are affected by less thick wood, less spacing between nails, less edge and end distances, and wood species. The standard for structural design of timber structures—edited by Architectural Institute of Japan [1]—specifies that edge and end distances and spacing of nails must be equal to or greater than the minimum required for the design of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints.</b> In this standard, the allowable shear strength of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> without split failure of members is exhibited, and the same values regardless of loading direction to the grain are shown. Although <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> with sufficient edge and end distances are preferable, it is difficult to always ensure this during the actual constructions of wooden houses. Because the width of the common frame members used in wooden houses are substantially fixed, less edge distance is often observed in the actual panel–frame joints. Therefore, it is important to accumulate the data regarding the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> failed by split of members under lateral force if consideration is given to the nailing conditions in the actual construction of wooden houses.|$|R

The relative slip for loading procedure was used the values measured by the displacement transducers located in the front side.

The load was applied up to a relative slip of 1  mm, and subsequently, reduced to 0  kN. This loading procedure was repeated to produce relative slips of 2, 3, and 4  mm.

30|$|With {{the recent}} concern toward wood {{utilization}} in large-scale structures, increasing the strength performance of structural elements is important. Developing structural elements using board materials {{is one of}} the measures to increase the strength performance. A high-performance <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> to resist shear loading is necessary to increase the strength performance of wooden structural elements using board materials. This study was conducted {{in order to understand the}} shear properties of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> intended for large-scale structures. Shear tests were conducted with <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> using structural plywood, medium density fiberboard, or particleboard. The yield resistance was determined from experimental load-slip displacement curves, and was also calculated using European yield theory (EYT). Consequently, the <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> specimens using MDF showed an experimental yield resistance higher than those using structural sugi plywood. The <b>nailed</b> <b>joint</b> specimens using PB also showed a high value similar to that of the joints using structural karamatsu plywood. The yield resistance of most of the joint specimen series calculated using European yield theory showed slightly higher values than the experimental yield resistance. This study observed the deformation behavior around nail the head under shear loading. No deformation was observed from the appearance at the initial region of the test. The nail head started a rotational deformation when the joint started yielding. Moreover, the side panel became partially embedded. The nail head was completely embedded at the maximum load of the specimen. Nail pull-out from the base material was not remarkably evident. This deformation behavior was observed in all the board materials used in this study.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{dynamic tests}} of <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are {{conducted}} under a band-limited white-noise wave using a uniaxial hydraulic shaking table. The principal results are as follows: dynamic responses of <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> under a band-limited white-noise wave are reasonably {{related to the}} static load-slip relationships and the dynamic responses under harmonic waves of them. When <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are shaken under a composite wave of wide frequency range, they resonate transitionally {{with one of the}} frequency components one after another decreasing their equivalent resonant frequencies along their static load-slip curves. <b>Nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are in danger of ultimate failures even though the input maximum accelerations do not exceed their damage limits, if they are shaken for long times with or without intermittences. In this case, <b>nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints</b> are prone to fail in low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of <b>nails.</b> <b>Nailed</b> plywood-timber <b>joints,</b> on the other hand, are prone to fail in typical static failure modes when they are shaken under strong input maximum accelerations equivalent to their ultimate limits.|$|R
30|$|The {{general view}} of the test results {{indicates}} that <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are likely damaged by the frequency components of seismic waves close to their higher resonant frequencies below the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance. However, the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> are ultimately broken by the lower frequency components of seismic waves, to which damaged joints with degraded stiffness resonate. The transition of the responsive behavior of the <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> affects the seismic resistance of entire structures. If the principal frequency components of seismic waves {{are close to the}} resonant frequencies after cyclic stiffness degradation of the nailed structural elements, structures are prone to collapse readily under strong earthquakes. If the principal frequency components of seismic waves are close to their resonant frequencies below the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance, on the other hand, the structures are initially prone to be damaged, but the resultant stiffness degradation may enable the structures to survive strong earthquakes. This discussion leads to an important conclusion that structural engineers should distinguish between principal frequency components dominant to the ultimate or safety-limit resistance and those dominant to the damage-limit or serviceability-limit resistance [12].|$|R

30|$|Dynamic {{tests of}} <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber <b>joints</b> are {{conducted}} under harmonic vibrations from 2 to 7  Hz. The principal results are as follows: under dynamic loading, <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber <b>joints</b> may break in low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of nails besides the other failure modes typical under static loading. The dynamic response of <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber <b>joints</b> is clearly dependent upon both the input frequency and the acceleration. These responsive characteristics {{arise from the}} nonlinear load–slip relationships and the characteristic cyclic stiffness degradation of nailed joints; that is, the cyclic degradation of the equivalent linear stiffness decreases the resonant frequencies of the same joints, which results in a transition of dynamic responses. It indicates that frequency components of seismic waves resonant to the frequencies corresponding to safety-limit stiffness of <b>nailed</b> <b>joints</b> may lead them to critical failures, even if the accelerations do not exceed the accelerations equivalent to the static damage-limit resistance.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{are a lot}} of {{traditional}} wooden houses, temples and shrines in Japan. These traditional wooden structures have already been standing for a long time. Many of these structural members and joints have suffered from biodeteriorations induced by fungi, termites and so on. It is difficult to know the residual strength of decayed structural members and joints.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the shear strength of <b>nail</b> <b>joints</b> attacked by fungi, which are often used in the wooden houses. In this study, we prepared the partial decayed specimens embedded by nails, and evaluated the shear strength. Those specimens were locally attacked by brown rot fungi (Fomitopsis palustris) for 7 weeks and evaluated the shear strength. In the case of steel <b>nail</b> <b>joint,</b> the shear strength of the decayed wood was higher than those of the sound wood.
