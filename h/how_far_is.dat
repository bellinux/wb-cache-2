Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a [...] "beaver tail", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>is</b> the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and rear flank downdraft, and requires {{a balance between the}} outflow and inflow.|$|E

[...] Larson recommended the book to potential readers: [...] "you need to read The Case for Impeachment, a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act committed by the child in the White House". Brent Budowsky reviewed the book for The Hill and praised it, writing: [...] "Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year." [...] He agreed with the premise that the book should start a wider debate in the public: [...] "I am suggesting that Professor Lichtman is right: America should now begin a serious debate about <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>is</b> too for the leader of the land of the free and the home of the brave." ...|$|E
