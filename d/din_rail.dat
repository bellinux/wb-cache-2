25|$|For {{reasons of}} space, many devices, {{especially}} in <b>DIN</b> <b>rail</b> format, use flying leads rather than screw terminals, {{especially for the}} neutral input and FE connections. Additionally, {{because of the small}} form factor, the output cables of some models (Eaton/MEM) are used to form the primary winding of the RCD part, and the outgoing circuit cables must be led through a specially dimensioned terminal tunnel with the current transformer part around it. This can lead to incorrect failed trip results when testing with meter probes from the screw heads of the terminals, rather than from the final circuit wiring.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, RCDs can fit on {{the same}} <b>DIN</b> <b>rail</b> as the MCBs, however the busbar {{arrangements}} in consumer units and distribution boards can make it awkward to use them in this way. [...] If it is desired to protect an individual circuit, an RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection) can be used. This incorporates an RCD and a miniature circuit breaker in one device.|$|E
50|$|The power shelf can be {{combined}} with a distribution and control unit. The distribution unit contains a controller, I/O units and <b>DIN</b> <b>rails</b> for holding AC and DC distribution MCBs, battery connections and battery MCBs, as well as screw terminal sockets for AC input and DC bus connections.|$|R
50|$|Fuseholders may {{be secured}} by screws to a panel, {{attached}} to bus bars, or mounted on <b>DIN</b> <b>rails.</b> For the Neozed fuses, {{there are also}} fuse bases with integrated disconnecting switches. Changing fuses with the circuit off increases {{the safety of the}} user. With new versions of these load disconnecting switches, the fuse cartridges are no longer screwed, but are held by spring clips.|$|R

50|$|In 2003, ITT Cannon {{acquired}} VEAM, {{a manufacturer}} of specialized high reliabiilty <b>DIN</b> <b>rail,</b> multipin, bulkhead sensor and power connectors serving the transportation, military and nuclear markets. As part of ITT Interconnect Solutions, VEAM also offers complete junction box assemblies for mass transit applications.|$|E
5000|$|One of the earliest, and {{probably}} the best known, is DIN 476 [...] - [...] the standard that introduced the A-series paper sizes in 1922 [...] - [...] adopted in 1975 as International Standard ISO 216. Common examples in modern technology include DIN and mini-DIN connectors for electronics, and the <b>DIN</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>DIN</b> <b>rail</b> is a metal rail of a {{standard}} type widely used for mounting circuit breakers and industrial control equipment inside equipment racks. These products are typically made from cold rolled carbon steel sheet with a zinc-plated or chromated bright surface finish. The term derives from the original specifications published by Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN) in Germany, which have since been adopted as European (EN) and international (IEC) standards.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the time, {{the panels}} and the {{breakers}} inserted inside them must {{be by the}} same manufacturer. Each manufacturer has one or more [...] "systems", or kinds of breaker panels, that will only accept breakers of that type. In Europe, this is still the case, despite {{the adoption of a}} standard <b>DIN</b> <b>rail</b> for mounting and a standard cut-out shape, as the positions of the busbar connections are not standardized.|$|E
50|$|Switches are {{available}} in many form factors, including: desktop units not mounted in an enclosure which are typically intended {{to be used in}} a home or office environment outside a wiring closet; rack-mounted switches for use in an equipment rack; large chassis units with swappable module cards; <b>DIN</b> <b>rail</b> mounted for use in industrial environments; and small installation switches, mounted into a cable duct, floor box or communications tower, as found, for example, in FTTO Infrastructures.|$|E
5000|$|In both cases, modern boards {{handling}} supplies up {{to around}} 100 A (CUs) or 200 A (distribution boards) use circuit breakers and RCDs on <b>DIN</b> <b>rail</b> mountings. The main distribution board in an installation will also normally provide a main switch (known as an incomer) which switches the phase and neutral lines {{for the whole}} supply. (n.b., an incomer may be referred to, or sold as, an isolator, but this is problematic, as it will not necessarily {{be used as an}} isolator in the strict sense.) ...|$|E

40|$|Intrinsic safety (IS) is a {{signaling}} {{technique that}} protects plant and personnel from {{the risk of}} fire and explosions by ensuring that the energy transferred to a hazardous area is well below the energy required to ignite the explosive gas atmosphere. IS basic principles are presented in this paper. Two intrinsically safe acoustic emission (AE) transducers with integrated 20 -dB preamplifier are described. A power adaptor {{is designed to provide}} power and signal conditioning for the AE transducers and is to be installed outside the hazardous area. An IS barrier is built into the power adaptor. The power adaptor will be constructed in an IP 20 (IEC 60529) enclosure, which will be mounted on standard 35 -mm <b>DIN</b> <b>rail.</b> The transducers and power adaptor are developed to meet the requirements of electrical apparatus standards UL 60079 - 0 : 2005 and UL 60079 - 11...|$|E
