5|$|Albatrosses live {{much longer}} than other birds; they delay {{breeding}} for longer and invest more <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old. She is the oldest confirmed wild bird {{as well as the}} oldest banded bird in the world.|$|E
5|$|Etty put a {{great deal}} of <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> the painting, {{including}} visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens' island. His use of real corpses became publicly known, causing complaints from some critics. Although he visited Brighton in 1836 to make studies of the sea in connection with the painting, Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting, and the painting of the sea and clouds is rudimentary in comparison {{with the rest of the}} work.|$|E

Hanneman, who was heavily influenced by hardcore punk music, got the other members into the genre, leading Slayer into a faster and more aggressive approach. The band's drummer Dave Lombardo asserted that his hardcore influences pushed him to play faster, contributing to shape his drumming style.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds' life {{histories}} are dramatically {{different from those}} of land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for up to ten years), and invest more <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> fewer young. Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.|$|E

Beginning in 1995, Ikata middle school students have traveled almost yearly to Red Wing for home stays of one to two weeks, and students from Red Wing likewise come to Ikata to learn about life in rural Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} known for some key distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E
5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E
5|$|Iwata's {{proficiency}} with programming quickly {{placed him}} in high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike. He would often {{continue to work on}} weekends and holidays because of his passion. With the company on the verge of bankruptcy, Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo's then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi. With assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company around from its ¥1.5billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years. Lacking experience in management, Iwata put a lot of <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> learning how to better himself, often reading books on the topic and seeking advice from others.|$|E

Their biggest project yet, the team, headed by company {{vice president and chief}} writer Victor Ireland, took to the project seriously, often collaborating with the original Japanese team themselves. New gameplay elements were often added at Ireland's request, including new sequences such as playing Alex's harp to awaken Luna {{near the end of the}} game. Working Designs also put extra <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> the game's packaging, giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering, and having seven separate stamps, each with different artwork, produced for the front of the game discs to increase collection value.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Egypt, Puttick was offered the {{opportunity}} to become Chief of the General Staff, effectively the commander of the New Zealand Military Forces, by the visiting New Zealand prime minister, Peter Fraser. He accepted the role and returned to New Zealand in September 1941. Puttick's focus was on ensuring the manpower of the 2NZEF in North Africa was adequately maintained by reinforcements. In the face of the increasing threat of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific, he also put considerable <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> improving New Zealand's defences. After the Japanese entered the war, he considered the actual threat of invasion to be minimal but continued to encourage improvements in home defence as a means of boosting morale.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the video}} game, Rufus has also {{appeared}} in UDON's Street Fighter comic series. First appearing in their Street Fighter II Turbo comic in February 2009, Rufus is shown to hate Ken for being named the best fighter in America {{as well as for}} the media attention he receives, feeling Ken put no <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> the achievement. Taking Candy along with him, Rufus sets out to find and defeat Ken at the story's conclusion. Later appearing in the second issue of UDON's Street Fighter IV comic book, Rufus attempts to find him through his friend Sakura Kasugano, defeating Dan Hibiki in the process but is himself defeated afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Ron Swanson {{had been}} {{director}} of Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{for six years}} at the time Parks and Recreation began. A staunch Libertarian, with a distinctive mustache, Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government; despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government {{is a waste of}} taxpayer money. Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government. Ron puts almost no <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> his job, and lets his deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do {{the vast majority of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|The Landing at Lae was an amphibious landing to {{the east}} of Lae and then the {{subsequent}} advance on the town during the Salamaua–Lae campaign of World War II. Part of Operation Postern, which was undertaken to capture the Japanese base at Lae, the landing was undertaken between 4 and 6 September 1943 by Australian troops from the 9th Division, supported by US naval forces from the VII Amphibious Force. The first major amphibious operation undertaken by the Australian Army since the failed Gallipoli Campaign, the Australians invested a significant amount of <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> planning the operation.|$|E
5|$|The couple put extra <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he could spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E

5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|When {{the episode}} {{initially}} aired in the United States on NBC on May 23, 1991, it received a Nielsen rating of 11.7 and an audience share of 21—this meant that 11.7% of American households watched the episode, and that 21% of televisions in {{use at the}} time were tuned to it. Seinfeld was the eighteenth most-watched show of the week, and the sixth most-watched show on NBC. NBC executives held a meeting after the broadcast to determine the fate of the show, and decided it would receive a third season order if the writers would put more <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> episode storylines.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
