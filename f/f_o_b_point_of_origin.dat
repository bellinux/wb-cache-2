40|$|Tomatoes are a {{high value}} crop in the United States market, {{especially}} {{during the winter months}} when the main suppliers are Florida and Mexico, and this has created conflict within the industry, off and on, for nearly 50 years. Literature points to imported tomatoes as the cause of lower prices in the United States market (ERS-USDA 2016). This thesis analyzes the effects of fresh tomato volumes both imported from Mexico and shipped from Florida on their shipping point prices and on terminal market prices in the United States. It also investigates the influence of the tomato suspension agreement on shipping point prices and on fresh tomato volumes in the United States, and to what extent temperature and precipitation have an impact on fresh tomatoes volumes. This analysis utilizes historical information of 18 years (1998 – 2015) of tomato volumes in the United States market, prices free on board (<b>F.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>B.)</b> for <b>point</b> of origin sales, prices of wholesale market sales at three main terminal markets, gas prices, weather patterns in the main tomato growing regions of Florida and Mexico, and the Tomato Suspension Agreement floor prices for Mexican tomatoes. The findings of this research show that the volume of Mexican tomatoes have no effect on shipping point prices of round tomatoes from Florida, and even more, neither affect the terminal market prices of round tomatoes from Florida at its main markets (New York and Chicago terminal markets). These findings contradict the accusations of Mexican tomatoes being dump in the market and lowering prices. The {{results of this study suggest}} that by utilizing different growing methods (greenhouses) the Mexican tomato industry has been able to control for temperature changes that can decimate tomato production acquiring a competitive advantage over Florida tomato production. Moreover, the findings suggest that the tomato suspension agreement floor prices affect in like manner volumes and prices of tomatoes from both Mexico and from Florida...|$|R

40|$|In {{establishing}} {{the value of}} imports for tariff assessment, most countries apply duties either to the cost-insurance-freight (c. i. f.) or the free-on-board (<b>f.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>b.)</b> value of the traded good. One effect of using the far more common c. i. f. base is to place a disproportinate burden on countries that have higher freight and insurance costs. Distant countries often not only pay higher transport costs, but are further penalized by disproportionate tariff costs that worsen their competitive disadvantage. The <b>f.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>b.</b> valuation procedure does not penalize exporters for their location, but applies a nominal tariff rate directly to the export costs of each country. Using cost information for six Latin American countries, this paper examines {{the influence of the}} two procedures on the level and incidence of tariff protection. It concludes that transport and insurance costs generally put developing countries at a disadvantage (compared to developed countries) on interregional trade and that the relatively high Latin American tariffs on c. i. f. prices further worsen their competitive position. To correct the bias against trade between developing countries, it is recommended that <b>f.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>b.</b> valuation procedures used by developed countries be adopted. This change would also reduce tariff barriers considerably.

40|$|A supply-response {{model for}} Florida fresh {{tomatoes}} is specified {{to analyze the}} impacts of the U. S. Department of Commerce's suspension agreement which governs imports of fresh tomatoes from Mexico. The particular {{focus is on the}} impact of the "reference" price which causes Mexican imports in a given week to cease if import prices in the prior week fall to the reference price. Using weekly weather data, a growing degree day (GDD) variable is constructed which predicts week of first harvest and duration of harvest. The GDD variable is used to construct the appropriate, variable lag length for weekly acres planted in four Florida production regions. A composite switching-regime model is estimated in which the regime prior to the suspension agreement occurs at a known time. The other two regimes occur when Nogales <b>f.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>b.</b> price are "near" or not near the reference price.

40|$|In this paper, whe {{show that}} the {{strategic}} choice of spatial price policy under duopoly crucially depends on the rules of price competition. Thisse and Vives (1988) show that spatial price discrimination is a dominant strategy when the mill pricing firm is the leader and the discriminatory firm is the follower. When the leader-follower roles are reversed we find that equilibrium pricing policies depend on the consumer's reservation value. The pricing policy game has two equilibria in pure strategies, either both firms price uniformly (<b>f.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>b.)</b> or both firms price discriminate, when the reservation value is low. For intermediate levels of the reservation value, price discrimination is a dominant strategy and the pricing policy game {{is similar to a}} Prisoner's Dilemma. When the consumer reservation value is large enough we obtain asymmetric equilibria in which one firm prices according to <b>f.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>b.</b> and the other price discriminates.
