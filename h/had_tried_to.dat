5|$|All {{this changed}} with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E
5|$|Brought to Constantinople, Xiphias was tonsured and banished to Antigone, {{one of the}} Princes Islands. Following {{his return}} to the capital after his Georgian expedition, Basil II had most of his co-conspirators imprisoned and their estates confiscated. The patrikios Pherses the Iberian was executed, while two {{imperial}} chamberlains were also killed: one by Basil's own hand, and the other, who <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> poison the Emperor, was thrown to the beasts.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Nhu {{tried to}} assassinate Sihanouk by sending him a parcel bomb.

5|$|Meanwhile, on 20 February 1948, Prokofiev's {{estranged wife}} Lina {{was arrested for}} 'espionage', as she <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> send money to her mother in Spain. After nine months of interrogation, she was sentenced by a three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR to 20 years of hard labour.

5|$|On 6 January 1948 a British European Airways Vickers VC.1 Viking {{flying from}} Renfrew Airport to RAF Northolt crashed in a {{ploughed}} field in Ruislip, {{five miles from}} the runway.

5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought {{the situation was}} hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 {{to convert it}} from iron to steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, {{the stability of the}} trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E
5|$|The next court {{session was}} on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an {{attorney}} for the employment agency that V.

5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E

5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220. The fleet was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had been agreed at the congress in 481 BC. Although Themistocles <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu {{and several other}} {{prominent}} officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia {{turned a blind eye}} to Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{headed for}} the cellar, joining his younger brother and confidant Ngô Đình Nhu, and his wife Madame Nhu. Brigadier General Nguyễn Khánh, {{at the time the}} Chief of Staff of the ARVN, climbed over the palace wall to reach Diệm during the siege. Khanh lived in the city center, close to the palace, and awoken by the gunfire, he drove towards the action. The {{plotters}} <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> put him under house arrest {{at the start of the}} coup, but were unaware that he moved house. Khanh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quan Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited until some time before 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ricasoli {{stands on}} the easternmost {{peninsula}} {{on the east side}} of the Grand Harbour. The promontory was originally known as Rinella Point or Punta Sottile. In 1531, two leaders of a slave rebellion and ten others who took a prominent role, who <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> take over Fort St. Angelo and escape from Malta, were tortured and then hanged on the peninsula, which became known as Gallows' Point (Maltese: Ponta tal-Forka) afterwards. During the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, the Ottomans built an artillery battery on the peninsula in order to bombard Fort St. Elmo.|$|E

Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped and work on Crazy Taxi Next was transferred to Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller, which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested by Next.|$|E
