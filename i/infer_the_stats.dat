40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} {{of the head and}} neck (SCCHN) is the 5 th most common cancer worldwide. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) is overexpressed in SCCHN and associated with decreased survival. A transcription factor decoy was designed to bind to the DNA binding domain of STAT 3, abrogating expression of downstream target genes. The antitumor mechanisms of transcription factor decoys, including <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy, are incompletely understood. STAT 3 forms heterodimers with STAT 1 suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy may interact with STAT 1.

Stimulation of <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 1 pathway with IFN-ƒ× did not mitigate STAT 3 decoy-mediated growth inhibition. STAT 3 decoy-mediated inhibition of STAT 1 signaling did not abrogate its antitumor effects in vitro. Studies using STAT 3 knockout cells indicated that STAT 3 is necessary for decoy-mediated growth inhibition. <b>The</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy was then studied in combination with an EGFR inhibitor and/or a Bcl-XL inhibitor as a therapeutic strategy for SCCHN.

Based on the known existence of STAT 1 -STAT 3 heterodimers, the high sequence homology between STAT 1 and STAT 3, as well as expression of both STAT 1 and STAT 3 in SCCHN, we examined whether <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy interferes with STAT 1 signaling. SCCHN cell lines with different STAT 1 expression levels (but similar STAT 3 levels) were used. Both cell lines were sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy compared with a mutant control decoy. Intact STAT 1 signaling was demonstrated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) -mediated induction of STAT 1 phosphorylation (Tyr 701) and interferon-regulatory factor- 1 (IRF- 1) expression. Treatment with <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy (but not a mutant control decoy) resulted in inhibition of IRF- 1 protein expression in both cell lines, indicating specific inhibition of STAT 1 signaling by <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy. Because STAT 1 is a potential tumor suppressor, we also investigated whether STAT 1 signaling mitigated the therapeutic efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy. In both PCI- 15 B and UM- 22 B cells, STAT 1 siRNA treatment resulted in decreased STAT 1 expression, without altering the antitumor activity of <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy.
