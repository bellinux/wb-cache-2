5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b> To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
25|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> {{contains}} {{an arrangement of}} blades usually powered by an electric motor {{in order to produce}} airflow for the purpose of creating comfort (particularly in the heat), ventilation, or exhaust. Between the years 1882 and 1886, New Orleans resident Schuyler Skaats Wheeler invented the first <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the problem}} of the {{shortened}} chimney was overcome by the use of an <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> to improve draught, but between 1996 and 1997 the chimney was repaired and restored to its full original height of 82 feet (25 m).|$|E

50|$|The MP15AC {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from the DC models. Instead of the front-mounted radiator intake and belt-driven fan used on all previous EMD switchers, these have intakes on the lower forward nose sides and <b>electric</b> <b>fans.</b> Side intakes allowed the unit to take in cooler air, and the <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> improved a serious reliability issue found in its earlier DC sisters.|$|R
25|$|A fan heater, {{also called}} a forced {{convection}} heater, is {{a variety of}} convection heater that includes an <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> {{to speed up the}} airflow. They operate with considerable noise caused by the fan. They have a moderate risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings. Their advantage is that they are more compact than heaters that use natural convection.|$|E
25|$|An {{oil burner}} is a heating device which burns fuel oil. The oil is {{directed}} under pressure through a nozzle {{to produce a}} fine spray, which is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through by an <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b> In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the oil burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in November 2009, Merzbow started {{releasing}} archival {{material from}} the 1980s and 1990s, both reissues and previously unreleased material, several of which were released on cassette. The Blossoming Noise label reissued the 1980s cassettes E-Study, Collection 004, Collection 005, Normal Music, and Flesh Metal Orgasm. The Kibbutz cassette was reissued on vinyl by Urashima. Other cassettes of unreleased material include Untitled Nov 1989, 9888A, April 1992, and Variations for <b>Electric</b> <b>Fan.</b> 2010–2013 saw the release several archival box sets; Merzbient, Merzphysics, Merzmorphosis, Lowest Music & Arts 1980–1983, and Duo.|$|E
50|$|Home {{appliances}} The Orion Electronics {{was founded}} in 1913. Its main profiles were the production of electrical switches, sockets, wires, incandescent lamps, <b>electric</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>electric</b> kettles, and various household electronics.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1920, and <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> in the main hall in 1928.|$|R

25|$|Lionel's first train, the Electric Express, was not {{intended}} for sale to consumers, but rather, as a storefront display. Delivered in December 1900, it operated on a brass track and was powered by a battery and a motor Cowen originally intended to use in an <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b> Cowen hoped to use the public's fascination with railroads and electricity to capture the public's attention and direct it to the goods for sale. Members of the public started approaching store owners about buying the trains instead, prompting Lionel to begin making toy trains for the general public. Lionel ended up selling 12 examples of the Electric Express.|$|E
25|$|Fail safe core. LFTRs {{can include}} a freeze plug {{at the bottom}} {{that has to be}} {{actively}} cooled, usually by a small <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b> If the cooling fails, say because of a power failure, the fan stops, the plug melts, and the fuel drains to a subcritical passively cooled storage facility. This not only stops the reactor, also the storage tank can more easily shed the decay heat from the short-lived radioactive decay of irradiated nuclear fuels. Even {{in the event of a}} major leak from the core such as a pipe breaking, the salt will spill onto the kitchen-sink-shaped room the reactor is in, which will drain the fuel salt by gravity into the passively cooled dump tank.|$|E
25|$|A {{vacuum cleaner}} uses a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} vacuum cleaner, his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an <b>electric</b> <b>fan,</b> a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|E
50|$|Centrifugal {{switches}} {{were also}} used in early <b>electric</b> <b>fans,</b> particularly those made in the 1900s and early 1910s.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{consumer}} behaviour develops great interest for consumers, students, scientists, and marketers. As consumers, we need insights {{into our own}} consumption related decisions: what we buy, why we buy, and how we buy. The aim {{of the study is}} to cover entire research about consumer behaviour towards <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> and different factors affecting their buying decision. A sample of 200 consumers of <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> is taken. Questionnaire has been analysed with the help of pie diagram & bar chart and different interpretations have been made to study the impact of consumer behaviour towards <b>electric</b> <b>fans.</b> This study concluded that the brand whose after Sales Service is more satisfactory get the positive response from customers. Price is the most important attribute which attracts consumer towards particular bran...|$|R

500|$|Loh sought {{his wife}} at Lim's flat and ended up staying to observe her treatment. [...] He was persuaded by her to {{participate}} in the electro-shock therapies. [...] In the early hours of 7January 1980, Loh sat with Hoe, their arms locked together and their feet in separate tubs of water. [...] Lim applied a large voltage to Loh, who was electrocuted, while Hoe was stunned into unconsciousness. [...] When she woke, Lim requested her to lie to the police about Loh's death. [...] Hoe repeated the story Lim had given her, saying that her husband had been electrocuted in their bedroom when he tried to switch on a faulty <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> in the dark. [...] The coroner recorded an open verdict, and the police made no further investigations.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{designed}} a version {{driven by a}} complex series of clutches running from the engine to a large single fan {{at the back of}} the car. Therefore, the faster the engine ran, the stronger the suction effect. Like the Lotus, it had sliding [...] "skirts" [...] that sealed the gap between the sides of the cars and the ground. These prevented excessive air from being sucked into the low pressure area under the car and dissipating the ground effect. There was a rule banning [...] "moveable aerodynamic devices", but the fan also drew air through a horizontally mounted radiator over the engine. Using a fan to assist cooling was legal—Brabham had used a small <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> to this effect on the BT45Cs at the South American races at the start of the year—and Brabham claimed that this was the primary effect of the new device. These claims were lent some legitimacy by the cooling system design issues that had affected the original design at the start of the year.|$|E

However, <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> have been primarily their most profitable product, {{on which they}} remain the world's leading manufacturer of electronically-operated fans in different varieties, such as orbit fan, wall fan, desk fan, pedestal fan, living fan, and stand fan. KDK also manufactures all <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> sold under the National (brand) (now a defunct manufacturer of non-audiovisual products of Panasonic) and Panasonic (brand).|$|R
2500|$|During {{the runs}} for the restaging of the trials Novelty was run with an <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> (powered by a petrol generator) {{in place of the}} blower. Even {{allowing}} for this in the final calculation Novelty was much more efficient than Sans Pareil ...|$|E
2500|$|The final {{major changes}} to the Spider came in 1990, when it was given Bosch Motronic {{electronic}} fuel injection and full-width plastic bumpers {{the same color as}} the car. [...] It gained an <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> and [...] 164-style rear lights stretching across the width of the trunk, and lost both front under-bumper and rear trunk-lid spoilers. [...] This also marked the first generation with on-board diagnostics and an optional automatic transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Early NON {{performances}} {{were designed to}} offer choice to audience members who might otherwise expect only a prefabricated and totally passive entertainment experience. Rice has stated that he considers his performances to be [...] "de-indoctrination rites". Rice has performed using a shoe polisher, the [...] "rotoguitar" [...] (an electric guitar with an <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> on it), and other homemade instruments. He has also used found sounds, played at a volume just below the threshold of pain, to entice his audiences to endure his high decibel sound experiments.|$|E
50|$|Engine-driven {{fans are}} often {{regulated}} by a viscous-drive clutch from the drivebelt, which slips {{and reduces the}} fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling radiator <b>fans.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>fans</b> are controlled by a thermostatic switch or the engine control unit. <b>Electric</b> <b>fans</b> also {{have the advantage of}} giving good airflow and cooling at low engine revs or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic.|$|R
5000|$|The Korea Consumer Protection Board (KCPB), a South Korean {{government-funded}} public agency, {{issued a}} consumer safety alert in 2006 warning that [...] "asphyxiation from <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> and air conditioners" [...] was among South Korea's five most common summer accidents or injuries, {{according to data}} they collected. The KCPB published the following:If bodies are exposed to <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> or air conditioners for too long, it causes the bodies to lose water and causes hypothermia. If directly in contact with current from a fan, this could lead to death from an increase of carbon dioxide saturation concentration and decrease of oxygen concentration. The risks are higher {{for the elderly and}} patients with respiratory problems. From 2003 to 2005, a total of 20 cases were reported through the CISS involving asphyxiations caused by leaving <b>electric</b> <b>fans</b> and air conditioners on while sleeping. To prevent asphyxiation, timers should be set, wind direction should be rotated, and doors should be left open.|$|R

2500|$|Solar Roof Package: {{includes}} the Navigation Package and adds a power tilt/slide moonroof {{along with a}} solar powered ventilation system that uses an <b>electric</b> <b>fan</b> {{to help keep the}} vehicle cooler when parked under the sun by venting the interior's heated air with the outdoors. [...] The solar roof was originally intended to assist in charging the vehicle's battery, but the system was configured to only power ventilation when {{it was found that the}} battery-charging configuration created electromagnetic interference that affected the radio. A new remote air-conditioning feature allows the driver to activate the air conditioner prior to entering the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|When ordered {{with the}} factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to 5000 pounds. [...] For the station wagon, {{this could be}} raised to 7000 pounds {{with the use of}} a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire {{pressure}} to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control. [...] The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by [...] the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one <b>electric</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Examining the Bathysphere in {{preparation}} for resumed dives, Beebe {{found that it was}} in need of considerable repair. [...] The steel body of the Bathysphere was as strong as ever, but the quartz windows had developed minute fractures which would prevent them from withstanding the pressure of the deep sea, and one of the copper bolts for the hatch was found to be damaged due to the explosive decompression after the failed test dive in 1932. [...] In addition to replacing these parts of the Bathysphere, Beebe also had it installed with a new system of valves which could regulate the release of oxygen much more precisely than before, and a barometer to show the increase in pressure if oxygen was flowing too quickly. [...] The palm-leaf fans to circulate air past the chemical trays were replaced with a small <b>electric</b> <b>fan,</b> powered by the same cable that powered the searchlight, and the searchlight itself was replaced with a far more powerful one.|$|E
