40|$|The undersea {{environment}} places special {{demands on}} the design of electro-optic and fiber-optic systems. Encapsulation in hermetically sealed pressure containers is one solution to the problems associated with deployment at depth. An alternative approach which avoids the inconvenience of pressure containers and pressure <b>hull</b> <b>penetrators</b> is to operate the system in a fluid-filled, pressure equalized package which subjects the components to the ambient pressure encountered at depth. The data presented here characterize the behavior of GaAlAs, single mode, injection laser diodes under conditions of fluid immersion and hydrostatic pres-sure. Fluid immersion affects laser operation primarily by reducing the end facet reflec-tivity and thereby raising the threshold current. Elevated hydrostatic pressure also resul-ted in increased threshold current due to pressure induced changes in the band structure of the active layer material. Spectral changes were particularly evident with pressure induced mode hopping being the most significant effect...|$|E

The simulation model is directed mainly for products, components and common components to different products, all with a discrete demand and manufactured based on a production to order system. It considers the fact that manufacturing process will rarely yield lots that are free of defective parts and therefore the planned manufacturing quantities should consider that these will be present and reduce the final outcome of parts. The uncertainty of the amount of defective parts will probably cause the quantity manufactured to have a shortage or an excess of parts depending on the existing discrepancy between the occurring amount of defective parts and the one originally estimated. Different costs will exist according to the situation and the minimum total cost will be the one desired. The simulation model has been applied for the manufacturing of underwater electrical <b>hull</b> <b>penetrators.</b> Three products with common components have been selected and their demands arbitrarily chosen as shown: (See more in text. ...|$|E
