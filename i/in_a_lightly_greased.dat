30|$|The dough was {{prepared}} by mixing 100  g of flour, 3.2  g of yeast, 3.0  g of salt, 12.0  g of sugar, 8.0  g of milk powder, 6.0  g of butter, and 120  g of water. The wild-type TsPOx or its mutants was supplemented at the dosage of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00  nkat/g flour. Dough mixing was performed {{at room temperature}} for 3  min. Mixed dough was then transferred to <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> <b>greased</b> beaker and incubated at 37  °C <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fermentation cabinet. The fermentation in the breadmaking process continued for 90  min. After fermentation, the dough was punched, transferred to a greased metal baking plate, and incubated {{at room temperature for}} a final proof of 45  min. The proofed dough was subsequently baked at 180  °C for 30  min. The loaf volume and weight were measured after cooling down to room temperature for 60  min.|$|R
