Furthermore, due to the hydrophilic nature of the aminophenyl group, CoAP has a strong affinity for the water/DCE interface as evidenced by lipophilicity mapping calculations and surface tension measurements, facilitating the protonation of the CoAP-O 2 complex and its reduction by ferrocene.

The electrochemical process involved the reduction of silver ion in the aqueous phase by an organic-phase electron donor (butylferrocene). The silver nucleation and growth process was investigated using potential step chronoamperometry, and the resulting current-time transients were analysed to extract nucleus numbers. At larger pipettes, with diameters of several micrometers, multi-particle nucleation was observed and optical microscopy provided direct evidence for metal electrodeposition at the liquid/liquid interface. For pipettes with radii of 0. 5 mum or smaller, the current-time behaviour was consistent with single particle generation. Under some conditions, detachment of the particle from the liquid/liquid interface was inferred from the current-time characteristics. and it is suggested that controlled-detachment from micropipettes could provide a method for the deposition of small metal structures on surfaces.

Ion transfer calculations indicate the formation of [AuCl 2]− at RSH/Au ratios from 0. 2 – 2 with a time-dependent variation observed over several days. At RSH/Au ratios above 2 and after time periods greater than 24 h, the formation of Au(I) SR is also observed. The relative concentrations of reaction products observed at the liquid/liquid interface are in excellent agreement with those observed by XAFS for the corresponding reaction in a single homogeneous phase. BH 4 – ion transfer reactions between water and DCE indicate that the reduction of [AuCl 4]− or [AuCl 2]− to Au nanoparticles by BH 4 – proceeds in the bulk organic phase. On the other hand, BH 4 – was unable to reduce the insoluble [Au(I) SR]n species to Au nanoparticles. The number and size of the nanoparticles formed was dependent on the concentration ratio of RSH/Au, as well as the experimental duration because of the competing formation of the [Au(I) SR]n precipitate.

The magnitude of the net photocurrent is essentially determined by {{the balance of the}} kinetics of these two processes, which can be controlled by tuning the Galvani potential difference between the two phases.

This was probably due to a facilitated transfer of the supporting-electrolyte cation in W (i. e., Li+, Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +). In order to explain the mechanism, we also carried out a determination of the double-layer capacity of the interface by ac voltammetry and potential-modulated fluorescence (PMF) spectroscopy measurements. The results have suggested that monocationic diOC 2 (3) and the supporting-electrolyte anion in DCE {tetrakis(4 -chlorophenyl) borate} are co-adsorbed (probably in multilayers) at the <b>DCE</b> | W <b>interface</b> and, into the adsorption layer, the above cations of small sizes are intercalated, and thus transferred more easily. This facilitation effect is more significant for alkali-earth metal ions than for the alkali metal ions.

The concept of this new mode of SECM is to generate a reactant in an initial potential step at a tip ultramicroelectrode (UME) positioned close to a target interface. The electrogenerated species diffuses from the tip to the interface, where it may bl: involved in a chemical process. The reactant is subsequently collected by electrolysis in a second potential step, and {{the form of the}} corresponding current-time curve provides :information {{on the nature of the}} interaction between the initial tip-generated species and the interface. If the species is consumed in an irreversible interfacial process, the current flow during the second potential step is less than when the interface is inert with respect to the species of interest. The theoretical predictions are first examined with DPSC studies on the electrogeneration and collection of ferricyanide ions from aqueous ferrocyanide solutions, at a tip positioned close to aqueous/glass, aqueous/ 1, 2 -dichloroethane (<b>DCE),</b> and aqueous/air <b>interfaces,</b> as mod-l examples of inert liquid/solid, liquid/liquid, and liquid/gas interfaces. The case of an active interfacial process is illustrated through studies of the electrogeneration and collection of Br- 2, from aqueous sulfuric acid solutions of potassium bromide, at a tip positioned close to aqueous/DCE and aqueous/air interfaces. The transfer of Br- 2 across these interfaces is found to be irreversible and effectively diffusion-controlled on the SECM rime scale, putting a lower limit on the interfacial transfer rate constant of 0. 5 cm s(- 1).

40|$|SECM-DPSC is {{extended}} as an approach for probing {{the transfer of}} a target electrogenerated species across the interface between two immiscible phases, by developing a theoretical model for reversible phase transfer. The SECM-DPSC technique involves the electrogeneration of a target species at an UME positioned close to an interface in an initial (forward) potential step. After a defined period, this species is then collected back at the UME by reversing the potential step. The numerical treatment for calculating the UME current-time response during the forward and reverse potential steps is outlined, without restriction on the partition coefficient of the solute between the two phases, thereby building on an earlier model (Slevin, C. J.; Macpherson, J. V.; Unwin, P. R. J. Phys. Chem. B 1997, 101, 10851). It is shown that the technique {{can be used to}} measure both the partition coefficient and kinetics of phase transfer.

In contrast, deca-methylferrocenium ion does not appear to transfer across the interface under the defined conditions.

Upon band-gap illumination, photocurrent responses are observed in the presence of ferrocene in the organic phase.

The interfacial reaction is investigated using an ultramicroelectrode (UME) positioned directly opposite the orifice from which the droplet expands. The UME measures directly the concentration profiles that develop at the expanding droplet due to the interfacial process.

The depletion of cupric ion in the aqueous phase, adjacent to the advancing droplet, is probed amperometrically at a fixed ultramicroelectrode. Time-dependent spatially resolved concentration measurements made in this way {{could be related to}} the kinetics of the extraction process, by solving a well-posed mass transport problem. The extraction process is immeasurably slow at pH I in the aqueous bulk phase, but becomes faster with increasing pH, ultimately attaining a transport-controlled rate on the MEMED timescale at pH 4. A first-order dependence of the extraction rate on the bulk concentration of Cu 2 + (1. 0 - 6. 0 mM) was found, while there was an inverse first-order correlation with proton concentration (pH 2. 0 - 3. 0). The dependence of the extraction rate constant on [HL] in the DCE phase was studied in detail. The extraction rate was first-order in [HL] in the range 10 - 200 mM. A mechanistic model for Cu 2 + extraction by HL with the formation of CuL+ at the water I <b>DCE</b> <b>interface</b> as the rate-limiting step, is proposed to explain these observations.

40|$|AbstractVoltammetry for charge (ion and electron) {{transfer}} at two immiscible electrolyte solutions (VCTIES) {{has been}} used to provide insight into the ligand exchange and redox processes taking place during the interfacial reaction of aqueous hexacyanoferrate(II) with tetrachloroaurate ([AuCl 4]−) in 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE). VCTIES permitted the detection of the reactants, intermediates and products at the liquid/liquid interface. A model for the sequence of interfacial processes was established with the support of speciation analysis of the key elementary reactions by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The potential-driven transfer of [AuCl 4]− from the organic into the aqueous phase is followed by reduction and ligand exchange by the aqueous hexacyanoferrate(II) to form dicyanoaurate ([Au(CN) 2]−). Inferences from the reactions point to the likely formation of [AuCl 2]− during the reduction sequence. The reaction is influenced by ligand exchange equilibria between [AuCl 4]−, [AuCl 3 (OH) ]– and [AuCl 2 (OH) 2]– which are shown to be dependent on the chloride ion concentration and pH of the solution. The difference between the Gibbs energy of transfer at the water | <b>DCE</b> <b>interface</b> (ΔGDCEW°) of AuCl 4 – and [AuCl 3 (OH) ]–, and the difference between [AuCl 3 (OH) ]– and [AuCl 2 (OH) 2]– were found to change by a value close to the difference between ΔGDCEW° of Cl– and that of OH–. The intermediate Au(I) species, [AuCl 2]−, was seen to decompose at neutral pH {{and in the absence of}} Cl– in water to form metallic Au, although it was stable in > 10 mM HCl for an hour. Time-dependent VCTIES and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) speciation analysis of the homogeneous aqueous phase indicate that reaction between [AuCl 4]− and hexacyanoferrate(II) is accompanied by the formation of an intermediate ionic species, formed when the concentration of [AuCl 4]− is close to that of hexacyanoferrate(II). This species, whose identity was not precisely determined, was also generated by reaction between [AuCl 2]− and hexacyanoferrate(III). The species is shown by VCTIES to be more hydrophilic than [Au(CN) 2]−, [AuCl 2]− and [AuCl 4]−...|$|E
40|$|Lipophilicity of {{compounds}} with therapeutic interest {{represents one of}} the most important physicochemical parameters in predicting and interpreting transport processes across biological barriers. This property is commonly measured as a drug | membrane partitioning by its distribution in a biphasic system, such as a water | oil system. The lipophilicity is a key parameter used in a variety of fields that may predict absorption and other transport properties of drugs in the human body. For a long time, the understanding of the lipophilicity of ionisable and ionic drugs was limited by the lack of reliable experimental methods to estimate the partition coefficients. Recently the introduction of cyclic voltammetry has filled this gap, opening new perspectives for its use in drug design transfer through a mimic of a biological membrane. The aim of this thesis was to develop new systems for the study of pH-lipophilicity profiles of neutral and ionisable compounds and to illustrate the various contributions of those in order to extend the applications for drug studies. The existing electrochemical methodology has revealed a number of limitations, which calls for further development of existing procedures. In particular, it has proved difficulty to investigate the partitioning of highly hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds. Consequently, new systems with various phase ratios have been developed in order to extend the electrochemical measurements to medicinal chemistry. In the present work, two systems named "drop system" using a small aqueous phase and "liquid membrane system" using a small organic phase have been developed to study charge transfer reactions. The drop system is based on the simple deposition of an aqueous drop containing a redox couple onto the surface of a platinum electrode and immersed into an organic electrolyte solution. The electrode | water | oil interfaces are in "series". The voltammetric response depends on the coupling of the redox reactions on the solid electrode with the charge transfer reactions at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES), being either ion transfer (IT) or electron transfer (ET). This new drop system ensures a rapid equilibrium between the phases and has been used to study the lipophilic molecules. The liquid membrane system consists in a small organic phase either supported by a hydrophobic membrane or hold between two cellulose membranes placed between two aqueous phases, leading also to two interfaces in "series". The flowing of current across the liquid membrane is associated with two ion transfer reactions across the two polarised liquid | liquid interfaces in "series". This new methodology is described as a useful tool to study the transfer of highly hydrophilic ions, such as amino acids. Furthermore, a fundamental work on the miniaturization of liquid | liquid partition chromatography in a microchannel has been completed in order to offer a better understanding of the drug transport mechanisms. In the present work, a stationary liquid phase was immobilized in a microchannel using a porous polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The final goal is to develop a high-throughput method for logP measurements in microchips based on partition chromatography. A computer simulation was performed using a finite element method. The model is validated by comparison of the simulated data with both analytical and experimental data. Finally, transfer reactions across an adsorbed phospholipid monolayer (constituent of biological membrane) at the water | <b>DCE</b> <b>interface</b> were studied by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). This technique consists in measuring the interfacial tension at different potential step. The transfer of hydrophilic cations, like amino acids was found to be facilitated by the formation of a complex between the cation or proton with the phospholipid, followed by desorption of the phospholipid monolayer from the interface. The method allows to understand the drug interaction with biological membranes within the transport process across them and to access to the different association constants in the organic phase. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates how the analytical electrochemistry at liquid | liquid interfaces can be extended to evaluate the fundamental thermodynamic parameters of various ionic compounds. The systems used herein are examples of new ways to study the lipophilicity of drugs with applications in drug screening pharmaceutical research and development...|$|E
