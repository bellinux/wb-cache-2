40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to address}} the green {{purchasing}} gap by: exploring environmentally conscious consumers’ mental representation of the barriers responsible for the green purchasing gap; assessing which barriers are perceived as the most relevant in hampering the purchase of <b>green</b> <b>products</b> for environmentally conscious consumers; and investigating the relationships among these barriers. Although consumers are increasingly concerned about environmental deterioration, the current market share of <b>green</b> <b>products</b> remains fairly low. Design/methodology/approach – An introspective qualitative study is conducted; 51 environmentally conscious consumers showing a green purchasing gap are interviewed, and the data are analysed with a cognitive mapping technique (Decision Explorer software) and Freeman’ structural indices (UCINET software). Findings – Higher price and scarce availability of <b>green</b> <b>products</b> are the main barriers to green purchasing. However, consumers’ perceptions of price and availability may vary by changing other barriers (e. g. <b>green</b> <b>products</b> displacement inside the store and in-store communication). Originality/value – This work reconstructs the decisional premises of environmentally conscious consumers’ choices to not purchase <b>green</b> <b>products,</b> identifies the most relevant barriers to green purchasing behaviour and the relationships between these barriers. With this knowledge, marketers of <b>green</b> <b>products</b> can focus {{on the most important}} barriers so that interventions in these barriers may change environmentally conscious consumers’ perceptions of other related barriers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>products</b> are {{becoming}} part of contemporary consumer cultures and part of everyday life. But how are <b>green</b> <b>products</b> constructed? What kind of <b>green</b> <b>products</b> are constructed? And what happens as these <b>green</b> <b>products</b> are constructed? The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute a socio-cultural and critical understanding of green marketing by exploring and illustrating how marketing practices work to construct <b>green</b> <b>products</b> as meaningful material-symbolic artefacts in practice. Departing from an understanding of marketing as practice I analyse how a <b>green</b> outdoor <b>product</b> - a t-shirt - was constructed as green through the marketing practices of the Nordic Nature Shops. Focusing on this retail corporation and examining the practices of trail making, attending and selling, it is suggested that these t-shirts become green through a process of socio-material inscription. Through marketing practices green moral is generated and linked to the t-shirts potentially making them desirable consumption objects to be used in the construction of consumers green identities. However, this process of green making is a difficult accomplishment with ambiguous outcomes. While the tendency to inscribe commercial products with morality can be interpreted as an indication of the development of a more ethically reflective consumer culture, it can also be argued to lead to the commercialization of moralit...|$|R
