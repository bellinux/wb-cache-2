5|$|Darwin {{thought of}} having <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> {{published}} mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood urged that it be published separately. On 30 December the question was settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of William Broderip that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the Narrative. Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming <b>his</b> <b>diary,</b> and incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his Journal and Remarks (now commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle) in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839.|$|E

5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that the eastern gale had {{turned it into a}} conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.|$|E
5|$|Phips finally sailed for England on November 17. Increase Mather {{was asked}} to go along in support but decided against it, citing the {{difficulty}} of the journey, though <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> from the time is full of yearning to return to England. They were still friendly, but it seems their coalition and partnership was in tatters.|$|E
5|$|Reed {{was very}} {{impressed}} with this information, and advocated for the Hastings Cutoff. None of the party received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; in <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.|$|E

5|$|After the 2/48th Battalion {{completed}} its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica, they were moved further {{along the coast}} to Gazala. Then, just {{as they began to}} dig in, the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk in response to the German Afrika Korps' advance. They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote in <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> about his constant fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with {{what he saw as}} her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} in <b>his</b> <b>diary,</b> Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E

5|$|In June and July 1991, {{the short}} armed {{conflict}} in Slovenia {{came to a}} speedy end, {{partly because of the}} ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia. It was later revealed that a military strike against Slovenia, followed by a planned withdrawal, was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and Borisav Jović, then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency.

5|$|On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski's wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski {{remarried}} soon after, {{taking the}} hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opalińska, daughter of future Crown Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage {{was the cause of}} his death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote in <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac.

5|$|The British {{casualties}} were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but {{a member of}} Howe's staff wrote in <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded.

The American victory raised morale in the ranks, even among {{those who had not}} been engaged. It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington's command.|$|E
