40|$|Recently, a novel <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> (DS) {{upscaling}} {{method has}} been successfully applied for the upscaling of US tight gas reservoir model. However, this approach does not work {{very well in the}} conventional SPE 10 waterflood reservoir model. Therefore, in this work, the goal is to figure out why this approach does not work in another model and how to improve this DS upscaling algorithm. Detailed analysis shows that there are three issues that need to be resolved for a more robust algorithm. The first issue is about the specification of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> time that is needed to define the transient state <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> in the fine cell. In the previous work, the time selection rule is not clearly stated. Too small or too large time values can lead to an overestimated or underestimated upscaling result. In this study, I find that the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> time can be correlated with the fine cell diffusive time of flight (DTOF). By means of a series of sensitivity test, I get the conclusion that we can use the pore volume weighted average of the DTOF square to determine the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> time. The second issue is related to the calculation of the effective transmissibility. In the case of upscaling the homogenous model, the previous proposed effective transmissibility calculation method gives us a wrong result. In this study, by studying the internal pressure profile in the coarse cells, I propose to use the fine cell pressures immediately adjacent to the coarse cell interface to determine an effective face permeability and apply the effective permeability to the calculation of steady state transmissibility in the simulator. The effective transmissibility obtained from this method is correct when the model is homogenous. The third issue {{has to do with the}} no flow boundary condition used in the local upscaling. In upscaling, we often encounter such problem that the no flow boundary condition is a bad approximation and to improve the accuracy of the result, we need to consider the existence of boundary effect. In this study, I generalize the DS upscaling algorithm by adding a buffering region around the upscaling coarse cells to reduce the impact of unrealistic boundary condition on the inter-cell effective transmissibility calculation. The buffering region is determined according to the fine cell DTOF in the target coarse cells and by using the exponential function in the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> term, I propose a cut-off criterion to exclude the cells that are not necessary for upscaling. Based on all the analysis above, I applied an improved upscaling algorithm for the upscaling of the SPE 10 model. It turns out that the simulation results from the new upscaled model have a good match with the fine scale results, which gives us the confidence on this improved algorithm...|$|R

2500|$|Nutrient source {{apportionment}} is used {{to estimate}} the nutrient load from various sectors entering water bodies, following attenuation or treatment. Agriculture is typically the principal source of nitrogen in water bodies in Europe, whereas in many countries households and industries {{tend to be the}} dominant contributors of phosphorus. Where water quality is impacted by excess nutrients, load source apportionment models can support the proportional and pragmatic management of water resources by identifying the pollution sources. There are two broad approaches to load apportionment modelling, (i) load-orientated approaches which apportion origin based on in-stream monitoring data and (ii) source-orientated approaches where amounts of diffuse, or nonpoint source pollution, emissions are calculated using models typically based on export coefficients from catchments with similar characteristics. For example, the Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) takes the latter approach, estimating the relative contribution of sources of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface waters in Irish catchments without in-stream monitoring data by integrating information on point discharges (urban wastewater, industry and septic tank systems), <b>diffuse</b> <b>sources</b> (pasture, arable, forestry, etc.), and catchment data, including hydrogeological characteristics.|$|E
