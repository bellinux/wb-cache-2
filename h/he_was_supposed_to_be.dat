5|$|The {{first time}} a {{prisoner}} tried {{to escape from the}} Bain was in 1993, when a 38-year-old prisoner was able to escape while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cleaning ice from the parking lot in front of the ship. The guard who was responsible for the inmate was suspended without pay due to the incident.|$|E

5|$|Jackson's {{faith in}} Johnson {{to balance the}} ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost the Democrats votes in the South, where his {{relationship}} with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner much support from the West, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and war hero. He even failed to deliver {{his home state of}} Kentucky for the Democrats. Regardless, the Democrats still won the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit {{in honor of the}} Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} {{on the world stage}} at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding {{in the back of a}} van when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries were years of {{lawlessness}} on Lundy, {{particularly during the}} ownership of Thomas Benson (1708-1772), a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon, who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deporting. Benson leased Lundy from its owner, John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (1694–1754) (who was an heir of the Grenville family of Bideford and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall), at a rent of £60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia, but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves. Later Benson was involved in an insurance swindle. He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a valuable cargo of pewter and linen. Having cleared the port on the mainland, the ship put into Lundy, where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts, before setting sail again. Some days afterwards, when a homeward-bound vessel was sighted, the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled. The crew were taken off the stricken ship by the other ship, which landed them safely at Clovelly.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2013, Lee was {{admitted}} to Singapore General Hospital after suffering a prolonged cardiac dysrhythmia which {{was followed by a}} brief stoppage of blood flow to the brain. For {{the first time in his}} career as a politician, Lee missed the annual Chinese New Year dinner at his Tanjong Pagar Constituency, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the guest-of-honour. He was subsequently discharged, but continued to receive anti-coagulant therapy.|$|E
25|$|South America was {{supposed}} to be his next assignment, and he and his wife, Arlene, attended the Defense Language Institute, Monterey, California, as Spanish language students in preparation. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aviation and engineering adviser to Argentina, but the assignment did not take place. Crandall suffered a stroke, which ended his flying career. After his recovery, the Crandalls found the language training useful when he was sent to Caracas, Venezuela, as the Defense Mapping Agency's director for the Inter-American Geodetic Survey.|$|E

25|$|On February 20, 2006, the National Football League {{announced}} that Williams had violated the NFL drug {{policy for the}} fourth time. His mother reportedly {{said she did not}} think it was another marijuana violation, and that he may have been in India when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tested. On April 25, 2006, Williams was suspended for the entire 2006 season. It has been suggested that the substance may have been an herb related to his interest in holistic medicine.|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{praise from}} {{players such as}} Ajit Agarkar, Mohammad Kaif and Harbhajan Singh, Frazer was criticized in the media over the {{ambiguity}} of his role and the job <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing. Critics accused him of doing no more than conducting basic practice. While Chappell said that Frazer's inclusion was important for his coaching vision, Frazer's lackluster first-class playing credentials were cited as insufficient by outsiders while calls increased for {{the appointment of a}} specialist bowling coach. Frazer resigned along with Greg Chappell after the Indian team's poor performance in the 2007 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Mackal and Jack Bryan mounted an {{expedition}} to the same area in late 1981. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> joined by Herman Regusters, but they came in conflict in terms of finance, equipment and leadership and decided to split and make separate expeditions. Although, once again, Mackal was unable to reach Lake Tele, he gathered details on other cryptids and possible living dinosaurs, like the Emela-ntouka, Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu, Nguma-monene, Ndendeki (giant turtle), Mahamba (a giant crocodile of 15 meters), and Ngoima (a giant monkey-eating Eagle). Among his company were J. Richard Greenwell, M. Justin Wilkinson, and Congolese zoologist Marcellin Agnagna.|$|E

25|$|He was a licentiate when {{he arrived}} in the Philippines on 29 March 1661 to serve as oidor (auditor) in the Real Audiencia. On 22 June 1662, Coloma married María de Cuellar y Cisneros in the Philippines. During the administrations of Governor-General Diego de Salcedo to Manuel de León, Coloma held the {{position}} of senior auditor. As senior auditor, Coloma was in charge of military affairs. This position was challenged by Francisco Sotomayor y Mansilla, who was also part of the Real Audiencia, arguing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the senior auditor. However, in fear of Salcedo, Sotomayor gave in to Coloma and assumed the second highest position.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} B.C. Pal and G.S. Khaparde in London in 1908 further stirred the matter, since both {{were known to}} have been radical {{nationalist}} politicians in India. By September 1908, an agent had been installed within India House who was able to invite detectives to the Sunday night meetings of the Free India Society (attendance for Europeans was by invitation only). The agent passed on some additional information, but was not able to infiltrate Savarkar's inner circle. Savarkar himself did not come under special scrutiny as a dangerous suspect until November 1909, when the agent delivered information about discussions of assassinations at Indian House. The agent may have been a young Maharashtrian by the name of Kirtikar, who had arrived at India House as an acquaintance of V.V.S. Aiyar, ostensibly to study dentistry in London. Kirtikar was discovered after Aiyar made enquiries at the London Hospital where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> training, and was one night forced by Savarkar to confess at gun-point.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{began to}} {{question}} Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in {{the weeks leading up}} to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E

25|$|The {{task was}} to create a toy and market it at a show {{attended}} by Sir Alan and toy industry representatives, with the potential for it to be mass-produced and sold to raise money for Comic Relief. The men's team, led by Gerald Ratner, created a belt with clip-on slots to hold collectible figurines, that was suggested by Jonathan Ross. The women's team created a velcro suit that was intended to come in pairs and played somewhat like Twister, including a giant novelty dice that when rolled, instructed players to stick one part of their body to the other player's, with the loser being whoever fell to the floor first. Both teams suffered internal conflicts, with Jonathan Ross forcing many of his ideas through and then not contributing to the speech that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> writing with Jack Dee, while Patsy Palmer became frustrated with Michelle Mone's leadership of their team and very nearly quit. Conflict between Dee and Ross was presented by the BBC in a humorous fashion, and it is likely that both Dee and Ross 'played up' their conflict to entertain the viewer.|$|E
500|$|SFX {{magazine}} reviewer Dave Golder {{gave the}} episode {{five out of}} five stars, praising it for being [...] "superbly paced, the changes in tone happening gradually and organically". He also commended the directing and sound effects. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of A-, praising the scary atmosphere {{and the development of}} the Weeping Angels. He commented that he was a little [...] "fuzzy" [...] on the Doctor and River Song's relationship, but he expected that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

Leslie Hamilton, the Cardiff club doctor, later said that he had believed at the time that Andrews was being far too soft on Friday; indeed, according to teammate Paul Went, the forward would simply leave after each match and not be heard of until he returned for the next game. [...] "He wouldn't even bother to have a shower", Went later said, in an interview. [...] "He'd just get dressed, take his carrier-bag with his dry martini and he'd go—no explanation".|$|E
