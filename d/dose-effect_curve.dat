5000|$|With the median-effect {{equation}} as {{the unified}} {{theory of the}} mass-action law and its combination index theorem for multiple effector interactions, these algorithms {{can be applied to}} virtually all aspects of quantitative biology and medical sciences as shown in over 754 different bio-medical journals.1 The conventional approach of dose-effect analysis in the past centuries has used numerous numbers of data points to draw the empirical <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> to best fit the available data by least square regression or other statistical means. This old approach is under the premises of assuming dose and effect relationships are random events. By contrast, the MEE theory is to use small number (usually 3-7) of data points to fit the mass-action law to yield its parameters (i.e. m, Dm and r), and to lineage all dose-effect curves with the automated median-effect plot. This led to [...] "the theory of minimum of two data points" [...] for easily defining the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> with the m and Dm parameters.|$|E

5000|$|Also {{introduced}} by Chou in 1976 was the median-effect plot {{which is a}} plot of log (D) vs log (fa)/(1-fa) or log (fa)/(fu) yields a straight line with slope (m) and the x-intercept of log (Dm), where Dm equals to the anti-log of the x-intercept. This unique theory holds true for all dose-effect curves that follows the physico-chemical principle of the mass-action law, for all entities regardless of the first-order or higher-order dynamics, and regardless of unit or mechanism of actions.3 MEE is derived by system analysis using enzyme kinetics and mathematical inductions and deductions where hundreds of mechanism specific individual equations are reduced to a single general equation. 3 Both left and right sides of the MEE are dimensionless quantities. When the m and Dm are determined, the full <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> is defined. Since the median-effect plot yields straight lines, the theoretical minimum of only two data points allow the drawing of the full <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve,</b> when the effect is accurately determined. This fundamental revelation defies the common held belief that two data points cannot draw a defined does-effect curve. The main significance of MEE is the mediation that [...] "Dose" [...] and [...] "Effect" [...] or [...] "Mass" [...] and [...] "Function" [...] are interchangeable. The [...] "Mass" [...] vs [...] "Energy" [...] was defined E=MC2 for subatomic fission and fusion; Now [...] "Mass" [...] vs [...] "Action" [...] is defined by MEE for supramolecular dynamics.|$|E
50|$|The {{revelation that}} all mass-action law based dose-effect curves can be {{transformed}} into straight lines with the median-effect plot leads to {{the theory that the}} theoretical minimum of two data points are required to define the entire <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve.</b> In conjunction with the median-effect principle of the mass-action law, the referred “two data” points actually has the third data point at dose zero. In addition, the median-effect dose (Dm) is the fourth point which serves as the universal reference point and the common link to all dynamic orders. T.C. Chou has not contemplated to use only two data points for experimentation {{due to the fact that}} it requires highly accurate measurement and low variability for the high r values.3 However, this mass-action theory leads to a green revolution in bio-medical research4 and effective and efficient drug development5, as manifested in Chou’s laboratory and elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} animal pharmacodynamics, the trial {{protocol}} {{reports that the}} biological activity of BIA 10-2474 was tested in models of predictive efficacy in treating pain. “BIA 10-2474 produced analgesic/anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse Formalin-Paw and Tail-Flick tests in a time-and dose-dependent manner. BIA 10-2474 also markedly potentiated the antinociceptive effects of exogenous anandamide in the mouse Formalin-Paw and Tail-Flick tests”. In other words, BIA 10-2474 worked as a pain-killer in mice using two different tests (the “analgesic/anti-inflammatory” effect); and, in mice that {{had been given a}} dose of the neurotransmitter anandamide, BIA 10-2474 also improved its effects in numbing pain (“antinociceptive” effect). The expert committee of the ANSM took the view that this was insufficient basis for commencing human trials, and that further evidence of BIA 10-2474 as an analgesic was warranted. The Committee's final report noted that in fact the original formalin paw study report presented additional data for the gabapentin comparator which was omitted in the Investigators Brochure. The final ANSM report stated that [...] "doses used in these tests differ greatly (from 0.3 to 10 mg/Kg), without it being possible to trace a <b>dose‐effect</b> <b>curve</b> or to estimate an effective dose 50 (which is a surprising shortcoming)".|$|E

Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and pentobarbital occasioned dose-related increases in diaze-pam-appropriate responding in all four training dose groups. Increasing the training dose of diazepam from 0. 3 to 1. 0 mg/kg resulted in approximately a 3 -fold shift to the right in the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curves</b> {{for each of these}} four drugs. However, increasing the training dose to 3. 0 or 6. 0 mg/kg did not result in additional, concomitant shifts in these <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curves.</b> Moreover, the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curves</b> of nine additional benzodiazepine analogs also did not differ markedly in rats trained with either 1. 0 or 3. 0 mg/kg of diazepam. The nonbenzodiazepines ethanol, phency-clidine, cyproheptadine and ketocyclazocine failed to produce diazepam-like discriminative stimuli in rats trained with either 0. 3, 1. 0 or 3. 0 mg/kg of diazepam. In rats trained with 1. 0 mg/kg of diazepam, Ro 1 1 - 6896, but not its inactive stereoisomer Ro 11 - 6893, occasioned diazepam-appropriate responding. Further-more, the selective benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 821 6 blocked the effects of diazepam but not the diazepam-like effects of pentobarbital. These results demonstrate that the discrimina-tive effects of diazepam are qualitatively similar across this 20 -fold range of training doses; quantitatively, the discriminative effects of diazepam appear to reach a maximum and plateau above a training dose of 1. 0 mg/kg in rats. Furthermore, the discriminative effects of diazepam appear to be receptor medi-ated in that 1) the relative potencies of a series of analogs correlated significantly with their relative potencies for inhibiting [3 H]diazepam binding, 2) they exhibited stereospecificity and 3) they were blocked by a selective benzodiazepine antagonis...|$|R

The method used in the experiments was activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT). The normal assay consisted of addition of platelin, plasma and Ca 2 + in equal volumes of 100 μl in a glass tube inside 37 °C water bath along with 10 μl of saline. The glass tube was tilted after the addition of Ca 2 + and the time taken for the clot to appear in the tube after the addition of Ca 2 + was measured and named as reference clotting time. The method was also applied by changing other variables such as the dilution Ca 2 + in saline and dilution of plasma in saline while keeping the other variables constant. Moreover, the method was also applied to Heparin, where Heparin was added in dilutions of saline instead of the 10 μl saline. The same method as Heparin was applied on Argatroban in order to have the dose-effect curves of both anticoagulants for comparison. In the results related to the problem formulation, the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> of Argatroban in vitro was steeper than the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> of Heparin in vitro.

Administration of saline i. c. v. produced no effect on heroin self-administration.

Each day there were four 15 -minute sessions, with a 10 -minute inter-session interval. Cumulative <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curves</b> for phencyclidine, pentobarbital, and d-amphetamine were obtained by giving an injection before each of the four sessions; successive injections increased the cumulative dose in equally spaced logarithmic steps. For comparison, non-cumulative doses of each drug (i. e., doses not preceded by other doses on the same day) were also tested. As the cumulative dose of each drug increased, the overall response rate decreased, the percent errors increased, and there was less within-session error reduction (acquisition). With phencyclidine and pentobarbital, the rate-decreasing and error-increasing effects tended to be greater with a non-cumulative dose than with the corresponding cumulative dose. In contrast, with d-amphetamine, the effects were considerably greater with the cumulative doses.

Under the single dosing procedure, a dose of triazolam (0, 0. 05, 0. 15, or 0. 35 mg/ 70 kg) or secobarbital (0, 25, 75, or 175 mg/ 70 kg) was administered 45 min before assessment.

40|$|Dose-related effects play an {{important}} role in the risk assessment of substances. The preventive risk assessment (standard-setting) generally utilises only one data point of the dose-effect curve: the No-observed-adverse-effect-level. The actual risk assessment, however, requires insight into the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> for the evaluation of the risk of current exposure. The shape of a <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> is determined by toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of a substance. Toxicokinetics deals with the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of substances. Toxicodynamics deals with the mode of action by which a substance exerts its toxic effects. Toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic processes can be dynamically described by mathematical modelling. This report describes how toxicokinetic (PBPK modelling) and toxicodynamic modelling (effect modelling) can contribute to improvement of preventive and actual risk assessment. Combined toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic modelling facilitates the risk assessment at any human exposure level (no high-to-low-dose extrapolations) for any exposure pattern (no concentration-time extrapolations) and for different exposure routes (no route-to-route extrapolation). The report concludes with a proposal for a study on toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic modelling. Based on the relatively high exposure levels and the varying exposure of the human population, benzene is selected as a relevant substance. A major advantage of benzene as a subject for study is that toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models can be taken from the literature. As an example of a more generic issue, a toxicodynamic model for the process of carcinogenesis will be used to illustrate the effects of different exposure patterns on tumour formation...|$|E

Anatabine or saline injections were administered 15 min before the 11 : 00 a. m. food self-administration session began. Anatabine (0. 18 – 3. 2 mg/kg, IM) dose-dependently reduced nicotine self-administration (0. 01 mg/kg/inj) (p. 036 – 0. 0003). Food-maintained responding was decreased only at the highest dose of anatabine (3. 2 mg/kg; p. 003). Each monkey returned to baseline levels of nicotine self-administration after anatabine treatment, and {{there was no evidence of}} catheter malfunction. Next, the effects of anatabine and saline on the nicotine <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> (0. 001 - 0. 1 mg/kg/inj) were evaluated. Anatabine (0. 32 and 1. 0 mg/kg, IM) decreased the peak of the nicotine <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curve</b> (p. 001 – p. 0001), with no significant effect on food-maintained responding. The abuse liability of anatabine also was examined, and monkeys did not self-administer anatabine (0. 0032 – 0. 32 mg/kg/inj) above saline levels. These findings are consistent with anatabine’s effects on nicotine self-administration in rats (Caine et al., 2014). These data suggest that anatabine could be an effective agonist medication for treatment of nicotine addiction...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{discrimination}} of agonist-antagonist opioids in humans trained in a two-choice hydromorphone/not hydromorphone discrimination. Eight adult male volunteers with histories of opioid abuse who were not currently physically dependent were trained to discriminate the mu receptor agonist hydromorphone (3 mg/ 70 kg, i. m.) (“Drug A”) from a “Not Drug A ” training condition (saline placebo). Volunteers received financial reinforcement for correct re-sponses. After training, generalization <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curves</b> for hydromorphone, butorphanol, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and buprenorphine were determined. Other subjective, behavioral, and physiological measures were concurrently collected in all sessions. In generalization testing hydromorphone and bu-prenorphine produced dose-related increases in hydromor...|$|R

J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 191 : 232 - 240, 1974. <b>Dose-effect</b> <b>curves</b> {{were obtained for}} nine antiarrhythmic substances utilizing the maxi-mal driving frequency of cat papillary muscles (an indirect method for determining prolongation of the refractory period). The order of potency was: d- and dl-propranolol> quinidine, dl-pronethalol and lidocaine> diphenylhydantoin> procainamide> dl-practolol. Bretylium showed only slight activity. From the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>curves</b> obtained, the concentrations which prolonged the refractory period by 20 % (RPPM) were derived. By strict adherence to the doses derived from the RPPM potency ratios the heart rate of aconitine-induced tachycardia in the cat Langendorif preparation was returned to preaconitine heart rate levels after addition of the five substances studied (dl-propran-olol, hidocaine, procainamide, quinidine and practolol). Thus, {{there appears to be}} a re-lationship between the ability of a substance to prolong the refractory period of cat papillary muscle and its ability to reverse the tachycardia produced by aconitine in the cat Langenolorff preparation. In addition, we observed that aconitine-induce auto-maticity and tacluycardia could be reversed by substituting perfusate containing half the normal concentration of sodium or by the addition of tetrodotoxin (0. 1 - 1 ag/m 1). These results support the view that aconitine-induced automaticity and tachycardia may be due to an increase in sodium permeability.

40|$|Repeated {{administration}} of D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa, induces profound tolerance that correlates with desensitization and downregulation of CB 1 cannabinoid receptors in the CNS. However, {{the consequences of}} repeated {{administration of}} the endocannabinoid N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide, AEA) on cannabinoid receptor regulation are unclear because of its rapid metabolism by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). FAAH/ mice dosed subchronically with equi-active maximally effective doses of AEA or THC displayed greater rightward shifts in THC <b>dose–effect</b> <b>curves</b> for antinociception, catalepsy, and hypothermia than in AEA <b>dose–effect</b> <b>curves.</b> Subchronic THC significantly attenuated agonist-stimulated [35 S]GTPgS binding in brain and spinal cord, and reduced [3 H]WIN 55, 212 - 2 binding in brain. Interestingly, AEA-treated FAAH/ mice showed less CB 1 receptor downregulation and desensitization than THC-treated mice. Experiments examining tolerance and cross-tolerance indicated that the behavioral effects of THC, a low efficacy CB 1 receptor agonist, were more sensitive to receptor loss than those of AEA, a higher efficacy agonist, suggesting that the expression of tolerance was more affected by the intrinsic activity of the ligand at testing than during subchronic treatment. In addition, the CB 1 receptor antagonist, rimonabant, precipitated a markedly reduced magnitude of withdrawal in FAAH/ mice treated subchronically with AEA compared with mice treated repeatedly with THC. The findings that repeated AEA administration produces lesser adaptive changes at the CB 1 receptor and has reduced dependence liability compared with THC suggest that pharmacotherapies targeting endocannabinoid catabolic enzymes {{are less likely to}} promot...|$|R
