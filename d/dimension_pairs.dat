40|$|In this {{manuscript}} we develop {{the theory of}} poset pinball, a combinatorial game recently introduced by Harada and Tymoczko {{for the study of}} the equivariant cohomology rings of GKM-compatible subspaces of GKM spaces. Harada and Tymoczko also prove that in certain circumstances, a successful outcome of Betti poset pinball yields a module basis for the equivariant cohomology ring of the GKM-compatible subspace. Our main contributions are twofold. First we construct an algorithm (which we call the <b>dimension</b> <b>pair</b> algorithm) which yields the result of a successful outcome of Betti poset pinball for any type A regular nilpotent Hessenberg and any type A nilpotent Springer variety, considered as GKM-compatible subspaces of the flag variety (^n). The definition of the algorithm is motivated by a correspondence between Hessenberg affine cells and certain Schubert polynomials which we learned from Erik Insko. Second, in the special case of the type A regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties specified by the Hessenberg function h(1) =h(2) = 3 and h(i) = i+ 1 for 3 ≤ i ≤ n- 1 and h(n) =n, we prove that the pinball result coming from the <b>dimension</b> <b>pair</b> algorithm is poset-upper-triangular; by results of Harada and Tymoczko this implies the corresponding equivariant cohomology classes form a H^*_S^ 1 () -module basis for the S^ 1 -equivariant cohomology ring of the Hessenberg variety.

40|$|Most of the {{available}} methods for selection of input-output pairings for decentralized control require evaluation of all alternatives to find the optimal pairings. As the number of alternatives grows rapidly with process <b>dimensions,</b> <b>pairing</b> selection through an exhaustive search can be computationally forbidding for large-scale processes. Furthermore, the different criteria can be conflicting necessitating pairing selection in a multiobjective optimization framework. In this paper, an efficient branch and bound (BAB) method for multiobjective pairing selection is proposed. The proposed BAB method is illustrated through a biobjective pairing problem using selection criteria involving the relative gain array and the µ-interaction measure. The computational efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using randomly generated matrices and the large-scale case study of cross-direction control...|$|R

The identity of paired helical filaments was confirmed following a specific immunogold labeling using antibodies directed against the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is the main constituent of paired helical filaments. Computer-assisted analysis of high resolution, three-dimensional images allowed us to study the longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles of individual filaments. Vertical dimensions of filaments were assessed along these sectional profiles. The smallest vertical diameter (6. 66 +/- 0. 78 nm) was obtained {{at the level of}} the greatest lateral profile (ie, "loop"), while the greatest vertical diameter was two times larger (13. 68 +/- 1. 46 nm) and was obtained {{at the level of the}} smallest lateral profile (ie, "crossover") of the filament. Based on the shapes of these sectional profiles and their vertical <b>dimensions,</b> <b>paired</b> helical filaments appeared to be composed of two identical integral subunits, each of a circular cross-sectional profile of approximately 7 nm in diameter, wound around one another in a left helical manner, with a 7 -nm center-to-center separation. Half-period of this helix was estimated at 81. 4 +/- 2. 1 nm. Serial cross-sectional profiles of paired helical filaments were further utilized to construct a theoretical model of their internal organization.

40|$|We study type A {{nilpotent}} Hessenberg varieties {{equipped with}} a natural S^ 1 -action using techniques introduced by Tymoczko, Harada-Tymoczko, and Bayegan-Harada, with a particular emphasis on a special class of nilpotent Springer varieties corresponding to the partition λ= (n- 2, 2) for n ≥ 4. First we define the adjacent-pair matrix corresponding to any filling of a Young diagram with n boxes with the alphabet { 1, 2, [...] .,n}. Using the adjacent-pair matrix we make more explicit and also extend some statements concerning highest forms of linear operators in previous work of Tymoczko. Second, for a nilpotent operator N and Hessenberg function h, we construct an explicit bijection between the S^ 1 -fixed points of the nilpotent Hessenberg variety (N,h) and the set of (h,λ_N) -permissible fillings of the Young diagram λ_N. Third, we use poset pinball, the combinatorial game introduced by Harada and Tymoczko, to study the S^ 1 -equivariant cohomology of type A Springer varieties S_(n- 2, 2) associated to Young diagrams of shape (n- 2, 2) for n≥ 4. Specifically, we use the <b>dimension</b> <b>pair</b> algorithm for Betti-acceptable pinball described by Bayegan and Harada to specify {{a subset of the}} equivariant Schubert classes in the T-equivariant cohomology of the flag variety Fℓ ags(^n) which maps to a module basis of H^*_S^ 1 (S_(n- 2, 2)) under the projection H^*_T(Fℓ ags(^n)) → H^*_S^ 1 (S_(n- 2, 2)). Our pinball module basis is not poset-upper-triangular; this is the first concrete such example in the literature. A consequence of our proof is that there exists a simple and explicit change of basis which transforms our basis to a poset-upper-triangular module basis for H^*_S^ 1 (S_(n- 2, 2)).
