The scent, which {{was released by}} Coty, Inc. in September 2011, joined his existing scents David Beckham Instinct (2005) and Intimately Beckham (2006), a his-and-hers collection with his wife Victoria Beckham.

25|$|The {{conventional}} {{application of}} pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, {{the nape of}} the neck, and the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer Sophia Grojsman behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise. The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance {{so that it is}} released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilette</b> is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening. Cologne fragrance is released rapidly, lasting around 2 hours. <b>Eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilette</b> lasts from 2 to 4 hours, while perfume may last up to six hours.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{originally}} produced to promote SimplySiti's range of <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilettes</b> - Him, Her and Miss. For the commercial, which {{was produced by}} Siti Nurhaliza Productions, Siti employed two actresses and one actor so that each of them represents a single line of <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> toillette. For the male range of <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> toillette (Him), she employed Zain Saidin to represent the range. Zain was chosen to represent the range because of his pan Asian features might help SimplySiti to break the international market, especially the Western Asia market when it is released. For Her and Miss, they were represented by Ari and Cha Cha Maembong respectively. A sneak peek of the music video was previewed at the first promotional tour of the <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> toillettes on 11 May. On 30 May, the music video was finally made available on SimplySiti's official YouTube account.

5000|$|The first single, [...] "Lebih Indah" [...] was {{released}} on 31 August 2013. The song is said by Siti [...] "to immortalize the spirit and share the trying moments" [...] {{that she has to}} endure when she has {{to take care of her}} husband after he was involved in a motorcycle accident in New Zealand in December 2012. Starring Zain Saidin, Chacha Maembong and Ari, its music video also served as a commercial for her own line of <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilettes</b> from her SimplySiti cosmetic range. The music video {{was released}} to YouTube on 30 May, two weeks after its first sneak peek during the first promotional tour of the <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilettes</b> on 11 May.

25|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the sense}} of style of Chanel {{continued}} undeterred; the firm’s initial venture into masculine parfumerie, Pour Monsieur was a successful <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilette</b> for men. Chanel and her spring collection received the Fashion Oscar at the 1957 Fashion Awards in Dallas. Pierre Wertheimer bought Bader's 20 per cent share of the Parfums Chanel, which increased the Wertheimer percentage to 90 per cent.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of time, Jacques Wertheimer bought the {{controlling}} interest of the House of Chanel. Critics stated that during his leadership, he never {{paid much attention to}} the company, as he was more interested in horse breeding. In 1974, the House of Chanel launched Cristalle <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilette,</b> which was designed when Coco Chanel was alive. 1978 saw the launch of the first non-couture, prêt-à-porter line and worldwide distribution of accessories.|$|E

500|$|Minogue {{underwent}} surgery on 21 May 2005 at Cabrini Hospital in Malvern and commenced chemotherapy treatment soon after. On 8 July 2005, {{she made her}} first public appearance after surgery when she visited a children's cancer ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. She returned to France where she completed her chemotherapy treatment at the Institut Gustave-Roussy in Villejuif, near Paris. In December 2005, Minogue released a digital-only single, [...] "Over the Rainbow", a live recording from her Showgirl tour. Her children's book, The Showgirl Princess, written during her period of convalescence, was published in October 2006, and her perfume, [...] "Darling", was launched in November. The range was later augmented by <b>eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>toilettes</b> including Pink Sparkle, Couture and Inverse. On her return to Australia for her concert tour, she discussed her illness and said that her chemotherapy treatment had been like [...] "experiencing a nuclear bomb". While appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2008, Minogue said that her cancer had originally been misdiagnosed. She commented, [...] "Because someone is in a white coat and using big medical instruments doesn't necessarily mean they're right", but later spoke of her respect for the medical profession.|$|R

2500|$|Classical {{colognes}} {{first appeared}} in Europe in the 17th century. The first fragrance labeled a [...] "parfum" [...] extract with {{a high concentration of}} aromatic compounds was Guerlain's Jicky in 1889. <b>Eau</b> <b>de</b> <b>Toilette</b> appeared alongside parfum {{around the turn of the}} century.

When made from pomace, it is called pomace brandy or marc. [...] While most <b>eaux</b> <b>de</b> vie from the Alpine regions of Europe only rest very briefly in glass containers, others are aged in wooden casks before bottling. Thus, calvados, an apple-based spirit from northwestern France, is {{required by law to}} spend at least two years in wood, and most producers also offer much older products to the market (up to 20 years or more). Some slivovitz are also aged in wooden casks, giving them their golden or amber color and some additional flavors.|$|R
2500|$|Finally, {{the term}} [...] "cologne" [...] {{has entered the}} English {{language}} as a generic, overarching term to denote a fragrance worn by a man, regardless of its concentration.

[...] A similar problem surrounds the term [...] "perfume," [...] {{which can be used}} a generic sense to refer to fragrances marketed to women, whether or not the fragrance is actually an extrait.|$|E
