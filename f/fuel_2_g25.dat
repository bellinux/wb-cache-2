In model 1, region A sets two fuel consumption taxes, one for each fuel. The optimal region A tax on fuel 1 then exceeds the Pigou level as defined by the region; while the tax set on <b>fuel</b> <b>2</b> is Pigouvian. Presence of a second fuel in region A reduces region B’s optimal tax on fuel 1. In model 2, region A sets a common carbon tax, which is lower (higher) for <b>fuel</b> 1 (<b>2)</b> than in model 1.

40|$|Abstract The lower {{troposphere}} {{is an excellent}} receptacle, which integrates anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions over large areas. Therefore, atmospheric concentration observations over populated regions would provide the ultimate proof if sustained emissions changes have oc-curred. The most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2), also shows large natural concentra-tion variations, which need to be disentangled from anthropogenic signals to assess changes in associated emissions. This is in principle possible for the fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> component (FFCO 2) by high-precision radiocarbon (14 C) analyses because FFCO 2 is free of radiocarbon. Long-term observations of 14 CO 2 conducted at two sites in south-western Germany do not yet reveal any significant trends in the regional fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> component. We rather observe strong inter-annual variations, which are largely imprinted by changes of atmospheric transport as supported by dedicated transport model simulations of fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2.</b> In this paper, we show that, depending on the remoteness of the site, changes of about 7 – 26 % in fossil fuel emissions in respective catchment areas could be detected with confi-dence by high-precision atmospheric 14 CO 2 measurements when comparing 5 -year averages if these inter-annual variations were taken into account. This perspective constitutes the urgently needed tool for validation of fossil <b>fuel</b> CO <b>2</b> emissions changes {{in the framework of}} the Kyoto protocol and successive climate initiatives...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the potential for enhancing {{the performance of the}} once-through PWR fuel cycle by appropriate design of thorium containing fuel with concurrent consideration of neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, and proliferation resistance. CASMO- 4 is employed to model a fuel assembly consisting of a homogeneously <b>fueled</b> ThO <b>2</b> -UO 2 lattice of conventional design. It is found that homogeneously mixed ThO <b>2</b> -UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel</b> in general has better physics behavior than all-UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel,</b> e. g. more negative MTC and less reactivity swing. The H/HM ratio can be optimized to extend the burnup of both ThO 2 -UO 2 and all-UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel</b> about 10 % and 5 % respectively. However, it is found that the all-UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel</b> provides higher potential energy generation (or achievable burnup) than the homogeneously mixed ThO <b>2</b> -UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel.</b> MOCUP (MCNP+ORIGEN) is used to model unit cells of the micro-heterogeneous fuel. The key findings for the best micro-heterogeneous configurations are as follows: (1) For a given U- 235 inventory, a 20 % to 30 % increase in fuel cycle achievable bumup above the homogeneous case is possible, therefore 10 % to 15 % above the all-UO 2 fuel; (2) For certain axially heterogeneous configurations, a "burnable poison" reactivity suppression effect appears at the beginning of irradiation. Analysis of the possible mechanisms behind these effects shows that they are due to a combination of changes in self-shielding, local fissile worth, and conversion ratio. (cont.) Economic evaluations show that the homogeneous ThO <b>2</b> -UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel</b> is 20 %- 30 % more expensive than the equivalent all-U fuel but micro-heterogeneous fuel can be comparable to or even cheaper than the all-UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel.</b> In terms of the plutonium content, the micro-heterogeneous Th/U fuel is more proliferation-resistant than the homogeneous Th/U fuel, and the homogeneous Th/U fuel is more proliferation-resistant than the all-UO <b>2</b> <b>fuel.</b> However, the uranium produced in the ThO 2 zone of any undenatured micro-heterogeneous design should be considered of proliferative concern. Adding natural or depleted uranium to the ThO 2 zone can make the material not weapon-usable at the expense of degrading the neutronic performance. Placing some enriched uranium within the thorium zone may be needed to reduce local thermal peaking to a manageable level. by Xiaofeng Zhao. Thesis (Ph. D.)
