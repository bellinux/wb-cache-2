40|$|Background: To {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that tissue iron and reactive oxygen species, including superoxide (O 2 ), mediate acute inflammatory and late <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> to vascular injury, we studied experimental overdistension of normal carotid and femoral arteries in dogs. Experimental design: Arterial segments isolated in situ were distended with Ringer solution at 2 atmospheres pressure. In initial experiments the arteries were excised immediately after distension and immersed in diaminobenzidine solutions containing Mn++ ions to initiate histochemical reactions for O 2 . In other experiments distended arterial segments were reperfused with arterial blood in {{the presence or absence}} of the iron chelator, deferoxamine, or the low-cost superoxide dismutase mimic, manganese chloride, and examined microscopically at 3 hours, 7 days, or 30 days. The degree of acute inflammation or smooth muscle hyperplasia was determined by quantitative morphometry; free iron capable of redox cycling was determined histochemically. Results: (1) O 2  was produced by injured endothelial cells; (2) free iron is present on the surfaces of endothelial cells in the distended arterial segments; (3) an acute subintimal inflammatory response occurs at 3 hours after distension injury, followed by proliferation of mural smooth muscle cells at 7 days, and neointima formation at 30 days; (4) single doses of either the low molecular weight superoxide dismutase mimic, manganese chloride, or the strong iron chelator, deferoxamine, administered during and immediately after arterial distension, prevent the early inflammatory and late <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> to distension injury.

40|$|Overexpression of amphiregulin {{has been}} shown to induce psoriasiform changes in the skin of {{transgenic}} mice shortly after birth. Therefore, amphiregulin has been suggested as a target for anti-psoriatic therapy. To test this theory, a humanized monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing human amphiregulin was examined for anti-proliferative effects in the human skin-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse transplant model. The anti-amphiregulin antibody reduced epidermal thickness of transplanted psoriatic skin and also inhibited the <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>response</b> that developed in nonpsoriatic skin after transplantation. The same antibody also suppressed keratinocyte proliferation in monolayer culture in a dose-dependent manner. Under the same conditions in which keratinocyte proliferation was inhibited, the antibody had little effect on proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts and no effect on type I procollagen production by these cells. Taken together, these data indicate an important role for amphiregulin in psoriatic hyperplasia and suggest that inhibition of amphiregulin activity could be an efficacious therapeutic strategy for psoriasis.

To determine whether injury of astrocytes produced by an in vitro model of brain trauma activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), a key regulator of cellular proliferation and differentiation, astrocytes cultured on deformable SILASTIC membranes were subjected to rapid, reversible strain (stretch) -induced injury. Activation of ERK was observed 1 min after injury, was maximal from 10 to 30 min, and remained elevated for 3 hr. Activation of ERK was dependent on the rate and magnitude of injury; maximum ERK activation was observed after a 20 – 60 msec, 7. 5 mm membrane displacement. ERK activation was blocked by inhibiting MEK, the upstream activator of ERK. Activation of ERK was reduced when calcium influx was diminished. When extracellular ATP was hydrolyzed by apyrase or ATP/P 2 receptors were blocked, injury-induced ERK activation was significantly reduced.

This report reviews evidence for {{the usefulness of the}} rat for evaluation of lung cancer hazards from inhaled particles. With the exception of nickel sulfate, particulate agents thought to be human lung carcinogens cause lung tumors in rats exposed by inhalation. The rat is more sensitive to carcinogenesis from nonfibrous particles than mice or Syrian hamsters, which have both produced false negatives. However, rats differ from mice and nonhuman primates in both the pattern of particle retention in the lung and alveolar epithelial <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> to chronic particle exposure. Present evidence warrants caution in extrapolation from the lung tumor response of rats to inhaled particles to human lung cancer hazard, and there is considerable uncertainty in estimating unit risks for humans from rat data. It seems appropriate to continue using rats in inhalation carcinogenesis assays of inhaled particles, but the upper limit of exposure concentrations must be set carefully to avoid falsepositive results. A positive finding in both rats and mice would give greater confidence that an agent presents a carcinogenic hazard to man, and both rats and mice should be used if the agent is a gas or vapor.

40|$|Reductionist approaches, where {{individual}} {{pieces of}} a process are examined in isolation, have been the mainstay of biomedical research. While these methods are effective in highly compartmentalized systems, they fail {{to account for the}} inherent plasticity and non-linearity within the signaling structure. In the current manuscript, we present the computational architecture for tracking an acute perturbation in a biologic system through a multiscale model that links gene dynamics to cell kinetics, with the overall goal of predicting tissue adaptation. Given the complexity of the genome, the problem is made tractable by clustering temporal changes in gene expression into unique patterns. These cluster elements form the core of an integrated network that serves as the driving force for the response of the biologic system. This modeling approach is illustrated using the clinical scenario of vein bypass graft adaptation. Vein segments placed in the arterial circulation for treatment of advanced occlusive disease can develop an aggressive <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>response</b> that narrows the lumen, reduces blood flow, and induces in situ thrombosis. Reducing this <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>response</b> has been a long-standing but unrealized goal of biologic researchers in the field. With repeated failures of single target therapies, the redundant response pathways are thought to be a fundamental issue preventing progress towards a solution. Using the current framework, we demonstrate how theoretical genomic manipulations can be introduced into the system to shift the adaptation to a more beneficial phenotype, where the <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>response</b> is mitigated and the risk of thrombosis reduced. Utilizing our previously published rabbit vein graft genomic data, where grafts were harvested at time points ranging from 2 hours to 28 days and under differential flow conditions, and a customized clustering algorithm, five gene clusters that differentiated the low flow (i. e., pro-hyperplastic) from high flow (i. e., anti-hyperplastic) response were identified. The current analysis advances these general associations to create a model that identifies those genes sets most likely to be of therapeutic benefit. Using this approach, we examine the range of potential opportunities for intervention via gene cluster over-expression or inhibition, delivered in isolation or combination, at the time of vein graft implantation...|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterial}} pathogen Citrobacter rodentium {{belongs to a}} family of gastrointestinal pathogens that includes enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and is the causative agent of transmissible colonic hyperplasia in mice. The molecular mechanisms used by these pathogens to colonize host epithelial surfaces and form attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions have undergone intense study. In contrast, {{little is known about}} the host's immune response to these infections and its importance in tissue pathology and bacterial clearance. To address these issues, wild-type mice and mice lacking T and B lymphocytes (RAG 1 knockout [KO]) were infected with C. rodentium. By day 10 postinfection (p. i.), both wild-type and RAG 1 KO mice developed colitis and crypt hyperplasia, and these responses became more exaggerated in wild-type mice over the next 2 weeks, as they cleared the infection. By day 24 p. i., bacterial clearance was complete, and the colitis had subsided; however, crypt heights remained increased. In contrast, inflammatory and crypt <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> in the RAG 1 KO mice were transient, subsiding after 2 weeks. By day 24 p. i., RAG 1 KO mice showed no signs of bacterial clearance and infection was often fatal.

Saccharin, ascorbate, DL-tryptophan, allopurinol, and diphenyl promoted development of PN hyperplasia. The dose-response of the promoters were examined in both sexes of rats by administration of saccharin at doses of 0. 04, 0. 2, 1. 0 and 5. 0 % for 32 weeks after BBN treatment. The occurrence of PN hyperplasia was significantly increased in the group given 5 % saccharin. Dose-response curves showed enhanced <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> in both sexes given 0. 2 to 5 % saccharin. The organ specificities of promoters were studied in rats initiated with BBN or 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF) followed by phenobarbital or saccharin for 32 weeks. Phenobarbital greatly enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis. Saccharin significantly enhanced the occurrence of both BBN-induced and 2 -AAF-induced PN hyperplasia. However, there was no effect of phenobarbital on the urinary bladder or of saccharin on the liver. The rats showed a strain difference in susceptibility of the urinary bladder to saccharin; ACI rats were most susceptible and Sprague Dawley rats were most resistant to saccharin.

This has led to the suggestion that IL- 1 α directly or indirectly mediates the inflammatory and <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> elicited by TPA and possibly by other skin tumor promoters. In the current study, we investigated the effect of skin application of a polyphenolic fraction isolated from green tea (GTP) to SENCAR mice on skin tumor- promoter-caused induction of cutaneous edema and hyperplasia, and IL- 1 α mRNA expression. Pretreatment of the skin with GTP 30 mm before that of anthralin, benzoyl peroxide, mezerein, and TPA resulted in a significant (p < 0. 05) inhibition of cutaneous edema and epidermal hyperplasia caused by each of these tumor promoters. Northern blot analysis indicated that topical application of TPA, anthralin, mezerein, or benzoyl peroxide to SENCAR mice resulted in an increased expression of epidermal IL- 1 α mRNA. Pretreatment of the skin with GTP or individual epicatechin derivatives (ECDs) present therein, 30 mm before that of TPA, resulted in a significant inhibition of enhanced expression of epidermal IL- 1 α mRNA caused by skin application of TPA. These inhibitory effects were found to be dependent on the dose of GTP. Among four epicatechin derivatives present in GTP, (-) -epicatechin- 3 -gallate and (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate were more effective than (-) -epigallocatechin and (-) -epicatechin in affording this inhibition. Preapplication of GTP was also found to afford inhibition against anthralin-, benzoyl peroxide-, and mezerein-caused increased expression of epidennal IL- 1 α mRNA and protein.

Current multicenter randomized trials comparing PTCR with the more invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting could not show long-term significant survival differences. During {{the last two decades}} progress has been made to further optimize PTCR. The most logic approach to treat atherosclerotic coronary narrowings is to remove the atherosclerotic material using especially developed devices. Several trials, however, could not show a significant beneficial outcome after use of these devices compared to plain old balloon angioplasty. Another approach was to implant a coronary prothesis (stent), scaffolding the diseased coronary artery after PTCA. This approach resulted in a decreased restenosis rate at follow-up. The beneficial effects of stenting, however, was not found {{to be related to the}} inhibition of the neointimal cellular proliferation after vascular injury, but simply to be the mechanical result of overstretching of the treated vessel segment. The most important remaining clinical problem after stenting remains the neointimal hyperplasia within the stent, resulting in a significant stent narrowing in 13 to 30 % of patients. Further efforts to improve the clinical results of coronary stenting should focus on the reduction of this neointimal hyperplasia. Neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation results from (1) a healing response to the injury caused by the stent implantation and (2) a foreign body response to the stent itself.

RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: A <b>hyperplastic</b> crypt <b>response</b> was evident in all of the disease states examined and was particularly pronounced in coeliac disease and in infection with enteropathogenic E coli, where mitotic and MIB- 1 labelling indices were significantly raised above control values. In contrast with coeliac disease, increased crypt cell production rates in enteropathogenic E coli infection were also due to an expansion of the crypt proliferation compartment, without a comparable increase in crypt cell numbers.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to use {{volumetric}} intravascular ultrasound analysis of Palmaz-Schatz stents to assess the in-stent restenotic process. BackgroundBy reducing lesion elastic recoil and chronic arterial remodeling, stents improve the long-term results of coronary angioplasty. However, stents are prone to the development of neointimal hyperplasia. Angiographic studies of stent restenosis have suggested that these <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> are the cause of in-stent restenosis; however, it is difficult to visualize the radiolucent Palmaz-Schatz stent by angiography. Intravascular ultrasound provides detailed cross-sectional imaging of the coronary arteries, especially the intense metallic reflection of endovascular stents. MethodsForty-four patients with 60 Palmaz-Schatz stents underwent intravascular ultrasound imaging at follow-up ([mean ± SD] 8. 8 ± 7. 2 months after implantation). Thirty-four stents were placed in saphenous vein grafts and 26 in native coronary arteries; 30 were placed in restenotic lesions. Intravascular ultrasound with automatic transducer pullback at 0. 5 mm/s allowed measurement of stent, lumen and intimal hyperplasia crosssectional areas at 1 -mm axial increments within the stents. Using Simpson's rule, stent, lumen and intimal hyperplasia volumes were calculated. Patterns of in-stent restenosis were then identified. ResultsRestenotic stents had smaller stent volumes (120 ± 41 vs. 147 ± 43 mm 3, p = 0. 016) and lumen volumes (62 ± 28 vs. 118 ± 42 mm 3, p < 0. 0001) but larger intimal hyperplasia volumes (58 ± 36 vs. 29 ± 18 mm 3, p < 0. 001) than nonrestenotic stents. A focal restenosis pattern was more common (20 [77 %] of 26) than a diffuse restenosis pattern (6 [23 %] of 26). Stents with focal restenosis and stents with diffuse restenosis had equally small stent volumes (120 ± 44 vs. 120 ± 31 mm 3, respectively, p = NS); however, stents with diffuse restenosis had larger intimal hyperplasia volumes (84 ± 30 vs. 50 ± 34 mm 3, p < 0. 05). Focal restenosis was most commonly located at the central articulation (45 %); the location of focal restenosis was related to the focal accumulation of neointimal tissue.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{testosterone}} on the morphology and biochemistry of adult castrated rat liver is described. Castration decreases mean weight and volume of hepatocytes, volume and {{surface area of}} sinusoidal lumen, and apparently increases cell number per g of tissue. These variations indicate cell distress. Testosterone administration restored sinusoidal volume and surface area, indicating a true <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>response</b> and improved trophic conditions. Acid soluble nucleotides, RNA and DNA content were lower after castration, being partially restored after testosterone treatment. This restoration, however, was only statistically significant for total guanylate. We concluded that testosterone deficiency and administration exerts a specific effect on the liver in terms of morphological and biochemical changes. Purine nucleotide metabolism is probably the first target of hormonal action, since its changes are the most significant and useful to explain all the other observations...|$|E
40|$|Prostatic {{inflammation}} is {{of considerable}} importance to urologic research {{because of its}} association with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. However, the mechanisms by which inflammation leads to proliferation and growth remain obscure. Here, we show that insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), previously known as critical developmental growth factors during prostate organogenesis, are induced by inflammation {{as part of the}} proliferative recovery to inflammation. Using genetic models and in vivo IGF receptor blockade, we demonstrate that the <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>response</b> to inflammation depends on interleukin- 1 -driven IGF signaling. We show that human prostatic hyperplasia is associated with IGF pathway activation specifically localized to foci of inflammation. This demonstrates that mechanisms of inflammation-induced epithelial proliferation and hyperplasia involve the induction of developmental growth factors, further establishing a link between inflammatory and developmental signals and providing a mechanistic basis for the management of proliferative diseases by IGF pathway modulation...|$|E
40|$|Female SENCAR mice {{were treated}} with aqueous {{solutions}} of hypochlorous acid (HOCI), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chlorine dioxide (Cl 02), and monochloramine (NH 2 Cl) by whole body exposure (except head) for a 10 -min period for 4 days in the first experiment and for 1 day (except NH 2 Cl) in the second experiment. Animals were sacrificed the day following the last treatment (experiment 1) or on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 12 following treatment (experiment 2), and skin thickness was measured by light microscopy at x 400 by use of an eyepiece micrometer. Concentrations of disinfectants were 1, 10, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/L, for experiment 1 and 1000 mg[L for experiment 2. Thickness of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) for control animals was 15. 4 ± 1. 5,um. Mter 4 days of treatment at 1000 mg/L, HOCI and C 102 increased thickness to 39 ± 7. 0 and 40. 2 ± 11. 8, and NaOCl increased thickness to 25. 2 ± 6. 1,m. Only HOCl and C 102 were tested at 300 mgIL, yielding an IFE thickness of 30. 0 ± 13. 1 and 16. 8 ± 0. 8,um, respectively. The response to HOCI {{was found to be}} dose-related; the minimally effective dose was 100 mg/L. In earlier, preliminary tests to determine optimum treatment schedule, the response to HOCI appeared to be maximal after 4 days of treatment and tended to decrease with further treatment. The time-course study following a single treatment of 1000 mg/L HOCI, however, showed a progression of IFE thickening of from 18. 3 ± 1. 4 at 1 day to 30. 8 ± 8. 0 at 8 days, decreasing to 19. 1 ± 6. 2,um at 12 days. ClO 2 and NaOCl when tested in this manner did not produce increased thickness of IFE with time, but rather gave a persistent level of increase that remained for the 12 days. NH 2 Cl reduced skin thickness to 13. 6 ± 6. 1,m. Examination of sections of skin treated with HOCI and Cl 02 indicated an increase in cell numbers. HOCI and C 102 are therefore capable of inducing <b>hyperplastic</b> <b>responses</b> in the mouse skin. The basis for the decrease in skin thickness resulting from NH 2 Cl treatment remains to be established...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} ultrastructural-based studies were {{conducted}} on the interface region in different fish-helminth systems: (a) an intestinal infection of the cestode Monobothrium wageneri in tench, Tinca tinca; (b) an extensive intestinal submucosa and mucosal infection in tench by metacercariae of an unidentified digenean trematode; (c) an intestinal infection in brown trout, Salmo trutta, by the acanthocephalan Dentitruncus truttae; (d) an extraintestinal infection by larvae of the acanthocephalan, Pomphorhynchus laevis in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus; and (e) an infection in the livers of Eurasian minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus, by larvae of the nematode Raphidascaris acus. Endoparasitic helminths frequently cause inflammation of the digestive tract and associated organs, inducing the recruitment of various immune cells {{to the site of}} infection. In each of the fish-helminth systems that were studied, a massive <b>hyperplastic</b> granulocyte <b>response</b> involving mast cells (MCs) and neutrophils in close proximity to the helminths was documented. The current study presents data on the interface region in each fish-helminth system and documents the penetration of mast cells granules within the tegument of P. laevis larvae. No extracellular vesicles containing tegumental secretions from any of the four different taxa of endoparasitic helminths species at the host-parasite interface region were seen...|$|R
40|$|Myc is a {{transcription}} factor with pleiotropic effects on tumorigenesis which {{are likely to}} be mediated by its target genes. A known Myc transcriptional target is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, Tert. However, the contribution of Tert activation to Myc-induced tumorigenesis in vivo remains unknown. In this study, we addressed the role of telomerase in Myc-induced skin papillomatosis by using compound mice with a switchable Myc gene, Inv-MycERTAM mice, in combination with either telomerase deficiency (Terc−/−) or telomerase overexpression (K 5 -mTert) in the skin. We first demonstrated that Myc activates telomerase in the skin. With Inv-MycERTAM × Terc−/− mice, we further showed that this telomerase activation is partially required to elicit a full <b>hyperplastic</b> Myc-induced <b>response.</b> The presence of critically short telomeres in late-generation Inv-MycERTAM × Terc−/− mice further reduced the skin lesion induced by Myc. On the other hand, telomerase overexpression in the skin of K 5 -mTert mice augments Myc-induced hyperplasia in the absence of changes in telomere length, suggesting a direct role of telomerase in the Myc protumorigenic response. Taken together, these results highlight telomerase as a mediator of Myc-induced papillomatosis and suggest telomerase as a putative therapeutic target for Myc-dependent lesions...|$|R
