5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|Rebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker {{challenged}} the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to {{a match for}} the title. Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed {{to a series of}} reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz' earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz' part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money. The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses {{in the middle of the}} match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion, and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re-match in 1896–97 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).|$|E

25|$|A slogan having {{political}} overtones {{seems to}} have been heard repeatedly in the gatherings of Ayyavazhi. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> declaration from Ayya Vaikundar {{that he was going to}} dethrone the king and rule the country under a Single Umbrella. Among the many accusations raised against Ayya Vaikundar, the one that he would overthrow the rule of kings was among the most serious.|$|E
25|$|When Trygve Lie {{resigned}} {{from his post}} as UN Secretary-General in 1953, the United Nations Security Council recommended Hammarskjöld to succeed him. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise to Hammarskjöld. Seen as a competent technocrat without political views, he was selected on 31 March {{by a majority of}} 10 out of 11 Security Council members. The UN General Assembly elected him in the 7–10 April session by 57 votes out of 60. In 1957, he was re-elected.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Ferdinand I of Romania {{declared}} war on Austria-Hungary, the German Empire and the other Central Powers. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shock for the Germanophiles. Although subject to the Romanian Army draft, Bassarabescu managed to avoid being called into active duty, and was instead appointed captain of a military reserve in Mogoșoaia train station. Through their personal contacts, both Mehedinți and Maiorescu tried to get Bassarabescu appointed to an even safer position, at a postal censorship bureau.|$|E

Edur Velasco, a 56-year-old labor {{economist}} and university professor, was on a 42-day-long hunger strike sitting in a tent outside Mexico City's stock market, demanding that the government guarantee greater access to higher education among the youth. Days after his initiative, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise to see the multiplication of tents setting up outside the stock exchange building.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{shock when}} the first case of local HIV {{infection}} was reported in 1985. It galvanised a group of healthcare personnel (both gay and straight) {{to set up a}} non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Action For AIDS (AFA) in 1988 which provided support and counselling for AIDS victims as well as educating the public on safe sex. AFA was not technically part of the Singapore gay movement and has been careful to present itself as an NGO dealing with a public health issue. However, {{a significant portion of the}} energy and leadership behind it has been provided by gay people and in many practical ways AFA has rallied homosexuals around a cause.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> terrible blow to Mrs. Logan {{when the}} General became sick and died. She decided {{a change of}} scene would help her and so she {{traveled}} through Europe, chaperoning George Pullman's daughters. On her return, Mrs. Logan became the editor of The Home Magazine, of Washington, which ran from 1888 to 1908, writing reminiscences of historic events. She served on the syndicate staff of Hearst news service, was a contributor to other magazine and newspapers, and wrote several books. President Benjamin Harrison appointed Mrs. Logan {{one of the women}} commissioners of the District of Columbia to the Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893). She also worked on plans for the Garfield Memorial Hospital, having been president of the board nine years. Logan died in 1923.|$|E

25|$|Between 1990 and 1994, the ANC began {{preparing}} for the first democratic elections. It was an adjustment period and Mbeki {{played a crucial role}} in transforming the ANC into a legal political organisation. In 1991, the ANC was able to hold its first legal conference in the country after 30 years of being banned. The party now had the task of finding a middle ground for discussion between all the various factions: the returning exiles, the long-term prisoners and those who had stayed behind to lead the struggle. Mbeki was chosen as national chair while Cyril Ramaphosa was elected secretary general and the ANC's chief negotiator at the multiparty talks. Mbeki had up to this point been handling much of the diplomatic talks with the apartheid regime, and given his diplomatic experience and the level of bargaining that was expected, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise that Mbeki was sidelined in favour of Ramaphosa.|$|E
25|$|Overextension {{reduced the}} {{capabilities}} of the German Army and its allies to defend this territory and the Soviets mounted a decisive offensive at Stalingrad, encircling a German army. Soon both sides concentrated on the battle for the city, making Caucasus a secondary theatre. With Army Group B unable to hold the Volga line, Soviet offensives almost cut off Army Group A in Caucasus and it was forced to withdraw. The surrender of Sixth Army was a huge blow to German morale and <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great shock to Hitler. Despite the destruction of Sixth Army, the Soviets were only able to force the German Army back from Caucasus, delaying the final decision on the Eastern Front. The Soviet command overestimated its capabilities and pushed its forces forward to the limit of its supply lines, which led to defeat at the Third Battle of Kharkov and left the Germans able to fight the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{maintains}} that the Radcliffe Award was altered by Mountbatten; Gurdaspur was handed over to India and thus was manipulated the accession of Kashmir to India. As per the `notional' award {{that had already been}} put into effect for purposes of administration ad interim, all of Gurdaspur district, owing to its Muslim majority, was assigned to Pakistan. From August 14th to 17th, Mushtaq Ahmed Cheema acted as the Deputy Commissioner of the Gurdaspur District, but when, after a delay of two days, it was announced that the major portion of the district had been awarded to India instead of Pakistan, Cheema left for Pakistan. The major part of Gurdaspur district, i.e. three of the four sub-districts and {{a small part of the}} fourth, had been handed over to India giving India practical land access to Kashmir, thus making the Indian intervention in Kashmir possible. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great blow to Pakistan. Jinnah and other leaders of Pakistan, and particularly its officials, criticized the Award as ‘extremely unjust and unfair’.|$|E

He studied Jolin's numerous works and, as at this time the artists sold very few paintings, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise to him when Gotthardt bought 16 canvases.
