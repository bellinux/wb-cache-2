5|$|After the announcement, {{the ballot}} results were published: London {{gathered}} more {{votes in the}} first, third and final rounds, while Madrid won the second round despite falling short on votes {{in the third round}} and being eliminated. The competitiveness of the bids from Paris and London was ultimately <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a four-vote difference in the final round.|$|E
5|$|As was <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> Oleg Tvorogov and Constantine Zuckerman, among others, the 9th {{century and}} later sources {{are out of}} tune with the {{earliest}} records of the event. In his August sermon, Photius mentions neither Michael III's return to the capital nor the miracle with the veil (of which the author purportedly was a participant).|$|E

5|$|Attempting to {{circumvent}} the patent, Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators devised ailerons to emulate lateral control described in the patent and <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> the Wrights in their public flights.|$|E
5|$|Democratic transhumanists, such as American {{sociologist}} James Hughes, {{counter that}} many influential {{members of the}} United States Establishment are bioconservatives strongly opposed to human enhancement, as <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> President Bush's Council on Bioethics's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering. Furthermore, he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.|$|E
5|$|Disjoint Groups: some 12-clue puzzles {{have been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> Glenn Fowler. Later also 11-clue puzzles are found. It {{is not known}} {{if this is the}} best possible.|$|E
5000|$|A {{court may}} also refuse {{to order the}} return of a wrongfully removed child if the {{respondent}} <b>demonstrates,</b> <b>by</b> [...] "clear and convincing evidence" [...] that [...] "there is a grave risk {{that his or her}} return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." [...] Additionally, a respondent must also <b>demonstrate,</b> <b>by</b> clear and convincing evidence, that the courts in the country of habitual residence are either unable or unwilling to adequately protect the child from the alleged risk of harm or intolerable situation.|$|R

5|$|During {{his five}} {{years with the}} Indians he was {{primarily}} used as a starting pitcher, although he did display the versatility that would become his hallmark. He pitched in 139 games for the Indians, starting 100 and finishing 27. Early evidence of his versatility is <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> his 41 complete games, 9 shutouts and 8 saves.|$|E
5|$|In a multi-paper sequence, Dynnikov {{has studied}} the topological book embeddings of knots and links, showing that these embeddings can be {{described}} by a combinatorial sequence of symbols and that the topological equivalence of two links can be <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a sequence of local changes to the embeddings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st century AD rich burials first {{appeared}} and Tikal underwent {{a political and}} cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined. At {{the end of the}} Late Preclassic, the Izapan style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence Tikal, as <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city.|$|E
30|$|We will <b>demonstrate</b> <b>by</b> some {{numerical}} {{examples in}} Section  5 that the penalty approach {{of an additional}} dielectric medium with a high relative permittivity gives bad approximations of the floating potential in general.|$|R

5|$|It {{was later}} shown in 1948 by Astrid Fagraeus in her {{doctoral}} thesis that the plasma B cells are specifically involved in antibody production. The role of lymphocytes in mediating both cell-mediated and humoral responses was <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> James Gowans in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal {{is exposed to}} air for long periods at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels. Though {{the stars}} and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter that extends beyond the visible component, as <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> the universal rotation curve concept.|$|E

5|$|The Crisis carried editorials by Du Bois that {{supported}} the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated the racism <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. Du Bois also supported {{the principles of the}} Socialist Party (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> some socialist leaders.Lewis, p. 275 (denounced). Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of asexually-reproducing avian malaria parasites in {{cells of the}} internal organs was first <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> Henrique de Beaurepaire Aragão in 1908.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} an early example of efforts to move beyond theater {{blocking}} conventions. During the police raid, depth was <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> having action take place in both the foreground and the background, and by allowing actors to move between them. This cinematography technique improved the realism and pacing of the scene.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is the first {{investigation}} to <b>demonstrate,</b> <b>by</b> employing the combined approach of immunologically and electron microscope methods, the presence of actin-like contractile proteins in the mammalian retina, the corneal epithelium and endothelium, the iris, and the ciliary body, and to confirm their presence in lens epithelium. This is also the first report to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>by</b> these methods the presence of microfilaments and intermediate filaments in retinal vascular endothelium. Since we have shown that actin filaments are especially abundant in immature retinal endothelial cells, the question of their function arises, and we have discussed their possible relevance to the closure of immature retinal vessels when exposed to hyperoxia...|$|R
