It involves the creation of a parallel power-structure to a constitution, so that party members answer first to the party and second to the public. In turn, that party advances its own interests ahead of those of the public.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{whether a}} <b>government</b> <b>party</b> always prefers to {{negotiate}} with another compact party rather than with many different parties in a legislature. We claim that the interaction between ideological polarization and number of parties {{plays an important role}} in this decision. We start by modeling two types of legislatures: The 2 -parties legislature, in which the <b>government</b> <b>party</b> negotiates with another compact party; and the m+ 1 -parties legislature, in which it negotiates with m> 2 parties. Parties negotiate on both a public (ideological) and a distributive (private) policy. Our main result shows that the <b>government</b> <b>party</b> does not always prefer to negotiate in a bilateral situation. If the level of ideological polarization in the 2 -parties legislature is high enough, it prefers {{to negotiate with}} m less polarized parties. We also find that if there are two legislatures with the same number of <b>parties,</b> the <b>government</b> <b>party</b> prefers to negotiate in that with the smallest level of ideological polarization. number of parties, bargaining, legislature...|$|R

Third, almost all policy moves are towards the government coalition (the only exceptions occur during periods of divided government). Fourth, roll rates for <b>government</b> <b>parties</b> sky- rocket when they fall into the opposition and roll rates for opposition parties plummet when they enter government, while policy movements go from being nearly 100 per cent rightward {{when there is a}} rightist government to 100 per cent leftward under a leftist government...|$|R
