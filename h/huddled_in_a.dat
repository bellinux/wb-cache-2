25|$|Harlow {{had already}} placed newly born monkeys in {{isolation}} chambers {{for up to}} one year. With the pit of despair, he placed monkeys between three months and three years old in the chamber alone, after they had bonded with their mothers, for up to ten weeks. Within a few days, they had stopped moving about and remained <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner.|$|E
25|$|For {{days the}} {{survivors}} <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few two-story buildings surrounded by water, {{with little or}} no supplies, power, running water or communications. There was no search and rescue or military presence. Eventually, they evacuated themselves by using their own fishing boats. They headed for higher ground which meant St. Claude Avenue (closer to the Mississippi River) in Arabi and the Kaiser Aluminum plant in Chalmette.|$|E
25|$|Ant {{saw little}} action during the {{remainder}} of the Phoney War, but adopted Bozděch as his master, sleeping at the foot of his bed in barracks. With the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940, the airfield at Saint-Dizier was bombed by a wing of German Dornier Do 17s, while Bozděch and Ant were <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bunker. The attack destroyed all but fourteen of the planes at the base, and following this the local forces began their retreat. After moving to their third base, Bozděch took the decision to take Ant with him in the Potez 630 for the dog's first combat mission. Ant barely stirred, even when Bozděch was firing the guns at German fighters. The duo were reunited with a recovered Duval, who became Bozděch's pilot once again, while Ant continued to fly with them.|$|E

500|$|FIG {{became the}} first {{publicly}} performing women-only improvising group, and they challenged the established improvising community with performances that were theatrical, with politics and farce supplementing their music. They staged parodies around {{the role of women}} in society and incorporated domestic [...] "found objects" [...] in their performances, including [...] "vacuum cleaners, brooms, dustpans, pots and pans, and egg slicers". Their performances often had some of the women cleaning the stage, while the others <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> group to [...] "explore the sonic possibilities of household items." [...] They also broke down the barriers that traditionally existed between the performer and the audience by engaging in [...] "antiphonal exchange" [...] with them, and promoting the notion that [...] "anyone can do it". FIG redefined free improvisation by introducing [...] "social virtuosity", the ability to communicate with the other musicians and the audience.|$|E
500|$|Merrick {{arrived at}} Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely {{back in his}} own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not {{eligible}} to enter a workhouse in London {{for more than one}} night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was [...] away. He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card. The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves took him in a hansom cab to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for bronchitis, washed, fed and put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospital's attic.|$|E

500|$|There was a {{widespread}} expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, {{that they should}} be prepared for a double funeral. This did not occur; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train. Leech noted [...] "the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love". She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street. She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907. She died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907. William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.|$|E

60|$|The moon, as it rose {{over the}} veldt that night, shone on three {{horsemen}} spurring {{it along the}} Capetown road as though their very lives depended upon their speed.

2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "pit of despair" [...] {{was used}} in experiments conducted on rhesus macaque monkeys during the 1970s by American comparative psychologist Harry Harlow at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The {{aim of the research}} was to produce clinical depression. The vertical chamber was a stainless-steel bin with slippery sides that sloped to a rounded bottom. A 3/8 in. wire mesh floor 1 in. above the bottom of the chamber allowed waste material to drop out of holes. The chamber had a food box and a water-bottle holder, and was covered with a pyramid top so that the monkeys were unable to escape. Harlow placed baby monkeys in the chamber alone for up to six weeks. Within a few days, they stopped moving about and remained <b>huddled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner. [...] The monkeys generally exhibited marked social impairment and peer hostility when removed from the chamber; most did not recover.|$|E

2500|$|Successive {{experiments}} {{concluded that}} infants used the surrogate {{as a base}} for exploration, and a source of comfort and protection in novel and even frightening situations. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> experiment called the [...] "open-field test", an infant was placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> novel environment with novel objects. When the infant's surrogate mother was present, it clung to her, but then began venturing off to explore. If frightened, the infant ran back to the surrogate mother and clung to her for a time before venturing out again.
