40|$|It’s {{generally}} accepted {{that the pressure}} distribution between rotor and pads interface is uneven in <b>disc</b> <b>brakes.</b> In traditional brake torque calculation methods, the uniform interface pressure and the uniform pad wear are validated. However, {{at the beginning of}} brake process, the leading and trailing edge have been occurred at the rotor and pads interface depending on rotating direction of disc. There’s higher pressure between the rotor and the pad on the leading side than the trailing side. The pressure changes can’t be determined certainly because there’s no experimental method available <b>for</b> directly measuring <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> pressure while it’s operating. In this study, it has been represented a new method by using uneven pressure distribution at the rotor and pads interface.

40|$|In this paper, the {{nonlinear}} {{behavior of}} a one-dimensional model of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> is examined. The contact normal force between the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> lining and rotor is represented by a second order polynomial of the relative displacement between the two elastic bodies. The frictional force due to the sliding motion of the rotor against the stationary pad is modeled as a distributed follower-type axial load with time-dependent terms. By Galerkin discretization, the equation governing the transverse motion of the beam model is reduced {{to a set of}} extended Duffing system with quasi-periodically modulated excitations. Retaining the first two vibration modes in the governing equations, frequency response curves are obtained by applying a two-dimensional spectral balance method. For the first time, it is predicted that nonlinearity resulting from the contact mechanics between the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> lining and rotor can lead to a possible irregular motion (chaotic vibration) of the pad in the neighborhood of simple and parametric resonance. This chaotic behavior is identified and quantitatively measured by examining the Poincaré maps, Fourier spectra, and Lyapunov exponents. It is also found that these chaotic motions emerge as a result of successive Hopf bifurcations characterized by the torus breakdown and torus doubling routes as the excitation frequency varies. Various aspects of the numerical difficulties in the solution of the nonlinear equations are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{parametric}} {{instability of}} a beam {{subjected to a}} moving distributed contact load that also oscillates in the transverse direction of the beam is studied. Due {{to the presence of}} friction between the beam and the moving contact surface, the beam is excited by a pulsating, distributed, follower-type axial load, which results in the problem of a Leipholz column subjected to parametric excitation. The study of this prototypical one-dimensional model is intended to provide further understanding of the instability of systems that have similar loading conditions such as automotive <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> rubbed by the oscillatory rotor or beam-like structures. Effects of several parameters such as boundary conditions, coefficient of friction, intermediate supports, and waviness of the contact load on the instability are examined.

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum brake's {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the brake, a drum brake can provide more braking force than an equal diameter <b>disc</b> <b>brake.</b> The increased friction contact area of drum brake shoes on the drum allows drum brake shoes to last longer than <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> used in a brake system of similar dimensions and braking force.

A significant amount of the emitted dust was shown by size-fractionated optical particle counting to be inhalable in environmental (> 90 % mass) and occupational (> 50 % mass) exposure situations. Differentiation via selective solubility showed a considerable amount of Sb 2 S 3 to oxidize during the braking process, likely leading to the formation of Sb 2 O 3, a suspected human carcinogen.
