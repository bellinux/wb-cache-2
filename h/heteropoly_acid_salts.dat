40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the removal of phosphorus, arsenic and silica from tungstate or molybdate solutions by synergistic extraction with primary amine and tributyl phosphate (TBP) was investigated. Phosphorus, arsenic and silica {{were considered to be}} extracted into the organic phase as heterotungstic or heteromolybdic acids. The composition of the extracted species is strongly dependent on the concentration of tungsten and molybdenum and equilibrium pH values of the aqueous phase, An extraction mechanism based on the formation of hydrogen bonding between the primary amine, TBP and <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids</b> is proposed. The loaded organic phase was characterized by UV and IR spectra and by molar conductance, It is proposed from the experimental results that the proton transfer from the <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids</b> to the primary amine in the extracted species occurs intramolecularly, resulting in the formation of ion-associated species, because the primary amine is a weak base and <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids</b> are strong acids.

40|$|Due to {{diminishing}} {{oil reserves}} valorization of renewable {{resources such as}} biomass is becoming ever more important. In this regard, cellulose, as {{a major component of}} plant biomass, {{is one of the most}} promising feedstocks available. Cellulose can be converted into industrially valuable sugar alcohols (C 4 - 6) and smaller alcohols (C 1 - 3) via hydrolytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions, respectively. The use of diluted mineral acids in combination with supported ruthenium catalysts allowed efficient conversion of cellulose into C 5 - 6 -alcohols at only 160 °C. Importantly, this concept was successfully transferred to real feedstocks such as spruce and straw, resulting in almost full conversion of the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions to C 6 and C 5 polyols. In addition to mineral <b>acids,</b> tungsten-based <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids</b> in combination with supported ruthenium catalysts show promising results for the conversion of cellulose. Reactions with <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids</b> enabled not only almost full conversion of cellulose with a much lower acid concentration compared to sulfuric acid, but also show a remarkably high selectivity towards sugar alcohols. Although <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids</b> are promising catalysts for cellulose conversion, their water solubility hampers efficient product and catalyst recycling. To alleviate these issues, water-insoluble caesium <b>salts</b> of <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids,</b> as well as supported <b>heteropoly</b> <b>acids</b> were synthesized. However, for these materials catalyst stability remains challenging. As an alternative to expensive ruthenium catalysts, copper-based catalysts were found to also possess high activity for cellulose conversion. Hydrogenolysis reactions over CuO/ZnO/Al 2 O 3, performed at 245 °C, allow direct and efficient conversion of cellulose into smaller chain alcohols (C 1 - 3). Studies elucidating the reaction network showed that formation of these small-chain alcohols proceeds through a retro-aldol mechanism (leading C-C-bond cleavage), followed by hydrogenation. In general, hydrolytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of cellulose and wood proved to be a promising approach for valorization of lignocellulosic feedstocks and could present an alternative entry point for biorefineries by potentially enabling large-scale production of chemicals already implemented in today’s value chains...|$|R

The reactant molecules in the gas or liquid phase penetrate in between the polyanions and react inside the bulk solid. This concept is known as ‘pseudoliquid’ catalysis [13].|$|R
