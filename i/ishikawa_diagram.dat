50|$|Common {{uses of the}} <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>diagram</b> are {{product design}} and quality defect {{prevention}} to identify potential factors causing an overall effect.

5000|$|When {{the process}} {{triggers}} {{any of the}} control chart [...] "detection rules", (or alternatively, the process capability is low), other activities may be performed to identify {{the source of the}} excessive variation.The tools used in these extra activities include: <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>diagram,</b> designed experiments, and Pareto charts. Designed experiments are a means of objectively quantifying the relative importance (strength) of sources of variation. Once the sources of (special cause) variation are identified, they can be minimized or eliminated. Steps to eliminating a source of variation might include: development of standards, staff training, error-proofing, and changes to the process itself or its inputs.|$|E

While it is common to refer to pareto as [...] "80/20" [...] rule, under the assumption that, in all situations, 20% of causes determine 80% of problems, this ratio is merely a convenient rule of thumb and is not nor should it be considered an immutable law of nature.|$|E

50|$|SysML {{has been}} criticized for being {{incomplete}} although there is little to stop a practitioner from adding their own content. In SysML, there is no provision for several diagrams and graphically-oriented tools that are commonly used in system engineering. Some of these diagrams can be built, for example, by extending the intended use of block definition diagrams but the results are not always adequate and often not in concordance with the rules of the SysML language. Missing elements include functional block diagram, N2 chart , House of Quality, <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>diagram</b> (fishbone), parameter diagram and others. The language is continually improving and other diagram types are being considered for addition in future updates, should they be deemed sufficiently useful for inclusion.|$|E
5000|$|For {{quality control}} in {{manufacturing}} in the 1960s, Kaoru Ishikawa developed a {{cause and effect}} diagram, known as an <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>diagram</b> or fishbone diagram. The diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here. These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies [...] "causes" [...] in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and they are used {{in other areas of}} management and in design and engineering. Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction.|$|E

An <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>diagram,</b> also known as a cause-and-effect diagram or fishbone diagram, is often used in quality management in manufacturing industries. In this report, an <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>diagram</b> is used to demonstrate how to relate potential causes of a major presenting problem in a clinical setting. This tool can be used by teams in problem-based learning or in self-directed learning settings. An <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>diagram</b> annotated with references to relevant medical cases and literature can be continually updated and can assist memory and retrieval of relevant medical cases and literature. It could also be used to cultivate a lifelong learning habit in medical professionals...|$|E

30|$|Cause {{and effect}} {{diagrams}} ually called Fishbone diagram is an analytical decision tool {{used in the}} quality management {{for the analysis of}} the root cause of the defect. Cause and effect analysis was devised by Professor Kaoru Ishikawa, a pioneer of quality management, in the 1960 s. The technique was then published in his 1990 book, “Introduction to Quality Control.” The diagrams that create with Cause and Effect Analysis are known as <b>Ishikawa</b> <b>Diagrams</b> or Fishbone Diagrams (because a completed diagram can look like the skeleton of a fish). Cause and effect analysis was originally developed as a quality control tool; this tool has a variety of uses in the service industry as well to find out the reasons for the lack of quality.|$|R
