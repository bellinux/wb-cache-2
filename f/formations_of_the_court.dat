Yet neither <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> nor social scientists have examined whether <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> race conscious majority–minority districts sends messages to voters and what <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> these messages may be. This research begins to address this scientific issue. In a quantitative content analysis, we examined messages about racial redistricting conveyed to citizens via the print media.

Law has been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most thoroughly investigated aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European integration process, and EU law has become a well-established academic discipline, with the emergence more recently of an impressive body of legal and political science literature on 'European law in context'. Yet, this field has been dominated by an essentially judicial narrative, focused on <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European <b>courts,</b> underestimating in <b>the</b> process the multifaceted roles lawyers and law play in the EU polity, notably the roles they play beyond the litigation arena. This book promotes a deeper understanding of European law as a social and political phenomenon, presenting a more complete view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European legal field by looking beyond <b>the</b> <b>courts,</b> and at <b>the</b> same time broadening the scholarly horizon by exploring the ways in which European law is actually made. To do this, the book describes <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great variety <b>of</b> actors who stand behind legal norms and decisions, bringing together perspectives from various disciplines - law, political science, political sociology, and history - to offer a global multi-disciplinary reassessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> 'law' and 'lawyers' in the European integration process.
