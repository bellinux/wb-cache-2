5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} system eventually developed for Hibernia <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> matter. Insiders sometimes {{describe it as}} a “stand and fight” system – a fixed platform heavily fortified to withstand iceberg impact. It is strong on safety, {{but it was not}} cheap.|$|E

25|$|It is {{one thing}} to impose a tax {{dependent}} upon the conduct of the taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> thing to say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} practical {{obstacle to}} a completely democratically elected and representative UNPA is that, {{in contrast to}} the situation in which the European Parliament functions, a significant number of UN members, including populous countries such as China are not electoral democracies. In the past, bodies such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights were criticized for being dominated by abusive regimes. If UNPA representatives were to be drawn from member nations' parliaments, it could create legitimacy concerns since some national legislatures are regarded as a rubber stamp for the rulers' decrees. Some global parliament proponents, such as Prof. Lucio Levi, propose starting a federation limited to democracies: [...] "Though the democratization of states all over the world hasn’t been completed, this does not preclude starting the democratization of the UN. Six Western European countries founded the European Community, starting its democratization without waiting for the democratization of the institutions of all the European states." [...] UNA-USA's Jeff Laurenti notes the problems associated with excluding undemocratic countries from membership: [...] "It is one thing to deny membership to a few small [...] "rogue" [...] dictatorships. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> to exclude China, the vast majority of Arab countries, and two-thirds of Africa, and imagine that the resulting body can have a formal consultative or oversight role with United Nations agencies, be part of UN-sponsored negotiations on multilateral conventions (the real work of international legislating), or pass on the resolutions of UN political bodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2007 {{article by}} Colette Braeckman in Le Monde Diplomatique {{strongly}} questions {{the reliability of}} Judge Bruguière's report and suggests the direct involvement of French military personnel acting for or with the Presidential Guard of the Rwanda governmental forces in the missile attack on the aircraft. In a 2007 interview with the BBC, Kagame said he would co-operate with an impartial inquiry. The BBC concluded, [...] "Whether any judge would want to take on such a task <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 9, 2015, Kristina Ruehli filed a {{defamation}} {{lawsuit against}} Cosby for denying her claims of rape. Ruehli's allegations against Cosby date back the furthest, with claims that Cosby assaulted her in 1965. She claims Cosby's vehement denials leveled against the numerous accusers in 2014 are grounds for defamation. Ruehli's complaint states, in part, [...] "It {{is one thing}} for an accused sexual assailant to remain silent and allow the legal process, or public opinion, to run its course, but it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> for him to unleash his agents to deny that he attacked the plaintiff and other women, to invite others to republish his statements, and to brand them as unreliable liars." [...] In an account from The New York Times Ruehli has dropped her lawsuit without prejudice as of June 24, 2016.|$|E
2500|$|My So-Called Life was {{produced}} before {{the explosion of}} youth and teen programming. The culture of television changed significantly {{in the years that}} immediately followed, most notably with the rise of The WB and UPN, networks that eventually catered to the teenaged audience My So-Called Life sought, in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) (The WB and UPN launched just two weeks and one week respectively before My So-Called Lifes run on ABC ended). Holzman never intended the show to be exclusively for teens. In the end, not enough viewers of any age were watching the show during its initial network run. ABC was more focused on larger ratings numbers and wider demographics. Holzman said, [...] "It is one thing to have huge ratings, but it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> to have smaller ratings but with an extremely passionate following. I don't understand why the network did not understand that." ...|$|E
