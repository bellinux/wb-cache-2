5|$|By {{virtue of}} their third-place finish in the 2007–08 Primera División, Barcelona entered the 2008–09 Champions League at the third {{qualifying}} round. Based on their UEFA coefficient, Barcelona were seeded for the third qualifying round draw, and drawn against Polish champions Wisła Kraków. A 4–0 win in the first leg at the Camp Nou made defeat in the second leg <b>immaterial</b> and Barcelona were entered into the group stage draw.|$|E
5|$|Just one sound can be {{complete}} in itself, for its complexity {{lies in the}} formulation of ma, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of dynamically tensed absence of sound. For example, in the performance of nō, the ma of sound and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an <b>immaterial</b> balance.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was <b>immaterial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps <b>immaterial,</b> timeless qualities.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} <b>immaterial</b> {{concepts}} such as the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} special cap power-ups appear {{in certain areas}} on many stages. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to {{withstand}} wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially <b>immaterial</b> and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons {{can be used to}} reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.|$|E

25|$|<b>Immaterial</b> souls exist, but {{are part}} of {{deterministic}} framework.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge commons {{encompass}} <b>immaterial</b> {{and collectively}} owned {{goods in the}} information age.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immaterial</b> souls {{exist and}} exert a {{non-deterministic}} causal influence on bodies. (Traditional free-will, interactionist dualism).|$|E
25|$|One {{argument}} against Dualism is {{with regard to}} causal interaction. If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and <b>immaterial</b> are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an <b>immaterial</b> mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally <b>immaterial</b> can affect something totally material—this is the basic problem of causal interaction.|$|E
25|$|In Berlin 30% - 35% of Gymnasium {{places are}} {{allocated}} by lottery. A student's performance at primary school is <b>immaterial.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Immaterial</b> souls do {{not exist}} — there is no mind-body dichotomy, {{and there is a}} Materialistic {{explanation}} for intuitions to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|Mental {{volition}} nourishes {{the three}} kinds of being (sense-sphere, fine-material and <b>immaterial</b> beings). Understanding this nutriment leads to understanding the three cravings.|$|E
25|$|Philo of Alexandria {{identifies}} the angel with the Logos inasmuch as the angel is the <b>immaterial</b> voice of God. The angel is {{something different from}} God himself, but is conceived as God's instrument.|$|E
25|$|In the {{dialogue}} Phaedo, Plato formulated his famous Theory of Forms as distinct and <b>immaterial</b> substances {{of which the}} objects and other phenomena that we perceive {{in the world are}} nothing more than mere shadows.|$|E
25|$|Mathematical anti-realism {{generally}} {{holds that}} mathematical statements have truth-values, {{but that they}} do not do so by corresponding to a special realm of <b>immaterial</b> or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include Formalism and Fictionalism.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{took place}} in the islands, and if people were caught the {{penalties}} were severe, a number of civilians died in prisons. There were few instances of active resistance and <b>immaterial</b> damage was done to the occupying forces.|$|E
25|$|Avicenna's {{psychology}} {{requires that}} {{connection between the}} body and soul {{be strong enough to}} ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the <b>immaterial</b> human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the <b>immaterial</b> soul may only receive the <b>immaterial,</b> universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.|$|E
25|$|The Ante Rem, or fully realist, {{variation}} of structuralism {{has a similar}} ontology to Platonism in that structures are held {{to have a real}} but abstract and <b>immaterial</b> existence. As such, it faces the usual problems of explaining the interaction between such abstract structures and flesh-and-blood mathematicians.|$|E
25|$|While {{supporters}} of the aetherial theory accepted the possibility that negatively charged particles are produced in Crookes tubes, they believed {{that they are a}} mere by-product and that the cathode rays themselves are <b>immaterial.</b> Thomson set out to investigate whether or not he could actually separate the charge from the rays.|$|E
25|$|The materialist view {{is perhaps}} best {{understood}} in its opposition to the doctrines of <b>immaterial</b> substance applied to the mind historically, famously by René Descartes. However, by itself materialism says nothing about how material substance should be characterized. In practice, it is frequently assimilated to one variety of physicalism or another.|$|E
25|$|The New Testament {{follows the}} {{terminology}} of the Septuagint, and thus {{uses the word}} psyche with the Hebrew semantic domain and not the Greek, that is an invisible power (or ever more, for Platonists, immortal and <b>immaterial)</b> that gives life and motion to the body and is responsible for its attributes.|$|E
25|$|While the Infantry {{likes to}} claim that the Infantry OCS course {{developed}} by General Bradley is the precursor of the branch <b>immaterial</b> course taught at Fort Benning, the truth is more likely that the integration of the various Combat, Combat Support and Combat Service Support duties that Officers perform caused the various OCS training programs to be combined.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Taoism had {{no concept}} of Hell, as {{morality}} was seen to be a man-made distinction and there was {{no concept of}} an <b>immaterial</b> soul. In its home country China, where Taoism adopted tenets of other religions, popular belief endows Taoist Hell with many deities and spirits who punish sin in a variety of horrible ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{score to}} be awarded is the actual Game Value. How high the player bid during the auction is <b>immaterial,</b> {{as long as the}} Game Value is at least as high as declarer's bid (see Overbid Hands above). Note that often the score will be higher than the auction value, because players {{typically}} do not bid as high as their hand would allow.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Justices' {{questions}} {{indicated a}} belief that Johnson v. Eisentrager was <b>immaterial</b> to the jurisdictional question at hand, while the government {{argued that it was}} material. Justice Stevens noted that the Ahrens v. Clark decision, the basis of the Eisentrager decision, had since been largely reversed in Braden (1973), and thus relevant parts of Eisentrager may no longer apply.|$|E
25|$|But if in {{addition}} to interchanging {{the names of the}} values we also interchange the names of the two binary operations, now there is no trace of what we have done. The end product is completely indistinguishable from what we started with. We might notice that the columns for x∧y and x∨y in the truth tables had changed places, but that switch is <b>immaterial.</b>|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} arguments, Craig {{concludes that the}} premise that the {{universe}} began to exist is more plausible than not, and conjoined with premise 1, the beginning of the universe implies the existence of a cause. Craig claims that, due to its nature, the cause must be an uncaused, beginningless, changeless, timeless, spaceless, <b>immaterial</b> being of enormous power, which he refers to as God.|$|E
25|$|Headquarters {{elements}} of Army commands, agencies, garrisons, centers, schools, depots and miscellaneous organizations are authorized guidons of distinctive design and colors. Generally these guidons follow {{the design of}} the unit’s Organizational Flag. Various units not oriented to a specific branch, e.g. US Army Garrisons, have a teal blue guidon with the branch <b>immaterial</b> insignia (the Coat of Arms of the U.S. within a ring) in yellow.|$|E
25|$|Formed in 1987 by {{brothers}} Christopher and Anthony Griffiths, {{the original}} line-up consisted of Chris Griffiths (guitar, vocals), Tony Griffiths (bass, vocals), Dave Reilly (drums, ex-China Crisis), Jay Norton (keyboards, ex-It's <b>Immaterial),</b> and Gordon Morgan (guitar, ex-Black). Tony Elson replaced Dave Reilly on drums {{and was later}} replaced by Garry Ford. Gordon Morgan was replaced by Sean Simpson, followed by Alan Gillibrand, then by Ian 'Sitar'.|$|E
25|$|The Petitioners {{argued that}} the {{definition}} in the CAA is so broad that carbon dioxide must be counted as an air pollutant. They claimed that the question was controlled by {{the words of the}} statute, so that factual debate was <b>immaterial.</b> Furthermore, the Petitioners filed substantial scientific evidence that the toxicity of carbon dioxide results from high concentrations and that causation of global warming transforms the gas into a pollutant.|$|E
25|$|Although this {{statutory}} definition broadly corresponds to its common law counterpart, {{there are two}} key differences. First, unlike the common law offence which requires evidence of a seditious intent, an offender's intention is irrelevant under the Sedition Act, and it suffices that the act possesses the requisite seditious tendency. Thus, it is <b>immaterial</b> that the offender failed to foresee or misjudged the risk {{that his or her}} act would be seditious.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God created and governed {{the world through}} mediators. Logos is the chief among them, the next to God, demiurge of the world. Logos is <b>immaterial,</b> an {{adequate}} image of God, his shadow, his firstborn son. Being {{the mind of the}} Eternal, Logos is imperishable. He is neither uncreated as God is, nor created as men are, but occupies a middle position. He has no autonomous power, only an entrusted one.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the sense}} of the Constitution, bills of credit signify a paper medium of {{exchange}} intended to circulate between individuals, and between the Government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society. It is <b>immaterial</b> whether the quality of legal tender is imparted to such paper. Interest-bearing certificates in denominations up to ten dollars that were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section. The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes, nor to execute instruments binding themselves to pay money at a future day for services rendered or money borrowed. Bills issued by state banks are not bills of credit; it is <b>immaterial</b> that the State is the sole stockholder of the bank, that the officers of the bank were elected by the state legislature, or that the capital of the bank was raised by the sale of state bonds.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 4th century, the Church Fathers agreed {{that there were}} {{different}} categories of angels, with appropriate missions and activities assigned to them. There was, however, some disagreement regarding the nature of angels. Some argued that angels had physical bodies, while some maintained that they were entirely spiritual. Some theologians had proposed that angels were not divine but {{on the level of}} <b>immaterial</b> beings subordinate to the Trinity. The resolution of this Trinitarian dispute included the development of doctrine about angels.|$|E
