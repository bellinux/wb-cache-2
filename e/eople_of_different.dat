40|$|Objectives: <b>eople</b> <b>of</b> low {{socioeconomic}} status are shorter {{than those of}} high {{socioeconomic status}}. The {{first two years of}} life being critical for height development, we hypothesized that a low socioeconomic status is associated with a slower linear growth in early childhood. We studied maternal educational level (high, mid-high, mid-low, and low) as a measure of socioeconomic status and its association with repeatedly measured height in children aged 0 – 2 years, and also examined to what extent known determinants of postnatal growth contribute to this association. Methods: This study was based on data from 2972 mothers with a Dutch ethnicity, and their children participating in The Generation R Study, a population-based cohort study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (participation rate 61 %). All children were born between April 2002 and January 2006. Height was measured at 2 months (mid- 90 % range 1. 0 – 3. 9), 6 months (mid- 90 % range 5. 6 – 11. 4), 14 months (mid- 90 % range 13. 7 – 17. 9) and 25 months of age (mid- 90 % range 23. 6 – 29. 6). Results: At 2 months, children in the lowest educational subgroup were shorter than those in the highest (difference: 20. 87 cm; 95 % CI: 21. 16, 20. 58). Between 1 and 18 months, they grew faster than their counterparts. By 14 months, children in the lowest educational subgroup were taller than those in the highest (difference at 14 months: 0. 40 cm; 95 % CI...|$|R
40|$|Poles in New Zealand {{have been}} living there since XIX century. During that time Poland has fallen into Soviet Empire as its {{political}} satellite. It {{is well known that}} emigrant groups ofPoles were invigilated by polish – communist special forces around the World (mainly in West countries). There was a lack of evidences in available literature if Poles in New Zealand or from New Zealand were under P <b>eople’s</b> Republic <b>of</b> Poland scrutiny. Hence question has arisen in what way Poles and New Zealand were under polish – communist special forces scrutiny and if so how did it affect the life of Poles in New Zealand at all? After a broad search query conducted in archives (located in Poland and in the United Kingdom) and literature the hypothesis was posed that polish – communist special security forces were unable to impact the socio – political life of Poles in New Zealand. This assumption was tested out of evidences written in primary sourcesReceived answers may lay a basis for further examinations on the role of polish – communist special forces in live of Poles abroad. Moreover results of this research may be useful in comparative studies for those interested about People Republic of Poland’s special forces activity toward polish emigrants in different countries at that time.
