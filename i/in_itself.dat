5|$|Suburban localities in Royton include Haggate, Heyside, Holden Fold, Long Sight (or Longsight), Oozewood, Royley, Salmon Fields, Stott Field, Thornham, and Thorp. Thornham was {{formerly}} a township <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> but was amalgamated into Royton in the late-19th century.|$|E
5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} does not, <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> entitle {{the holder}} to enter another country. To enter another country, the traveler {{must comply with}} the visa and entry requirements of the other countries to be visited, which vary {{from country to country}} and may apply specifically to a particular passport type, the traveller's nationality, criminal history, health issues, evidence of sufficient funds, evidence of ticket for exit or many other factors.|$|E

5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|As {{it appears}} that the {{decision}} of the court of appeals was rested, in addition to other grounds, upon a distinct and independent ground, not involving any federal question, and sufficient <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> to maintain the judgment, the writ of error falls within the wellsettled rule on that subject, and cannot be maintained.|$|E
5|$|Association {{football}} <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> {{does not}} have a classical history. Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, the new {{district}} of Lyallpur {{was formed to}} include the tehsils of Samundri and Toba Tek Singh with a sub-tehsil at Jaranwala, which later became a full tehsil <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> The University of Agriculture, originally the Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute, Lyallpur, was established in 1906. The Town Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee in 1909. Lyallpur grew into an established agricultural tool and grain centre. The 1930s brought industrial growth and market expansion to the textile industry {{as well as to}} food processing, grain crushing and chemicals.|$|E

5|$|Just one sound can be {{complete}} <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> for its complexity {{lies in the}} formulation of ma, an unquantifiable metaphysical space (duration) of dynamically tensed absence of sound. For example, in the performance of nō, the ma of sound and silence does not have an organic relation for the purpose of artistic expression. Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with one another in an immaterial balance.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E
5|$|The Inner Ring Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of the 1960s.
