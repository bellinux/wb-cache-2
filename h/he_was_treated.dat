5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> as a government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited {{him to come to}} Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which {{made it difficult for}} him to work or even talk. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{developed}} {{what was}} thought to be influenza (then referred to as grippe) in February 1901. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with steam vapor inhalation and oxygen, but his condition worsened. He died from pneumonia at his home in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 13, 1901, at the age of 67.

50|$|O’Brien {{recounts the}} two times he took a bullet. The first time, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> by Rat Kiley, and is {{impressed}} with the man’s courage and skill. The second time, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> by Kiley’s replacement, Bobby Jorgenson; Jorgenson is incompetent, and nearly kills O’Brien. Furious, O’Brien promises revenge, but can only recruit Azar. They scare Jorgenson by pretending to be enemy soldiers, but when Jorgenson proves that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> no longer a coward, O’Brien lets go of his resentment.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{always seen}} wearing typical host-style apparel, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{known as a}} {{depressed}} character, which is reflected in his skits, {{and in the way}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> by other owarai talents.|$|R
5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{the band}} {{appeared}} at the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in the United Kingdom, performing {{to an audience of}} more than 100,000. One show featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer (and Mustaine's former bandmate) Lars Ulrich. The band was added to the Monsters of Rock European tour, but left after the first show due to Ellefson's drug problems, for which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> immediately.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> never <b>was</b> {{pleased with}} anything; teased his mother half the night, and drove Ellen about all day. She, good girl, never said {{one word of}} impatience, but bore it all with the sweetest good humour; but her mother now and then spoke {{severely}} for Alfred's own good, and then he made himself more miserable than ever, and thought she was unkind and harsh, and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very much to be pitied for having a mother who could not bear with her poor sick boy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>treating</b> his mother as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treating</b> his Father in Heaven.|$|R
5|$|Morshead {{returned}} to Australia on 22 January 1916 where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> at the 4th General Hospital at Randwick, New South Wales. After he recovered, he was posted to the 33rd Infantry Battalion, which was being raised in Armidale {{as part of}} the 3rd Division. He became its commander on 16 April, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel three days later. He embarked for England again with his battalion on 4 May 1916.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Seward {{enjoyed his}} time in Georgia, where he was {{accepted}} as an adult {{for the first time}} in his life. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> hospitably, but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As it was too late for him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no records}} of {{diseases}} experienced by Belgrano during his youth or adolescence. His first illness {{dates from the}} time of his return to Buenos Aires, when he worked in the Consulate; he experienced symptoms of syphilis caught during his stay in Spain. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> by the most prestigious physicians of the city: Miguel Gorman from the Protomedicato of Buenos Aires, Miguel García de Rojas, and José Ignacio de Arocha. This disease forced him to take long leaves from his work at the Consulate and take repose stays at Maldonado and San Isidro. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with salts and iodines, and his condition eventually improved. It is also suspected that he may have had rheumatism. By the year 1800 he had a growing lacrimal fistula in one of his eyes and was invited by the King to move to Spain for a cure. He was offered a one-year leave with paid wages, but he rejected it, giving priority to his work for the nation over his own personal health. The fistula would later stabilise at a safe and unnoticeable size.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his stronghold in Kediri, Trunajaya managed to escape to the {{mountains}} of eastern Java. VOC and the king's forces chased Trunajaya, who, isolated and deprived of food, surrendered to the VOC {{at the end of}} 1679. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with respect as a captive of the VOC commander. However, during a ceremonial visit to the royal residence in Payak, East Java, on 2 January 1680, he was personally stabbed by Amangkurat, and the king's courtiers finished him off. The king defended this killing of a VOC prisoner by saying that Trunajaya had tried to kill him. The VOC was not convinced by this explanation, but it chose not to call the king into account. A romanticised account of Trunajaya's death appears in the 18th-century Central Javanese babads.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{extinguished}} {{the fires}} without any major {{damage to the}} school. Saari remained at large for {{some time in the}} school grounds after they had been evacuated. Two days after the killings, a friend of Saari's, named Rauno, told 7 päivää that at 11:53 he received a call from Saari in which he confessed to having killed ten people. Saari is claimed to have spoken to Rauno in a calm manner, telling him that he wanted to say goodbye. He was found alive by the police at 12:30, having shot himself in the head. He was taken to Tampere University Hospital, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> for his gunshot wound. He died a short time later at 17:40.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{high time}} {{to urge the}} use of a little {{imagination}} in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know in recent philosophic history. Schiller says the truth is that which 'works.' Thereupon <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> as one who limits verification to the lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives 'satisfaction'! <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> as one who believes in calling everything true which, if it were true, would be pleasant. (James 1907, p. 90) ...|$|R
50|$|In April 1960, {{he becomes}} a patient at Sundby {{hospital}} in Strängnäs where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> for depression. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> given electroshock and medications. On 22 July 1960, he commits suicide by drowning in a nearby lake.|$|R
