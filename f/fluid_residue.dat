Pleural manometry {{can be used to}} recognize a not-expanded lung. METHODS: Interval pleural pressure measurements with a high temporal resolution were performed after each removal of 200 mL of fluid to observe pleural pressure swings. Pleural elastance was defined as the difference in pleural pressure divided by the change in volume. Chest x-rays were performed to evaluate lung expansion, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and <b>fluid</b> <b>residue.</b> RESULTS: Thirty-four procedures in 30 patients were eligible for analysis. Four patients had incomplete lung expansion after drainage. No reexpansion pulmonary edema was observed. Pleural pressure swing after 200 mL drainage was higher when the lung did not expand. Pleural elastance after removal of 500 mL was higher in the not-expanded subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a high pleural pressure swing after removal of only 200 mL was related to incomplete lung expansion. We confirmed the association between pleural elastance and lung expansion.

40|$|Determining {{the amount}} and {{distribution}} of residual hydrocarbon in granular media is important for monitoring secondary and tertiary recovery processes during hydrocarbon production. The distribution of residual hydrocarbon {{is affected by the}} structure of the granular media (layering, grain, pore size, etc.), and the method used to produce oil (single well, multi-well, etc.). Seismic technique are often used to monitor the recovery process, thus, it is required that the effect of structure and hydrocarbon distribution be understood. The objectives of this thesis work is to determine if acoustic methods can (1) delineate sediment structure caused by variation in grain size and (2) delineate {{the amount and}} spatial distribution of residual hydrocarbon. ^ Naturally occurring sediments are often complicated in composition and structure that results in a range of seismic attenuation mechanisms. For this study, synthetic sediments with idealized 3 -D sediment structures were created from glass beads (with known composition and geometry) saturated with two fluid phase: water and paraffin wax. A series of control experiments were performed using different saturation techniques to (1) explore the immiscible fluid displacement processes and (2) to study the effect of amount and the spatial distribution of the immiscible <b>fluid</b> <b>residue</b> on the acoustic response. An acoustic tomographic approach was used to delineate the 3 -D sediment structure and to study the effect of sediment structure on the amount and the spatial distribution of the immiscible fluid. From the control experiments, it was determined that the saturation method affected the residual wax distribution in the pores. The residual wax distribution can be categorized into four types, i. e. bridging, thin fingering, cements at grain contacts, and patchy saturation. The tomographic experiments determined that sediment structure caused by a variation in grain size could barely be determined seismically. However, the 3 -D sediment structure was clearly determined when residual paraffin resided in the sediment. Even residual saturation of less than 1 % altered the seismic signal of the sediments. ^ Seismic-wave attenuation and velocity is sensitive to alteration of the grain contact stiffness even for only a few percent residual hydrocarbon saturation and to spatial features that are ∼ 1 / 100 of a wavelength. Thus the affect of micro-scale phenomena on macro-scale measurements of seismic wave attenuation and velocity cannot be ignored. ...|$|E

Using these techniques, we compare toe pad microstructure in two distantly related species of tree frog, Litoria caerulea, White (Hylidae) and Rhacophorus prominanus, Smith (Rhacophoridae), in which the toe pads are considered to be convergent. AFM demonstrates the extraordinary similarity of both surface microstructures (largely hexagonal epithelial cells surrounded by deep channels) and nanostructures (an array of nanopillars, ca. 350 nm in diameter, all with a small dimple at the apex). The cryo-SEM studies examined the distribution of the fibrillar cytoskeleton within the different layers of the stratified toe pad epithelium, demonstrating that the cytoskeletal elements (keratin tonofilaments) that lie at an angle to the surface are relatively poorly developed in L. caerulea, clearly so in comparison to R. prominanus. Cryo-SEM also enabled the visualization of the fluid layer that is critical to a toe pad's adhesive function. This was achieved by examination of the frozen <b>fluid</b> <b>residues</b> left behind after removal of a toe within the cryo-SEM's experimental chamber. Such ‘toeprints’ demonstrated the presence of a wedge of fluid surrounding each toe pad, as well as fluid filling the channels that surround each epithelial cell. Cryo-SEM was used to examine epithelial cell shape. In a sample of 582 cells, 59. 5 % were hexagonal, the remainder being mainly pentagonal (23. 1 %) or heptagonal (16. 1 %). The distribution of differently-shaped cells was not random, but was not associated with either pad curvature or the distribution of mucous pores that provide fluid for the frogs' wet adhesion mechanism. Our main finding, the great similarity of toe pad structure in these two species, has important implications for biomimetics, for such convergent evolution suggests a good starting point for attempts to develop adhesives that will function in wet conditions...|$|R

40|$|Vaginal fluid is {{most often}} found at crime scenes where a sexual assault has taken place or on {{clothing}} or other items collected from sexual assault victims or perpetrators. Because the victim is generally known in these cases, detection of vaginal fluid {{is not a matter}} of individual identification, as it might be for semen identification. Instead, linkages can be made between victim and suspect if the sexual assault was carried out digitally or with a foreign object (e. g., bottle, pool cue, cigarette, handle of a hammer or other tool, etc.). If such an object is only analyzed for DNA and the victim is identified, the suspect may claim that the victim’s DNA is present because she handled and/or is the owner of the object and not because it was used to sexually assault her; identification of vaginal <b>fluid</b> <b>residue</b> would alleviate such uncertainty. Most of the research conducted thus far regarding methods for the identification of vaginal fluid involves mRNA biomarkers and identification of various bacterial strains. 1 - 3 However, these approaches require extensive sample preparation and laboratory analysis and have not fully explored the genomic differences among all body fluid RNAs. No existing methods of vaginal fluid identification incorporate both high specificity and rapid analysis. 4 Therefore, a new rapid detection method is required. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an emerging technique with high sensitivity for the forensic analysis of various body fluids. This technique has the potential to improve current vaginal fluid identification techniques due to its ease-of-use, rapid analysis time, portability, and non-destructive nature. For this experiment, all vaginal fluid samples were collected from anonymous donors by saturation of a cotton swab via vaginal insertion. Samples were analyzed on gold nanoparticle chips. 4 This nanostructured metal substrate is essential for the large signal-enhancement effect of SERS and also quenches any background fluorescence that sometimes interferes with normal Raman spectroscopy measurements. 5 Vaginal fluid SERS signal variation of a single sample over a six-month period was evaluated under both ambient and frozen storage conditions. Vaginal fluid samples were also taken from 10 individuals over the course of a single menstrual cycle. Four samples collected at one-week intervals were obtained from each individual and analyzed using SERS. The SERS vaginal fluid signals showed very little variation as a function of time and storage conditions, indicating that the spectral pattern of vaginal fluid is not likely to change over time. The samples analyzed over the span of one menstrual cycle showed slight intra-donor differences, however, the overall spectral patterns remained consistent and reproducible. When cycle spectra were compared between individuals, very little donor-to-donor variation was observed indicating the potential for a universal vaginal fluid signature spectrum. A cross-validated, partial least squares – discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was built to classify all body fluids, where vaginal fluid was identified with 95. 0 % sensitivity and 96. 6 % specificity, which indicates that the spectral pattern of vaginal fluid was successfully distinguished from semen and blood. Thus, SERS has a high potential for application in the field of forensic science for vaginal fluid analysis...|$|E

The UVB-induced one-electron oxidation of Trp produces •Trp and O 2 •- radicals which trigger lipid peroxidation. Immunoblots from buffered solutions or suction blister fluid reveal that propagation of photooxidative damage to other residues such as Tyr or disulfide bonds produces intra- and intermolecular bonds in apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and B 100. Partial repair of phenoxyl tyrosyl radicals (TyrO•) by α-tocopherol is observed with LDL and HDL on millisecond or second time scales, whereas limited repair of α-tocopherol by carotenoids occurs in only HDL. More effective repair of Tyr and α-tocopherol is observed with the flavonoid, quercetin, bound to serum albumin, but quercetin is less potent than new synthetic polyphenols in inhibiting LDL lipid peroxidation or restoring α-tocopherol.

As a result of these conditions only a few inspection methods can fulfill this task.

40|$|As feature sizes in {{semiconductor}} devices become smaller and newer materials are incorporated, current methods for photoresist and post plasma etch residue removal face several challenges. A cleaning process should be environmentally benign, compatible with dielectric materials and copper, and provide residue removal from narrow and high aspect ratio features. In this work, sub-critical CO 2 based mixtures {{have been developed}} to remove the etch residues; these mixtures satisfy the above requirements and can potentially replace the two step residue removal process currently used in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. Based on the chemical nature of the residue being removed, additives or co-solvents to CO 2 have been identified that can remove the residues without damaging the dielectric layers. Using the phase behavior of these additives as a guide, the composition of the co-solvent was altered to achieve a single liquid phase at moderate pressures without compromising cleaning ability. The extent of residue removal has been analyzed primarily by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Various techniques such as attenuated total reflection - Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS), and interferometry were used to probe the interaction of cleaning <b>fluids</b> with <b>residues.</b> Model films of photoresists and plasma deposited residues were used to assist in understanding the mechanism of residue removal. From these studies, it was concluded that residue removal takes place primarily by attack of the interface between the residue and the substrate; a solvent rinse then lifts these residues from the wafer. It has been shown that transport of the additives to the interface is enhanced in the presence of CO 2. From positronium annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) studies on a porous dielectric film, {{it has been shown that}} these high pressure fluids do not cause significant changes to the pore sizes or the bonding structure of the film.

40|$|Gel {{residues}} {{occur as}} the result of repeated anti-icing fluid application that leaves a powdery film upon dryout that, when rehydrated, can swell up to over 600 times its weight. When these gels collect on aircraft flight control surfaces in aerodynamically quiet areas and freeze, they give rise to reduced performance, increased stick force, slowed rotation and have caused jammed flight controls. Laboratory tests have been developed to simulate the gel formation by drying out fluids and rehydrating them. However, by their complex nature, much variation is seen between test results from different laboratories and the results are not yet considered by fluid users. Testing carried out at AMIL on different fluids with different test methods has led to a more reproducible results and a potential classification of fluids based on their gel formation potential (GFP). It was found that complete dryout of the fluid, steady immersion, plate etching, wait times, oven temperature, and number of fluid immersions are important factors to the reproducibility of the test method. While, bubbles in the test sample, fluid dilutions, fluid viscosity and weight of the dryout residues had little effect on the tests results.

At 800 degrees C, they are distributed between 60 nm and 100 nm and total porosity is 37 % (including 33 % arising from the nanoporosities). The hydroxyapatite crystal structure is transformed less at 600 degrees C, so this temperature should be preferred. Signcance.

Because the respective transgene products are integral parts of the GM plants and their expression is coupled to the physiology and metabolism of the plant, exposure of associated organisms can be multi-fold and complex. Exposure can be bitrophic via the GM plant including any metabolites of the transgene products in <b>residues,</b> <b>fluids</b> (e.g. phloem) or secretions (e.g. nectar, root exudates). Exposure of higher order consumers can occur through multitrophic exposure routes when the transgene products move through the food web. Also, after movement and expression of the transgenes in other genetic contexts (e.g. wild relatives), an entirely different suite of organisms can get into contact with the novel transgene products. The same holds true after spread of the transgene products, such as the Bt-toxin including any metabolites, away from the field of release of the GM plant e.g. embedded in wind dispersed GM pollen or in GM plant residue washed into water systems like ponds, lakes, creeks and rivers, or leaching of transgene products into the soil. Determination of the possible exposure pathways requires a solid characterization of the GM plant and the expressed novel traits and accompanying management systems. Hence, this step builds on and is only as good as the information collated in the previous component I. Because GM plants can multiply and spread via pollen and seed flow, this exercise will differ significantly from an exposure analysis of chemicals.|$|R

The objective of this test was to reduce the complexity of in vitro methods for feed assessment simplifying the composition of fermentation medium and reducing the dosage of rumen fluid as inoculum of fermentation. Another goal was to reuse residual fluids of fermentation as microbial inoculum for feeds incubation. The test was carried out using as substrate of fermentation 2 by‐products (tomato peels and citrus pulp) and a roughage (Silybum marianum ‐ milk thistle) incubated with two different mediums (the conventional Menke medium and a “simplified” medium) and two different ratios between inoculums and medium (inoculum/medium = 5 / 55 ml or 30 / 30 ml). Three subsequent incubations were carried out: each lasted 12 h, for a total incubation time of 36 h. In the second and in the third incubation the residual fluid of fermentation of the previous incubation was reused as inoculum. The results suggest that a simplified medium {{can be used as}} alternative to the conventional Menke medium, providing that the pH of the inoculum does not fall below 5. 5, and a high dose of microbial rumen fluid is used as inoculum. Moreover, the dose of rumen fluid used as inoculum of fermentation can be reduced without adverse effects on gas production. The residual <b>fluids</b> of fermentation <b>residues</b> can be re‐used as microbial inoculum at the condition that a complex medium (such as Menke) is used and the dose of microbial inoculum is reduced from conventional 30 ml to about 5 ml. The results also showed that the citrus pulp and tomato peels are characterized by high fermentability and their complete degradation requires the use of a medium dose higher than that 10 used in this research. Differently, the roughage is characterized by the ability to buffer the pH and stimulate rumen microbial activity, especially, when the pH of the medium falls below values of 6. For this reason, the combined incubation of by‐products and roughage increased the gas production compared to the single incubation of by‐products...|$|R
30|$|The <b>residue</b> <b>fluid</b> {{catalytic}} cracking unit (RFCCU) of Khartoum Refinery Company (KRC) uses {{conradson carbon residue}} and metal-contaminated feedstocks (such as atmospheric residue or mixtures of vacuum residue and gas oils) to produce more valuable products (especially gasoline) using active zeolite catalyst in a circulating fluidized bed [1]. In the RFCCU, the oil feed and dispersion steam enter the catalytic riser reactor together with the regenerated catalyst, where cracking of vacuum residue into lighter hydrocarbons starts as it contacts the hot regenerated catalyst from the regenerator. The regenerated catalyst is made to rise by steam introduced {{at the base of}} the riser reactor between the regenerator and the feed inlet point. The vaporized feed and the catalyst pass through the riser reactor into disengager for cracked products and catalyst separation. During the cracking process, coke is deposited on the catalyst, and the spent catalyst flows down by gravity into the regenerator, where air is used to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst in a combustion environment so that it is returned to a stable state for catalysing the cracking reaction. The hot regenerated catalyst is then re-injected into the base of the riser reactor [2]. The complexity of the typical FCCU feed makes it extremely difficult to characterize and describe the inherent kinetics at a molecular level. In this way, similar components are grouped into lumps. Therefore, lumping scheme has been used to study the reactions involved in the {{catalytic cracking}} of heavy oil. To give an insight into a comprehensive prediction of products’ distribution, there is an increasing number of lumps of the proposed models for catalytic cracking reactions [3]. In the first kinetic model of Weekman [4, 5] for catalytic cracking of heavy oil, three lumps were identified as gas oil (feedstock), gasoline, and light gas[*]+[*]coke as products, without incorporating diffusion characteristics of solid and gas phases. Lee et al. [6, 7] modified the three-lump model by splitting the light gas[*]+[*]coke lump into two different lumps of C 1 –C 4 gas and coke; therefore, resulting in the four-lump model for catalytic cracking of heavy oil. Corella and Frances [8] developed a five-lump model, in which the gas oil lump was divided into its heavy and light fractions. Different modified versions of five-lump model were developed by Dupain et al. [9], Kraemer et al. [10], and Ancheyta et al. [11]. Other proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil include: 6 -lump [1, 12, 13, 14, 15], 8 -lump [16], 10 -lump [17, 18], 11 -lump [19], 13 -lump [20], 14 -lump [21], and 19 -lump [22], without taking cognisance of diffusion resistance. A comprehensive review was presented by Pinheiro et al. [23] on the subject of fluid catalytic cracking process modelling, simulation, and control. Obviously, the number of lumps of the proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil may be increased to obtain more detailed descriptions of the catalytic cracking reactions and product distribution [24, 25]. However, sparing kinetic investigations have been carried out with the incorporation of diffusion resistances. Taking into account mass and heat transfer resistances between the reacting fluid and solid phases helps with conceiving the lump concentration on the catalyst surface as well as temperature profiles of the fluid and solid phases. Flinger et al. [26] considered mass transfer between the fluid and solid phases in the FCCU-riser reactor model equation. Gupta and Subba Rao [27] and Nayak et al. [28] applied the relationship for Sherwood number proposed by Ranz and Marshall [29] in their model to demonstrate the effects of mass transfer. The lump concentration within the catalyst is reduced by intraparticle mass transfer. In this way, the presence of an internal concentration gradient reduces the average rate of cracking [30]. Pruski et al. [31] validated adsorption coefficients for the four-lump model of catalytic cracking of gas oil. Bidabehere and Sedran [32] set up a model to investigate the impacts of diffusion, adsorption, and reaction at high temperature inside commercial FCC catalyst pellets and analysed the significance of these phenomenon. Dupain et al. [9] discussed external and internal mass transfer relationships utilised for FCC riser.|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Ruminants have a {{compound}} stomach system that {{enables them to}} utilize forages more efficiently than monogastric animals. However, forages alone do not contain sufficient nutrients to meet the requirements of high producing dairy cows. Forages are high in fibre and their nutrient availability depends on the degree of cell wall degradability. Improvements in forage fermentation would increase energy intake and subsequently milk production and performance by dairy cows. It is therefore important to find ways to improve forage degradation and utilization in the rumen. The use of different non-fibre carbohydrate (NFC) sources has different effects on animal performance. Supplementing forage based diets with energy sources containing sugar, starch or pectin results in variation in performance measurements such as milk yield, milk composition and dry matter intake (DMI). This thesis reports on two studies in which the effect of energy supplementation on forage fermentation and digestion parameters was investigated. In the first study an in vitro gas production protocol was used to determine the effect of sugar (molasses), starch (maize meal) and pectin (citrus pulp) on total gas production and rate of gas production of different forages. The forage substrates included wheat straw (WS), oat hay, (OH) lucerne hay (LUC), ryegrass (RYE) and kikuyu grass (KIK). The three energy sources, as well as a control (no energy source) were incubated in vitro with each of the above mentioned forages. Rumen fluid was collected from two lactating Holstein cows receiving a diet consisting of oat hay, lucerne, wheat straw and a concentrate mix. Forages alone (0. 25 g DM) and/or together (0. 125 g DM) with either molasses (0. 1412 g DM), citrus pulp (0. 1425 g DM) or maize meal (0. 125 g DM) were weighed into glass vials and incubated for 72 hours. The weights of the energy sources were calculated on an energy equivalent basis. Blank vials, that contained no substrates, were included to correct for gas production from rumen fluid alone. The substrates were incubated in 40 ml buffered medium, 2 ml of reducing solution and 10 ml rumen fluid. Gas pressure was recorded automatically every five minutes using a pressure transducer system and the method based on the Reading Pressure Technique (Mauricio et al., 1999). Gas pressure was converted to gas volume using a predetermined regression equation. In the first gas production trial, the gas production included gas produced by the energy sources, while in the second gas production trial, the energy source gas production was deducted from the total gas production to determine the effect of energy source on gas production of respective forage substrates per se. Data were fitted to two non-linear models adapted from Ørskov and McDonald (1979). Significant forage x energy interactions were observed for the non-linear parameter gas production (b) in Model 1 and for b and lag phase (L) in Model 2 in both trials. In the first gas production trial, the higher fermentability of the energy sources supplemented to forage substrates, increased b (Model 1 & 2) of the LUC and WS. The gas production rate was affected in different ways for different forages, with the most noticeable effect on WS when it was supplemented with energy sources. All the energy sources increased c of WS irrespective of the model used. Energy sources had no effect on the L of LUC, OH or RYE, but decreased the L of WS and KIK. In the second trial, maize meal had no effect on b for any of the forages (Model 1 & 2), while molasses (Model 1 & 2) decreased b for all forage substrates, and citrus pulp (Model 1 & 2) decreased b of OH and RYE, to lower values than those of the control treatments. Gas production rate was not affected by molasses for any of the forage substrates, while citrus pulp (Model 1 & 2) increased c of OH and maize meal increased c of OH and KIK. Lag phase was only affected by energy sources in WS and KIK, where all the energy sources had lower L values than the control treatment. It was concluded that forage fermentability is affected differently by different energy sources. These observations may have important implications, in practice, on rumen health and milk production, and the data obtained can potentially be used as guidelines in feed formulations. In the second study, in vitro digestibility trials were undertaken to determine the effect of sugar (molasses and sucrose), starch (maize meal and maize starch) and pectin (citrus pulp and citrus pectin) on neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and dry matter (DM) degradability of forages. Forage substrates used included wheat straw, oat hay, lucerne hay, ryegrass and kikuyu grass. Rumen fluid was collected from two lactating Holstein cows receiving a diet consisting of oat hay, wheat straw and a concentrate mix. In vitro degradability was done with an ANKOM Daisy II incubator and forage substrates were incubated with or without the respective energy sources for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The substrates were incubated in 1076 ml buffered medium, 54 ml of reducing solution and 270 ml rumen <b>fluid.</b> The <b>residues</b> were washed, dried and analyzed for NDF. In the study with the applied energy sources (molasses, maize meal and citrus pulp) there were a forage x energy source interactions. Supplementation with the applied energy sources all improved dry matter degradability (DMD) of forages (24 and 72 hours), when compared to the control treatment, except for RYE supplemented with maize meal and citrus pulp at 24 hours. Molasses seemed to have had the biggest effect on DMD in all forage substrates. Supplementation with maize meal had no effect on neutral detergent fibre degradability (NDFD) of any forage substrate, except for an improvement in NDFD of LUC at 72 hours. Molasses improved NDFD of LUC at 24 h, but had no effect on the other forage substrates. Citrus pulp improved NDFD of OH (72 hours), as well as LUC and WS (24 and 72 hours). It is postulated that the NDF of the energy sources was more digestible than that of the respective forages, and that the improved NDFD values could be ascribed to the contribution of the energy source NDFD. Overall, pasture grasses had a higher NDFD than the hays and straw, and appear to be more readily fermentable by rumen microbes than the low quality hays and straw explaining the higher NDFD. In the study involving the purified energy sources (sucrose, maize starch and citrus pectin), forage x energy source interactions were observed. In general, supplementation with these energy sources improved DMD at 24 and 72 hours except for RYE and KIK (72 hours). Pasture grasses (RYE and KIK) had a higher NDFD than LUC, OH and WS. At 72 hours, NDFD was 37. 1 % for LUC, 42. 5 % for OH and 40. 3 % for WS, compared to 70. 5 % for KIK and 64. 9 % for RYE. A possible explanation is that KIK and RYE samples came from freshly cut material, harvested after a 28 d re-growth period. In general, sucrose (24 and 72 hours) and citrus pectin (72 hours) had no effect on NDFD of forage substrates. However, supplementing oat hay (24 hours) with starch and citrus pectin, and wheat straw (24 and 72 hours) with starch lowered NDFD, when compared to the control treatment. It is hypothesized that microbes fermented the easily fermentable energy sources first, before attacking forage NDF. The study suggested that forage NDFD values are not fixed, and may be altered by type of energy supplementation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die meervoudige maagsisteem van herkouers stel hulle in staat om ruvoer meer effektief te benut as enkelmaagdiere. Ruvoere alleen bevat egter nie genoeg voedingstowwe om die behoeftes van hoogproduserende melkbeeste te bevredig nie. Ruvoere is ryk aan vesel en hul voedingstofbeskikbaarheid word bepaal deur die graad van selwand degradeerbaarheid. ‘n Verhoging in ruvoerfermentasie sal energieinname verhoog en gevolglik ook melkproduksie en prestasie. Dit is dus belangrik om maniere te vind om ruvoerdegradeerbaarheid en -verbruik in die rumen te verbeter. Die gebruik van verskillende nie-vesel koolhidraat (NFC) bronne het verskillende uitwerkings op die prestasie van diere. Energie-aanvullings soos suiker, stysel en pektien tot ruvoer-gebasseerde diëte, beïnvloed prestasiemaatstawwe soos melkproduksie, melksamestelling en droëmateriaalinname (DMI) op verskillende maniere. Hierdie tesis lewer verslag oor twee studies waar die invloed van energie-aanvullings op ruvoerfermentasie en verteringsmaatstawwe ondersoek is. In die eerste studie is ‘n in vitro gasproduksieprotokol gebruik om die invloed van suiker (melasse), stysel (mieliemeel) en pektien (sitruspulp) op totale gasproduksie (b) en tempo van gasproduksie (c) van verskillende ruvoersubstrate te bepaal. Ruvoersubstrate wat gebruik is, was koringstrooi (WS), hawerhooi (OH), lusernhooi (LUC), raaigras (RYE) en kikuyugras (KIK). Die drie energiebronne, sowel as ‘n kontrole (geen energiebron), is in vitro geïnkubeer saam met elk van die genoemde ruvoere. Rumenvloeistof is verkry van twee lakterende Holsteinkoeie, wat ‘n dieet ontvang het bestaande uit hawerhooi, koringstrooi en ‘n kragvoermengsel. Ruvoere is alleen en/of in kombinasie met melasse (0. 1412 g DM), sitruspulp (0. 1425 g DM) of mieliemeel (0. 125 g DM) in glasbottels afgeweeg en vir 72 uur geïnkubeer. Die massas van die energiebronne is op ‘n energie-ekwivalente basis bereken. Leë bottels wat geen substraat bevat het nie, is ingesluit om te korrigeer vir gasproduksie afkomstig vanaf rumenvloeistof alleen. Substrate is in 40 ml van ‘n buffermedium, 2 ml reduserende oplossing en 10 ml rumenvloeistof geïnkubeer. Gasdruk is elke vyf minute outomaties aangeteken deur gebruik te maak van ‘n drukmetersisteem en die metode is gebasseer op die Reading gasdruktegniek. Gasdruk is omgeskakel na gasvolume deur gebruik te maak van ‘n voorafbepaalde regressievergelyking. In die eerste proef het totale gasproduksie die gas wat deur die onderskeie energiebronne geproduseer is, ingesluit. In die tweede proef is gasproduksie afkomstig van die energiebronne afgetrek van totale gasproduksie, om sodoende die invloed van die energiebronne per se op die gasproduksie van die onderskeie ruvoersubstrate, te bepaal. Data is met behulp van twee nie-liniëre modelle gepas. Betekenisvolle ruvoer x energie-interaksies is in albei proewe waargeneem vir die nie-liniëre parameter b (gasproduksie) in Model 1, en vir b en L (sloerfase) in Model 2. In die eerste proef het die energiebronne se hoë fermentasie gelei to ‘n verhoging in b (Model 1 & 2) van LUC en WS. Energie-aanvullings het die c-waarde van die onderskeie ruvoere verskillend beïnvloed, met WS wat die mees opvallende effek gehad het. Al die energiebronne het die c-waarde van WS verhoog, ongeag watter model gebruik is. Energiebronne het geen invloed op die L-waarde van LUC, OH of RYE gehad nie, maar het wel die L-waarde van WS en KIK verlaag. In die tweede proef het mieliemeel geen invloed op die b-waarde van enige van die ruvoere gehad nie (Model 1 & 2), terwyl melasse (Model 1 & 2) die b-waarde van alle ruvoere verlaag het, en sitruspulp (Model 1 & 2) OH en RYE se b waardes verlaag het tot laer as die kontroles. Melasse het geen invloed op die c-waarde van die onderskeie ruvoersubstrate gehad nie, terwyl sitruspulp (Model 1 & 2) die c-waarde van OH, en mieliemeel die c-waarde van OH en KIK, verhoog het. Energiebronne het slegs ‘n invloed op die sloerfase in WS en KIK gehad, waar dit L verlaag het tot laer waardes as dié van die kontroles. Daar is gevind dat ruvoer-fermenteerbaarheid verskillend beïnvloed word deur verskillende energiebronne. Bogenoemde resultate kan in die praktyk betekenisvolle invloede hê op rumengesondheid en melkproduksie en die data wat verkry is, kan potensieël gebruik word as riglyne in voerformulerings. In die tweede studie is in vitro verteerbaarheidsproewe gedoen om die effek van suiker (molasse en sukrose), stysel (mieliemeel en mieliestysel) en pektien (sitruspulp en sitrus-pektien) op neutraalonoplosbare vesel (NDF) en droë materiaal (DM) degradeerbaarheid van ruvoere, te bepaal. Ruvoersubstrate wat gebruik is, was WS, OH, LUC, RYE en KIK. Rumen vloeistof is verkry van twee lakterende Holstein koeie, wat ‘n dieet ontvang het bestaande uit hawerhooi, koringstrooi en ‘n konsentraat mengsel. Die in vitro degradeerbaarheidsproef is gedoen met ‘n ANKOM Daisy II inkubator. Ruvoersubstrate is geïnkubeer met of sonder die onderskeie energiebronne vir 24, 48 en 72 uur. Die substrate is geïnkubeer in 1076 ml buffer medium, 54 ml reduserende oplossing en 270 ml rumen vloeistof. Residue is gewas, gedroog en geanaliseer vir NDF. In die proef met toegepaste energiebronne (molasse, mieliemeel en sitruspulp), was daar ruvoer x energiebron interaksies. Toegepaste energiebron aanvullings het almal DMD van ruvoersubstrate (24 en 72 uur) verbeter, uitsluitend vir RYE wat aangevul is met mieliemeel (24 uur) en sitruspulp (24 uur). Van al die ruvoersubstrate het molasse die grootste effek gehad op DMD. Mieliemeel aanvullings het geen effek gehad op neutraal-onoplosbare vesel degradeerbaarheid (NDFD) van ruvoersubstrate nie, behalwe vir ‘n verbetering in NDFD van LUC by 72 uur. Molasse het NDFD van lucern by 24 uur verbeter, maar geen effek gehad op ander ruvoersubstrate nie. Sitruspulp het NDFD van OH (72 uur), asook LUC en WS (24 & 72 uur) verbeter. Daar word beweer dat die NDF van energiebronne meer verteerbaar is as die van ruvoersubstrate, en dat die verbetering in NDFD waardes toegeskryf kan word aan die bydraes van energiebronne se NDFD. Weidingsgrasse (RYE & KIK) het oor die algemeen ‘n hoër NDFD as hooie en strooi gehad. Rumen mikrobes blyk ook om dié grasse vinniger te verteer as lae kwaliteit hooie en strooi, wat gevolglik die hoër NDFD verduidelik. In die proef met suiwer energiebronne (sukrose, mieliestysel en sitrus-pektien) is ruvoer x energiebron interaksies waargeneem. Energiebronaanvullings het DMD by 24 en 72 uur verbeter, buiten vir RYE en KIK (72 uur). Weidingsgrasse het hoër NDFD as LUC, OH en WS. By 72 uur was die NDFD van LUC 37. 1 %, OH 42. 5 %, WS 40. 3 %, in vergelyking met 70. 5 % vir KIK en 64. 9 % vir RYE. ‘n Moontlike verklaring vir die hoër NDFD van KIK en RYE, is omdat dit vars gesnyde material is, geoes na slegs 28 dae hergroei. Oor die algemeen het sukrose (24 & 72 uur) en sitrus-pektien (72 uur) geen effek gehad op NDFD van ruvoersubstrate nie, terwyl stysel en pektien aanvullings tot OH (24 uur), en stysel aanvullings tot WS (24 & 72 uur) NDFD verlaag het. Daar word hipotetieseer dat mikrobes eers die vinnig fermenteerbare energiebronne fermenteer, voordat hulle ruvoer NDF aanval. Hierdie studie beweer dat ruvoer NDFD waardes nie vas is nie, en dat dié waardes beïnvloed mag word deur energiebron aanvullings...|$|R
