40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a <b>double-helical</b> <b>gear</b> system supported by journal bearings is theoretically and experimentally investigated in this study. A bending–torsional–axial coupling model for dynamic analysis of <b>double-helical</b> <b>gear</b> system is developed. Influence of the time-varying mesh stiffness and damping is considered. Oil film stiffness and damping of the supporting journal bearing {{are supposed to}} be time-varying, and the time-varying oil film stiffness and damping are predicted by a back propagation neural network, which is optimized by genetic algorithm. A double-helical gear–rotor–journal bearing system test rig is also established to carry out the experimental investigations, such as the dynamic transmission errors of gear pairs. The comparisons between theoretical and experimental results show that the time-varying oil film dynamic coefficients of journal bearings are an important internal excitation. The theoretical model with time-varying oil film stiffness and damping can predict the gear dynamics more accurate than the model with time-invariant oil film stiffness and damping, and the neural network optimized by genetic algorithm can obtain the time-varying oil film stiffness and damping efficiently and accurately for the dynamic analysis of <b>double-helical</b> <b>gear</b> system...|$|E
40|$|In {{the dynamic}} {{study of the}} <b>double-helical</b> <b>gear</b> transmission, the {{coupling}} shaft {{in the middle of}} the two helical gears is difficult to be handled accurately. In this article, the coupling shaft is treated as the Timoshenko beam elements and is synthesized with the lumped-mass method of the two helical gear pairs. Then, the numerical integration method is used to solve the amplitude–frequency responses and dynamic factors under diverse operating conditions. A gear vibration test rig of closed power circuit is developed for in-depth experimental measurements and model validation. After comparing the theoretical data with the practical results, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) the dynamic model with the Timoshenko beam element is quite appropriate and reliable in the dynamic analysis of <b>double-helical</b> <b>gear</b> transmission and is of great theoretical value in the accurate dynamic research of the <b>double-helical</b> <b>gear</b> transmission. (2) In both theoretical analysis and experimental measurements, the dynamic factors of gear pair diminish with the increase in the input torque and augment with the increase in the input speed. (3) The deviation ratio of the theoretical data and the experimental results decrease with the increase in the input torque, reaching the minimum at the highest input speed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} mostly aimed at {{analyzing}} optimum profile modifications (PMs) in planetarygears (PGTs) {{with regard to}} dynamic mesh forces. To this end, a dynamic model is presentedbased on 3 D two-node gear elements connected to deformable ring-gears discretized into beam elements. <b>Double-helical</b> <b>gears</b> are simulated as two gear elements of opposite hands which are linked by shaft elements. Symmetric tip relief on external and internal gear meshes are introduced as time-varying normal deviations {{along the lines of}} contact and time-varying mesh stiffness functions are deduced from Wrinckler foundation models. The equations of motion are solved by coupling a Newmark time-step integration scheme and a contact algo-rithm to account for possible partial or total contact losses. Symmetric linear PMs for helical and double-helical PGTs are optimized by using a genetic algorithm with the objective of minimizing dynamic tooth loads over a speed range. Finally, the sensitivity of these optimum PMs to speed and load is analyzed...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} now {{supported}} at just three not four points using special rubber insulation to control noise and vibration. Rover's—as it was promoted— Easy-free gear change {{was a new}} 4-speed gearbox with constant mesh <b>double-helical</b> <b>gears</b> for 2nd and 3rd and a freewheel device with its control beside the driver. A further convenience was an optional extra power-controlled or automatic clutch. A Startix automatic engine starter was fitted. Startix was activated when the ignition was switched on and, in addition, operated automatically if the engine stalled. The new change-speed system meant gears might be changed after a slight easing of the accelerator without using the clutch yet making no noise. A knob on the instrument panel switched of the freewheel and returned the gearbox to orthodox. The half-elliptic spring on both axles are controlled by hydraulic shock-absorbers. The freewheel was to remain a feature of Rovers for more than 20 years.|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} modal {{properties of}} <b>double-helical</b> planetary <b>gear</b> (DHPG) system with three-dimensional motion are investigated {{with a combined}} use of numerical and analytical approach in this paper. The lumped-parameter model of the DHPG consider-ing stiffness coupled between the left gear and the right gear is developed. Load-sharing with journal bearings is accepted in this planetary gear system, so that four stiffness coef-ficients {{can be applied to}} describe the dynamic behavior between the planet gear and the carrier. The model has three planar degrees of freedom for the carrier and an added axial degree of freedom for all gears, considering the effect of axial dynamic forces. The vibration equations are obtained according to Lagrange equation. A modal type distribu-tion map is plotted initially to simplify modal classification. With the application of this modal type distribution map, all vibration modes are categorized distinctly into three essentially different types of modes including planet mode (PM), rotational-axial mode (RAM), and planer-translational mode (PTM). Unique characteristics of these vibration modes, such as, eigenvalue number, multiplicity of natural frequencies and deflection relations, are deduced and proved analytically. For each type of vibration modes, the reduced-order eigenvalue problems are derived. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028788...|$|R
