40|$|The {{usability}} {{analysis of}} information systems has {{been the target of}} several research studies over the past thirty years. These studies have highlighted a great diversity of points of view, including researchers from different scientific areas such as Ergonomics, Computer Science, Design and Education. Within the domain of <b>information</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> the study of tools and methods used for usability evaluation dedicated to E-learning presents evidence that there is a continuous and dynamic evolution of E-learning systems, in many different contexts -academics and corporative. These systems, also known as LMS (Learning Management Systems), can be classified according to their educational goals and their technological features. However, in these systems the usability issues are related with the relationship/interactions between user and system in the user's context. This review is a synthesis of research project about <b>Information</b> <b>Ergonomics</b> and embraces three dimensions, namely the methods, models and frameworks that have been applied to evaluate LMS. The study also includes the main usability criteria and heuristics used. The obtained results show a notorious change in the paradigms of usability, with which {{it will be possible to}} discuss about the studies carried out by different researchers that were focused on usability ergonomic principles aimed at E-learning...|$|E

Six examples from the author's career in which technology got too far ahead of ergonomics are described, necessitating the ergonomist to run behind. There were, and are, a number of causes for this lag. The engineer's and designer's overrating of the user's capacities in system operation is one of them.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Increasingly {{industrial}} designers {{are required to}} engage in the design of computer-embedded products. Due to the interactive nature of these products, efficient prototyping is becoming more critical in the design process. This paper presents a designer-oriented prototype development method that facilitates the construction of fully functional physical prototypes. Unlike the multi-media authoring tools commonly used to date, this method employs a cheap and widely available software application: Microsoft PowerPoint with embedded Visual Basic. The method has been designed for use by programming non-literate designers and allows interactive physical prototypes to be created and tested without extensive specialist knowledge. This was achieved in part by simple modifications to a standard computer keyboard. Our case study on the use of this method in the teaching of <b>information</b> <b>ergonomics</b> demonstrated that students could effectively produce software-hardware hybrid prototypes with minimum effort in a short time scale. This method offers an excellent means of collaboration between designers and professionals from different domains. The prototyping method enables rapid and iterative design cycles in design education, research and practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{variety and}} {{increasing}} availability of hypermedia information systems, {{which are used}} in stationary applications like operators’ consoles as well as mobile systems, e. g. driver information and navigation systems in automobiles form a foundation for the mediatization of the society. From the human engineering point of view this development and the ensuing increased importance of information systems for economic and private needs require careful deliberation of the derivation and application of ergonomics methods particularly {{in the field of}} information systems. This book consists of two closely intertwined parts. The first, theoretical part defines the concept of an information system, followed by an explanation of action regulation as well as cognitive theories to describe man information system interaction. A comprehensive description of <b>information</b> <b>ergonomics</b> concludes the theoretical approach. In the second, practically oriented part of this book authors from industry as well as from academic institutes illustrate the variety of current information systems taken from different fields of transportation, i. e. aviation, automotive, and railroad.

40|$|Due to the borderless {{communications}} in the Information world today, {{a shift of}} focus is seen occurring from "product-as-object" approach towards the notion of "product-as-event" where dynamic functionality and behavioral qualities of the new products are increasingly important. Because of the interactive nature of these products, the trend has enhanced the importance of <b>Information</b> <b>Ergonomics</b> in general and Interaction Design in particular. However, the education of computer professionals often concentrates on the understanding of computational mechanisms, and on engineering methods {{to ensure that the}} mechanisms behave according to the intention of the programmer. This research looks at the current product design issues involving the single-sided focus on the design of interactive products and highlights the importance of Industrial Design. As a conceptual framework, this research study includes reviews on previous research relevant to the scope of 'design' in relation to Industrial Design, which involve the design process, design drawings and design methods. A case study, involving qualitative and quantitative method was used in this research. A classroom of Industrial Design students doing Applied Industrial Design subject at Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, was taken as the study in understanding the thinking process involved in delivering content for interactive products. Seven students were selected for the study and their design documents such as; sketches, drawings diagrams and reports were analyzed using three stages of analyses. Various Interaction Design concern were discussed and {{towards the end of the}} study a design method was proposed. This research documented a specific type of project for the design of 'Cleaning Appliances' where design intention and creative ability of the students in delivering Interaction Design content and method was sought. Although without proper guidelines from the Interaction Design discipline, the students showed the ability in delivering basic interactive product design concepts using the Industrial Design knowledge. This research study contributes to the knowledge of design disciplinary areas in both Human Computer Interaction and Industrial Design, which highlights the important role of Industrial Design students in delivering Interaction Design content and methods. 11 COPYRIGH...|$|E
40|$|Forklift trucks {{represent}} a well-known occupational hazard in many modern industrial environments. In terms of severe work-related injuries and fatalities, exposure to forklift trucks in the transport industry, in wholesale and retail and in manufacturing implies high risks to operators, pedestrian workers {{and others in}} the environment. Creating industrial environments where vehicle, pedestrian and material movements can flow productively without hazardous conflicts requires logistics and safety analyses as a basis for the design and layout of facilities. Monash University Accident Research Centre, funded by Worksafe Victoria (the local workers’ compensation insurer and industrial safety regulator), has coordinated a development project with the following components: · the development and testing of a paradigm for dynamic stability assessment of industrial forklift trucks; · the formation of a local team of experts in forklift safety, transport, logistics, and industrial architecture/design to develop, through a series of workshops, the details of safe forklift transport systems operationalized into "blueprint" format for a freight terminal and a warehouse, including relevant goods receiving and dispatch  areas; · a warehouse management software application, incorporating features for conflict prognosis and necessary parameters for the managing of a distribution centre; The project has also analysed existing alert, proximity warning and navigational systems, including systems based on ultraviolet, microwave and laser technology, together with several applications of speed limiting technology, and developed and tested a prototype RF-tag and on-vehicle receiver unit to assess costs and feasibility of using radio frequency technology to identify pedestrians in forklift truck zones. Testing of different combinations of electronic control devices for on-vehicle or other traffic management applications for industrial forklift trucks is undertaken at a number of industrial "testbed" locations. The blueprint designs will be used in a planned subsidy program targeting existing and prospective medium-size transport terminal operators in Victoria, where Worksafe Victoria covers the cost of expert assistance in translating the blueprint to the specific requirements of an operator willing to use the design as the basis for their new or upgraded facility. The development project aims to report its findings {{in the form of a}} ”Safe Forklift Management Manual”, the main focus of which is the safe management of the forklift transport system, with basic parameters such as rational logistics, good <b>information</b> <b>ergonomics,</b> optimal traffic separation and management, speed and proximity control, well-structured operational environments, good systems management and preferred secondary vehicle safety features.

A model postulating that process quality predicts product quality was proposed. In this study, the banking industry is the domain of interest. Two different large banks were selected, with five branches among them. First, service quality questionnaires were sent to 800 customers; the overall response rate was 468 / 800 = 59 %. A non-difference score of SERVQUAL {{was used to assess}} the dimensions of service quality. Second, information quality questionnaires (Wang and Strong) and ergonomics questionnaires were sent to 278 employees of the banks; the overall response rate was 236 / 278 = 84 %. Both instruments were used to assess the underlying dimensions of <b>information</b> quality and <b>ergonomics.</b> ^ The result of the service quality analysis showed that reliability and responsiveness are the two most critical dimensions of service quality and they are directly related to the overall service quality. ^ The result of the information quality analysis showed that all of the information quality dimensions except accessibility were significantly different between banks, but they were the same for branches within each bank. Reputation, believability, value-added, and relevancy had the highest score; completeness, access, and security had the lowest score for all the banks. In addition the result showed that accuracy and amount of information were related to overall service quality. Objectivity, timeliness, and believability were also related to the dimensions of service quality. ^ The results of ergonomics analysis showed that all of the dimensions of ergonomics (workstation, overall comfort, other, and environment) had a positive impact on overall service quality. ...|$|R

40|$|Sociotechnical {{approach}} is {{commonly known as}} one of the most important research streams in organizational literature due to its contribution to theoretical development as well as to action-research methods. This paper depicts the history of STS approach from its origins, traceable in founding works of researchers at Tavistock Institute in 1946, to our days. It aims highlighting the different kinds of STS studies and explaining the main changes in their conceptual basis and in methods of analysis. The paper argues that STS {{approach is}} a theory in evolution from the beginning due to the need to address new research issues. Between the 1970 s and the 1980 s STS knows its greatest expansion since it is applied by academic researchers working on both side of Atlantic for studying old and new fields of inquiry (manufacturing and intellectual work, complex system, <b>information</b> system, <b>ergonomics,</b> knowledge management). In the 1990 s STS approach looses ground to emerging managerial practices like BPR, TQM, lean production. This has caused someone to talk of “decline” of the STS approach.
