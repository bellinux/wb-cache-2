5|$|Judges of the Subordinate Courts do {{not enjoy}} the {{security}} of tenure enjoyed by the Supreme Court judges. As officers of the Singapore Legal Service, {{it is said that}} there is a risk of executive interference because judges may be removed from their judicial positions or transferred to lower-ranking positions elsewhere within the Legal Service by the Legal Service Commission (LSC). In 1984, the Senior District Judge Michael Khoo acquitted Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaratnam of all but one minor charge in a case involving cheques for the Workers' Party of Singapore which had allegedly been fraudulently handled. The acquittal was overturned on appeal to the High Court, and a retrial ordered. However, before the retrial took place, Khoo was transferred from his position on the Bench to the Attorney-General's Chambers to take up the post of <b>deputy</b> <b>public</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> This was considered to be a demotion. In 1986, Jeyaratnam claimed in Parliament that the transfer had been made because Khoo had ruled in his favour in the 1984 case. However, a commission of inquiry formed to look into the circumstances surrounding the transfer found no evidence of this. For making the allegation, Jeyaratnam was referred to Parliament's Committee of Privileges for abusing parliamentary privilege. While the Committee was considering the matter, Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the Committee's proceedings and sent them to residents of his constituency. On 9 October 1986, the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters' contents to the Speaker of Parliament, which the Committee also considered. On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters. Fines totalling S$26,000 were imposed.|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the nature of}} cyber attacks (meaning attacks on computer systems and the disruption of national security and order through online seditious and defamatory statements) and the appropriate countermeasures under the law of Malaysia and international law are undertaken in this project. This study explores the emergence of cyber attacks as a serious threat to security and a challenge to current legal norms. As such, it uses ontologies to encapsulate and analyse the existence and reality of the cyber attacks phenomenon. It provides an open-ended concept and categories of cyber attacks especially for countermeasures and criminalisation purposes. This study posits that criminal law is a necessary reaction in dealing with cyber attacks in Malaysia on the basis of effectiveness and fairness alongside other non-criminal law measures. In doing so, it identifies non-criminal and criminal law approaches in countering cyber attacks. Apart from the position in Malaysia, this study investigates the emergence of international norms in relation to cyber attacks. It examines the effectiveness and fairness of the international law in dealing with cyber-attacks. This study focuses on several approaches to draw out analysis of the effectiveness and fairness of the measures to counter cyber attacks. Besides doctrinal analysis and policy transfer, semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 32 participants in Malaysia including policymakers, law enforcement officers, <b>deputy</b> <b>public</b> <b>prosecutors,</b> legal practitioners and experts in cyber security from the public and private sectors. The results show that there are different variations in the perception of cyber attacks at the national and international level. In that socio-political culture of Malaysia influences the understanding of cyber attacks and countermeasures. ...|$|R

2500|$|District {{judges and}} magistrates of the State Courts are {{appointed}} to their positions by the Legal Service Commission (LSC) on a term basis, {{and do not}} enjoy security of tenure. These judges can be transferred by the LSC from the courts to other government departments to serve as legal officers, and [...] This {{may be said to}} create a risk of executive interference. The transfer of Senior District Judge Michael Khoo is often cited as an illustration of this. Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam and a co-accused had each been charged with three charges of having fraudulently transferred cheques to prevent the distribution of money to the creditors of the Workers' Party of Singapore, and one charge of making a false declaration. In January 1981, Khoo acquitted the defendants of all charges except a single charge of fraud involving a cheque for S$400. He sentenced Jeyaretnam to a $1,000 fine, which was below the amount of $2,000 that would have caused him to lose his seat in Parliament. Upon the Public Prosecutor's appeal to the High Court, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin ordered retrials on the two charges of cheque fraud that the defendants had been acquitted of. In August 1981, before the retrials, Khoo was transferred to the Attorney General's Chambers to take up appointment as a <b>deputy</b> <b>public</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> The defendants were convicted of the charges by a different senior district judge and sentenced to three months' imprisonment each. Jeyaretnam and his co-accused then appealed to the High Court, which confirmed their convictions but reduced the sentences to a fine of $5,000 each. However, a commission of inquiry convened in 1986 to examine Khoo's transfer determined that no evidence of executive interference in the State Courts had been presented, and that the transfer had been decided by the Chief Justice in consultation with the Attorney-General. It did not investigate why the transfer was made. In Parliamentary debates before and after the inquiry it was suggested on the one hand that the transfer had been routine and the timing coincidental, and on the other that it was related to Khoo's competence in handling the case. The reason for the transfer was never clearly established.|$|E
