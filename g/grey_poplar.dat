Their vast plain is now, in summer, one sea of golden corn; in winter, a black dreary fallow, cut into squares by stagnant dykes, and broken only by unsightly pumping mills and doleful lines of poplar-trees. Of old it was a labyrinth of black wandering streams; broad lagoons; morasses submerged every spring-tide; vast beds of reed and sedge and fern; vast copses of willow, alder, and <b>grey</b> <b>poplar,</b> rooted in the floating peat, which was swallowing up slowly, all-devouring, yet all-preserving, the forests of fir and oak, ash and poplar, hazel and yew, which had once grown on that low, rank soil, sinking slowly (so geologists assure us) beneath the sea from age to age. Trees, torn down by flood and storm, floated and lodged in rafts, damming the waters back upon the land. Streams, bewildered in the flats, changed their channels, mingling silt and sand with the peat moss. Nature, left to herself, ran into wild riot and chaos more and more, till the whole fen became one [...] "Dismal Swamp," [...] in which, at the time of the Norman Conquest, the [...] "Last of the English," [...] like Dred in Mrs. Stowe's tale, took refuge from their tyrants, and lived, like him, a free and joyous life awhile.|$|E

The main objective of this research was to identify which species in the Kejimkujik National Park region experts believe could be most sensitive to climate change. The climate change scenario utilized was for an average of 2 °C warming and generally drier conditions. This thesis also provides some preliminary discussion of management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on populations of these species and on natural communities generally. The thesis explores species sensitivity to climate change through an expert opinion survey. Opinions were gathered on which species might be sensitive (positively or negatively) to climate change. Suggestions for potential indicator species for monitoring ecosystem responses to climate change, and potential management strategies for mitigating the negative effects of climate change, were also collected. The general trend suggested by the experts is that climate change will influence the populations of most species. Red maple, <b>poplar,</b> <b>grey</b> squirrel and the brown headed cowbird were all species identified as having the potential to increase their populations under a warming scenario.

40|$|Transcript {{levels of}} mRNA from 1 -deoxy-d-xylulose 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (PcDXR), {{isoprene}} synthase (PcISPS), and phytoene synthase (PcPSY) showed strong seasonal variations in leaves of <b>Grey</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus × canescens [Aiton] Sm.). These changes were {{dependent on the}} developmental stage and were strongly correlated to temperature and light. The expression rates of the genes PcDXR and PcISPS {{were found to be}} significantly correlated to each other, whereas the expression of the PcPSY gene showed a different seasonal pattern. Protein concentration and enzyme activity of PcISPS showed distinct seasonal patterns peaking in late summer, whereas highest transcription levels of PcISPS were observed in early summer. Moreover, correlation between PcISPS protein concentration and enzyme activity changed, in particular in autumn, when PcISPS protein levels remained high while enzyme activity declined, indicating posttranslational modifications of the enzyme. The positive correlation between dimethylallyl diphosphate levels and PcISPS protein content was found to be consistent with the demonstrated synchronized regulation of PcDXR and PcISPS, suggesting that metabolic flux through the 1 -deoxy-d-xylulose 5 -phosphate pathway and isoprene emission capacity are closely intercoordinated. Transcript levels of PcISPS showed strong diurnal variation with maximal values before midday in contrast to PcDXR, whose gene expression exhibited no clear intraday changes. During the course of a day, in vitro PcISPS activities did not change, whereas leaf dimethylallyl diphosphate levels and isoprene emission showed strong diurnal variations depending on actual temperature and light profiles on the respective day. These results illustrate that the regulation of isoprene biosynthesis in <b>Grey</b> <b>poplar</b> leaves seems to happen on transcriptional, posttranslational, and metabolic levels and is highly variable with respect to seasonal and diurnal changes in relation to temperature and light...|$|E

40|$|White poplar (Populus alba L.) and {{its natural}} hybrid, <b>grey</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus x canescens) are native stand-forming tree species in Hungary, {{covering}} 3. 4 per {{cent of the}} forested area (64 000 ha).

One of the most important tasks ahead of Hungarian poplar growers is to improve the quality of poplar stands and plantations for wood production based on selecting relatively drought-tolerant clones and cultivars. In the paper the juvenile growth and the morphological characteristics of four micropropagated white poplar clones have been evaluated on a marginal site in central Hungary.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the prompt release of acetaldehyde and other oxygenated {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from leaves of <b>Grey</b> <b>poplar</b> [Populus x canescens (Aiton) Smith] following light-dark transitions. Mass scans utilizing the extremely fast and sensitive proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry technique revealed the following temporal pattern after light-dark transitions: hexenal was emitted first, followed by acetaldehyde and other C 6 -VOCs. Under anoxic conditions, acetaldehyde was the only compound released after switching off the light. This clearly indicated that hexenal and other C 6 -VOCs were released from the lipoxygenase reaction taking place during light-dark transitions under aerobic conditions. Experiments with enzyme inhibitors that artificially increased cytosolic pyruvate demonstrated that the acetaldehyde burst after light-dark transition could not {{be explained by the}} recently suggested pyruvate overflow mechanism. The simulation of light fleck situations in the canopy by exposing leaves to alternating light-dark and dark-light transitions or fast changes from high to low photosynthetic photon flux density showed that this process is of minor importance for acetaldehyde emission into the Earth's atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The leaf cuticular {{ultrastructure}} of some {{plant species}} has been examined by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) in only few studies. Attending to the different cuticle layers and inner structure, plant cuticles have been grouped into six general morphological types. With the aim of critically examining the effect of cuticle isolation and preparation for TEM analysis on cuticular ultrastructure, adaxial leaf cuticles of blue-gum eucalypt, <b>grey</b> <b>poplar,</b> and European pear were assessed, following a membrane science approach. The embedding and staining protocols affected the ultrastructure of the cuticles analysed. The solubility parameter, surface tension, and contact angles with water of pure Spurr's and LR-White resins were within a similar range. Differences were however estimated for resin[*]:[*]solvent mixtures, since Spurr’s resin is combined with acetone and LR-White resin is mixed with ethanol. Given the composite hydrophilic and lipophilic nature of plant cuticles, the particular TEM tissue embedding and staining procedures employed may affect sample ultrastructure and {{the interpretation of the}} results in physicochemical and biological terms.

40|$|In plants, {{isoprene}} plays a dual role: (a) as thermo-protective agent {{proposed to}} prevent degradation of enzymes/membrane structures involved in photosynthesis, and (b) as reactive molecule reducing abiotic oxidative stress. The present work addresses {{the question whether}} suppression of isoprene emission interferes with genome wide transcription rates and metabolite fluxes in <b>grey</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populusxcanescens) throughout the growing season. Gene expression and metabolite profiles of isoprene emitting wild type plants and RNAi-mediated non-isoprene emitting poplars were compared by using poplar Affymetrix microarrays and non-targeted FT-ICR-MS (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry). We observed a transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes of phenylpropanoid regulatory and biosynthetic pathways, as well as distinct metabolic down-regulation of condensed tannins and anthocyanins, in non-isoprene emitting genotypes during July, when high temperature and light intensities possibly caused transient drought stress, as indicated by stomatal closure. Under these conditions leaves of non-isoprene emitting plants accumulated hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), a signaling molecule in stress response and negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. The absence of isoprene emission under high temperature and light stress resulted transiently in a new chemo(pheno) type with suppressed production of phenolic compounds. This may compromise inducible defenses and may render non-isoprene emitting poplars more susceptible to environmental stress...|$|E
40|$|Isoprene (2 -methyl- 1, 3 -butadiene) {{emission}} varies diurnally {{in different}} species. In poplar (Populus spp.), it {{has recently been}} shown that the gene encoding the synthesizing enzyme for isoprene, isoprene synthase (ISPS), displays diurnal variation in expression. Working on shoot cultures of <b>Grey</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus × canescens) placed under a different light regime in phytochambers, we showed that these variations in PcISPS gene expression, measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, are not only due to day-night changes, but also are linked to an internal circadian clock. Measurement of additional selected isoprenoid genes revealed that phytoene synthase (carotenoid pathway) displays similar fluctuations, whereas 1 -deoxy-d-xylulose 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase, possibly the first committed enzyme of the 1 -deoxy-d-xylulose 5 -phosphate pathway, only shows light regulation. On the protein level, it appeared that PcISPS activity and protein content became reduced under constant darkness, whereas under constant light, activity and protein content of this enzyme were kept high. In contrast, isoprene emission rates under continuous irradiation displayed circadian changes {{as is the case}} for gene expression of PcISPS. Furthermore, binding assays with Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) late elongated hypocotyl, a transcription factor of Arabidopsis involved in circadian regulation, clearly revealed the presence of circadian-determining regulatory elements in the promoter region of PcISPS...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} hemiterpene isoprene is {{emitted from}} plants and can affect atmospheric chemistry. Although recent {{studies indicate that}} isoprene can enhance thermotolerance or quench oxidative stress, the underlying physiological mechanisms are largely unknown. In this work, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), a natural nonemitter of isoprene and the model plant for functional plant analyses, has been constitutively transformed with the isoprene synthase gene (PcISPS) from <b>Grey</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus x canescens). Overexpression of poplar ISPS in Arabidopsis resulted in isoprene-emitting rosettes that showed transiently enhanced growth rates compared to the wild type under moderate thermal stress. The findings that highest growth rates, higher dimethylallyl diphosphate levels, and enzyme activity were detected in young plants during their vegetative growth phase indicate that enhanced growth of transgenic plants under moderate thermal stress is due to introduced PcISPS. Dynamic gas-exchange studies applying transient cycles of heat stress to the wild type demonstrate clearly that the prime physiological role of isoprene formation in Arabidopsis is not to protect net assimilation from damage against thermal stress, but may instead be to retain the growth potential or coordinated vegetative development of the plant. Hence, this study demonstrates the enormous potential but also the pitfalls of transgenic Arabidopsis (or other nonnatural isoprenoid emitters) in studying isoprene biosynthesis and its biological function(s) ...|$|E

We recorded that non-isoprene emitting poplars were more resistant to ozone as indicated by less damaged leaf area and higher assimilation rates compared to ozone-exposed wild-type (WT) plants. The integral of green leaf volatile emissions was different between the two poplar phenotypes and was a reliable early marker for subsequent leaf damage. For other stress-induced volatiles, such as mono-, homo- and sesquiterpenes and methyl salicylate, similar time profiles, pattern and emission intensities were observed in both transgenic and WT plants. However, unstressed non-isoprene emitting poplars are characterized by elevated levels of ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol as well as by a more effective de-epoxidation ratio of xanthophylls than the WT. Since ozone quenching properties of ascorbate are much higher than those of isoprene and furthermore alpha-tocopherol is also an essential antioxidant, non-isoprene emitting poplars might benefit from changes within the antioxidative system by providing them with enhanced ozone tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Globally {{plants are}} the primary sink of {{atmospheric}} CO 2, but are also the major contributor of a large spectrum of atmospheric reactive hydrocarbons such as terpenes (e. g. isoprene) and other biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC). The prediction of plant carbon (C) uptake and atmospheric oxidation capacity are crucial to define the trajectory and consequences of global environmental changes. To achieve this, the biosynthesis of BVOC and the dynamics of C allocation and translocation in both plants and ecosystems are important. Methodology: We combined tunable diode laser absorption spectrometry (TDLAS) and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for studying isoprene biosynthesis and following C fluxes within <b>grey</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus x canescens) saplings.

40|$|Background and purpose: White poplar (Populus alba L.) and {{its most}} {{important}} natural hybrid, the <b>grey</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus x canescens SM.) are native tree species in Hungary, covering 3. 2 % of the forested area. Thanks to their favourite silvicultural and growth characteristics {{as well as the}} wood utilization possibilities, their present area is increasing continuously. The most important task ahead of Hungarian poplar growers is to improve the quality and to increase the quantity of poplar stands for wood production. To determine their growth rate and yield as exactly as possible, a yield table has been constructed which is based on the currently applied silvicultural practice. Material and methods: Chapman – Richards function with three parameters was successfully used as a growth function for constructing the height growth model. The white poplar yield table was constructed from data gathered on 50 permanent and 40 temporary plots (cca. 500 - 1000 m 2). The age of the stands varied between 5 and 45 years. In the course of the stand surveys the key stand characteristics were measured, and then, on the basis of data collected, were calculated such major stand structure features as the average height, diameter (DBH), volume, basal area and stem number given separately for the main (remaining), secondary (removal) and total stands per hectare. Results and conclusion: The numerical (tabulated) yield table of normative nature presents data given to six yield classes (base age: 25 years) including the most important stand structural and yield features expressing in terms of main stand, removing stand (which can be removed in tending operations) and the total stand.

40|$|Stress-induced {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) emissions from transgenic <b>Grey</b> <b>poplar</b> modified in isoprene emission potential {{were used for the}} investigation of photochemical secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. In poplar, acute ozone stress induces the emission of a wide array of VOCs dominated by sesquiterpenes and aromatic VOCs. Constitutive light-dependent emission of isoprene ranged between 66 nmol m− 2 s− 1 in non-transgenic controls (wild type WT) and nearly zero (− 2 s− 1 ) in isoprene emission-repressed plants (line RA 22), respectively. Nucleation rates of up to 3600 cm− 3 s− 1 were observed in our experiments. In the presence of isoprene new particle formation was suppressed compared to non-isoprene containing VOC mixtures. Compared to isoprene/monoterpene systems emitted from other plants the suppression of nucleation by isoprene was less effective for the VOC mixture emitted from stressed poplar. This is explained by the observed high efficiency of new particle formation for emissions from stressed poplar. Direct measurements of OH in the reaction chamber revealed that the steady state concentration of OH is lower in the presence of isoprene than in the absence of isoprene, supporting the hypothesis that isoprenes' suppressing effect on nucleation is related to radical chemistry. In order to test whether isoprene contributes to SOA mass formation, fully deuterated isoprene (C 5 D 8 ) was added to the stress-induced emission profile of an isoprene free poplar mutant. Mass spectral analysis showed that, despite the isoprene-induced suppression of particle formation, fractions of deuterated isoprene were incorporated into the SOA. A fractional mass yield of 2. 3 % of isoprene was observed. Future emission changes due to land use and climate change may therefore affect both gas phase oxidation capacity and new particle number formation...|$|E

40|$|The {{most recent}} National Forest Inventory (Th Institute of Forest Ecosystems, National Forest Inventory) subdivides the areas not devoted to short {{rotation}} coppice (SRC) as follows: Aspen 81, 000 ha, black poplar & hybrid varieties 38, 500 ha, <b>grey</b> <b>poplar</b> 5, 500 ha, white poplar 2, 600 ha, balsam poplar 19, 200 ha, in total 147, 000 ha. During the period under review, the area cultivated by poplars and willows as SRC has hardly extended. Several factors are responsible for this: attractive alternative crops, in particular maize production for biogas, combined with the far-reaching ban on converting grassland {{and a lack of}} incentives from the Regulation on Greening decided at EU level in 2014. With regard to the cultivation of poplars and willows greening stipulates that their cultivation as SRC or agro-forestry-system may be counted as ecological focus area, yet only with a factor of 0. 3. The total SRC surface in Germany has hence only increased to some 7, 000 hectares and is currently almost stagnating. The woody biomass of approx. 50, 000 t that is annually produced in SRCs is insignificant as compared to the quantities of fuel wood used in private households of 34 million m 3 and the imported wood pellets, which amount to several million tonnes. Efforts have been continued to preserve the remaining pure black poplar occurrences, consisting mostly of relict stands with over-mature trees through in situ and ex situ measures and to approve black poplar stands for harvesting reproductive material for conservation purposes in accordance with the Act on Forest Reproductive Material (Forstvermehrungsgutgesetz - FoVG). Using molecular-genetic methods the species purity of the reproductive material is safeguarded. For 11 of the 14 poplar species, species-specific SNPs/InDels in the chloroplast genome and for identification of poplar cultivars sets of genetic markers have also been developed. For the identification of cultivars of the Section Populus 24 nuclear SSRs and for the identification of willow cultivars 12 nuclear SSRs were established, which are developed further continually. These markers also facilitate the unequivocal identification of multiple hybrid varieties and the resolution of the genealogy of hybrids up to the parental generation. Under the provisions of the Act on Forest Reproductive Material three poplar clones, Matrix 11, 24, and 49 from the Northwest German Forest Research Station (NW-FVA) and four hybrid aspen cultivars and two hybrid aspen families (in each case P. tremula 7 P. tremuloides) by the Th Institute for Forest Genetics, Grosshansdorf, were approved for the production of forest reproductive material in the category "Tested". Over 50 research projects, carried out at 26 institutions on genetics and breeding, cultivation, physiology, resistance of poplar and willows as well as wood utilisation were funded by third parties and have been included in the report. Also, over 180 scientific publications and seven book titles are listed in the report. In der j Bundeswaldinventur (Th-Institut f Wald 6 kosysteme, Bundeswaldinventur) werden die Fl 4 chenanteile ohne Kurzumtriebsplantagen (KUP) im Jahr 2012 wie folgt angegeben: Aspe 81000 ha, Schwarz-Pappel + Hybriden 38500 ha, Graupappel 5500 ha, Silberpappel 2600 ha, Balsampappel 19200 ha, insgesamt 147000 ha. Der aktuelle Anbau von Pappeln und Weiden beschr 4 nkt sich weitgehend auf KUP, deren Anbaufl 4 che sich im Berichtszeitraum kaum ausgedehnt hat. Daf verantwortliche Faktoren sind attraktive Alternativkulturen, insbesondere Maisanbau f Biogas, verbunden mit dem weitgehenden Verbot der Umwandlung von Gr sowie mangelnde Impulse aus der auf EU-Ebene 2014 beschlossenen Greening-Verordnung. In ihr wird geregelt, dass Pappeln und Weiden in Form von KUP oder Agroforstsysteme (AFS) als 6 kologische Vorrangfl 4 chen, maximal mit dem Faktor 0, 3 angerechnet werden k 6 nnen. Die Gesamtfl 4 che mit KUP ist in Deutschland deshalb nur auf ca. 7. 000 ha angestiegen und nimmt derzeit kaum zu. Die in KUP j 4 hrlich erzeugte Holzmenge von ca. 50. 000 t atro ist vergleichsweise unbedeutend im Verh 4 ltnis zum Brennholzverbrauch in privaten Haushalten von 34 Mio. m 3 und den Importmengen an Holzpellets, die mehrere Mio. t ausmachen. Anstrengungen wurden fortgesetzt, die in Relikten mit B 4 umen verbliebenen Schwarz-Pappel-Vorkommen durch in situ und ex situ Ma zu sichern und Ausgangsbest 4 nde zur Gewinnung von Vermehrungsgut f den Zweck der Generhaltung nach dem Forstvermehrungsgutgesetz (FoVG) zuzulassen. Mit molekulargenetischen Methoden wird sichergestellt, dass nur artreines Vermehrungsgut zur Verf gestellt wird. Zur Artbestimmung sind artspezifische Single Nucleotid Polymorphism (SNP) s/InDels im Chloroplastengenom f 11 der 14 Pappelarten, und zur Identifizierung von Pappelkultivaren umfangreiche Sets molekularer Marker entwickelt worden. Zur Identifizierung von Kultivaren der Gattung Populus sind 24 nukleare Simple Sequence Repeats (nSSR) und f die Gattung Salix 12 nSSR-Marker etabliert, die laufend erg 4 nzt werden. Die Marker erm 6 glichen auch die Identifizierung von Mehrfachhybriden und die Aufl 6 sung der Genealogie von Hybriden bis zur Elterngeneration. Nach Vorgaben des Gesetzes forstliches Vermehrungsgut (FoVG) wurden in der Kategorie 'Gepr' drei Pappelklone, Matrix 11, 24 und 49 aus der Nordwestdeutschen Forstlichen Versuchsanstalt sowie vier Hybridaspen-Kultivare und zwei Hybridaspen-Familien (jeweils P. tremula 7 P. tremuloides) seitens des Th-Instituts f Forstgenetik, Gro, zur Zulassung gebracht. 50 verschiedene Forschungsprojekte wurden durch Drittmittel an 26 Institutionen in Deutschland zur Genetik und Z, Anbau, Physiologie, Resistenzen von Pappeln, Weiden sowie Ernte und Verwertung ihres Holzes gef 6 rdert. 180 wissenschaftliche Ver 6 ffentlichung und sieben B sind im Bericht erfasst...|$|E
