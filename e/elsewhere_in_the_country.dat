25|$|Despite these achievements, {{there were}} signs of {{difficulties}} <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country's</b> tuberculosis control program. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> half of China that did not implement the project funded by the World Bank, the prevalence of tuberculosis did not fall during the 1990s. Thus, <b>the</b> fall <b>in</b> tuberculosis prevalence for <b>the</b> entire <b>country</b> slowed to 2.5% per year during the 1990s. The 2000 national tuberculosis survey revealed that one in ten patients with tuberculosis had multi-drug resistant (MDR) disease — i.e., resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. Other studies confirmed a serious epidemic of MDR tuberculosis in several Chinese provinces, with rates of multidrug resistance in previously untreated cases that were five to ten times higher than the global mean.|$|R

Also in question was to what extent the advances of the ARBiH, HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes, and conversely, to what extent they hampered the VRS.|$|E
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} in the Dominican Republic, David turned unexpectedly to the northwest, causing 125 mph (200 km/h) winds in Santo Domingo and Category 5 winds <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The storm caused torrential rainfall, {{resulting in}} extreme river flooding. The flooding swept away entire villages and isolated communities during the storm's onslaught. A rail-mounted container crane collapsed in Rio Haina at the sea-land terminal.

5|$|By 1926, {{however, the}} Buffalo to Albany section of NY5 was {{relocated}} onto the Genesee Road alignment, replacing NY5A. NY5's former, more southerly alignment was redesignated as NY7. In 1927, {{the establishment of}} the U.S. Highway System created more numbering changes. US20, which mainly followed the Yellowstone Trail <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> was designated in New York along NY5 southwest of Hamburg and east of Albany and along old NY7 from Skaneateles to Albany. Between the towns of Hamburg and Avon, the new US20 used an even more southerly alignment, running via East Aurora and Warsaw. This truncated both ends of NY5 to Athol Springs (south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg) in the west, and to Albany in the east.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, William Fox was {{operating}} the successful film distributor Box Office Attraction Film Rental Company. Box Office purchased films from studios such as Balboa Amusement Producing Company, showing them in Fox's New York area theaters and renting prints to exhibitors <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Life's Shop Window may have originally been considered for production in this manner. However, Fox {{decided he was}} unwilling to depend on others for the products his business required, and instead prepared to produce his own films under the Box Office Attractions Company name. He purchased the Éclair film studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey and property in Staten Island, arranged for actors and crew, and began production with an adaptation of an established work, as was common at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{education}} system of Gyeongju {{is the same}} as <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Schooling begins with preschools; there are 65 in the city. This is followed by six years in elementary schools; Gyeongju has 46. Subsequently, students pass through three years of middle school. There are 19 middle schools in Gyeongju. High school education, which lasts for three years, is not compulsory, but most students attend and graduate from high school. Gyeongju is home to 21 high schools, of which 11 provide specialized technical training. At each of these levels, there is a mix of public and private institutions. All are overseen by the Gyeongju bureau of North Gyeongsang's Provincial Office of Education. Gyeongju is home to a school for the mentally disabled, which provides education to students from preschool to adult age.|$|E

The group has lost 75% of its Nigerian territory since 2014, and has fallen back to its strongholds in northeast Borno State.|$|R
30|$|Have {{the numbers}} of mobile pastoralists {{decreased}} over the twentieth century? The (flawed) census data indicate that the proportions of <b>the</b> population engaged <b>in</b> a mobile lifestyle have declined (see Figure  1) and a considerable literature points to the sedentarisation of both the rich (a small minority) and the poor who have lost most/all their livestock and thus {{no longer need to}} be mobile. Although there are claims that nomads have lower natural fertility than sedentary populations (Randall 2008), in most contexts, these claims are difficult to substantiate and contemporary evidence indicates that populations in pastoralist zones have higher fertility than those in more settled or more urban areas, a factor primarily related to access to schooling and to health and contraceptive services. Nevertheless, it means that populations of pastoralist origin will often have very high population growth rates, possibly higher than <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> concerned, and therefore, all things being equal, one would expect their proportion to increase, not decrease.|$|R
5000|$|The Nonesuch Mine is an {{abandoned}} copper mine and small ghost town <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southeast corner of}} the Porcupine Mountains State Park in Carp Lake Township, Ontonagon County, near Silver City, Michigan, United States.

The offensive achieved its objectives and set the stage for further advances of the HV, HVO and ARBiH towards Banja Luka, contributing to the resolution of the war.|$|E
5|$|The strongman behind Haakon's monarchy {{had been}} his foster-father Tore Tordsson ("Steigar-Tore"), who refused to {{recognise}} Magnus as king after Haakon's death. With Egil Aslaksson and other noblemen, he had the otherwise-unknown Sweyn Haraldsson set up as a pretender. Although later sagas maintain that Sweyn was Danish, some modern historians have speculated {{that he may have}} been a son of Harald Hardrada. The revolt was based in the Uplands, but also gained support from noblemen <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> After several weeks of fighting, Magnus captured Tore and his supporters and had them hanged on the island of Vambarholm (outside Hamnøy, Lofoten, in northern Norway). Magnus was reportedly furious because he could not pardon Egil, a potentially useful, young and resourceful nobleman. As king, his honour would only allow a pardon if other noblemen pleaded for Egil's life; this did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially {{there appeared to}} be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E
60|$|A cursory {{inspection}} of Shaghab removed {{some of the}} difficulties which had perplexed us at Shuwák and <b>elsewhere.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Country</b> signs of metal-working, which was mostly confined to the Wadys, have been generally obliterated; washed away or sanded over.

5|$|In {{the days}} after the storm, airstrikes and attacks {{continued}} <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and only days after Chapala, Cyclone Megh followed a similar path, causing additional damage. Relief distribution was disrupted due to the poor communications in the region, worsened by the ongoing civil war, with the hardest hit areas under al-Qaeda control; aid trucks had to pass security clearances, resulting in delays. Workers began restoring communications and clearing roads in {{the days after}} the storm. By 19November, most of the displaced residents had returned home, although some remained in shelters due to house damage. Southern portions of Yemen saw food and fuel shortages following the two storms. Mukalla experienced an outbreak of dengue fever by January 2016 due to the floods, affecting 1,040people; earlier efforts to kill disease carrying mosquitoes were ineffective due to residual floods and unsanitary conditions. Seven people died due to the outbreak. A locust outbreak also began in December 2015 due to the floods.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Mexico, {{the floods}} {{killed at least}} 379people, {{according}} to the federal government, and as many as 600 according to relief agencies; the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters later estimated there were 636deaths, and damage in Mexico was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos). Nationwide, the floods damaged or destroyed 90,000houses, which left about 500,000people homeless. Flooding caused thousands of landslides, many in more populated areas than the flooding in 1944. The floods also caused 39rivers to overflow, and the combination of floods and landslides destroyed bridges, houses, widespread crop fields, schools, and electrical networks. Impact was worst in Puebla, where damage totaled $240million (2.1billion pesos) and many roads were washed out. Landslides in the state killed 107people in Teziutlán. <b>Elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> the floods washed crocodiles into the streets of Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco, and in Oaxaca, the rainfall occurred after an earthquake left thousands homeless. Flooding also extended into Central America in late September through early October, causing $40million (385million pesos) in crop damage and 70deaths.|$|E
5|$|Wales has {{a complex}} {{geological}} history which has left it a largely mountainous country. The coastal plain is narrow {{in the north}} and west of the country but wider in the south, where the Vale of Glamorgan has some of the best agricultural land. Exploitation of the South Wales Coalfield during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the development of an urban economy in the South Wales Valleys, and the expansion of the port cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea for the export of coal. The smaller North Wales Coalfield was also developed at this time, but <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> the landscape is rural and communities are small, the economy being largely dependent on agriculture and tourism. The climate is influenced by the proximity of the country to the Atlantic Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds; thus it tends to be mild, cloudy, wet and windy.|$|E

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). This re-organisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina that took place between 29 February and 1 March 1992. This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March 1992. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In {{the final days of}} March, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, resulting in a cross-border operation by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) 108th Brigade. On 4 April 1992, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. There were other examples of the JNA directly supported the VRS, such as during the capture of Zvornik in early April 1992, when the JNA provided artillery support from Serbia, firing across the Drina River. At the same time, the JNA attempted to defuse the situation and arrange negotiations <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
