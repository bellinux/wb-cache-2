The conventional flap system consisted of a leading edge slat and a double slotted, trailing edge flap with a small chord vane and a large chord aft flap. The advanced flap system consisted of a leading edge slat and a double slotted, trailing edge flap with a large chord vane and a small chord aft flap. Both models were tested with all elements nested to form the cruise airfoil and with the leading edge slat and with a single or double slotted, trailing edge flap deflected to form the high lift airfoils. The experimental tests were conducted through a Reynolds number range from 2. 8 to 20. 9 x 1, 000, 000 and a Mach number range from 0. 10 to 0. 35. Lift and pitching moment data were obtained. Summaries of the test results obtained are presented and comparisons are made between the observed aerodynamic performance trends for both models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development process}} of a dynamically actuated lip for active blowing at high-lift flaps. The system consists of MEMS pressure sensors to determine the flow conditions and adaptive lips to regulate the mass flow and the velocity of a wall near stream over the internally blown Coanda flap. By the oscillating lip the mass flow in the blowing slot changes dynamically, consequently the momentum exchange of the boundary layer over a <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>flap</b> required mass flow can be reduced. In a first functional demonstrator piezo ceramic d 33 -stack actuators, operating at low voltage levels, are bonded to a metal substrate in a bending transducer configuration for basic experiments to determine the nominal displacement and the blocking force of the adaptive lip. Prospective all control systems shall be coupled to large-area sensor-actuator-arrays and integrated conformable into the structure. The efficiency increase of an internally blown Coanda flap by using unsteady blowing will be investigated during water channel tests which are in preparation. In this context an appropriate waterproof electrical insulation is evaluated by environmental tests. The first flow investigations will be implemented in a water tunnel {{in order to reduce}} the flow velocity and the systemâ€™s control frequency by a factor of 10 compared to a wind tunnel. Compared to the prior art, an expansion of the frequency range is expected and the benefits due to the compact and highly integrated design demand a high aerodynamic efficiency of this configuration...|$|E
40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{flow separation}} control {{system is designed}} and implemented as {{an essential part of}} a novel high-lift device for future aircraft. The system consists of MEMS pressure sensors to determine the flow conditions and adaptive lips to regulate the mass flow and the velocity of a wall near stream over the internally blown Coanda flap. By the oscillating lip the mass flow in the blowing slot changes dynamically, consequently the momentum exchange of the boundary layer over a <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>flap</b> required mass flow can be reduced. These new compact and highly integrated systems provide a realtime monitoring and manipulation of the flow conditions. In this context the integration of pressure sensors into flow sensing airfoils of composite material is investigated. Mechanical and electrical properties of the integrated sensors are investigated under mechanical loads during tensile tests. The sensors contain a reference pressure chamber isolated to the ambient by a deformable membrane with integrated piezoresistors connected as a Wheatstone bridge, which outputs voltage signals depending on the ambient pressure. The composite material in which the sensors are embedded consists of 22 individual layers of unidirectional glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) prepreg. The results of the experiments are used for adapting the design of the sensors and the layout of the laminate to ensure an optimized flux of force in highly loaded structures primarily for future aeronautical applications. It can be shown that the pressure sensor withstands the embedding process into fiber composites with full functional capability and predictable behavior under stress...|$|E
40|$|A prior trade study {{established}} {{the effectiveness of}} using Active Flow Control (AFC) for reducing the mechanical complexities associated with a modern high-lift system without sacrificing aerodynamic performance at low-speed flight conditions representative of takeoff and landing. The current technical report expands on this prior work in two ways: (1) a refined conventional high-lift system based on the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) is presented that is more representative of modern commercial transport aircraft in terms of stall characteristics and maximum Lift/Drag (L/D) ratios at takeoff and landing-approach flight conditions; and (2) the design trade space for AFC-enabled high-lift systems is expanded to explore {{a wider range of}} options for improving their efficiency. The refined conventional high-lift CRM (HL-CRM) concept features leading edge slats and slotted trailing edge flaps with Fowler motion. For the current AFC-enhanced high lift system trade study, the refined conventional high-lift system is simplified by substituting simply-hinged trailing edge flaps for the slotted single-element flaps with Fowler motion. The high-lift performance of these two high-lift CRM variants is established using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions to the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. These CFD assessments identify the high-lift performance that needs to be recovered through AFC to have the CRM variant with the lighter and mechanically simpler high-lift system match the performance of the conventional high-lift system. In parallel to the conventional high-lift concept development, parametric studies using CFD guided the development of an effective and efficient AFC-enabled simplified high-lift system. This included parametric trailing edge flap geometry studies addressing the effects of flap chord length and flap deflection. As for the AFC implementation, scaling effects (i. e., wind-tunnel versus full-scale flight conditions) are addressed, as are AFC architecture aspects such as AFC unit placement, number AFC units, operating pressures, mass flow rates, and steady versus unsteady AFC applications. These efforts {{led to the development of}} a novel traversing AFC actuation concept which is efficient in that it reduces the AFC mass flow requirements by as much as an order of magnitude compared to previous AFC technologies, and it is predicted to be effective in driving the aerodynamic performance of a mechanical simplified high-lift system close to that of the reference conventional high-lift system. Conceptual system integration studies were conducted for the AFC-enhanced high-lift concept applied to a NASA Environmentally Responsible Aircraft (ERA) reference configuration, the so-called ERA- 0003 concept. The results from these design integration assessments identify overall system performance improvement opportunities over conventional high-lift systems that suggest the viability of further technology maturation efforts for AFC-enabled <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>flap</b> systems. To that end, technical challenges are identified associated with the application of AFC-enabled high-lift systems to modern transonic commercial transports for future technology maturation efforts...|$|E
25|$|The Welkin {{required}} a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise {{the number of}} seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in {{the features of the}} Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> Fowler <b>flaps</b> of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament âˆ’ four Hispano 20 mm cannon âˆ’ was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely to dazzle the pilot.|$|R

Based on a known laminar cruise airfoil that incorporated an NGAS-developed integrated slot design, this effort involved using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and quality function deployment (QFD) analysis on several leading edge concepts, and subsequently down-selected to two blown leading-edge concepts for testing. A 7 -foot-span AHLLE airfoil model was designed and fabricated at NGAS and then tested at the NGAS 7 x 10 Low Speed Wind Tunnel in Hawthorne, CA. The model configurations tested included: baseline, deflected trailing edge, blown deflected trailing edge, blown leading edge, morphed leading edge, and blown/morphed leading edge. A successful demonstration of <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> leading edge technology was achieved, and the target goals for improved lift were exceeded by 30 % with a maximum section lift coefficient (Cl) of 5. 2. Maximum incremental section lift coefficients (Cl) of 3. 5 and 3. 1 were achieved for a blown drooped (morphed) leading edge concept and a non-drooped leading edge blowing concept, respectively.

5000|$|Several NASA Research Centers {{have noted}} its unique ability to {{fly on the}} planet Mars. Fixed wing aerial Mars rovers would have to fly at over 250 mph just to stay aloft in the {{rarefied}} Mars atmosphere. This makes landing on the rocky surface almost impossible, thereby precluding sample inspection/gathering. Also, the high speed flight means that dwell time on any particular area will be difficultâ€”a negative feature that {{is compounded by the}} fact that turns in the thin atmosphere will require enormous radii.

40|$|The Institute of Structural Mechanics (ISM) at the German Aerospace Center {{is working}} on several aeronau-tical {{projects}} dealing with adaptive structures. Some examples will be presented at the workshop. In transonic civil transport airplanes the structural and aerodynamic efficiency of cruise flight can be in-creased significantly by varying the wing camber with a flexible trailing edge and building up a variable bump at the upper surface of the wing, both optimized for every flight condition during the complete mission. In order to provide an optimal gap size between wing and <b>flap</b> during <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> flight with <b>flaps</b> extended, these are actively re-deformed in spanwise direction due to the applied airload {{which leads to a}} much better <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> behavior. In <b>high</b> performance aircraft one example is concerned with vibrations of the vertical stabilizer due to vor-texes, generated by the wings leading edge. They are reduced by means of an active interface, made of piecoce-ramic stack actuators, thus resulting in reduced structural loading. Present helicopter research mainly focuses on the improvement of the aerodynamic efficiency and on the re-duction of vibrations and acoustic emission. The adaptive blade twist concept, developed by ISM, allows to directly control the twist of the helicopter blades by smart adaptive elements and through this to positively influ-ence the main rotor area which is the primary source for helicopter noise and vibrations...|$|R
