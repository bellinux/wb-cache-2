5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Stadium attendances are a {{significant}} source of regular income for Premier League clubs. For the 2009–10 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 34,215 for Premier League matches with a total aggregate attendance figure of 13,001,616. This represents an increase of 13,089 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league's first season (1992–93). However, during the 1992–93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats {{in order to meet the}} Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums. The Premier League's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season. This record was then beaten in the 2013–14 season recording an average attendance of 36,695 with a total attendance of just under 14 million, the highest average in England's top flight since 1950.|$|E

25|$|As {{a simple}} example, {{consider}} the average daily maximum temperatures for two cities, one inland {{and one on}} the coast. It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as, on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature {{is more likely to be}} farther <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.|$|E

50|$|According to Goldin, a key {{cause of}} the Quiet Revolution was the {{development}} of new contraceptive technology, namely the birth control pill. Young women married and had children at a lower rate if the state they lived in had early legal access to it; women could set aside their relationships and pursue a career through higher education. Goldin and Katz noted that the birth control pill was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1960 for use by married women. It spread to young, unmarried women in the late 1960s with change in age of majority laws. Thus, they found a difference <b>from</b> <b>the</b> national <b>average</b> for women born 1930-1965 with if they lived in a state with early legal access to the pill. There was a −0.02 difference in marriage age at 23 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> national <b>average</b> of 0.41. There was a −0.07 difference <b>from</b> <b>the</b> national <b>average</b> of having a child by 22. There was a 0.004 difference <b>from</b> <b>the</b> national <b>average</b> of being a professional, and a 0.016 difference <b>from</b> <b>the</b> national <b>average</b> of being a lawyer or doctor. The birth control pill affected marriage, fertility, and career choice.|$|R
25|$|Continental climates {{are usually}} seen in areas further inland from the coastal {{influences}} of oceans and large bodies of water. The difference <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> mean temperature of its coldest and hottest months {{can be quite}} significant with moderate precipitation that usually occurs {{in the winter and}} early spring. Depending on the water retaining ability of the soil the grapevine may receive enough water during this period to last throughout the growing season with little if any irrigation needed. For soils with poor water retention, the dry summer months may require some supplemental irrigation. Examples of continental climates that use supplemental irrigation include the Columbia Valley of Washington State and the Mendoza wine region of Argentina.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{oil embargo}} and the {{restrictions}} on transactions with Iran’s Central Bank have dramatically reduced Iran’s oil sales – a fact acknowledged by Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi to the Majles on 7 January 2013. He indicated sales had fallen 40% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> of 2.5 {{million barrels per day}} (mbd) in 2011 (see chart above on Iran oil buyers). This is close to the estimates of energy analysts, which put Iran’s sales at the end of 2012 in a range of 1 mbd to 1.5 mbd. Reducing Iran’s sales further might depend on whether U.S. officials are able to persuade China, in particular, to further cut buys from Iran—and to sustain those cuts.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco was {{designated}} the official {{port of entry}} for all California ports where U.S. customs (also called tariffs and Ad valorem taxes) (averaging about 25%) were collected by the Collector of Customs from all ships bearing foreign goods.

Shipping boomed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> of about 25 vessels from 1825 to 1847 to about 793 ships in 1849 and 803 ships in 1850. All ships were inspected for what goods they carried.

25|$|The {{retardation}} {{factor is}} another very important feature {{that make the}} motion of the contaminant to deviate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> groundwater motion. It is analogous to the retardation factor of chromatography. Unlike diffusion and dispersion, which simply spread the contaminant, the retardation factor changes its global average velocity, {{so that it can be}} much slower than that of water. This is due to a chemico-physical effect: the adsorption to the soil, which holds the contaminant back and does not allow it to progress until the quantity corresponding to the chemical adsorption equilibrium has been adsorbed. This effect is particularly important for less soluble contaminants, which thus can move even hundreds or thousands times slower than water. The effect of this phenomenon is that only more soluble species can cover long distances. The retardation factor depends on the chemical nature of both the contaminant and the aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Skilled, {{highly trained}} and very fit freedivers can often go {{as deep as}} {{recreational}} scuba divers, and sometimes deeper, but for a very much shorter time. Recreational scuba diving is generally limited by diver certification {{to a maximum of}} 40 meters, for reasons of safety. Recreational divers who dive to deeper depths are generally expected by the certification agencies to have technical diver training, while freediving is only limited by the divers ability and willingness to accept the risks. The risks of freediving to these depths are significant, and a major difference is that recreational scuba certification agencies specify depth restrictions to avoid liablity issues, while freedivers are left to make their own choices regarding risk acceptance. Recreational freediving is practiced by many people ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> snorkeler to the professional freediver. Recreational freediving is also frequently practiced in freshwater springs due to excellent visibility.|$|E
