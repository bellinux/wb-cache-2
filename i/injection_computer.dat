5000|$|Using air {{conditioning}} requires {{the generation of}} up to [...] of extra power to maintain a given speed. A/C systems cycle on and off, or vary their output, {{as required by the}} occupants so they rarely run at full power continuously. Rolling down the windows is often seen as the leading way to prevent this loss of energy. This technique, however, causes increased drag in the form of air resistance and the cost savings is less than is generally anticipated. Using the passenger heating system slows the rise to operating temperature for the engine. Either the choke in a carburetor-equipped car (1970's or earlier) or the fuel <b>injection</b> <b>computer</b> in modern vehicles will add more fuel to the fuel-air mixture until normal operating temperature is reached, decreasing fuel efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Technically speaking, the 1996 to 1998 US {{models with}} 4.0-litre engines {{had the same}} {{displacement}} as the 3.9-litre engines fitted to the earlier 1994 to 1995 US models; {{the differences between the}} engines involved improvements to the block rigidity and pistons, and a change from the Lucas 14CUX engine management to the distributor-less Generic Engine Management System ("GEMS"). In earlier 3.9-litre US engines the fuel <b>injection</b> <b>computer</b> (14CUX) did not control the ignition, which was instead controlled by a traditional system with an ignition coil and distributor made by Lucas. The GEMS system was developed jointly by Lucas and SAGEM; it controlled both spark timing and fuel injection. Unlike the earlier systems fitted to Rover V8 engines, GEMS was made OBD-II compliant. This change was largely driven by the federal requirement (starting in 1996) for vehicles sold in the United States to meet the OBD-II specification.|$|E

TR8s were initially fitted with twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetors. However, about 400 1980 models sold in California, all 1981 models---of which only 352 were produced including twenty carbed cars for the UK market---and all 1982 models (of which all seventy went to Canada) featured a Bosch L-jetronic fuel injection system with a specially designed Lucas fuel <b>injection</b> <b>computer</b> (ECU). The carburetor model was rated at [...] (at around 5000 rpm) and the fuel injected at either 137 or possibly 148 bhp delivering 0-60 mph times in the low 8 seconds. Other differences between the TR8 and TR7 are upgraded brakes, revised axle ratio (3.08:1 on the TR8 and all automatic TR7s), battery moved to the trunk (boot), alloy wheels, leather steering wheel and a few minor trim changes.|$|E

50|$|The {{conventional}} {{remedy for}} a flooded carbureted engine is to steadily hold the throttle full open (full power position) {{while continuing to}} crank the engine. This permits the maximum flow of air through the engine, flushing the overly rich fuel mixture out of the exhaust. If the exhaust system is hot enough to autoignite, an after-fire may result; {{this can be seen}} as a flame discharging through the exhaust system. On a fuel-injected engine, ignoring the throttle (no fuel) while starting permits electronic logic systems to produce the correct fuel mixture, often based on exhaust gases. Some fuel <b>injection</b> <b>computers</b> interpret 'pumping' the throttle to indicate a flooded engine, and alter the fuel-air mixture accordingly. In a carbureted engine equipped with an accelerator pump (which advances fuel flow to match air ingestion under rapid throttle acceleration), 'pumping' the throttle will force excess fuel into the engine, further flooding it.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1989 for the 740 GLE (and later {{used in the}} 940/960), The 16-Valve Redblock motors {{were offered}} in both a 2.0 litre Turbo (B204FT/GT) and a 2.3 litre 154 hp Naturally {{aspirated}} version (B234F). The head was designed for Volvo by Porsche. In addition to the 16 Valve head, these motors were equipped with twin counter rotating external balance shafts and the engine block itself differs from the 8V redblock. The block differed from the standard B230 in that the auxiliary shaft (used to drive the oil pump and distributor on models that had block mounted distributors) was replaced with an external oil pump. The 16-Valve head was itself a completely new design for Volvo: The head was of a multi-piece design featuring a separate cam carrier and lower section. The later [...] "white block" [...] motors can trace their head design back to the two-piece setup found in the B204 and B234. The 2.0 litre turbo variant was introduced for European markets with tax structures tied to engine displacement such as Italy. Unique to the B204 turbo was an exhaust gas pyrometer which was used to detect excessively high exhaust temperatures. When excessively high exhaust temperatures were detected, the fuel <b>injection</b> <b>computer</b> would richen the mixture. It has a forged crankshaft, cast pistons, and 13 mm connecting rods.|$|E

40|$|Human induced {{pluripotent}} stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) hold {{great promise}} for studying inherited cardiac arrhythmias and developing drug therapies to treat such arrhythmias. Unfortunately, until now, action potential (AP) measurements in hiPSC-CMs have been {{hampered by the}} virtual absence of the inward rectifier potassium current (I-K 1) in hiPSC-CMs, resulting in spontaneous activity and altered function of various depolarising and repolarising membrane currents. We assessed whether AP measurements in ventricular-like and atrial-like hiPSC-CMs could be improved through a simple, highly reproducible dynamic clamp approach to provide these cells with a substantial I-K 1 (computed in real time according to the actual membrane potential and injected through the patch-clamp pipette). APs were measured at 1 Hz using perforated patch-clamp methodology, both in control cells and in cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) during the differentiation process {{to increase the number}} of cells with atrial-like APs. RA-treated hiPSC-CMs displayed shorter APs than control hiPSC-CMs and this phenotype became more prominent upon addition of synthetic I-K 1 through dynamic clamp. Furthermore, the variability of several AP parameters decreased upon I-K 1 <b>injection.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations with models of ventricular-like and atrial-like hiPSC-CMs demonstrated the importance of selecting an appropriate synthetic I-K 1.

Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker (points), and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s.

40|$|Piezoelectric {{injectors}} {{allow to}} inject precise proportional quantities of fuel at extremely high speed. Controlled by pulses {{from the engine}} management unit, they work like solenoid valves, opening and closing back very rapidly, spraying the exact quantity of fuel determined by the <b>injection</b> <b>computer</b> into the engine combustion chambers. However, {{for this type of}} injectors an impulse of a hundred volts is applied in order to actuate them. This is a big concern in automotive environment, where the 12 V battery voltages is still the main power source available. Therefore, a power converter is needed to interface battery voltage and piezo actuator; for mechanical and electrical reasons (weight, dimensions and power losses) a switching amplifier is preferred with respect to linear amplifier, especially for this type of applications where efficiency and weight are the main issues. Fig. 1 presents a switching amplifier for piezo actuator: it consists of two components, a unidirectional DC/DC converter with a small input power that loads a large buffer capacitor and a bidirectional DC/DC converter, which controls the energy alternating between the buffer capacitor and the piezo actuator. The requirements on the unidirectional DC/DC converter are few. It only needs to compensate for the power losses of the two stages plus the energy dissipated in the actuator and the connected mechanical system [6]. Conventional DC/DC boost converter is not the best solution in piezoelectric based applications where a high step up ratio (more than 20) and high efficiency power conversion is required. Flyback converter could be an alternative topology but presents high switching losses and it has an insulated output, so not compliant with electrical load specification. An efficient high-step up DC/DC converter is presented for interfacing the standard 12 V battery with the high voltage DC-bus used for piezoelectric actuators system. In the proposed converter, two coupled inductor boost converters are interleaved and controlled by an FPGA. Different types of control techniques could be used to limit the input current [7]; the solution presented herein allows fast transient response and best performances with respect to traditional control techniques. Moreover the implemented technique has the advantages of lower electromagnetic emission and higher operating frequency capability, compared to the standard fixed frequency control; on the other hand it is difficult to design the EMI filter due to the intrinsic variable frequency. The high computational load of the control algorithms forces the use of an FPGA implementation in order to achieve the desired accuracy in real time control at the frequency of the PWM signal needs for the DC/DC converter, which will be 200 kHz. Design and analysis of the proposed converter are presented. Finally, experimental results are reported in order to validate the proposed converte...|$|E

40|$|The {{drive to}} reduce engine {{emissions}} has placed an emphasis upon turbocharging {{especially with the}} trend of engine downsizing (1, 2). Turbocharged vehicles exhibit a weak point of poor drivability under transient running conditions.

A novel and original category of low-cost static solar-daylighting-collectors named Keywo solar energy, solar collectors, daylighting systems, nonimaging optics, Refractive Integrated Nonimaging Solar Collectors (RINSC) has been designed and thoroughly tested. The RINSC category is based on nonimaging optics and integrates several optical elements, such as prismatic arrays and light guides, into a single-structured embodiment made of solid-dielectric material. The RINSC category is sub-divided in this thesis into four distinctive and original sub-categories/systems: Prismatic Solar Collectors (PSC), Multi-Prismatic Solar Collectors (MPSC), Integrated Multi-Prismatic Solar Collectors (IMPSC) and Vertically Integrated Nonimaging Solar Collectors (VINSC). The optical configuration and compact embodiment of these systems allows them to be integrated into a building façade without creating any protrusion, indicating that they can lead to solar collector systems with high building integration potential.

40|$|Purpose. To develop {{paclitaxel}} {{carried by}} injectable PEGylated emulsions, an {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) was used to optimize the formulation—which has a small particle size, high entrapment efficiency, and good stability—and to investigate the role of each ingredient in the emulsion. Methods. Paclitaxel emulsions were prepared by a modified ethanol <b>injection</b> method. A <b>computer</b> optimization technique based on a spherical experimental design for three-level, three factors [soybean oil (X 1), PEG-DSPE (X 2) and polysorbate 80 (X 3) ] were used to optimize the formulation. The entrapment efficiency of paclitaxel (Y 1) was quantified by HPLC; the particle size of the emulsions (Y 2) was measured by dynamic laser light scattering and the stability of paclitaxel emulsions was monitored by the changes in drug concen-tration (Y 3) and particle size (Y 4) after storage at 4 °C. Results. The entrapment efficiency, particle size and stability of pa-clitaxel emulsions were influenced by PEG-DSPE, polysorbate 80, and soybean oil. Paclitaxel emulsions of small size (262 nm), high entrapment efficiency (96. 7 %), and good stability were obtained by the optimization. Conclusions. A novel formulation for paclitaxel emulsions was opti-mized with ANN and prepared. The contribution indices of each component suggested that PEG-DSPE mainly contributes to the en-trapment efficiency and particle size of paclitaxel emulsions, while polysorbate 80 contributes to stability.
