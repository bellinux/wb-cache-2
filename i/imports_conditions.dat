40|$|The {{import of}} protein into chloroplasts is {{mediated}} by translocon components {{located in the}} chloroplast outer (the Toc proteins) and inner (the Tic proteins) envelope membranes. To identify intermediate steps during active import, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation and blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to identify complexes of translocon components associated with precursor proteins under active <b>import</b> <b>conditions</b> instead of arrested binding <b>conditions.</b> <b>Importing</b> precursor proteins in solubilized chloroplast membranes formed a two-peak distribution in the sucrose density gradient. The heavier peak was in a similar position as the previously reported Tic/Toc supercomplex and was too large to be analyzed by BN-PAGE. The BN-PAGE analyses of the lighter peak revealed that precursors accumulated {{in at least two}} complexes. The first complex migrated at a position close to the ferritin dimer (approximately 880 kDa) and contained only the Toc components. Kinetic analyses suggested that this Toc complex represented an earlier step in the import process than the Tic/Toc supercomplex.

40|$|Translocation and folding of {{proteins}} imported into mitochondria are mediated by two matrix-localized chaperones, mhsp 70 and hsp 60. In order {{to investigate whether}} these chaperones act sequentially or in parallel, we studied their interaction with newly imported precursor proteins in isolated yeast mitochondria by coimmunoprecipitation. All precursors bound transiently to mhsp 70. Release from mhsp 70 required hydrolysis of ATP and did not immediately generate a tightly folded protein. For example, after imported mouse dihydrofolate reductase (a soluble monomeric enzyme) had been released from mhsp 70, folding to a protease resistant conformation occurred only after a lag and was much slower than the release. Under standard <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> no significant association of DHFR with hsp 60 could be detected. Similarly, newly imported hsp 60 subunit was released from mhsp 70 as an incompletely folded, unassembled intermediate which accumulated at low temperature and assembled to hsp 60 14 -mer at higher temperature in an ATP-dependent manner. Mas 2 p (the larger subunit of the MAS-encoded processing protease) first bound to mhsp 70, then to hsp 60, and only then assembled with its partner subunit, Mas 1 p.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of known vacuolar proteins transit through the secretory pathway, two vacuole-resident proteins have been identified that reach this organelle by an alternate pathway. These polypeptides are targeted to the vacuole directly from the cytoplasm by a novel import mechanism. The best characterized protein that uses this pathway is aminopeptidase I (API). API is synthesized as a cytoplasmic precursor containing an amino-terminal propeptide that is cleaved off when the protein reaches the vacuole. To dissect the biochemistry of this pathway, we have reconstituted the targeting of API in vitro in a permeabilized cell system. Based on several criteria, the in vitro import assay faithfully reconstitutes the in vivo reaction. After incubation under <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> API is processed by a vacuolar- resident protease, copurifies with a vacuole-enriched fraction, and becomes inaccessible to the cytoplasm. These observations demonstrate that API has passed from the cytoplasm to the vacuole. The reconstituted import process is dependent on time, temperature, and energy. ATP gamma S inhibits this reaction, indicating that API transport is ATP driven. API import is also inhibited by GTP gamma S, suggesting that this process may be mediated by a GTP-binding protein. In addition, in vitro import requires a functional vacuolar ATPase; import is inhibited both {{in the presence of}} the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A 1, and in a yeast strain in which one of the genes encoding a V-ATPase subunit has been disrupted...|$|R

Extraintestinal (muscular) {{sarcocystosis}} and intestinal sarcocystosis are the two known manifestations of disease in humans. In this series of six cases and review, we focus on the invasive extraintestinal ("muscular") form of sarcocystosis in humans. This disease, which until recently was rarely described, has become relevant particularly as an <b>imported</b> <b>condition</b> in travelers due to a recent series of outbreaks reported from Malaysia. Human intestinal sarcocystosis is ubiquitous across the globe. However, absolute numbers of probable and particularly confirmed cases are few, with only several hundred described to date. Characteristically, patients exhibit signs and symptoms either 1 - 2 weeks after exposure, or after 4 - 8 weeks. Whether people remain asymptomatic or develop disease apparently depends on the infecting species, host factors, and the inoculum size. The definitive host(s) remain uncertain, and identification of the animal reservoir(s) requires further research. A better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, as well as its immunological determinants, is hampered by the lack of reliable serological diagnostic methods. Additionally, DNA seems to be contained very effectively within the encysted parasite, thereby rendering PCR detection unreliable. Physicians should suspect the condition in patients with suggestive symptoms and a possible history of exposure.

Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to analyze factors that determine export flows between Ethiopia and its trading partners using a gravity model approach. The research had used secondary data collected from different sources and covers periods from 1995 - 2010 for 14 importing countries, which implies that the data were panel. There was consideration of the importing capacity of the countries and successiveness of their <b>importing</b> <b>condition</b> for considering the countries as a sample. Different tests were applied in order to select the appropriate model to regress the gravity model. As of those tests, the research had adopted the random effects gravity model.

Coefficients of per capita GDPs of importer and exporter countries, population size of trading partners, and the distance between nations are significant and as to the expected sign. However, the coefficients of population sizes of Ethiopia and bilateral exchange rate between nations are significant and against the hypotheses. Based on the result, successive enlargement of the foreign per capita GDP directly result into increment in the export revenue of Ethiopia. In addition, the more populous the trading partners of Ethiopia, the higher its export volumes as they imports much to satisfy large domestic demands. Moreover, distance between two countries, which is a proxy for transport costs, affects Ethiopian exports negatively...|$|R

Biol. Chem. 277, 45704 – 45714]. To understand further the import strategy of Mtf 1 p, we investigated {{the import of}} the wild-type and N-terminal-truncated Mtf 1 p mutants synthesized in two different in vitro translation systems. These Mtf 1 p derivatives were generated either in the RRL (rabbit reticulocyte lysate) or in the WGE (wheat germ extract) translation system. Under the in vitro <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> the RRL-synthesized full-length Mtf 1 p but not the N-terminal-truncated Mtf 1 p product was efficiently imported into mitochondria, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence is important for its import. On the other hand, when these Mtf 1 p products were generated in the WGE system, surprisingly, the N-terminal-truncated products, but not the full-length protein, were effectively translocated into mitochondria. Despite these differences between the translation systems, in both cases, import occurs at a low temperature and has no requirement for a trypsin-sensitive mt receptor, mt membrane potential or ATP hydrolysis. Together, these observations suggest that, {{in the presence of}} certain cytoplasmic factors (derived from either RRL or WGE), Mtf 1 p is capable of using alternative import signals present in different regions of the protein. This appears to be the first example of usage of different targeting sequences for the transport of a single mt protein into the mt matrix...|$|R

Results There were no severe complications and transient mild chest pain resolved until the seventh day after the stent deployment. Chest X-ray demonstrated expansion of the stent in all patients. In 2 cases of fistula, a barium swallow showed its complete sealing. The completion of the proposed follow-up was not achieved in three cases, limited by the patient's death until the third month, due to cancer progression.

The winter of 1916-1917 {{was known as the}} [...] "turnip winter" [...] (:de:Steckrübenwinter), because that vegetable, which was usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers. Compared to peacetime, about 474,000 additional civilians died, chiefly because malnutrition had weakened the body.Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink, but using the slogan of [...] "sharing scarcity", the German bureaucracy ran an efficient rationing system nevertheless.|$|R
40|$|Algeria remains heavily {{dependent}} on the hydrocarbon sector and still maintains a sizable and inefficient state-owned enterprise sector. Against this background, the paper addresses two different issues with important implications for macroeconomic stability in Algeria. The paper proposes the replacement of directed credit to large loss-making public enterprises with temporary and explicit budget subsidies. It also shows that money, volume of <b>imports,</b> and weather <b>conditions</b> have a strong impact on price movements in the short term, whereas the exchange rate has none.

50|$|Problems were {{encountered}} {{opening the}} restaurant due to strict import laws at the time, which limited importing of overseas products {{that could be}} produced in New Zealand. The kitchen for the Porirua restaurant was <b>imported</b> on the <b>condition</b> that it was to allow local companies to reproduce it, and {{it was to be}} sent back after 12 months. However, the kitchen had been cemented into the floor and removing parts of it while still maintaining the restaurant operation meant it was impossible. The New Zealand affiliate eventually negotiated with the Corporation to import more kitchens in exchange for a large surplus of cheese the New Zealand Dairy Board (now Fonterra) had.|$|R
30|$|Less low {{growth rate}} has {{to possess the}} ratio of the volume of {{innovative}} products and imports which characterizes relative increase in outputs in comparison with import analogs. Strategy of import substitution is main for the territories urged to develop innovative type of production thus full refusal of <b>import</b> in the <b>conditions</b> of the global economy at the moment existing isn’t possible. It is caused both economic inexpediency in view of a scale effect, and possibility of imitating strategy’s realization of separate products (services) of foreign analogs as special type of development of the innovative companies. The growing markets at a sustainable development of TID will cause some growth of import’s volumes that will affect a value’s activity.|$|R
