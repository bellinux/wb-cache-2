40|$|Celecoxib, a {{selective}} COX- 2 inhibitor, exhibits poor water solubility, dissolution and flow properties. Thus, {{the aim of}} the present study was to improve the solubility and dissolution rate of celecoxib by preparing crystals by spray drying technique using pluronic F 127. Celecoxib crystals were produced by spray drying using TBA and water as co-solvent system to enhance solubility and dissolution rate. The prepared crystals were evaluated for solubility and in-vitro dissolution. The prepared formulations were characterized by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Dissolution profile of the prepared spray <b>dried</b> <b>crystals</b> was compared with recrystallized sample and pure sample. Spray <b>dried</b> <b>crystals</b> exhibited decreased crystallinity. The solubility and dissolution of the crystals were significantly improved compared with recrystallized sample and pure sample of celecoxib. The solubility of crystals was found to be three fold more than the pure celecoxib and dissolution of spray <b>dried</b> <b>crystals</b> showed 76 % release in 60 min while pure sample shows 35 % release in 60 min. Consequently, from the above result it can be concluded that spray <b>dried</b> <b>crystals</b> of celecoxib are a useful technique to improve the solubility and dissolution of poorly water soluble drug like celecoxib...|$|E

40|$|Pauling and Coryell's (1) {{measurements}} of the magnetic properties of hemoglobin and several of its derivatives have revealed that observations along these lines are capable of contributing {{a great deal to}} the elucidation of the chemical structure of such compounds.

Such a surprising result suggests extending this study to other heavy metal complexes of biological interest. It is the task of this paper to extend such measurements to catalase. Here, the task is very much more difficult than for hemoglobin. In addition to the difficulty of obtaining enough material, there is the risk of denaturation on thorough drying.

40|$|We have {{observed}} three-dimensional crystals of the calcium pump from sarcoplasmic reticulum by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). From AFM images of <b>dried</b> <b>crystals,</b> both on graphite and mica, we measured steps in the crystal thickness, corresponding to the unit cell spacing normal to the substrate. It is known from transmission electron microscopy that crystal periodicity in {{the plane of the}} substrate is destroyed by drying, and it was therefore not surprising that we were unable to observe this periodicity by AFM. Thus, we were motivated to use the AFM on hydrated crystals. In this case, crystal adsorption appeared to be a limiting factor, and our studies indicate that adsorption is controlled by the composition of the medium and by the physical-chemical properties of the substrate. We used scanning electron microscopy to determine the conditions yielding the highest adsorption of crystals, and, under these conditions, we have obtained AFM images of hydrated crystals with a resolution similar to that observed with dried samples (i. e., relatively poor). In the same preparations, we {{have observed}} lipid bilayers with a significantly better resolution, indicating that the poor quality of crystal images was not due to instrumental limitations. Rather, we attribute poor images to the intrinsic flexibility of these multilamellar crystals, which apparently allow movement of one layer relative to another in response to shear forces from the AFM tip. We therefore suggest some general guidelines for future studies of membrane proteins with AFM...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} of enterococci in various {{dried egg white}} products was surveyed, and some behaviors of enterococci, detected from the dried egg whites, in the manufacturing process of dried egg white were studied. From some of dried egg white samples, enterococci including Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis var. liquefaciens, and S. faecium were identified, but S. durans was not detected. These three spp. of enterococcus did not grow in yolk-free egg white, but grew well in egg white containing small quantities of egg yolk. These enterococci hardly decreased by the pasteurization in various conditions including Cunningham and Lineweaver's method. In the desugaring process by glucose oxidase method these enterococci perished, but in yeast or bacteria fermentation of yolk-free egg white, the counts of these enterococci hardly changed. Small counts of presumable enterococci perished in the spontaneous fermentation of yolk-free egg white, but increased rapidly in the fermentation of the egg white containing 0. 15 % yolk.

The product used for these purposes is a water-soluble salt of PQQ disodium. Although in the past, PQQ disodiumpentahydrates with a high water concentration were used, currently, low hydration crystals of PQQ disodiumpentahydrates are preferred. Results We prepared a crystal of PQQ disodium trihydrate in a solution of ethanol and water, studied its structure, and analyzed its properties. In the prepared crystal, the sodium atom interacted with the oxygen atom of two carboxylic acids {{as well as two}} quinones of the PQQ disodium trihydrate. In addition, the hydration water of the prepared crystal was less than that of the conventional PQQ disodium crystal. From the results of this study, {{it was found that the}} color and the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of the prepared crystal changed depending on the water content in the dried samples. Conclusions The water content in the dried samples was restored to that in the trihydrate crystal by placing the samples in a humid environment. In addition, the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray diffraction-differential calorimetry (XRD-DSC) analyses show that the phase of the trihydrate crystal changed when the crystallization water was eliminated.
