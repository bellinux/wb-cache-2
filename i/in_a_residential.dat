The road returns to the Carlstadt/East Rutherford border at Route 17 which it crosses over via an overpass, and is then designated as Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road for a distance.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Pekin, Route98 {{passes through}} {{farmland}} in unincorporated Groveland Township. The highway meets Cole Hollow Road and California Road at successive intersections <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> area. Past a creek, the road heads into {{a rural area}} with sections of farmland and forest. As it enters Groveland, the highway intersects County Route1, which runs south through the community. Route98 leaves Groveland to the east, running through another farmed area. The route curves into Morton and takes the name Birchwood Street, traversing a creek before entering an industrial district. In this area, Route98 briefly becomes a divided highway before terminating at exit 31 on I-155. The road continues past the terminus as a local street, still carrying the name Birchwood Street.|$|E
5|$|At 8:24a.m. MDT, Reid's {{aircraft}} {{began its}} takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence.

Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid, who was legally the pilot in command for all of Dubroff's flights, was allegedly manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} in both Los Angeles and Miami. The scenes filmed in Miami were shot in July 2006; those in Los Angeles were shot later. Scenes at the beach where Yelina talks with Rita and where her fiancé's body washes up were filmed at South Beach Park in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, north of Miami. A {{waterfront}} house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida stood in for the Castillos' home. The abandoned hospital where Dexter and the police find Tucci was filmed at the former Linda Vista Community Hospital in East Los Angeles, and Dexter's childhood home was filmed at a house <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> neighborhood of Long Beach, California, where Rita's house is also filmed. Scenes in the salvage yard were filmed at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California.

Keenor died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> nursing home on 19 October 1972 and his ashes were buried in Thornhill crematorium in Cardiff. His son Graham, who had joined Cardiff City as a youth player but never appeared for the first-team, served as club secretary between 1959, following the resignation of Trevor Morris, and 1972, resigning from the post just days after his fathers death.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs {{was living}} with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, {{at the time of}} the riot. He had spent time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> school in Reading, and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew. He was named shortly after the riot by two of those arrested, and was arrested himself five days later on {{suspicion}} of murder. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and a container of rocks, though he told them he had first arrived at the estate after midnight, two hours after Blakelock was killed. In the end he was charged with affray, and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison (the longest sentence handed out for affray during the riot, according to Rose), reduced on appeal to six years. Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry.|$|E

5|$|Marianne {{moved in}} with Pontecorvo at the Hôtel des Grands Hommes on the Place du Panthéon on 4 January 1938. Their son Gil was born on 30 July. Her visa expired, {{and she had to}} return to Sweden in September. Pontecorvo {{accompanied}} her, leaving Gil behind <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> nursery in Paris. Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with Manne Siegbahn and met with Niels Bohr and Lisa Meitner on 12 October 1938. Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the Fascist regime's racial laws against the Jews. This caused the breakup of the Via Panisperna boys, with Fermi moving to the United States. Pontecorvo's family also dispersed. Guido moved to Britain in 1938, followed by Giovanni, Laura and Anna in 1939, while Gillo joined Pontecorvo in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them {{that it would not}} be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to use it for. When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized in order to make it easier to restore later. Because it was located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E
5|$|The day of filming in the salvage yard, {{which took}} place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was {{abnormally}} hot according to Lauren Vélez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's victim is found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid—"all the things we needed it to be". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, and a house <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> neighborhood of Long Beach, California which stands in for Dexter's childhood home.|$|E

5|$|Although The Human Centipede {{is set in}} Germany, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes. Heiter's home, where most of The Human Centipede takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>residential</b> area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot. Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre, with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital. The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house. The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot {{on the last day of}} filming.|$|E
