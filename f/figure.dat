5|$|Other folklore, first {{recorded}} in the Victorian era, associates the <b>figure</b> with fertility.

5|$|Overall, {{levels of}} {{academic}} achievement in Felling are low. Only 59% of adults have 5 or more GCSEs at grade A* – C.

5|$|Overclaiming of aerial {{victories}} was not uncommon, {{and both}} sides claimed more aircraft shot down than was the case. For the 18 August action, British propaganda claimed 144 German aircraft destroyed, which was over twice the actual <b>figure.</b> In response, the Germans claimed they had only lost 36, a <b>figure</b> which has since been proven to be half the actual <b>figure</b> (69 to 71). The German propaganda elements claimed to have destroyed 147 British aircraft, which was over twice the actual <b>figure.</b> Again, the British admitted to losing only 23, when the actual <b>figure</b> was around 68. Other sources between them insist the RAF's losses were 27–34 fighters destroyed, and 29 aircraft destroyed on the ground, including only eight fighters.|$|E

5|$|Storhamar Ishall is {{the regular}} {{training}} venue for Storhamar IL's <b>figure</b> skating group. Between them, the two venues have hosted the Norwegian <b>Figure</b> Skating Championships three times: Storhamar Ishall in 1983, and the Olympic Amphitheatre in 2005 and 2011. In October 1993, the Olympic Amphitheatre hosted Piruetten 1993, a pre-Olympic <b>figure</b> skating event. Although featuring {{stars such as}} Nancy Kerrigan, it only attracted 150 spectators.

5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the <b>figure</b> stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The <b>figure</b> looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked <b>figure</b> stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the central}} <b>figure</b> shines a single small star {{at the very}} top of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of the central <b>figure</b> herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central <b>figure,</b> and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{service members}} {{returned}} to the area, spurring an enormous population explosion which dwarfed the 1920s boom.

5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human <b>figure</b> portrayed in profile, facing left. The <b>figure</b> is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile <b>figure</b> is depicted facing the first <b>figure,</b> separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central <b>figure</b> is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the <b>figure</b> is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

The female <b>figure</b> shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in <b>figure</b> 11. Bridging across a single resonator (<b>figure</b> 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (<b>figure</b> 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (<b>figure</b> 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E
