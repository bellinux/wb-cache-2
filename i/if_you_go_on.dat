25|$|To my {{knowledge}} {{there is only}} one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out â€“ Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide. I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it came out that he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E
60|$|Be {{off with}} you, Christina. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> finding out {{things that are}} not your {{business}} I shall have you deported.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of your saying that, mamma? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like that I'll {{separate}} myself from you and throw myself on papa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't write as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> hearsay evidence. Speak of proofs--irrefragable proofs--and {{then you}} convict him at once, without power of eluding you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, you {{eat breakfast}} for me; I'm hungry," [...] the Squire said. [...] "Sit down! You couldn't get Abel away now, not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> an hour. Don't {{separate}} families!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{might take}} you {{a week or}} two <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> foot through the mud," [...] {{answered}} the second man. And then he continued: [...] "I suppose you came from a distance, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mrs. Grossmith, Worley Farm, near Union.' That's {{about two}} miles along the road. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> anyone will tell you which is Mrs. Grossmith's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Uncle Sol,' said Walter, 'I don't think you're well. You haven't eaten any breakfast. I shall bring {{a doctor}} to you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you be quiet, Robin?" [...] said I, rather sternly; [...] "how can I {{get over}} this very {{difficult}} matter <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> interrupting me so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; not bound; but {{you would}} have to show, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> with the action, that the damage complained of was of so grievous a nature that the apology would not salve it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even seamen {{are divided}} into seamen gunners, {{apprentices}} and the like, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> as a mere boy you might not see me once a week, unless we happened to be off duty at the same time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now see here, Rose Dutcher, do {{you want}} to break my heart into smithereens? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> lunching with Owen Taylor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've been {{laughing}} again, father," [...] she said. [...] "I see by the purpleness of your face. You'll burst {{yourself at}} last <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> so." ...|$|E
60|$|HE. Halloo! got out o' bed {{the wrong}} side again? I say, Jane, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like that you'll never get a man to marry you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} are--any way, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> as you're doing. You see what I {{consider}} it prudent {{to write off}} {{the value of your}} property?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As I don't mean to ask you, and {{you might}} {{possibly}} do it without being invited <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> much further,' said Mr Chester with great composure, we will stop, <b>if</b> agreeable to <b>you,</b> my good friend, at the next glass. You were drinking before you came here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can steer," [...] he said sternly to Disco. [...] "Come, {{take the}} helm an' {{go to your}} ship; or, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> choose, <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the breakers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back <b>on</b> the job--then it 'll be {{all right}} for you to run in heah to see me once in a while. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> throw up this chance I'll--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll shove {{you into}} the sea <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> talking balderdash," [...] said Bob. [...] "Now, look here, you hain't got nothin' to do, have you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{shall have}} you a perfect Niobe, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> at this rate, Cherry. Really, {{we must not}} have these lessons, if they excite you so much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something will go worse {{wrong with}} it, chief, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like that. I thought {{the last one}} must have split it. Well, what know you about Cormac?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> drawing <b>on</b> down or cliff [...] Let no soft curves intrude [...] Of a woman's silhouette, But {{show the}} escarpments stark and stiff [...] As in utter solitude; [...] So shall you half forget.|$|R
6000|$|Two mornings later {{one of the}} coast-guard came in. [...] "Captain Downes will be glad, sir, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> board; {{there is}} {{something}} particular {{that he wants to}} speak to you about." ...|$|R
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. Money {{gave you}} the choice of {{engaging}} in an occupation in which you could take an interest and a pride, and enabled <b>you</b> occasionally to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a spree, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>went</b> <b>on</b> a spree, George.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will be {{most welcome}} there, I am sure, Mr. Burns. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> {{improving}} at this rate you'll be presently one of the healthiest men in the ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{be careful}} of you, Master Holliday," [...] the countess said; [...] "for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like this you will much {{diminish}} {{the number of the}} queen's subjects." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Grampus, you'll kill me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like that," [...] said he; [...] "I can't stand it. Indeed I can't. Sich a face! D'ye {{know what}} it's like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had"--he <b>went</b> <b>on</b> more hesitatingly, glancing {{down at his}} travel-torn and frayed garments--"anything like a coat, or {{any other}} clothing? It would {{disguise}} me also, you see, and put 'em off the track." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] the Egyptian said. [...] "The {{winds are}} so {{uncertain}} on these seas that, {{as far as}} time <b>goes,</b> <b>you</b> might journey by the route you propose and reach Egypt more speedily than <b>you</b> would do <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> board a ship at once. The danger lies almost entirely in the first portion of your journey. The caravans that go hence {{once or twice a}} year through Moab to Palmyra are numerous and well armed, and capable of resisting an attack by these robber tribesmen. But one left a few weeks ago, and it may be some months before another starts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he resumed, [...] "I cheated you, because I {{could see}} no other plan. I think you have waited too long. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> {{thinking}} about nothing but the lode, it would have done you harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear wife,' {{said the}} man at last, 'you really must eat something. What {{in the world is}} the matter with you? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like this you will die.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> {{with the}} beer, {{you may go}} on with curing yourself. I shan't attend you. You know I mean what I say, Mrs. Larrick"--this to the wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] {{said the}} accountant; [...] "`faint heart,' etcetera, you know. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> as you've begun, you'll be chosen {{to head the}} next {{expedition}} to the north pole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{am sorry}} you are going, very sorry, Charlie; but, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{altogether}} <b>on</b> to the staff, I shall see {{a good deal}} of you, for, as the king is always with the army, this must be your headquarters still.|$|R
