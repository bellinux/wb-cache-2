40|$|Abstract: The {{geometry}} {{and evolution of}} normal fault terminations were studied in Tithonian limestones exposed on a vertical cliff in the French SE-Basin. The rocks consist of mainly lime-stone layers alternated with thin clayey interlayers. All studied fault zones die out vertically into bed-perpendicular veins striking approximately parallel to the fault. Displacement decreasing to zero towards the fault tip is accommodated horizontally by bed-parallel opening of calcite veins, and vertically by bed-perpendicular localized compaction. The latter mechanism leads the clayey interlayers to be thinned and in places completely pushed out, and enhances pressure solution in bed-parallel seams. The respective thicknesses of the limestone layers and clayey inter-layers, and the ratio between local <b>displacement</b> <b>amount</b> and bed thickness influence the geome-tries of the fault termination and of the steps between slip surfaces. Relatively thick clayey interlayers localize low-angle slip surfaces and may impede the vertical propagation of the slip surface. Vertical fault restriction is also related to thick limestone layers, which are deflected and affected by outer arc extensional fractures, localized pressure solution and dilational jogs con-necting adjacent propagating slip surfaces. However, beds keep their continuity if thicker than the local <b>displacement</b> <b>amount.</b> Where the local displacement {{is larger than the}} layer thickness, lime...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} characterized {{a system}} of small faults (displacement < 0. 3 m) in seven closely-spaced continuous 2. 4 inch (6. 1 cm) diameter cores. Cores were obtained from central Texas, on {{the western edge of}} the Llano Uplift. Cores penetrate a dip-slip dominant, normal fault (Nobles Fault) with 18. 3 m (60 ft) of stratigraphic throw. The spatial, geometric and kinematic attributes of small faults within the Nobles Fault system were characterized to explore potential cause-and-effect relationships. To quantify spatial distributions, a "density" measure based on individual small fault magnitude was utilized. Approximately half of the small faults in the core possessed no discernible offset markers; thus <b>displacement</b> <b>amount</b> for these faults could not be measured directly. Using a nonparametric method in which an alternating conditional expectation determined optimal transformations for the data, a statistically significant empirical correlation was established for faults with measurable gouge thickness, displacement, protolith mean grain size and sorting. Gouge thickness of small faults was found to be dependant upon the <b>displacement</b> <b>amount</b> of the small fault and the textural characteristics of the host protolith. The role of protolith lithology, proximity to crystalline basement, and structural position relative to the Nobles Fault system were examined to explain observed ubiquitous spatial distribution of small faults. Small faults were found to occur in clusters and the number of faults per foot only weakly correlates to the cumulative displacement of the corresponding faults. The amount of mudstone present is the dominant factor controlling small fault formation. Intervals with only minor quantities of mudstone have the largest number of faults per foot as well as largest associated cumulative displacement per foot. Frequency of occurrence of small faults near the basement is greater when compared to similar lithologies higher in the core. Intensity of small faults do not universally increase with proximity to large faults. To observe an increase in small faults, it is necessary to use a mean global cumulative displacement approach. Zones of greater than average cumulative displacement of small faults in close proximity to large faults were observed in zones that are compatible with faultfault interaction...|$|E

40|$|The Daqingshan Piedmont Fault (DPF) {{is one of}} {{the major}} active normal faults in the Hetao {{depression}} zone in the northern part of Ordos Block, North China. It extends in NEE direction along the Daqingshan piedmont zone in the eastern part of the depression, dipping to the south, for a length of 223 km. The fault formed in the Eocene and underwent strong movement during the Cenozoic time. Its vertical displacement amplitude has exceeded 2400 m since the Quaternary. The fault can be divided into 5 active segments. Paleoseismological studies were concentrated on its western part from Baotou to Tumdzuoqi whereas the Hohhot Segment to the east was scarcely studied. To fill this gap of knowlegde, the authors carried out in-depth study on the Daqingshan piedmont fault during recent years. Excavation of trenches at Kuisu, Ulanblang, and Bakouzi sites on the Hohhot Segment of the Daqingshan piedmont fault and study of geomorphic surfaces allow us to identify and date paleoearthquakes and to evaluate the completeness of paleoseismic activity history. This was done both for the individual sites and for the entire segment since the Late Quaternary using the «method for displacement confining» along the fault and «method for correlation between multiple trenches». In this paper we present the geological loggings of two trenches at Kuisu site, provide the evidence for 6 events since 19 ka BP and the cumulative <b>displacement</b> <b>amount</b> produced by them is around 7 m. But the cumulative <b>displacement</b> <b>amount</b> obtained from difference in heights of geomorphic surfaces is 5. ??. 5. 5 m. Results of tests using the method of displacement confining show that the event sequence revealed at this site can be considered complete.

Several well-exposed examples confirm the difficulty in the task of predicting fault permeability. The development of fault deformation zones and fault cores, including fault gauge and cataclastic bands, {{is a function of}} several variables, including rock rheology, stress and strength conditions along the fault surface, fluid pressures, and the fault kinematics. Once you know the appropriate boundary conditions, analytical equations allow to compute an index of fault gauge formation at any point, as well as the geometry and type of expected (brittle) deformations.

40|$|The Bok Bak {{fault is}} a {{northwest}}-directed sinistral fault in northwest Peninsular Malaysia whose location was, by late 1980 's, quite established. A postulated extension of 450 kilometres to the north-northwest {{has never been}} substantiated, but instead, speculated upon. The postulated extension in north Kedah, if there was any, had escaped detection of several mapping exercises, including modern approaches. The weak topography of the area and thick unconsolidated superficial deposits, apparently, are responsible for clouding the sensitivities of the modern methods. However, the conventional approach adopted in this study led to a successful discovery and definition of 82 kilometres of the Bok Bak fault in north Kedah and Perlis up to the Perlis (Malaysia) /Thailand boundary. It is in a dextral six-kilometre offset position with the established counterpart to its south.

Other fault-signatures include, fault planes and breccia, a sharp formational boundary, a spring locality, a lake, two linear rivers, a distorted river's course and a bent watershed line.

We also determined the effect of marker registration on the measured SV displacement and its impact on margin design. SV displacement was determined relative to marker registration by using 296 cone beam computed tomography scans of 13 prostate cancer patients with implanted markers. SV were individually registered in the transverse plane, based on gray-value information. The target registration error (TRE) for the SV due to marker registration inaccuracies was estimated. Correlations between prostate gland rotations and SV displacement and between individual SV displacements were determined. The SV registration success rate was 99 %. <b>Displacement</b> <b>amounts</b> of both SVs were comparable. Systematic and random residual SV displacements were 1. 6 mm and 2. 0 mm in the left-right direction, respectively, and 2. 8 mm and 3. 1 mm in the anteroposterior (AP) direction, respectively. Rotation correction did not reduce residual SV displacement. Prostate gland rotation around the left-right axis correlated with SV AP displacement (R(2) = 42 %); a correlation existed between both SVs for AP displacement (R(2) = 62 %); considerable correlation existed between random errors of SV displacement and TRE (R(2) = 34 %). Considerable residual SV displacement exists in marker-based IGRT. Rotation correction barely reduced SV displacement, rather, a larger SV displacement was shown relative to the prostate gland that was not captured by the marker position. Marker registration error partly explains SV displacement when correcting for rotations. Correcting for rotations, therefore, is not advisable when SV are part of the target volume.

This thesis examines one of these faults, the McMillan Fault, and the secondary faults in its hanging wall at a large scale, in order to assess the nature of normal faults in the Mason area. The McMillan Ranch in Mason, Texas, was mapped at a scale of 1 : 7, 000 using both traditional and digital mapping methods, to determine the lengths and displacements of each fault, and attempt to determine a length/displacement ratio which can be applied to all normal faults in this area. A single length/displacement ratio was not determined, just as in previous studies. This study determined that the normal faults in the area are planar, high angle normal faults with varying <b>displacement</b> <b>amounts.</b> As a result, observations determined that deformation in the hanging wall of normal faults exceeded the deformation in the footwalls of the same faults. The main fault on the McMillan Ranch is the McMillan Fault, and its shape is determined based upon the orientation of the subsidiary normal faults in its hanging wall. A detailed study of the geology of the McMillan Ranch and {{the surrounding}} area, including a geologic history of the area, geologic map and cross section, and stratigraphic descriptions including bed-by-bed descriptions, stratigraphic column, and thin sections of each unit was carried out as a preliminary step to perform analyses of the faults on the ranch. The presence of the McMillan Fault was already known, and the pasture that was chosen for this study was best represented at a scale of 1 : 7, 000. At such a large scale, it was necessary to recognize precisely where in the stratigraphic section the mapper was located, as some subsidiary faults were recognized by beds missing, rather than entire units. The structural data gathered from the field convey the varying natures of faults, even within the same area, and support the conclusion that length alone is not sufficient to predict displacement value on a fault...|$|R

The structure is modeled using nonlinear finite elements employing a bilinear hysteretic model. So that elements are used so that yielding of the structures could be accurately modeled and captured. The frame is analyzed using a non-linear, elastic-plastic finite element program written in code MATLAB. Six tendon architectures were investigated. A single tendon was placed between different floors and its effects investigated. From the obtained results, the ideal case which causes {{a reduction in the}} maximum <b>displacement</b> and the <b>amount</b> of permanent deflection without increase in the maximum structural shear forces greatly is obtained. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{topology}} preservation in three-dimensional (3 -D) deformable image registration. This {{work is a}} nontrivial extension of [34], which addresses the case of two-dimensional (2 -D) topology preserving mappings. In both cases, the deformation map is modeled as a hierarchical dis-placement field, decomposed on a multiresolution B-spline basis. Topology preservation is enforced by controlling the Jacobian of the transformation. Finding the optimal <b>displacement</b> parameters <b>amounts</b> to solving a constrained optimization problem: The residual energy between the target image and the deformed source image is minimized under constraints on the Jacobian. Unlike the 2 -D case, in which simple linear constraints are derived, the 3 -D B-spline-based deformable mapping yields a difficult (until now, unsolved) optimization problem. In this paper, we tackle the problem by resorting to interval analysis optimization techniques. Care is taken to keep the computational burden as low as possible. Results on multipatient 3 -D MRI registration illustrate {{the ability of the}} method to preserve topology on the continuous image domain.

40|$|Two major degradations, edge {{displacement}} and corner erosion, {{change the}} appearance of bilevel images. The displacement of an edge determines stroke width, and the erosion ofa corner affects crispness. These degradations are functions of the system parameters: the point spread function (PSF) width and functional form, and the binarization threshold. Changing each of these parameters will affect an image differently. A given <b>amount</b> of edge <b>displacement</b> or <b>amount</b> of erosion of black or white corners {{can be caused by}} several combinations of the PSF width and the binarization threshold. Any pair of these degradations are unique to a single PSF width and binarization threshold for a given PSF function. Knowledge of all three degradation amounts provides information that will enable us to determine the PSF functional form from the bilevel image. The effect of each degradation on characters will be shown. Also, the uniqueness of the degradation triple dw 3 ̆e db, δc and the effect of selecting an incorrect PSF functional form will be shown, first with relation to PSF width and binarization threshold estimate, then for how this is visible in sample characters...|$|R
