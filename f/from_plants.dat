5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them <b>from</b> <b>plants</b> and algae. They are also distinguished <b>from</b> <b>plants,</b> algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines are derived <b>from</b> <b>plants,</b> both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified <b>from</b> <b>plants</b> or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised {{for use in}} modern medicine. Modern medicines derived <b>from</b> <b>plants</b> include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{grown as}} {{industrial}} crops {{are the source}} {{of a wide range of}} products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived <b>from</b> <b>plants</b> include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels <b>from</b> <b>plants</b> include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E
30|$|The {{last two}} columns of Table 1 show the {{consequences}} of the Lorenz curve assumption for the regional roundwood production <b>from</b> <b>planted</b> forests. Overall, 32 % of world roundwood production in 2009 was derived <b>from</b> <b>planted</b> forests. In EU- 27 countries, the proportion reached 52 % whereas it was only 15 % in South America. Worldwide roundwood production <b>from</b> <b>planted</b> forests computed <b>from</b> these data was estimated to be approximately 1 billion m 3. Of this, Asia contributed 459 million m 3 and Europe (including the Russian Federation) 266 million m 3.|$|R
40|$|The field {{experiments}} were conducted during 2004 and 2005 seasons {{to study the}} effect of three first post planting irrigation times and ten fertilization treatments on growth, yield, yield components and fiber traits in cotton. The times of first post planting irrigation in a separate experiment were 20, 30 and 40 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> irrigation time in both seasons 2004 and 2005. A completely randomized block design with four replicate was used for each time of first irrigation. Each experiment of the first irrigation included ten of fertilizers treatments. Application the first irrigation after 40 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> resulted in the highest values of all growth characters. However, application of the first irrigation after 30 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> gave the highest values of all yield and yield components, except boll weight which recorded highest values with application the first irrigation after 20 days <b>from</b> <b>planting.</b> On the other hand, the lowest values of all growth, yield and yield components were recorded by application of the first irrigation after 20 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> in the two seasons, except boll weight which recorded the lowest values with application the first irrigation after 30 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> in the two seasons. Application the first irrigation after 40 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> gave the highest values of fiber strength and fiber length uniformity ratio (%). On the other hand, the lowest values of fiber strength and fiber uniformity ratio (%) were recorded by application the first irrigation after 20 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> over the two seasons. Maximum means of all studied characters were produced <b>from</b> fertilizing cotton <b>plants</b> with organic fertilizer + bio-fertilizer + 66 % from recommended NPK in both seasons. On the contrary, the lowest values were obtained from plots received Bio-fertilizer alone, except fiber quality which the lowest values were obtained from plots received organic fertilizer alone. It can be concluded that applying first irrigation after 30 days <b>from</b> <b>planting</b> date and applying to soil bio-fertilizer (EM) at rate 5 L/fed., organic-fertilizer at rate 20 kg N/fed., in addition to application of 2 / 3 NPK from recommended may be maximize the productivity of cotton...|$|R

These include various synthetic chemicals, such as insecticides and fertilizers, {{as well as}} a variety of naturally occurring chemicals <b>from</b> <b>plants,</b> such as ethanol resulting from the fermentation of organic materials. Bee intoxication can result from exposure to ethanol from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and manmade and natural chemicals in the environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} alcohol on bees are {{sufficiently}} {{similar to the}} effects of alcohol on humans that honey bees have been used as models of human ethanol intoxication. However, the metabolism of bees and humans is sufficiently different that bees can safely collect nectars <b>from</b> <b>plants</b> that contain compounds toxic to humans. The honey produced by bees from these toxic nectars can be poisonous if consumed by humans. Many humans have eaten toxic honey and become seriously ill as a result.|$|E

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture <b>from</b> <b>plants.</b> As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are eurychoric; {{they have}} a {{widespread}} geographic distribution in many different climates, but they are usually found in dry and mesic habitats. They {{are referred to as}} a tropical genus, but the type specimen was collected from temperate Sydney. They are found in sclerophyll woodland and forests, eucalypt woodland, Casuarina forests, mallee, hillsides, beaches and urban areas. These ants are arboreal ants and nests are located in bark, logs, rotten wood, sand, soil, under rocks and stones, tree stumps and twigs or branches. In urban areas, colonies are found under cracked paths, inside house walls or in patio areas. Some species are considered pests, and they forage into pastures and houses where they show a preference for fluids and sweets. Ochetellus flavipes nesting habits are unique among Australian ants, and they construct small runways across the ground. These nests are structurally similar to nests built by some Polyrhachis ants, which construct platforms woven <b>from</b> <b>plants</b> that house the Hemiptera insects they attend to.|$|E
