40|$|The data {{obtained}} mainly by pulsed NMR spectroscopy on phosphorus nuclei on {{the mechanism of}} the internucleotide phosphodiester (PDE) group formation are summarised. With arylsulphonyl chloride as condensing reagent monomeric nucleotide derivative B (nucleoside metaphosphate or its pyridinium adduct) is the highly reactive intermediate. In the presence of PDE groups in nucleoside or nucleotide component the significantly less reactive derivatives with trisubstituted pyrophosphoryl residues are formed both with arylsulphonyl chloride and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). The reactive B form of nucleotide component may be obtained using greater excess of arylsulphonyl chloride with simultaneous convertion of PDE groups to tetrasubstituted pyrophosphates amenable to side reactions. The convertion of PDE groups to easily hydrolysable <b>dicyclohexylurea</b> derivatives by reaction with DCC is proposed to reversible blocking of PDE groups of nucleoside component.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the polymerization of N-acryl-N,N'-dicyclohexylurea (A-DCU), N-methacryl- N,N'-dicyclohexylurea (MA-DCU) and N-methacryl-N,N'-diisopropylurea (MA-DiPrU) monomers with styrene (St) and α-methylstyrene (α-MeSt), thermal stability and degradation mechanism of prepared copolymers. Free-radical initiated polymerization {{was performed to}} low conversion by using dibenzoyl peroxyde (Bz 2 O 2) in butanone at 70 °C under nitrogen stream. It {{was found that the}} pendant group in (meth) acrylic monomers have high influence to the polymerization {{as well as to the}} copolymer properties. A-DCU readily homopolymerized and copolymerized with St and r 1,A-DCU = 0. 72 and r 2,α-MeSt = 0. 07, while MA-DCU does not homopolymerized or copolymerized with α-MeSt under the same conditions, but copolymerized with St to randomly composed copolymers after a long heating of comonomers. Copolymers A-DCU with α-MeSt prepared under different monomer-to monomer-ratios in the feed have random composition with an azeotropic point at ratio of 0. 75 (A-DCU) to 0. 25 (St). The initial rate of copolymerization indicates that the rate increases almost linearly with the increase of ratio of A-DCU in the comonomer feed. Reactivity ratios determined by the Kelen-Tüdös method are: r 1,A-DCU = 0. 72 and r 2,α-MeSt = 0. 07. Molar mass of copolymers increased from 8. 5 to 30 (kg mol - 1) when mole ratio of A-DCU to α-MeStin the feed increased from 0. 1 to 0. 9. Poly(A-DCU) and copolymers with α-MeSt decomposed by two-step mechanism. Under TGA (nitrogen, 10 °C min - 1) conditions in the first step between 180 °C and 250 °C a quantitative yield of cyclohexylisocyanate (C 6 H 11 NCO) separated by a decomposition of <b>dicyclohexylurea</b> (DCU). The thermally stable residue represented poly(acryl-cyclohexylamide), poly(A-CHA), and copolymer with α-MeSt, poly(A-CHA-co-α-MeSt). Glass transition temperature (T g) of poly(A-DCU) was at 184 °C and T g of residue, poly(A-CHA), was at 161 °C. T g 's of the copolymers are higher for the copolymer with higher A-DCU content. T g 's of residue are increased also when the content of A-CHA in copolymer increased. Copolymers of A-DCU with St have a random composition with an azeotropic point at a ratio of 0. 73 (A-DCU) to 0. 27 (St). The rate of copolymerization of A-DCU with St increases by the increase of A-DCU in the feed. The reactivity ratio are: r 1,A-DCU = 0. 80 and r 2, St = 0. 50. Molar mass of copolymer, prepared at equimolar ratio of monomers in the feed, is Mw = 78. 6 kg/mol - 1. These copolymers decompose in TGA conditions by two-step mechanism, which correspond to the mechanism explained for the copolymers of A-DCU with α-MeSt. MA-DCU copolymerized with St to randomly composed copolymers. The reactivity ratio determined by the KT method are: r 1, MA-DCU = 0. 18 and r 2, St = 4. 84. These values indicate that MA-DCU favors cross-propagation over homopolymerization, while St favors homopolymerization as opposite to cross-propagation. It also shows, that since St is more reactive than MA-DCU, copolymers contain a higher proportion of St units. It was found, that the rate of copolymerization of MA-DCU with St is slower than the rate of copolymerization of A-DCU with St, and that the rate of copolymerization decreases by increasing the amount of MA-DCU in the feed. Molar mass of copolymer prepared at equimolar ratios of comonomers in the feed is Mw= 12 kg mol - 1. Thermal properties of poly(MA-DCU-co-St) are similar to those previously described in the decomposition of poly[A-DCU-co-St(α-MeSt) ]. The results have also shown quite a big influence of DiPrU group in MA-iPrU to the polymerization with St and α -MeSt. Namely, MA-DiPrU does not homopolymerized or copolymerized with α -MeSt, but can polymerize with St only after a long heating of comonomers at 70 °C. The copolymerization of MA-DiPrU with St is a statistical reaction in which regardless of monomer-tomonomer ratios in the feed, an excess of St was in the copolymer. The reactivity ratios (KT method) are: r 1, MA-DiPrU = 0. 39 and r 2, St = 1. 03. The obtained data indicate a monomer tendency to alternating structure. The initial rate of copolymerization decreases with increasing the content of MA-DiPrU monomer in the feed. Molar mass of all copolymers are approximately of the same values, Mw = 12 - 8 kg mol - 1 and Mn = 8. 7 - 6. 2 kg mol - 1. Thermal behavior of those copolymers correspond to the behavior of acrylic and methacrylic polymers containing DCU as pendant group. Namely, all copolymers decompose under TGA conditions by a two-step mechanism. In the first step between 180 °C and 250 °C isopropylisocyanate (C 3 H 7 NCO) separates by degradation of diisopropylurea (DiPrU) in the side chain. The thermally stable residue represents the copolymer of methacryl-isopropylamide with St, which decompose by one-step mechanism between 280 °C and 450 °C...|$|E

Polimerizacija je provedena s dibenzoil-peroksidom (Bz 2 O 2) u butanonu ili dioksanu pri 70 °C, do niske konverzije.

Rezultati istraživanja pokazuju da uvođenje diizopropiluree umjesto dicikloheksiluree u metakrilatnom monomeru također utječe na početnu brzinu polimerizacije. Naime, N-(met) akril-N,N [...] diizopropilurea (MA-DiPrU) ne homopolimerizira niti kopolimerizira s α-MeSt-om. Polimerizacija sa St-om je sporija u usporedbi s odgovarajućim monomerom koji sadrži DCU. Kopolimerizacija je statistička reakcija u kojoj je, neovisno o sastavu smjese komonomera, uvijek veći udjel St-a u kopolimeru. Toplinsko ponašanje svih polimera u osnovi je slično. Zagrijavanjem pri temperaturama od 100 °C - 450 °C razgrađuju se dvostupnjevitim mehanizmom. U prvom stupnju pri temperaturama od 180 °C - 250 °C dolazi do izdvajanja cikloheksilizocijanata (C 6 H 11 NCO), odnosno izopropilizocijanata (C 3 H 7 NCO).
