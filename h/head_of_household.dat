5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous seasons. HouseGuests were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests took part in several compulsory challenges that determined who would win food, luxuries and power in the House. The winner of the <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> competition was immune from nominations and was instructed to nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest became <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> he or she was ineligible {{to take part in the}} next <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the Power of Veto {{competition}} {{won the right to}} save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction. If the Veto winner exercised the power, the <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> then had to nominate another HouseGuest for eviction.|$|E

A sample of 30 single female <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> was conducted in studying the relationship. The major finding in the study concludes that there is a significant impact of the cost and availability of child care on the employment activity <b>of</b> single female <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>household.</b> The study also concludes that the health of a family member also impacts the employment activity <b>of</b> single female <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>household...</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, in the US, {{the federal}} government, through Title IV of the Older Americans Act, recognizes NORCs as {{communities}} in which at least 40 percent <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> are older individuals. The State of Indiana defines a NORC as a community in which 50 percent of housing units have <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> who are 60 years old or older, and/or at least 2,500 <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> who are 60 years old or older. By contrast, New York City requires that a community must have at least 45 percent of housing units with <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> 60 years old or older with a minimum count of at least 250 seniors, or that there be at least 500 older adults who are 60 years old or older (regardless {{of the percentage of}} housing units).|$|R

5|$|As of 2010, {{there were}} 74,786 {{occupied}} households, while 19.7% were vacant. 17.7% had {{children under the}} age of 18 living with them, 30.4% were married couples living together, 12.3% have a female <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> with no husband present, and 52.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older (4.8% male and 6.3% female.) The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 3.00.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land, {{construed}} as a tax on its produce or productive capacity. Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile. Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> {{to appear before the}} presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.|$|E
5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions. Depending {{on the local}} custom, Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E

(2008), while {{the program was}} intended for unemployed <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>household,</b> in practice these requirements were not fulfilled: administrators did not ensure that applicants were really <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> and nor that only the unemployed were admitted in the program.|$|R
50|$|Families, {{prior to}} and during the Meiji restoration, relied on a patriarchal lineage of succession, with disobedience to the male <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the <b>household</b> {{punishable}} by expulsion from the family unit. Male <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> with only daughters would adopt male heirs to succeed them, sometimes through arranged marriage to a daughter. <b>Heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> were responsible for house finances, but could delegate to another family member or retainer (employee). Women in these households were typically subject to arranged marriages at the behest <b>of</b> the <b>household's</b> patriarch. Married women marked themselves by blackening their teeth and shaving their eyebrows.|$|R

5|$|Big Brother 11 was {{broadcast}} on CBS from July 9, 2009 to September 15, 2009. This season lasted {{a total of}} 73 days, making it the third shortest season of the series to date. This season featured no changes to the schedule {{that was used in}} the previous edition, with episodes airing on Tuesdays, Thursday, and Sunday each week. The Thursday episode, which aired at 9 PM Eastern time, featured the live eviction and subsequent <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> competition taking place. During the live eviction, the show was hosted by Julie Chen. The Sunday episode, which aired at 8 PM Eastern time, featured the food competition and nomination ceremony, as well as some highlights from the previous days. The Tuesday episode featured the Power of Veto competition and the Power of Veto ceremony, along with more highlights of recent events in the game. Some changes to the scheduling format were made. Chima's expulsion from the game, for example, led to various changes in the formatting of the television broadcasts, and led to the cancellation of the upcoming Double Eviction week. The series {{was broadcast}} on Global Television Network in Canada. For {{the first time in the}} history of the show, Big Brother had a two-hour live season finale, which aired on September 15, an increase from the usual hour.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (<b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>household)</b> met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E
30|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>household</b> <b>head</b> characteristics, the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> that attrited {{were more}} likely to be divorced, less likely to be {{illiterate}} or read & write, and more likely to be secondary or university educated. The <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> that attrited {{were more likely}} than the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> those that did not attrite to be engaged in formal or informal private regular wage work, but less likely to be engaged in informal temporary work or to be a household enterprise worker.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the source of health care funding for <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> related to the management of severe malaria in children admitted to a Kinshasa reference hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1, 350 hospitalised children under the age of 15 years treated for severe malaria in Kinshasa reference hospitals from January to November 2011 and the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> <b>of</b> these children. Results: Only 46 % <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> reported having sufficient funds directly available in the household budget. The remaining 54 % had to call upon external sources of funding (sale of assets, loans, pawning goods). The use of a loan tended to increase significantly mainly for households with a low (adjusted odds ratio = 6. 2), and intermediate socioeconomic status (adjusted odds ratio = 3. 8) and for households working in the informal sector (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 5). Similarly, the sale of assets was more frequently reported for households working in the informal sector (adjusted odds ratio = 2. 4)) and for female <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> (adjusted odds ratio = 3. 9). Conclusion: The management of severe malaria is a burden on household income. The majority <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> concerned needs to use external funding sources. A State subsidy for this management would help to reduce the risk of debt and sale of assets, especially for the poorest households. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Industrial Psychology. Africa Centre for HIV/AIDS Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The {{study was}} about {{assessing}} the dropout rate {{of children who}} are <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> at Mandela Village in Tshwane Municipality, Gauteng Province. Given the number of orphans who are escalating in each year as a result of HIV/AIDS pandemic especially in the Sub Saharan region, the author’s intention was to analyse what are the causes for these children to drop out from school, {{and what can be done}} to minimize the dropout rate of these children. All the participants were the children who are <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> and residents <b>of</b> Mandela Village, East of Mamelodi Township, and Pretoria. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with thirty-one children who are <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households,</b> as well as with two educators in schools where these children are attending school or were attending school. This was followed by two focus groups with the same children. The intention of using the focus group was to investigate the issues raised during the interviews and to establish an understanding of how the children who are <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> want to improve their own circumstances. The study findings observed that there were no strong linkages in assisting children who are <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>households</b> between the Department of Social Development and Department of Education in the North Rand Region, Gauteng. Other findings were that the schools have no support programmes or teachers assigned to assist these children to cope with schoolwork.
