Hops (Humulus lupulus sp) {{contain a}} wide range of {{compounds}} with different properties and activities, among them are the prenylated flavonoids such as the Xanthohumol (XN) and Isoxanthohumol (IXN). In aqueous medium XN it’s isomerized to IXN, who produce 8 -prenilnaringenin (8 PN) by the action of gut microbiota. It’s raising the interest in 8 PN by its functional properties: potential estrogen only about 1000 times less than estradiol with ability to bind to both receptors, ERα and ERβ (Zanoli and Zavati, 2008). The first step to get 8 PN is by isolation of its precursor: IXN (or XN in either case). Hop pellets (normally used for animal feed) were used for the extraction by two methods: -Solid-liquid extraction to determine the initial amount of both compounds: cryogenically crushed hops mixed with DMSO, and left in agitation and darkness 24 hours. It is filtered and the cake obtained again underwent the same process. This was repeated until no XN nor IXN were detected in the filtrate. -Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE) <b>hop</b> <b>powder</b> mixed with sea sand (1 : 2 ratio) were extracted using following conditions: water at 150 º C (6 cycles of 5 minutes), ethanol at 150 ° C (6 cycles of 5 minutes), sequential extraction (hexane followed by ethanol and finally water; 20 minutes each fraction). All samples were evaporated and/or freeze dried. In order to have an idea of the amount of total phenols extract, Folin-Ciocalteu method was used, as described by Kosar et al (2004). Extracts obtained by both methods was analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS (triple quadrupole). Multiple reactions monitoring analysis was carried out for quantification. In this sense, direct infusion of standards (XN, IXN and 8 PN) was used to optimize MS transitions and voltages. Moreover two full scan analysis simultaneously, with and without source fragmentation. The results indicated that there was a considerable amount of XN in hops (around 50 mg/g hops). The pressurized water extraction at 150 ºC showed a high selectivity towards IXN (10 times more than XN) that reflects the isomerization described previously (Stevens and Page, 2004), while ethanol was more selective to extract XN, because no isomerization took place. In hexane and water fractions of sequential extraction the amount of XN and IXN was not relevant (less than 0. 40 mg/g extract) although it is in ethanol (that is where more of both substances extracted, however there is no selectivity). The next step would be to conduct trials of digestion and bioavailability of the extracts of interest, to determinate the synthesis yield of 8 PN from our extracts. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

500|$|The return voyage was uneventful {{until the}} fleet reached {{the waters off}} Long Island. On 4 April, the fleet {{encountered}} and captured a prize, Hawk, which was laden with supplies. The next day brought a second prize Bolton, which was also laden with stores that included more armaments and <b>powder.</b> <b>Hoping</b> to catch more easy prizes, Hopkins continued to cruise off Block Island that night, forming the fleet into a scouting formation of two columns. The need to man the prizes further reduced the fighting effectiveness of the fleet's ships. The fleet finally met resistance on April 6, when it encountered the Glasgow, a heavily armed sixth-rate ship. In the ensuing action, the outnumbered Glasgow managed to escape capture, severely damaging the Cabot in the process, wounding her captain, Hopkins' son John Burroughs Hopkins, and killing or wounding eleven others. Andrew Dorias Captain Nicholas Biddle described the battle as [...] "helter-skelter". They reached New London on 8 April.|$|R

40|$|The risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease and atherosclerosis progression is significantly increased after menopause, {{probably due to the}} decrease of estrogen levels. The use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for prevention {{of cardiovascular}} disease in older postmenopausal failed to meet expectations. Phytoestrogens may induce some improvements in climacteric symptoms, but their effect on the progression of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The reduction of cholesterol accumulation at the cellular level should lead to inhibition of the atherosclerotic process in the arterial wall. The inhibition of intracellular lipid deposition with isoflavonoids was suggested as the effective way for the prevention of plaque formation in the arterial wall. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was to investigate the effect of an isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation on atherosclerosis progression in postmenopausal women free of overt cardiovascular disease. One hundred fifty-seven healthy postmenopausal women (age 65 ± 6) were randomized to a 500 mg isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation containing tannins from grape seeds, green tea leaves, <b>hop</b> cone <b>powder,</b> and garlic powder, or placebo. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors and intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries (cIMT) were evaluated at the baseline and after 12 months of treatment. After 12 -months follow-up, total cholesterol decreased by 6. 3 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (p = 0. 011) and by 5. 2 % in placebo recipients (p = 0. 020); low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 7. 6 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (p = 0. 040) and by 5. 2 % in placebo recipients (non-significant, NS); high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased by 3. 4 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (NS) and by 4. 5 % in placebo recipients (p = 0. 038); triglycerides decreased by 6. 0 % in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients (NS) and by 7. 1 % in placebo recipients (NS). The differences between lipid changes in the isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation and placebo recipients did not reach statistical significance (p > 0. 05). Nevertheless, the mean cIMT progression was significantly lower in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients as compared to the placebo group (6 μm, or < 1 %, versus 100 μm, or 13 %; p < 0. 001 for the difference). The growth of existing atherosclerotic plaques in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients was inhibited by 1. 5 -fold (27 % versus 41 % in the placebo group). The obtained results demonstrate that the use of isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation in postmenopausal women may suppress the formation of new atherosclerotic lesions and reduce the progression of existing ones, thus promising new drug for anti-atherosclerotic therapy. Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm these findings...|$|R
