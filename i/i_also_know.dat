When questioned about this, Geoffrey Mandall stated in an interview, [...] "Having been around then, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> that Doug Drexler and John Eaves did EXACTLY what the producers asked them to: Rick and Braga had very strong opinions, and knew exactly what they wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot of things I don't know, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all." [...] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the [...] "assistant President".|$|E

In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (season seven, 1995), {{she felt she was}} mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her [...] "over-mothering", but as she started acting more distant towards him, he felt guilty about it and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." [...] Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge. In [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] (season four, 1992) When Marge was playing the role of Blanche DuBois, she hit Ned Flanders naked with a bottle and she tells him 'What's this bottle in your face!'.|$|E

500|$|Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the {{two have}} a {{turbulent}} relationship. Bart regularly addresses Homer by his given name instead of [...] "Dad", while Homer in turn often refers to him as [...] "the boy". Homer has a short temper and when enraged by Bart will strangle him on impulse in a cartoonishly violent manner. One of the original ideas for the show was that Homer would be [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as their characters were explored. Marge {{is a much more}} caring, understanding and nurturing parent than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud", (season seven, 1995) she felt she was mothering Bart too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. At the beginning of the episode, Bart protested at her over-mothering but as her attitude changed, he felt bad and made it up to her. Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to experience humiliation if it means pleasing his mom. Marge has expressed an understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." ...|$|E

This fall ended her 33-vault hitting streak in competition. Even with the fall, Maroney still came in second. She said, [...] "I didn't get my full block, my hands didn't really touch the vault. I still walked out with a silver medal and I'm happy about that. I'll have to watch the video {{and figure out what}} happened. It's really sad that I had to fall on that vault but I'm glad I won a silver medal. I know I can do better vaults but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> I didn't deserve the gold medal because I fell on my second vault. It happens. It's gymnastics. You can't always be perfect.

In his statement to the committee, he detailed his experiences and expressed his hope that his case will not be repeated. [...] "I now understand how fragile our human rights and freedoms are, and how easily they can be taken from us by the very same governments and institutions that have sworn to protect us. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> that the only way I {{will ever be able to}} move on in my life and have a future is if I can find out why this happened to me, and help prevent it from happening to others." ...|$|E

2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I know perfectly well that I can buy a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> if I can get music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be severable from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E
