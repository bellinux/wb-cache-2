40|$|We {{present the}} {{numerical}} analysis of a Helmholtz resonator-based 4 He analog of the rf-SQUID. This device has been demonstrated {{to act as a}} sensitive <b>gyrometer.</b> The rotation is detected by its effect on the apparent critical velocity of helium superflow through a small aperture. To increase the sensitivity, one must enlarge the sensing loops and use higher excitation frequencies. The behavior of this device is significantly modified when the propagation time of sound along the tube forming the loop becomes comparable with the period of the Helmholtz resonator. Large pseudo-random noise is introduced into the system. The ratio of the signal to this extra noise depends on the mode of the oscillator being used. The sensitivity and optimal performance of the <b>gyrometer</b> are discussed. PACS numbers: 06. 30. Gv, 07. 10. Yg, 47. 37. +q, 67. 40. Hf, 93. 85. +q This paper discusses the performance of a superfluid <b>gyrometer</b> with a large sensing loop. A superfluid <b>gyrometer</b> is conceptually a torus filled with superfluid and partitioned by a wall which has a small aperture. Rotation of the torus induces superflow through the aperture 1, 2. To detect this flow, an external current is applied which combines with that induced by rotation. In superfluid 4 He, when this combined current through the aperture exceeds the critical current, one or several vortices are created, resulting in a quantized decrease of the flow through the aperture (phase slip). Thus, the changes in the rotation-induced current can be detected as modifications of the maximum achievable external currents. The topology of the experiment requires that the external flow be alternating. The torus is usually connected as the 91...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} {{to study the}} {{integration}} of {{a new source of}} a priori information, which is the virtual 3 D city model. We study this integration for two tasks: vehicles geolocalization and obstacles detection. A virtual 3 D city model is a realistic representation of the evolution environment of a vehicle. It is a database of geographical and textured 3 D data. We describe an ego-localization method that combines measurements of a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver, odometers, a <b>gyrometer,</b> a video camera and a virtual 3 D city model. GPS is often consider as the main sensor for localization of vehicles. But, in urban areas, GPS is not precise or even can be unavailable. So, GPS data are fused with odometers and <b>gyrometer</b> measurements using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). However, during long GPS unavailability, localization with only odometers and <b>gyrometer</b> drift. Thus, we propose a new observation of the location of the vehicle. This observation is based on the matching between the current image acquired by an onboard camera and the virtual 3 D city model of the environment. We also propose an obstacle detection method based on the comparison between the image acquired by the on-board camera and the image extracted from the 3 D model. The following principle is used: the image acquired by the on-board camera contains the possible dynamic obstacles whereas they are absent from the 3 D model.
