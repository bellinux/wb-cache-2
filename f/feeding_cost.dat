Feeding costs can be significantly reduced by using proper feeding regimes. Mixed sex Oreochromis niloticus with initial mean weights (± standard error) of 3. 97 ± 0. 35 g were randomly fed twice daily (G 1), starved for one day (G 2) and two days (G 3) in three replicates so as to evaluate <b>feeding</b> <b>cost,</b> growth performance, feed utilization and survival rate for eight weeks in tanks. The results showed that, feed restriction had a significant effect in reducing feed cost (F = 180. 291, p = 0. 001).

40|$|In North Vietnam, during winter, {{alternative}} forage {{resources are}} needed to balance the feed ration of dairy cows. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of oat forage as a component of traditional winter roughage diets on feed intake, milk production and <b>feeding</b> <b>cost</b> in dairy cows. The study was conducted on-farm using 24 mid-lactation Holstein-Friesian cows. The feeding experiment consisted of two successive periods and two dietary treatments per period. Traditional basal diets included fresh tropical grasses, maize silage and hay. The oat forage had no effect on the dry matter intake of the basal diet, but the total crude protein intake was higher in cows fed with oat diets than in those fed with control diets. The yield of butterfat-corrected milk (FCM) was not significantly different between diets during period 1, but there was a trend (P 0 0. 078) of higher FCM yields in cows fed with the oat diet compared to those with control diet during period 2 (17. 3 vs. 16. 3 kg/day). The decline rate in milk yield was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) in cows fed with control diets than in those fed with oat diets in both experimental periods. The total <b>feeding</b> <b>cost</b> of cows fed with oat diets was on average 12 % lower than those fed with control diets (P< 0. 01).

The experimental rations contained 13 % SBM for group I and 30 % UCSM (as a main source of protein) either, without addition as ration II or with ferrous sulfate addition (1 part iron: 1 part free gossypol), ration III.

Total 240 one-week old broiler chicks were divided into four groups (Ph- 0, Ph- 200, Ph- 250 and Ph- 300) that were replicated six times (10 birds/replicate) and were randomly given methanolic extract @ 0, 200, 250 and 300 mgL- 1 of drinking water, respectively. Standard management practices were adopted. Feed and water were provided ad libitum. At the end of every week, two birds from each replicate were randomly selected to collect blood samples for serum lipid profile determination. Serum samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein and triglycerides. Triglycerides were measured by the enzymatic calorimetric method. Total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol showed gradual significant decrease and nevertheless HDL gradual increase with the increasing dose levels of P. harmala up to 250 mgL- 1 of drinking water. Feed cost was significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced by methanolic extract of P. harmala and was the lowest in group Ph- 250.

30|$|The {{nutrition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factor to consider in fish farming, because it contributes up to 50  % of fish production costs (Omoruwou and Edema 2011). Nowadays, it is necessary to increase fish production for satisfying the increasingly growing demand of protein. Therefore, fish breeding has been found necessary to increase fish production in order to make fish/protein available to the population. However, one of major constraints facing aquaculture is feeding. The prominence of fish meal in the production of animal feeds cannot be disputed but constitute the highest cost, thereby making the price of the feed to rise exponentially (Olaniyi and Salau 2013). In formulating nutritive diet for fish breeding, fish meal is used as the main dietary protein source because of its nutritional quality and palatability properties (Hardy and Tacon 2002).

The effect of overgrazing on the step/bite ratio was greater in sheep and goats than in cattle, and {{the effect on the}} walking velocity was stronger in winter than in summer. The results indicate that heavy grazing altered the foraging behavior of animals imposing higher foraging costs, which varied among the animal species and between the seasons. The declined quantity of preferred species in the heavily grazed area required high searching efforts and decreased the bite rate, for selecting acceptable plants and better feeding sites. The stronger effects on sheep and goats than on cattle and in winter than in summer may reflect different foraging behavior potentials among the animals and different food availabilities between the seasons.

For milk production the six Holstein herds produced an average of 70. 925 lbs of energy corrected milk, while the four Jersey herds produced an average of 73. 688 lbs of energy corrected milk. For feed intakes the six Holstein herds consumed an average of 52. 417 lbs per milking cow, while the four Jersey herds consumed an average of 45. 094 lbs of feed per milking cow for the year 2012. For feed efficiency, the Holstein dairies had 1. 353 lbs of milk produced per pound of dry matter (DM) consumed. For the Jersey breed, the dairies reported an average feed efficiency of 1. 635. <b>Feed</b> <b>costs</b> for the dairies were also observed. <b>Feed</b> <b>costs</b> per day per milking cow on the six Holstein dairies resulted in $ 7. 66 compared to $ 7. 45 for the four Jersey dairies. Another <b>feed</b> <b>cost</b> that was determined was the cost per hundred weight of milk. The Holstein dairies had a $ 10. 85 average on <b>feed</b> <b>cost</b> per hundred weight, while the Jersey dairies had a $ 10. 12 average on <b>feed</b> <b>cost</b> per hundred weight. As well as the information from the dairies, I constructed spread sheets to compare different prices of milk income for different cooperatives. Premiums were observed and milk quality bonuses were plugged into spread sheets for different cooperatives in California to see which ones were more beneficial to ship milk to. Information from this study was very hard to draw conclusions with, because of different factors that go into how cooperatives pay dairymen. With this information, I will determine if there is a sound advantage between milking a Jersey herd or a Holstein herd on a commercial size dairy in California...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of decreasing acres available for crop production, an increasing world population, increased utilization of grain for fuel and increased input costs (fuel, transportation, and fertilizer) {{have resulted in}} limited feed supplies and higher <b>feed</b> <b>costs.</b> Additionally, the recent drought {{in much of the}} United States has further reduced the available feed supply driving <b>feed</b> <b>costs</b> dramatically higher. Historically, <b>feed</b> <b>costs</b> have represented 50 D 70 % of the cost of production for beef enterprises. This past year, the high prices for corn and hay have driven that percentage over 80 % for many operations. CowDcalf producers have been forced to investigate alternative feedstuffs to lower the cost of production. Ideally, the cowherd is grazing {{a significant portion of the}} year. Grazing days varies drastically throughout different regions of the United States and is greatly impacted by year to year differences in weather patterns. Drought limits summer grazing. Snow and ice can limit winter grazing. Harvested and stored feeds represent the majority of <b>feed</b> <b>costs</b> for cowDcalf producers. With hay supplies low and hay costs high, producers need to consider alternative feeds for winter feeding and for emergency drought relief...|$|R
