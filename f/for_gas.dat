5|$|By August22, city {{officials}} in Corpus Christi, Texas {{declared a state}} of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region.

Later that day, Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down.

5|$|Hennessy {{concludes that}} if the un{{dissolved}} and dissolved gas content of a tissue cannot be independently measured {{either directly or indirectly}} then the safe maximum limits relative to the ambient pressure cannot be accurately determined through decompression trials and it will not be possible to systematically develop a comprehensive biophysical model <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> exchange.

5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> to return from the tissues to the breathing gas.

The first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous (branching in two) pleopods (lamellar structures which serve the function of gas exchange, and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion), and the last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods (posterior limbs). In males, the second pair of pleopods, and sometimes also the first, are modified for use in transferring sperm. The endopods (inner branches of the pleopods) are modified into structures with thin, permeable cuticles (flexible outer coverings) which act as gills <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> exchange.

5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> exchange to occur.|$|E

Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> {{and said he had}} to get something in the trunk of his car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that day on a $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident almost an hour later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway waited in a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student debit card with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} <b>for</b> <b>gas</b> {{metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the paper, two {{tools are}} used for {{estimation}} of second virial coefficient <b>for</b> <b>gases</b> and the obtained results are compared with the experimental data. The first tool is the computer program for estimation of second and third virial coefficients <b>for</b> <b>gases</b> and gas mixtures from basic properties of components. The computer program incorporates two empirical methods, the Tsonopoulos method to estimate second virial coefficients for nonpolar to polar pure gases and gas mixtures, and the method of Orbey and Vera to estimate third virial coefficients <b>for</b> nonpolar pure <b>gases</b> and gas mixtures. The second tool is the artificial neural network model (ANN) for correlation and prediction of second virial coefficients <b>for</b> <b>gases.</b> The neural network model was developed with the training variables: critical temperature, critical pressure, critical volume, acentric factor, dipole moment and temperature with the learning method back propagation of errors according to the best prediction error. The target variable was the second virial coefficient of gas. The neural network model has architecture (6, 10, 4, 1). The training error was 0. 3 %. The network predicts the second virial coefficient with the average prediction error of 1. 3 %. The second virial coefficients <b>for</b> twenty <b>gases</b> are estimated with both tools. The comparison of results with experimental data shows that the computer program based on empirical methods, and the neural network model are appropriate tools for second virial coefficient prediction <b>for</b> <b>gases,</b> but more accurate results are obtained with the neural network model which gives good predictions of second virial coefficients <b>for</b> every <b>gas...</b>|$|R
