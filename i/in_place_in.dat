5|$|In recent years, {{the high}} level of bog being {{destroyed}} by cutting has raised environmental concerns.

5|$|Shortages {{of skilled}} {{shipyard}} workers and materials slowed {{construction of the}} boats, and as a result, neither {{of the first two}} boats was ever launched, much less completed.

5|$|A mayor-council {{government}} has been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. Plurality voting is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Republican G. T. Bynum who won the 2016 mayoral election and took office on December 5, 2016. Another Tulsa political figure, Jim Inhofe, who now represents Oklahoma in the United States Senate, served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.|$|E

5|$|Above all, however, Joseph {{attempted}} {{to break up}} the structure of autonomous states which provided the framework for the Austrian Netherlands. He introduced two reforms in early 1787 instituting new administrative and judicial reform to create a much more centralised system. The first decree abolished many of the administrative structures which had existed since the rule of Emperor Charles V (1500–58) were replaced by a single General Council of Government under a minister-plenipotentiary. In addition, nine administrative circles (cercles), each controlled by an Intendant, were created to which much {{of the power of the}} states was devolved. A second decree abolished the ad hoc semi-feudal or ecclesiastical courts operated by the states and replaced them with a centralised system similar to that already <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Austria. A single Sovereign Council of Justice was established in Brussels, with two appeal courts in Brussels and Luxembourg, and around 40 local district courts.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. At {{least some of the}} rails remained <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, although much of the route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E
5|$|Although CNT {{had secured}} fully {{complete}} plans from Weser, the Austro-Hungarian design modifications delayed {{the start of}} construction.

5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before a boiler room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career.

5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|France sank after {{striking}} {{a rock in}} Quiberon Bay in 1922. Between the wars the surviving ships were modernised several times, {{but they were not}} rebuilt thoroughly enough to prevent them from becoming obsolete in comparison to modern German or Italian battleships. They were relegated to training duties during the 1930s. Courbet and Paris escaped to Portsmouth where they became depot and accommodation ships after the French armistice in 1940. Jean Bart was demilitarised, renamed Océan, and became a school hulk in Toulon. She was captured there on 27 November 1942, although she was not scuttled. She was used for experiments with large shaped charge warheads by the Germans until she was sunk by the Allies in 1944, later broken up <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1945. Courbet was scuttled on 9 June 1944 as a breakwater for a Mulberry harbour used during the Battle of Normandy.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business {{to become a}} novelist, and the only ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with {{the management of the}} Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts lost interest in the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people in}} China {{and other parts}} of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have {{medicinal}} properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs. There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs.

Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> China since 1993.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{arrived in}} Sydney with the {{survivors}} on 14 February, and after spending time alongside at Garden Island, {{was moved to}} Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 March, where repairs were undertaken; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship's internal structure were undertaken in drydock, while a 40-ton prefabricated bow was constructed.

5|$|Most of {{the bones}} in Turku were still <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was the infamous Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side {{during the war and}} {{was in charge of the}} grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E
5|$|Nairana had {{her final}} {{overhaul}} at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured {{a significant portion}} of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and Nairanas schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Nairana broke her moorings during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne. Unrecoverable, she was broken up <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1953–54.|$|E
