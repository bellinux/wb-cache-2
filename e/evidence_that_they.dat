Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, {{and there is no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann's mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae).|$|E

Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Vithoba and his cult {{is an area}} of {{continuing}} debate, even regarding his name. Various Indologists have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously: a hero stone, a pastoral deity, a manifestation of Shiva, a Jain saint, or even all of these at various times for various devotees. Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated, there is clear <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> already existed by the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Three {{divisions}} (the 21st, 54th, and 60th) were formed, {{and later}} {{took part in}} the Ogaden War. While the IISS did not list them in July 1976, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were formed as early as 1970 or earlier: Mohamud Muse Hersi has been listed by somaliaonline.com as commander of the 21st Division from 1970 to 1972, and Muse Hassan Sheikh Sayid Abdulle as commander 26th Division in 1970–71.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Janey's {{relationship}} with Rossetti had continued, {{and by the}} late 1860s gossip regarding their affair had spread about London, where they were regularly seen spending time together. Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy {{argued that it was}} likely that Morris had learned of and accepted the existence of their affair by 1870. In this year he developed an affectionate friendship with Aglaia Coronie, the daughter of wealthy Greek refugees, although there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had an affair. Meanwhile, Morris's {{relationship with}} his mother had improved, and he would regularly take his wife and children to visit her at her house in Leyton. He also went on various holidays; in the summer of 1866 he, Webb, and Taylor toured the churches of northern France.|$|E

The study sought to determine whether WDA offers greater insight to the design requirements of playgrounds. A new understanding of the important interdependencies of objects and functional purposes of playgrounds is revealed. Constraints, complexity, and emergent behaviours are not necessarily concepts associated with urban design challenges; however this paper <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have much to offer if considered within a sociotechnical systems framework...|$|R

5|$|Lefante {{is found}} {{wandering}} on a roadside, but {{appears to have}} been given an improperly-performed lobotomy. Another woman, Alice Brandt, is later kidnapped. She wakes up bound to a dentist's chair, with her kidnapper brandishing an ice pick and speaking in German. Mulder returns to Washington, D.C. to digitally analyze the photos and finds no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were doctored. By closely examining the photos, he finds the face of an old man as well as the shadow of the kidnapper, who appears to be abnormally tall.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} fly or glide has been {{suggested}} {{for at least five}} dromaeosaurid species. The first, Rahonavis ostromi (originally classified as avian bird, but found to be a dromaeosaurid in later studies) may have been capable of powered flight, as indicated by its long forelimbs with evidence of quill knob attachments for long sturdy flight feathers. The forelimbs of Rahonavis were more powerfully built than Archaeopteryx, and show <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> bore strong ligament attachments necessary for flapping flight. Luis Chiappe concluded that, given these adaptations, Rahonavis could probably fly but would have been more clumsy in the air than modern birds.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{widespread}} opinion that goods, especially foods, and services in Russia are very cheap {{as compared to the}} US. A number of Russian statistical indicators characterizing the cost of living, either directly or indirectly, seemingly corroborate this opinion. This paper demonstrates that these indicators are biased, sufficiently understating the cost of living in Russia. A comparison of Russian actual prices for foods with those in the US <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are comparable. Moreover, the Russian prices are tending {{to catch up with the}} US prices. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{effect of the}} carotenoids Lutein and zeaxanthin on cognition diseases and visual disorders was reviewed extensively [77]. These carotenoids are protective against various diseases/disorders such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), age-related cataract (ARC), ischemic/hypoxia induced retinopathy, retinal damage, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment, uveitis and diabetic retinopathy. Properties such as physical blue light filtration and antioxidant activity are the major factors for their protective role. In addition to protection against light-induced oxidative damage, there are increasing <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may also enhance normal ocular function by improving contrast sensitivity and reducing glare disability.|$|R
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|Although Triceratops are {{commonly}} portrayed as herding animals, {{there is currently}} little <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lived in herds. While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals, to date there is only one documented bonebed dominated by Triceratops bones: a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. Another, more recent find may reveal that Triceratops lived in small family groups. In 2012, a group of three Triceratops in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found in Wyoming, near Newcastle. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit, but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from Tyrannosaurus, particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from Tyrannosaurus teeth.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate, {{it appears}} that most recruits, both legionary and auxiliary, were volunteers (voluntarii). Compulsory {{conscription}} (dilectus) was never wholly abandoned, but was generally only used in emergencies or before major campaigns when large numbers of additional troops were required. In marked contrast, the late army relied mainly on compulsion for its recruitment of Roman citizens. Firstly, the sons of serving soldiers or veterans were {{required by law to}} enlist. Secondly, a regular annual levy was held based on the indictio (land tax assessment). Depending on the amount of land tax due on his estates, a landowner (or group of landowners) would be required to provide a commensurate number of recruits to the army. Naturally, landowners had a strong incentive to keep their best young men to work on their estates, sending the less fit or reliable for military service. There is also <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> tried to cheat the draft by offering the sons of soldiers (who were liable to serve anyway) and vagrants (vagi) to fulfil their quota.|$|E

50|$|Hicks has {{emphasized}} {{that there is}} little <b>evidence</b> suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are any more aggressive than other chimpanzees (predatory behavior being the norm for the species). However, he has been misquoted in the press about this.|$|R
5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led Fitch {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and there was no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> existed, but it made a good thesis topic.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E
5|$|In their 1995 {{review of}} Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues {{established}} Eptesicus somalicus malagasyensis, a new subspecies of Eptesicus somalicus (currently Neoromicia somalica). They {{had only a}} single specimen and noted that further material was needed to assess the new form's relationship with E.somalicus. Studies in 2001 and 2002 provided evidence that E.somalicus and related species are not closely related to Eptesicus (nor to Pipistrellus, where they have also been placed), so that these species were allocated to the separate genus Neoromicia. In 2004, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo reviewed the Malagasy subspecies after collecting two more specimens and concluded that it was distinct enough to be classified as a separate species, Neoromicia malagasyensis. Two years later, Paul Bates and colleagues reported on two more specimens and showed that the bacula (penis bones) of N.malagasyensis and N.somalica are different, providing further <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are distinct species. However, they recommended that further research assess the degree of difference between N.malagasyensis and N.matroka (formerly in Eptesicus, but placed in Neoromicia by Bates and colleagues), which occurs further east in Madagascar. The IUCN Red List currently again classifies the species in Eptesicus, as Eptesicus malagasyensis.|$|E
