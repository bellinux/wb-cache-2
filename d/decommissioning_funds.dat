40|$|The {{implementation}} of strengthened safeguards measures creates {{a wealth of}} information including AP declarations, complementary access reports, inspectors' reports and Open Source information. Often, the information is scattered in different databases and document repositories. Therefore, efficient nuclear safeguards require an information platform integrating the collection, management and analysis of all relevant data. Since most safeguards relevant information has a geographical component (e. g. sites, buildings, mines), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are suitable tools for satisfying the needs of a safeguards information system: the geographical features in the GeoDatabase are used to associate different data items in the distributed databases; the map-based interface allows to intuitively browse, query and find the information of interest, thus providing a single-point-of-entry. Over the last years, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed a number of tools supporting the preparation, management and verification of AP declarations, which were demonstrating the usefulness of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for this purpose. Following these experiences, JRC in collaboration with DG-TREN developed SIT-ES, a Geo-Portal integrating the diverse safeguards-related databases at DG-TREN and providing a single point of access to all relevant information. SIT-ES allows DG-TREN users to have fast and direct access to information related to a particular facility or activity. The possibility to intuitively browse a map-based interface and quickly find the required information is essential for verifying the information and documentation efficiently and accurately. The paper will present the SIT-ES architecture, its main reporting capabilities in answering to clarification requests from IAEA or other interested parties, and will describe the main operational features: •SIT-ES is a Geo-Portal, which provides an intuitive, map-based interface to access Safeguards related information through a geographic location on the map; •It integrates different existing databases at DG-TREN and provides central access to the distributed information. Further to the Additional Protocol declarations, it links current and historic data for waste management, inspection planning, shipment of radioactive waste and spent fuel, <b>decommissioning</b> <b>funds</b> etc; •It is a multi-user information system which ensures that all users always access the most up-to-date and accurate information; •The system enforces the security requirements that come with this type of sensitive data.
