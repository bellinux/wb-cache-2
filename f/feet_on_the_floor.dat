25|$|After Frenchy Martin's departure, Bravo joined Jimmy Hart's {{stable and}} entered a feud with another power wrestler, The Ultimate Warrior, unsuccessfully {{challenging}} Warrior for his WWF Intercontinental Championship. Prior to a WrestleMania VI loss to Duggan, Bravo {{teamed up with}} Earthquake, and Bravo would often display his strength by doing push ups while the 460lb. Earthquake sat on his back (although Tenta kept his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> so not all of his weight was on his partner). The team of Earthquake and Bravo would have a lengthy feud with Hulk Hogan and Tugboat.|$|E
500|$|Adkins {{performed}} as a one-man band, using foot pedals {{to play the}} drums, or simply stomped his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to an often detuned guitar. He once vowed that he would play [...] "twelve to twenty" [...] instruments simultaneously, including playing the piano and organ with his elbows. He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating {{that when he was}} a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings. The first time he saw a guitarist in action, he built a guitar of his own.|$|E
2500|$|They {{struck up}} one of those over and over strains {{that seem to have}} no {{beginning}} and certainly no ending at all. The strumming attained a disturbing monotony, but on and on it went, a kind of stuff associated with [...] cane rows and levee camps. Thump-thump-thump went their <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> It was not really annoying or unpleasant. Perhaps [...] "haunting" [...] is the better word.|$|E

2500|$|... … we somehow {{got around}} to taking about Wilamowitz … [...] said that Wilamowitz would pepper his lectures with remarks about the {{political}} situation in Germany and that his students would applaud by loudly stamping their <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The remarks were of such a nature that they caused Cherniss to develop an intense dislike for the man. I don’t recall how he characterized the remarks, but Solmsen’s description of the antidemocratic, anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic Prussian lens through which Wilamowitz viewed Weimar Germany would explain Cherniss’s antipathy.|$|E
6000|$|Cashel ground his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> impatiently, {{and then}} sprang up. After an interval, {{during which he}} seemed to be {{swallowing}} some indignant protest, he said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put on {{your shirt}} and stand over there {{alongside}} your master," [...] Doctor Emory commanded Kwaque, having suddenly elevated {{the chair and}} spilled him out on his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... stomp: place <b>the</b> flat <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> lift <b>foot</b> off floor (no {{change of}} weight).|$|R
6000|$|All {{this time}} {{there had been a}} muffled hum of conversation, and {{rustling}} of robes and scraping of <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> a combination of dull noises which filled all the place. Suddenly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come this minute. My {{mother has}} coughed, got up, set her <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Let her only catch {{you on the}} stairs, Miss Caroline. You're not to bid him good-bye"--stepping between her and Moore--"you are to march." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You get me {{what you}} like, dad,' says Marilla, who couldn't keep her <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> from joy. 'Of course {{you know what to}} select. I'd just as lief it was a piano or a organ or what.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... stamp: place <b>the</b> flat <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with {{a change}} of weight. <b>Foot</b> stays <b>on</b> floor.|$|R

60|$|When he and Psmith were alone, {{there was}} silence. Psmith leaned back comfortably in his chair. The {{headmaster}} tapped nervously with his <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the {{stamping}} and shuffling of <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully {{at the end of a}} shelf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's you, is it? Come in, then. Don't stand staring. Close {{that door}} quick! Hustle! Don't scrape your <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Try to look intelligent. Don't gape. Where {{have you been}} all this while? Why didn't you come before? Can you tie a tie? All right, then--do it!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} the boys {{as if they had}} no more than fallen asleep, {{although}} {{as a matter of fact}} they had both been in Dreamland fully two hours, when the clanging of the gong, the thud of horses' <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and the rapid movements of the men aroused them.|$|E
60|$|This latter {{reflection}} heightened Nell's resentment {{toward her}} lover. She {{stood with her}} face turned away from Mrs. Wentz; the little frown deepened, and she nervously tapped her <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't want {{to speak}} of them here,' replied Bella, suppressing indignation, and tapping her <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> 'They are much too kind and {{too good to be}} drawn into these discussions.' ...|$|R

60|$|Ethel, who had {{permitted}} {{her grandmother}} {{to continue her}} sententious advice, while she herself sat tapping her <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and performing the most rapid variations of that air which is called the Devil's Tattoo, burst out, at length, to the elder lady's surprise, with an outbreak of indignation, a flushing face, and a voice quivering with anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rachel! Rachel!" [...] he shrieked, {{trying to}} rush back to her. But they {{prevented}} him, and pushed {{him down the}} passage and into a bedroom far from her room. Downstairs {{they could hear the}} thud of his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> as he struggled to break free; and twice they heard him shout, [...] "Rachel, Rachel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Leaning heavily upon him, {{she set her}} <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> She {{felt with}} them {{as if she was}} feeling the floor, without quite {{understanding}} that she stood on it. The next moment, she reeled against the desk. [...] "Giddy," [...] she said, faintly and thickly. [...] "My head." [...] Her eyes looked at him, cold and big and staring. They maddened the poor affectionate creature with terror. The frightful shrillness of the past days in Bedlam was in his voice, as he screamed for help.|$|E
6000|$|... (He knots the lace. Bella {{places her}} <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.) ...|$|R
50|$|Bharadvājāsana I is {{the basic}} {{variation}} in which the legs articulated as in vīrāsana dropped to one side one <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and <b>the</b> other's ankle cradled in the {{arch of the foot}} below.|$|R
60|$|Janoo stamped her <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> {{and nearly}} cried with vexation; while Suddhoo was whimpering {{under a blanket}} in the corner, and Azizun was trying to guide the pipe-stem to his foolish old mouth.|$|R
60|$|It {{was early}} when I called, and the General was dressing; but I pleaded urgent business, and was shown at once into his bed-room {{by an old}} negro valet, who {{remained}} in attendance during my visit. As I entered the chamber, I looked about, of course, for the occupant, but did not immediately perceive him. There was a large and exceedingly odd-looking bundle of something which lay close by my <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and, as I {{was not in the}} best humor in the world, I gave it a kick out of the way.|$|E
60|$|I {{realized}} how sorely he was hurt, yet not then in my stupidity and horror--or {{is it that}} I refused to confess it to myself?--that his hurt was mortal. Morning would come soon. I grasped tight the hand in mine. Then help. In this monotony and weariness of mind and body, the passing trees seemed to dance and gesticulate before my eyes. A torturing drowsiness crept over me which in vain, thrusting up my eyelids with my fingers, beating my senseless <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the cart, I tried to dispel. Once, I remember, I rose and threw my cape over his shoulder. At last I must have slept.|$|E
60|$|Out of {{all this}} fog of unfriendliness {{appeared}} the waitress at the St. Brasten Cocoa House; first, {{as a human being}} to whom he could talk, second, as a woman. She was ignorant and vulgar; she misused English cruelly; she wore greasy cotton garments, planted her large <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with firm clumsiness, and always laughed at the wrong cue in his diffident jests. But she did laugh; she did listen while he stammered his ideas of meat-pies and St. Paul's and aeroplanes and Shelley and fog and tan shoes. In fact, she supposed him to be a gentleman and scholar, not an American.|$|E
6000|$|Even this {{confession}} {{failed to}} move Father Benwell. He obstinately crossed his arms, obstinately tapped his <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> [...] "No!" [...] he said. [...] "Plead as generously as you may, my answer is, No." ...|$|R

60|$|Franchard {{was soon}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sloop. Everything {{appeared}} to be in order, although there were the marks of muddy <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooring</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seats. Martin and Toglet had taken good care that no clew that should lead to their identity should be left behind.|$|R
