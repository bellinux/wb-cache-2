5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, {{who is working on}} a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as {{she was diagnosed with}} cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E

5|$|Izzie {{supports}} Alex when {{he discovers}} his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces {{him to have}} her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain. Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, {{who has been in}} an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.|$|E

500|$|That evening, the 27th Infantry placed two belts of antipersonnel {{mines and}} trip flares {{across the road}} and stream bed [...] and [...] in front of its {{positions}} in the valley. After dusk, the North Koreans began shelling the general area of the 27th Infantry positions until just before midnight. ROK troops had planned to mount an attack, but {{it became apparent that}} the North Koreans would hit first. Then the KPA 13th Division launched a major attack against the entire UN front in and around the valley. Nine US tanks supported the infantry troops in the valley. Because it was on higher ground and positioned in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the other American units, C Company on the left of the road usually was the first to detect an approaching attack. That evening the C Company commander telephoned the regimental headquarters that he could hear tanks. When the artillery fired an illuminating shell he was able to count 19 North Korean vehicles in the attacking column on the road. The tanks and self-propelled guns approached the American positions, firing rapidly. Most of their shells landed in the rear areas. North Korean infantry moved forward {{on both sides of the}} road. Simultaneously, other North Korean units attacked the ROK troops on the high ridges flanking the valley.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{widespread}} {{success has}} made it indispensable to the band's live setlists and has been performed over 640 times since 1991 making it the band's second most performed song behind [...] "Give it Away". Unlike several of the Chili Peppers' other songs, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is not interpreted in a different manner than {{what is on the}} record—aside from being played acoustically, the track is performed the same as it appears on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Kiedis is, however, notorious for being incapable of achieving several high notes in live performances; the vocalist has noted that he sometimes forgets or rearranges song lyrics in the verses. Therefore, the song has sometimes suffered from his limitations as a singer. After being released as a single in March 1992, the song would be included in virtually all concerts; Frusciante, however, began to resent the song's popularity and would play convoluted intros, purposefully throwing Kiedis off. An example of this was during a televised performance on the highly rated program Saturday Night Live on February 22, 1992. Kiedis said that it [...] "felt like I was getting stabbed in the back and hung out to dry in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of America while [...] was off in a corner in the shadow, playing some dissonant out-of-tune experiment." [...] The guitarist used a distortion pedal for the ending verse and screamed incomprehensibly into the microphone when providing backup vocals, neither of which were originally planned or typical of live performances. Nevertheless, sales of Blood Sugar Sex Magik skyrocketed following the show.|$|E

Subsequently, the police men who arrested Stan in [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] enter the bar looking for her. They eventually see her and try to arrest her again. However, the man that played cards with the singer defends her, beginning to bar-fight with the police men; they win the fight, with all people lying on the floor. Upon next, the police men are sitting on the bar stool next to the bar man and are presented a tape. Meanwhile, it is shown in a flashback in sepia that, while the men were bar-fighting, Stan was grabbing the money from the cards and ran out of the bar. The video ends with one of the police man punching the bar man. Scenes interspersed throughout the main plot present Stan singing in front of an old-fashioned wall, sporting a white worn blouse and hot pants. An editor from Los 40 Principales cited the video for [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] as one of the singer's best clips ever. Hamard from Pure Charts wrote that the visual would have an impact on males and deemed Stan as [...] "sensual".|$|E
