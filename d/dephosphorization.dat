Because of {{disadvantages}} of converter steelmaking with semi-steel in Panzhihua Steel, such as slow-footed slag forming, {{low rate of}} <b>dephosphorization,</b> high rate of rephosphorization after converter smelting, studies on increasing <b>dephosphorization</b> rate have been carried out.

Thus, the mass percentage product (pct Fe (t) O) x (pct CaO) and the mass action concentration product are recommended to represent the comprehensive effect of CaO+Fe (t) O on <b>dephosphorization</b> ability of the CaO-based slags. Furthermore, a parabolic relationship of L (P) against binary basicity or complex basicity CB 2 and CB 3 can be established at binary basicity in 1. 8 or at complex basicity CB 2 and CB 3 in 2. 0 corresponding to the maximum of <b>dephosphorization</b> ability of the CaO-based slags.

The influences of various parameters, including the reduction temperature, the reduction time, and the C/O molar ratio, on the reaction behavior of phosphorus during reduction process were studied.

40|$|At SSAB EMEA in Luleå {{steel is}} {{manufactured}} mainly based on pellets from LKAB, Malmberget {{but a small}} part is from Kiruna. But in the future, {{the majority of the}} pellets will come from Kiruna instead of Malmberget. What distinguishes these two kinds of pellets from each other is that the pellet from Kiruna has higher phosphorus content. Coal and coke used in smelting the pellets will also have a higher level of phosphorus. This will contribute that the phosphorus content in pig iron will rise which will make phosphorus removal at SSAB more difficult because the company doesn’t have a practice in dealing with the new amounts of phosphorus. A common knowledge is that a good refining of impurities is to a large part due of the slag. Therefor when it comes to improving <b>dephosphorization</b> there is a proposal to modify the slag slag benefiting removal of phosphor. This can be done by not adding dolomitic lime at LD converter. Dolomitic lime is added today at SSAB to reduce the wear of the LD converter linings composed of MgO. MgO from the linings has a tendency to dissolve in the slag and a method to prevent this is to saturate the slag with MgO by the addition of dolomitic lime. But the adding of dolomitic lime hastens the formation of tricalciumsilikates, 3 CaO·SiO 2 which inhibits the dissolve of lime. This thesis purpose was to investigate the dolomitic lime effect on <b>dephosphorization</b> by excluding it in the LD process. The goal with this work was to get a clear picture of the <b>dephosphorization</b> without the dolomitic lime and then based from this report develop a praxis for depshosphorization on steel grade that demands low phosphor. At SSAB a computer system is used to calculate a model on how the pig iron should be treated as for example how much lime and dolomitic lime must be added to reach the demands. During this thesis two different trials were done. The first trial in which dolomitic lime was removed from the computer system and the system calculated a model where the ordered requirements were met without adding dolomitic lime. The second trail was with a controlled blowing in which certain parameters were established in advance, for example the amount lime and dolomitic lime in the reference samples and then the amount lime in the trial samples. During the trials there were a desire to see the phosphorus behaviour during the entire blow, so samples were taken during the blowing as well as after. The results showed that the removal of dolomitic lime at LD converter contributed to improved phosphorus distribution but a controlled blowing method must be developed for it to have a clear impact. It has also been shown that a high FeO content in slag, high basicity and a low steel temperature contributes to a good phosphorus removal. By the results there is a marginal improvement of the <b>dephosphorization</b> by removing the dolomitic lime in the blowing of the pig iron.

The {{process of}} <b>dephosphorization</b> for basic {{electrode}} {{and distribution of}} phosphours between slag and deposited metal(Lp) in {{manual metal arc welding}} has been researched by means of experimental and theortical analyses. The results indicate that P content in deposited metal decreased with the increase of coating basicity of the electrode and FeO content in slag. The distributive coefficient of phosphorus Lp increased with the increase of coating basicity of the electrode and FeO content in slag. Although dephosphprylation in deposited metal was a limit finally, it was satisfactory under suitable selsction of the value of FeO in slag and coating basicity of the electrode according to the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model for predicting the phosphate capacity of CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -MnO-Al 2 O 3 -P 2 O 5 slags at the steelmaking endpoint during an 80 -ton top-bottom combined blown converter steelmaking {{process has been}} developed based on the ion and molecule coexistence theory (IMCT). The phosphate capacity has {{a close relationship with}} the phosphate capacity index, whereas the logarithm of phosphate capacity is 12. 724 greater than that of phosphate capacity index at 1873 K (1600 degrees C). The developed phosphate capacity prediction model can be also used to predict the phosphate capacity index with reliable accuracy compared with the measured and the predicted phosphate capacity index of the slags by other models in literatures. The results from the IMCT phosphate capacity prediction model show that the comprehensive effects of iron oxides and basic components control the <b>dephosphorization</b> reaction with an optimal ratio of (pct FeO) /(pct Fe 2 O 3) as 0. 62. The determined contribution ratio of FetO, CaO+ FetO, MgO+ FetO, and MnO + FetO to the phosphate capacity or phosphate capacity index of the slags is approximately 0. 0 pct, 99. 996 pct, 0. 0 pct, and 0. 0 pct, respectively. The generated 2 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, 3 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, and 4 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 as products of <b>dephosphorization</b> reactions accounts for 0. 016 pct, 96. 01 pct, and 3. 97 pct of the phosphate capacity or phosphate capacity index of the slags, respectively...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{technology}} of hot metal pretreatment had tremendous improvements in past decades and was widely {{used by the}} overwhelming majority of steelworks in Japan. While, since the first hot metal pretreatment station was established in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd in the later period of 1980 s, this process began to be applied in domestic steel plants. And now 30 years have passed, the desilionization and <b>dephosphorization</b> process are still rarely seldom used in China except desulphurization process in most carbon steel plants. So in this paper, the metallurgical principles and effects of hot metal desiliconization were analyzed in great details. Meanwhile, the optimum silicon content of hot metal between iron-making and steelmaking process was summarized and calculated. The necessity of hot metal desiliconizaiton was discussed for the iron and steel companies in China...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{importance}} of <b>dephosphorization</b> process in ironmaking and steelmaking, this paper attempted to estimate the phosphate capacities of different systems. Mass triangle model could approach the properties of multi-component systems without the parameter for every component. This present work also extended the mass triangle model to multicomponent systems application to three systems containing as much as seven components proved the feasibility and accuracy of this model. The calculated contour lines revealed the reasonable trend as experimental results, and calculation results for fixed compositions showed a low error rate. Scattered points calculation obtained more accurate results. Since this model can also evaluate other properties of slag, such as density, viscosity, sulphide capacity etc., this model might shoot light on the understanding of various properties of multi-component slags accurately, and thus offer insight on optimization of ironmaking and steelmaking process...|$|E
