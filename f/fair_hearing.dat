5|$|The {{ground of}} fettering {{discretion}} {{on this basis}} is distinct from {{the right to a}} <b>fair</b> <b>hearing.</b> The latter relates to a separate ground of judicial review, namely, procedural impropriety, and particularly the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person to be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> {{may also}} include the rights to legal representation, to {{cross-examine}} witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an oral hearing. An applicant claiming a breach of the <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> requirement has {{to prove that he}} or she suffered substantial injustice since {{there is no such thing}} in law as a technical breach of natural justice. The requirements of <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> depend on the circumstances of the case such as the nature of the inquiry, the rules governing the tribunal, and the subject matter being dealt with.|$|E

The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the {{right to a}} <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.|$|E

25|$|The rule of <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> is {{the other}} of the two pillars of natural justice. It is {{encapsulated}} in the Latin maxim audi alteram partem, which implies that everyone {{has a right to}} be heard and that none ought therefore to be condemned unheard. This principle must be observed by courts, tribunals, arbitrators and all persons or bodies having the duty to act judicially, save where their application is excluded expressly or by necessary implication. The need for <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> is important as it forms a part of good procedure by reflecting a universal sense of fair play.|$|E
25|$|The Manila hostage crisis, officially {{known as}} the Rizal Park hostage-taking incident, took place when a disgruntled former Philippine National Police officer named Rolando Mendoza hijacked a tourist bus in Rizal Park, Manila, Philippines on August 23, 2010.

25|$|A {{procedural}} {{legitimate expectation}} is created when a representation {{is made by}} a public authority that it will follow a certain procedure before making a decision on the substantive merits of a particular case.

25|$|Excessive {{intervention}} by a tribunal is {{a breach of}} the <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> requirement. The principle behind this rule was elucidated succinctly by Justice Yong Pung How. He stated that since Singapore's justice system is adversarial and not inquisitorial, when hearing evidence a tribunal may seek clarification on points in the evidence which are not clear, but must at all times avoid descending into the arena and joining in the fray. The tribunal is there to judge as best it can and is not there to supplement the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|The rule of <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> {{requires}} that persons {{liable to be}} directly affected by the outcome of any decision must be given prior notification of the action proposed to be taken, {{of the time and}} place of any hearing that is to be conducted, and of the charge or case they will be called upon to meet. There is also a necessary implication that notice must not only be given, but that it must be sufficient and accurate. People should be told clearly what cases they are to meet and the cases against them should not be left to conjecture.|$|E

25|$|Article 6 does not, however, {{replace the}} common law duty to ensure a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing.</b> It has been {{suggested}} that Article 6 alone is not enough to protect procedural due process, and only with the development of a more sophisticated common law will the protection of procedural due process extend further into the administrative machine. Nonetheless, Article 6 supplements {{the common law}}. For example, the common law does not impose a general duty to give reasons for a decision, but under Article 6(1) a decision-maker must give a reasoned judgment so as to enable an affected individual to decide whether to appeal.|$|E

Wolman and the ALB proceeded with the elections all the same, and although only about 19,000 workers had elected to form unions a plan was drawn up in April 1935 to guide the anticipated collective bargaining process.|$|E

25|$|For {{a hearing}} to be fair, {{the person who}} will be {{affected}} by the hearing's outcome must be given sufficient notice to allow him or her to adequately prepare his or her case; he or she must be entitled to know what evidence has been produced against him or her; and that there must be a proper opportunity to contest, contradict or correct any evidence, state one's case and raise relevant matters before the court. In addition, a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> may also include the rights to legal representation, to cross-examine witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an oral hearing.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the common}} law {{provides}} no explicit statement of rights in a legal process, a number of principles combine to guarantee an individual {{a certain level of}} protection by law. These are often known as the rules of natural justice and comprise the principles nemo iudex in causa sua and audi alteram partem. A <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> implies that each party has the opportunity to present their own case to an impartial tribunal. Courts must generally sit in public and decisions may be challenged on the grounds of actual or apparent bias. Although judges are under a common law duty to give reasons for their decisions, there is no such rule for non-judicial decision-makers.|$|E

Three days later the judge declared a mistrial, and a retrial was set for March 1, 2010. This second trial, overseen by Western District of Louisiana judge Donald Walter, was moved from the Northern District of Illinois to the Eastern District of New York: since the prosecution was to call the three judges to the stand, the defense felt that Turner would not get a <b>fair</b> <b>hearing</b> if the trial was conducted {{in the same city}} where the judges worked.
