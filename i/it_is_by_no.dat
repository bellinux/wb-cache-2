5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

25|$|Two main matters i.e. {{assuming}} {{the body as}} a fixed support and influence of the nonlinear elements in calculation of the hunting speed are mostly focused in studies.

50|$|The Scots Musical Museum {{was a major}} {{publication}} that had {{a pivotal role in}} the collecting and tradition of music of Scotland. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means the first collection of Scottish folk songs and music, but the six volumes, with 100 songs in each, collected more pieces, introduced new songs, and brought many of them into the classical music repertoire.|$|R
5000|$|The English word rhyton {{originates}} {{in the ancient}} Greek word [...] (rhy&#774;tón or rhŭtón).

25|$|In Thomas Fowler's {{monograph}} on Shaftesbury and Hutcheson in {{the series}} of English philosophers (1882) {{he was able to}} supplement the printed materials for the Life by extracts from the Shaftesbury papers in the Record Office. These include, besides many letters and memoranda, two Lives of him, composed by his son, the fourth earl, one of which is evidently the original, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means always closely followed, of the Life contributed by Thomas Birch to the General Dictionary.|$|E
25|$|The spores {{of these}} fungi are {{dispersed}} {{either by the}} actions of being unearthed and broken apart, or by ingestion and subsequent excretion. Some studies even suggest that passage through an animal's gut promotes the germination of these spores, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means necessary for a majority of fungal species. Regardless, the ability of these certain mammals to spread fungal spores is thus indirectly related to plant community structure, by way of the pivotal role that EcM fungi play in plant nutrition and productivity.|$|E
50|$|The undisputed annual {{highlight}} of the Hall's calendar was the 'Hatch Ball' a large formal dinner held in the nearby Shelbourne hotel. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means, however, the only social gathering; with intermittent discos in nearby nightclubs, nightly parties in private rooms usually proceeding to Dublin nightclubs and regular excursions to the beloved local pub, Hartigans of Leeson Street, the social scene was always vibrant.|$|R

5000|$|Although Boughner's {{operation}} {{may have}} been among the earliest and most advanced stoneware operation in the area, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means the only one.

The remains of their endeavors, which operated under the name James Hamilton and Company, can still be found along Water Street.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means {{simple to}} sort out fact and fiction within this story. The picture is further {{complicated}} by the fact that other authors (both in print and on the web) have chosen to join Borges in his game and write about one or another fictional aspect of this story either as if it were non-fiction or in a manner that could potentially confuse the unwary reader. Two online examples are the Italian-language website La Biblioteca di Uqbar, which treats Tlön itself as duly fictional, but writes as if the fictional Silas Haslam's entirely imaginary History of the Land Called Uqbar was a real work.|$|E
25|$|One non-trivial {{example is}} the fractal {{dimension}} of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means a rectifiable curve: {{the length of the}} curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which in this case is a number between one and two.|$|E
25|$|Official {{records of}} mining {{in the area}} go back {{at least as far}} as 1898. Before that it is likely, due to the {{particularly}} craggy nature of the valley, that the local dry stone walls and stone for housing were taken from the slopes around the valley, even as far back as the Bronze Age. There are two main open cast mines in the valley. The first is Jumb Quarry, situated within a few hundred yards of the early settlement at Tongue House, suggesting that the two may have been coexisting in some form or other. However the general proliferation of rock in this part of Kentmere means the early inhabitants may easily have taken their building material from almost anywhere in the valley, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means certain.|$|E
50|$|The Dome Zero was {{not really}} a {{supercar}} by today's standards, but for Japanese privateer carmakers at the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an incredible step forward. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means powerful with its 2.8 L L28 SOHC inline six-cylinder engine producing 145 PS (105 kW), but it only had to propel a 920 kg chassis. With this engine, the Dome Zero offered a power-to-weight ratio that closely matched Porsches of the day.|$|R

50|$|The Fifth Crusade <b>was</b> {{endorsed}} <b>by</b> the Lateran Council of 1215, and Honorius started {{preparations for}} the crusade to begin in 1217. To procure the means necessary for this colossal undertaking, the Pope, and the cardinals were to contribute the tenth part of their income for three years. All other ecclesiastics were to contribute the twentieth part. Though the money thus collected <b>was</b> considerable, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means sufficient for a general crusade as planned by Honorius III.|$|R
25|$|Chinese {{names are}} a well-studied example of surname extinction: there are {{currently}} only about 3,100 surnames in use in China, compared with close to 12,000 recorded in the past, with 22% of the population sharing the names Li, Wang and Zhang (numbering close to 300 million people), and the top 200 names covering 96% of the population. Names have changed or become extinct for various reasons such as people taking {{the names of their}} rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, among others. While family name lines dying out may be a factor in the surname extinction, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means the only or even a significant factor. Indeed, the most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names. Further, while new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing.|$|E
25|$|There are {{eighteen}} professional county clubs, seventeen {{of them in}} England and one in Wales. Each {{summer the}} county clubs compete in the first class County Championship, which consists of two leagues of nine teams and in which matches are played over four days. The same teams also play the one day National League, a one-day knock out competition called the Friends Provident Trophy, and the short-form Twenty20 Cup. English cricket grounds include Lord's, The Oval, Headingley, Old Trafford, Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. Cardiff's Sophia Gardens ground has also become increasingly popular in recent years. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means equal to football in finance, attendance or coverage, {{but it has a}} high profile nonetheless. It is probably the second most widely covered sport in England and third most widely covered sport in Wales and the fortunes of the England team are closely followed by many people who never attend a live game.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Swiss Plateau forms a basin, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means a flat territory, but {{depending}} on the region, it has a manifold structure. Important elements are the two big lakes, Lake Geneva and Lake Constance that delimit the Swiss Plateau in the southwest and the northeast. The western plateau is stamped by the Gros-de-Vaud plateau (up to 600 meters AMSL) and the Jorat molasse hills (up to 900 meters AMSL) but sometimes intersected by deep valleys. Only near the Jura there is an almost continuous dip consisting of the Venoge and the Orbe valleys which are separated by the Mormont hill, the main watershed between Rhône and Rhine, at only 500 m AMSL. The Seeland ('lake land'), characterized by the Murten, Neuchâtel and Biel lakes, represents the biggest plain of the Swiss Plateau, though it is also interrupted by isolated molasse ranges. In the east, it is neighboured by various hill countries the height of which decreases to the north. Another major plain is the Wasseramt where the Emme runs. In a broad valley alongside the Jura, the Aare collects all the rivers that {{come down from the}} Alps.|$|E
50|$|Baba Devi Sahab preached that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> {{other means}} save inner {{meditation}} which consisted mainly of the Yoga of Inner Light and the Yoga of Inner Sound {{that one could}} attain complete liberation from the shackles of transmigration. He would preach that selfless pure love, 'ishq' or 'bhakti' towards the God is of utmost importance. He cautioned people to very carefully and meticulously guard against the vices of jealousy and vainglory as these defile our mind.|$|R
50|$|The {{recommendations}} of the EAC shaped the development of postwar Europe. While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> means obvious at the Potsdam Conference that Germany would be partitioned into two states, the {{recommendations of}} the EAC allowed each occupying power full control over its occupied zone and deprived the ACC of an overruling influence. The subsequent Cold War thus was reflected in the partition of Germany as each occupying force could develop its zone on its own.|$|R
