However, so far {{there has not been}} a lot of research about the process of <b>open</b> <b>sourcing,</b> especially in more detail and in the context of commercial companies <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> non-revenue generating internal software. This thesis was driven by a global IT company that wanted to understand what kind of value they could gain <b>from</b> <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> an internal tool, how they could successfully carry out the <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> project, and what kinds of decisions they should make regarding it. In the literature review an existing high-level framework for the <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> process was found. This framework was used to further build on by studying seven different dimensions of open sourcing: business model, legality, software, community, infrastructure, process, and marketing. In the empirical part people, who have been highly involved in <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> projects of internal software, were interviewed in order to get more insights on the value gained <b>from</b> <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> and the decisions made regarding the different <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> dimensions. The result of this thesis is providing an understanding for the case company on the potential value they could gain <b>from</b> <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> their internal tool, and a detailed recommendation on how they could successfully carry the <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> project if they would decide to do it, and what kind of decisions they should make regarding each <b>open</b> <b>sourcing</b> dimension...|$|R
