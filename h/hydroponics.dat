40|$|Allen, Herbert E. Di Toro, Dominic M. The {{purpose of}} the work is to develop a Terrestrial Biotic Ligand Model (TBLM) to predict Ni and Cu toxicities on barley root {{elongation}} (RE) grown in soil system, using controlled experiments in the inert sand culture with <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution. The chemical composition of the <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution can be varied univariately so the toxicity and the competition effect can be studied individually and independently while that of soil cannot. For Ni experiments EC 50 (50 % effective concentration) of free Ni activity increased as Mg 2 + activity increased, whereas the effect of Ca 2 + was insignificant. Toxicity from NiHCO 3 + at high pH was considered to account for the effect of H+ on EC 50. For Cu experiments linear relationships between EC 50 of free Cu 2 + and H+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + activities were found, meaning that the H+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + cations will alleviate the toxicity of Cu 2 + in solutions. TBLM parameters were estimated and <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution culture bioassays were modeled by TBLM with root mean square error (RMSE) % root elongation (%RE) of 9. 4 % for Ni and 12. 8 % for Cu toxicity predictions. Toxicity accompanying increasing concentration of solution ions other than Ni 2 + or Cu 2 + toxicity was observed and modeled as an osmotic effect and needed to be included for soil culture due to cations released into the soil solution. Including the osmotic effect improved soil culture toxicity prediction. TBLM parameters that were developed from <b>hydroponic</b> sand culture were validated by predicting soil toxicity response with RMSE %RE of 14. 1 % for Ni, and 13. 0 % for Cu toxicity bioassays, which are similar to the prediction of RMSE %RE of 10. 5 % for Ni and 14. 0 % for Cu using the TBLM parameters that were developed from soil culture itself. EC 50 prediction by <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution TBLM parameters are also similar to those for soil parameters, so TBLM parameters for soils toxicity prediction can be derived from <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution culture experiments, and the TBLM parameters allow prediction of effects in systems other than those in which the TBLM constants were developed. The effect of activity at the root plasma membrane surface was incorporated into the model for predicting the toxicities of Ni and Cu in the <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution and the soil culture. Using the activities at the plasma membrane surface as the toxicity dose did not improve the predictions over using activities in bulk soil solution to determine the metal toxicity, and using the value of f (fraction of biotic ligand sites occupied by the toxic metal) obtained from the TBLM resulted in the better prediction. TBLM parameters developed from <b>hydroponic</b> water solution culture from previous reported work were also included for comparison for their ability to predict the Ni and Cu toxicity on barley root elongation in soil culture. Predictions of %RE and EC 50 for respective Ni and Cu toxicity responses in soil culture result in larger errors with <b>hydroponic</b> water solution TBLM parameters than with <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution culture parameters. Parameters developed from <b>hydroponic</b> water solution systems were unable to accurately predict the Ni and Cu toxicities in soils. As both the <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution culture and the <b>hydroponic</b> water solution culture are types of <b>hydroponic</b> methods, the same factors should affect both if plant response is dictated by solution chemistry. For the <b>hydroponic</b> water culture method there is no sand or other solid material present but in the <b>hydroponic</b> sand culture there is sand for the plants to grow in. Barley was grown in the 3 media of soil, <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution, and <b>hydroponic</b> water solution cultures at the same environmental conditions at same time. The difference of root morphology for barley grown in different growth media and its relationship with the Ni toxicity prediction were studied. Results showed that barley grown in <b>hydroponic</b> water solution had greater root hair length than those from soil and <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution which makes it more sensitive to the Ni toxicity, whereas root hair length of the barley grown in <b>hydroponic</b> sand solution culture are similar to that in soil culture. By including the effect of unit root surface area, the difference in root elongation and EC 50 was diminished, and % root elongations can be improved with an error of approximately 10 % for plants grown in different media.

2500|$|It {{is often}} claimed by growers and breeders of herbal {{cannabis}} that advances in breeding and cultivation techniques {{have increased the}} potency of cannabis since the late 1960s and early '70s when THC was first discovered and understood. However, potent seedless cannabis such as [...] "Thai sticks" [...] were already available at that time. Sinsemilla (Spanish for [...] "without seed") is the dried, seedless inflorescences of female cannabis plants. Because THC production drops off once pollination occurs, the male plants (which produce little THC themselves) are eliminated before they shed pollen to prevent pollination. Advanced cultivation techniques such as <b>hydroponics,</b> cloning, high-intensity artificial lighting, and the sea of green method are frequently employed as a response (in part) to prohibition enforcement efforts that make outdoor cultivation more risky.
