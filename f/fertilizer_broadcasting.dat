40|$|In {{the past}} two years, ICRISAT, in {{collaboration}} with other International Agricultural Research Centres, National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems, has been evaluating and promoting point or hill application of fertilizer along with “Warrantage” in three West African countries, namely, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The hill application of fertilizers consists of applying small doses of fertilizer in the planting hills of millet and sorghum. The combination of strategic hill application of fertilizer with complementary institutional and market linkages, through an inventory credit system (known as “Warrantage”) offers {{a good opportunity to}} improve crop productivity and farmers’ incomes. Results from the two year on-farm trials showed that, on average, in all the three countries, grain yields of millet and sorghum were greater by 44 to 120 % while incomes of farmers increased by 52 to 134 % when using hill application of fertilizer than with the earlier recommended <b>fertilizer</b> <b>broadcasting</b> methods and farmers’ practice. Substantial net profits were obtained by farmers using “Warrantage”. Farmers’ access to credit and inputs was improved substantially through the “Warrantage” system. The technology has reached up to 12650 farm households in the three countries and efforts are in progress to further scale-up and out the technology to wider geographical area...|$|E

Field trials on Sandy and Loam soils were conducted to test the effects of rock phosphate on sweet corn. These effects were investigated by studying the height, dry weight and phosphorus uptake of plants grown in soils banded with 0 - 90 lb P 2 O 5 /AFS. The results were moderate increases in plant height with applied rock phosphorus. The laboratory studies entailed oven drying forty day old corn plants to obtain their dry weights, then grinding and ashing the plants in order to extract the phosphorus through the phospho-molybdo-vanadate-nitric acid method. The phosphorus extraction showed a direct correlation between applied rock phosphate and phosphorus uptake by the plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the economic feasibility of small scale organic production of rice, common bean and maize in Goias State, Brazil. During 2004 / 05 and 2005 / 06 growing seasons, rice, common bean and maize were produced at the organic farm of Embrapa Rice and Beans in five mulching systems (fallow, Crotalaria juncea, Cajanus cajan, Mucuna aterrima and Sorghum bicolor), with and without tillage. Soil tillage consisted of heavy disc harrowing followed by light disc harrowing. All operations and used inputs were recorded. Based on those records, the production costs for each crop were estimated for each cropping season. The costs included operations like sowing, ploughing, harrowing, spraying, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>broadcasting</b> and harvesting, as well as inputs like seeds, inoculant strains of Rhizobium, neem oil and organic fertilizers. The benefits include the gross revenue obtained by multiplying the production amount with the market price for non-organic products. For the purpose of analysis of competitiveness of organic production in comparison to conventional farming the market prices assumed were those of conventional production. In the analysis, the costs of certification were not considered yet due to lack of certifiers in the region. For comparison between traits, net revenue, the benefit-cost-ratio (BCR) and the break even point were used. In 2004 / 05 growing season the BCR varied from 0. 27 for common bean on S. bicolor mulch system with tillage up to 4. 05 for green harvested maize produced after C. juncea in no tillage system. Common bean and rice were not economically viable in this growing season. In 2005 / 06 growing season the BCR varied between 0. 75 for common bean after S. bicolor in tillage system and 4. 50 for green harvested maize produced after fallow in no tillage system.

In addition, the distribution of fertilizer P in the soil was to be examined in comparing the placement methods. Leaf, plant, and grain analyses were also to be used in determining the phosphorus status in the corn plants grown on plots on which the various placement methods had been applied.

40|$|The {{application}} of nitrogen (N) fertilizers is still insufficient across cropping systems in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, while plant uptake of nitrogen is often inefficient and wasteful even when farmers apply fertilizers. This leaves sizable room for improving the productivity of crops and managing nutrient cycles. Fertilizer deep placement is a technology designed to enhance the efficiency of nutrient delivery to crops by placing granulated fertilizer directly in the root zone. Deep placement maximizes nutrient uptake by crops while using less <b>fertilizer</b> than surface <b>broadcasting,</b> and minimizes N losses due to runoff and ammonia volatilization. Urea deep placement (UDP) technology has been widely adopted in lowland paddy rice production systems in South Asia, especially in Bangladesh. There is a growing interest to scale up UDP adoption in West African countries, such as Ghana and Senegal, but {{a limited number of}} studies have been published from the region to support developing strategies. To contribute to the evidence-base, we use a grid-based cropping systems modeling framework, combined with analyses on the characterization of UDP and its geospatial targeting, and map the extent of biophysical suitability for UDP across regions in Ghana and Senegal and estimate potential yield increases under this technology.

Spectrum) in 1987 and 1988 summer seasons in Eastern Europe. Spring wheat was grown under rainfed conditions with the following treatments. Control N 0 P 0 K 0 No fertilizer applied (T 1); N 90 P 90 K 60 applied as incorporated basal fertilizers before planting (T 2); N 45 P 90 K 60 applied as incorporated basal fertilizers before planting and N 45 applied at tillering stage by broadcasting method (T 3); N 45 P 90 K 60 applied as incorporated basal fertilizers before planting, N 15 at tillering, N 15 at stem elongation and N 15 at heading stages by broadcast method (T 4); N 45 P 90 K 60 applied as incorporated basal fertilizers before planting, N 15 at tillering, N 15 at stem elongation and N 15 at heading stages by foliar application method (T 5) and N 45 P 90 K 60 applied as incorporated basal fertilizers before planting, N 15 at tillering, N 15 at stem elongation and N 15 at heading stages banded as a solution in the root system zone of both sides of plant rows (T 6). Data showed that there was a distinct pattern of nitrate movement down the soil profile as the nitrate bulge became more pronounced with depth across all phenological stages of wheat plants in both years of the study. During the first and second seasons of study soil profile NO 3 -N content steadily decreased from tillering to anthesis before rapidly increasing just after anthesis to mature stages. Single basal N fertilizer applications before planting (T 2) and single split application of N 45 at tillering stage by broadcasting (T 3) had the most significant decline in nitrate content (0. 13 mg/ 100 g soil) between tillering and anthesis. Comparatively small decreases in nitrate content between the two growth stages were recorded in T 5 and T 6 (0. 07 mg/ 100 g soil). The decline in nitrate content from tillering to anthesis coincided with peak uptake of N from the soil by wheat plants. Highest and lowest decreases in soil nitrate indicated the lowest and highest NUE associated with the treatments respectively. Wheat plants normally cease uptake of N from the soil by the boot stage even at higher N application rates. N <b>fertilizer</b> placements by <b>broadcasting</b> have been reported to be least efficient in recent reviews on N fertility management. This study, however, recorded the most significant maintenance of elevated amounts of NO 3 -N in the soil profile even at peak N uptake by wheat plants in plots where triple split applications of N were undertaken by broadcasting (T 4). Triple split applications of N <b>fertilizer</b> by <b>broadcasting</b> method maintain comparatively higher amounts of NO 3 -N in the soil profile than single split N applications by broadcasting (T 3). Foliar triple split applications (T 5) and triple split applications of N by banding in solution form (T 6) had similar effects on the distributions and fluctuations of NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N in the soil profile. Soil profile NH 4 -N accumulations were highest at tillering (3. 97 mg/ 100 g soil) before rapidly thinning out to 0. 12 mg/ 100 g soil in the plough layer in plots where all N was applied as incorporated basal fertilizer before planting in the second season of the study. Single split applications of N 45 at tillering stage had significant bulge of NH 4 -N in both the plough (0. 40 mg/ 100 g soil) and upper subsoil (0. 31 mg/ 100 g soil) compared with triple split applications in rates of N 15 in the first season of the study...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this report forms part of the endeavour to draw up guidelines for successful implementation of ploughless tillage techniques (cultivation to 10 cm replacing ploughing). Results and experiences from over 120 field trials carried out during the period 1975 - 86 are presented in the first section. On average, use of ploughless tillage has meant reduced yields of winter wheat, spring barley, winter and spring oilseed rape and sugarbeet and somewhat improved yields of oats, first year grass leys and potatoes. The results from ploughless tillage were generally improved by use of twin mounted tractor tires instead of single mounted, placement of artificial <b>fertilizer</b> instead of <b>broadcasting</b> and removal of straw. Incidence of seeding weeds increased on average by 25 % and stoloniferous weeds by 100 %. Most suitable soils were peats, sandy Loamy tills, silty Loams or silty clay loams and heavy clays. The second section consists of results of soil physical and chemical investigations carried out during 1980 - 1984. Soil physical changes observed included increased compaction in mid-topsoil, improved saturated hydraulic conductivity in the Lower topsoil and upper subsoil and improved aggregate stability in the seedbed. Reduced rate of evaporation Was also recorded in a pilot investigation. Soil chemical investigations showed increased Levels of readily-soluble phosphorus and potassium in the surface Layer and reduced Levels in mid- and Lower topsoil. Humus content also increased in the surface Layer and decreased in mid- and Lower topsoil. No relationship was found between pH and cultivation technique. On {{the basis of the}} results obtained, a procedure to evaluate site suitability for ploughless tillage is described. The effects of ploughless tillage on root development and evaporation were investigated in 1985 and results from these investigations are described in a third section of this report. Root studies showed that root development was invariably obstructed in mid-topsoil, an effect ascribed to high mechanical resistance. Studies on evaporation showed that ploughless tillage, in contrast to conventional tillage, gave a better effect of reduced evaporation after a wet followed by a dry period than after a wholly dry period. It was also shown that superficial incorporation of harvest residues gave a better effect of reduced evaporation on a silty clay Loam than on a heavy clay. In conclusion, results and experiences obtained from these investigations are used to suggest practical measures for best applying ploughless tillage while minimizing those problems arising when soil is no Longer ploughed annually...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyCharles W. RiceAgricultural lands {{receiving}} N inputs {{are considered}} {{the primary source of}} N 2 O, a potent greenhouse gas. N fertilizer management has shown variable effects on both N 2 O losses and corn grain yield. The objectives of this study were {{to assess the impact of}} N source and placement on N 2 O emissions, fertilizer-induced emission factor (FIEF), corn grain yield, yield-scaled N 2 O emissions (YSNE) and N fertilizer recovery efficiency (NFRE). The experiment was conducted from 2013 through 2014 at the Agronomy North Farm located at Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS. The soil was a moderately well-drained Kennebec silt loam. The treatments were broadcast urea (BC-Urea), broadcast urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) (BC-UAN), broadcast coated urea (BC-CU), surface-band UAN (SB-UAN), subsurface-band UAN (SSB-UAN), subsurface-band UAN + nitrification inhibitor (SSB-UAN+I) and a 0 N control. In 2013, SSB- UAN emitted significantly more N 2 O (2. 4 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1), whereas control (0. 3 kg ha- 1) and BC- UAN (0. 6 kg ha- 1) emitted the least. In 2014, most treatments emitted between 3. 3 and 2. 5 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1. Only SSB-UAN+I (1. 03 kg ha- 1) and control (0. 26 kg ha- 1) were significantly lower. The use of a nitrification inhibitor decreased N 2 O emissions by 62 % and 55 % in 2013 and 2014, respectively. BC treatments had cumulative emissions significantly higher in 2014 compared to 2013. Only SSB-UAN+I had a significantly lower FIEF (0. 4 %), and 2013 FIEF (0. 68 %) was significantly lower than that of 2014 (1. 38 %). In 2013, banded treatments had significantly higher grain yields (from 9. 1 to 10. 5 Mg ha- 1), whereas in 2014 fewer differences among N treatments were observed, ranging from 7. 2 to 8. 6 Mg ha- 1. Banded treatments had significantly lower grain yields in 2014 compared to 2013. Only BC-UAN and SSB-UAN+I had significantly lower YSNE, and 2013 had lower YSNE than 2014. In 2013, SSB-UAN had the greatest NFRE, whereas BC treatments had the lowest. In 2014, N treatments did not differ in NFRE. SSB-UAN and SSB-UAN+I had significantly lower NFRE values in 2014 compared to 2013. Fertilizer source and placement have the potential to mitigate N 2 O emissions and promote high yields and NFRE in corn, however, the response is dependent on the rainfall pattern after fertilizer application. The option of banding UAN without any additive promoted higher N 2 O losses on a year when precipitation was well distributed, but also enhanced grain yield and NFRE. On the other hand, under the same precipitation conditions, <b>broadcasting</b> N <b>fertilizer</b> promoted lower N 2 O losses, grain yield and NFRE, but those were all improved in a wet year. Therefore, the subsurface band placement would be the best option under a normal year, whereas <b>broadcasting</b> <b>fertilizer</b> would be the best option under a wetter year. Further, the use of NI with subsurface band UAN provides the most sustainable option, since the NI decreased N 2 O losses compared to UAN alone in both years. Further research should evaluate N source and placement combinations under different environments in order to better understand how they impact crop performance and the negative environmental aspects of N fertilization. It is important to test those treatments under different precipitation scenarios and look for trends that indicate the best N management option at the local level...|$|R
