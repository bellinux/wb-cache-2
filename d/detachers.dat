The stocks entering and leaving the drum <b>detachers</b> applied on the different reduction passages in two industrial mills were intercepted and employed in the experiments. The changes in the flour release and flour ash content were followed. The results show that the drum <b>detachers</b> are effective in disrupting the flakes formed in the smooth roller mills grinding zone. However, the contribution of the drum <b>detachers</b> to the overall milling efficiency is in close correlation with the nature of the formed flakes. If the flakes are primarily composed of endosperm particles, the employment of drum detacher results in a statistically significant increase of the flour yields without deterioration of flour quality. If flakes, formed on the end passages of the reduction system, contain large portion of branny particles, the increase of the flour ash content following the drum detacher is statistically significant.

40|$|Inability {{to unwind}} about work during leisure {{time has been}} {{associated}} with a number of negative health outcomes. This study was concerned with a possible behavioural pathway between unwinding and disease and examined the relationship between work-related rumination and food choice. Work-related rumination is arguably a core to understanding the ‘unwinding process’, and food choice is a well-established indicator of nutritional health. Two hundred and sixty-eight full-time workers from a range of white-collar occupations completed a self-report measure of ruminative thinking about work and an eating behaviour questionnaire. Three types of ruminative thinking were identified by factor analysis and labelled affective rumination, problem-solving pondering and detachment. In terms of food choice, high-relative to low-affective ruminators reported eating more unhealthy foods, and low <b>detachers</b> reported eating less cooked meals and more processed foods compared to high <b>detachers.</b> Problem-solving pondering was not associated with food choice, and none of the factors were associated with healthy food choice. It was concluded that failure to unwind from work is not necessarily related to unhealthy food choices. What appears to be the crucial factor is the type of perseverative thinking that people engage in post-work. Limitations and future directions are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Discussions {{about the}} alleged “death of class ” and “individualization” {{indicate}} {{the need for an}} in-depth analysis of the assumptions underlying the class concept. The authors focus on the distinction between two aspects of the class concept following Weber’s theory of causality. As a concept “devoid of meaning, ” class refers to probabilistic influences of the occupational world on human behaviour in social relationships outside work. As a concept of “meaningful ” human behaviour, class refers to the typical conduct of occupational groups at work. Following John H. Goldthorpe’s call for the complementarity of statistics and hermeneutics, the authors argue that the measurement of class- and domain-specific causal attributions can help to test hypotheses on the microstructures of unequal life courses. This view makes intelligible the class-related differences in behaviour within and away from the work environment and the consequences of differential attributions of cause and effect for inequality.

40|$|The {{principles}} for milking the high-producing cow {{are the same}} as for any other dairy cow: her teats should be clean and dry for milking; she should be milked gently, quickly and completely with minimal machine stripping or overmilking. However, these principles need to be applied in different ways because high-producing cows have: 1) a lower pre-milking stimulus requirement compared with low-producing cows, 2) higher peak milking rates and higher average flowrates (in spite of this, high producers take longer to milk), 3) poorer teat-end condition, 4) higher risk of new mastitis infections. Although less time and effort is needed for deliberate manual stimulation in high-producing herds, there is a progressively greater need for meticulous care and attention to ensure teats are clean and dry before milking to minimize the increased risk of mastitis. Healthy teat skin provides the best defence against all types of mastitis pathogens. Teat condition can be improved, and milking times per cow reduced by use of excellent milking procedures and adjusting the take-off settings of automatic <b>detachers.</b> The new performance-based ISO international standards for milking installations can be used, with confidence, to evaluate the “system ” components of existing milking systems. The results of milking-time tests (measurements or observations made while milking cows) are the best and most direct indicator of the performance of milking units...|$|E
40|$|The term {{rumination}} {{is commonly}} used to describe negative phenomenological experiences and is related {{to a number of}} psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, social phobia, anger, worry and the persistence of negative mood and thinking. Research also indicates an association between rumination and the development and/or sustenance of cognitive and emotional problems (Ehring, Frank, & Ehkers, 2008; Segertom, Tsao, Alden, & Craske, 2003; Watkins et al., 2007). Over recent years there has been an increasing focus on rumination and other pressures and strains that may exist on a more daily basis. This is the focus on the present thesis which addresses links between rumination, work stress, recovery and well being. Previous research has also tended to conceptualise rumination as a univariate construct whereas the present thesis takes a more complex approach and conceptualises rumination within a tripartite model. The primary aim of this thesis was to develop and evaluate a new measure of rumination within the tripartite perspective and to assess links with health indices such as physical symptoms, blood pressure, sleep and eating behaviour in the context of how people unwind in their leisure time. The thesis consists of four empirical studies. Study 1 was designed to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a new measure of rumination which operationalised three different types of work related rumination labelled: affective rumination, problem solving and detachment. This was then evaluated on a large sample of workers using factor analysis, reliability analysis and cluster analysis. Further this study examined the relationship between the three types of rumination and psychosomatic symptoms. The second study involved a confirmatory factor analysis of this scale and in addition investigated whether these three components of rumination were associated with differences in cardiovascular activity and leisure activities using a longitudinal diary based methodology. Study 3 further explored this approach to rumination with a focus on sleep problems and differences in participants' leisure activities by ruminator type. Study 4 explored the association between work rumination and eating behaviour. The results showed that the new measurement tool consisted of three robust factors with good reliability. This was confirmed throughout the thesis. Results also indicated differences between the different types of ruminators. In particular, affective ruminators scored higher on physical symptoms and had highest intake of unhealthy foods in contrast to the <b>detachers</b> and problem solvers. In contrast problem solver ruminators reported consuming more unhealthy foods and scored higher on physical symptoms than <b>detachers.</b> Results also showed that workers who ruminate about work-related issues failed to reduce their diastolic blood pressure in the evening, in contrast {{to the rest of the}} workers. The results showed no differences between the three groups in terms of their sleep patterns and cardiovascular activity. There were also no differences between the three ruminator types and pattern leisure time activities with all engaging in low effort activities in the evening. These results support the theory that inadequate recovery, or poor disengagement from work leads to physical-illness symptoms and health problems and indicate that rather than it just being rumination per se which may be detrimental to health, it is the type of rumination that is predictive. Future work could use this tripartite operationalisation of rumination to examine other behavioural and physiological factors that influence the process of recovery from work and their impact on additional health indices to further our understanding of the unwinding process...|$|E
40|$|Le {{district}} minier Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes) est connu pour avoir été exploité dès la fin du Chalcolithique et au Bronze ancien. Le minerai, une bornite massive très riche, était traité sur un atelier situé à 250 m en contrebas de la mine. Les travaux miniers les plus importants se situent sur la branche ouest du gîte à l’endroit appelé Tranchée des Anciens, où les mineurs ont exploité la veine verticale de minerai, comprise entre des quartzites et des chloritoschistes. L’exploitation en surface de la branche est du gîte est plus discrète. Mis à part quelques grattages vers 2 650 m d’altitude, le travail le plus intéressant se situe {{au niveau}} d’une recherche moderne (travers-banc 0). C’est une amorce de tranchée taillée au feu datée du début du Bronze ancien soit entre 3366 ± 42 BP (1750 - 1520 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58833) et 3524 ± 41 BP (1960 - 1730 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58831), ce qui est exceptionnel dans les Alpes. On y a observé une série de cuvettes thermiques creusées dans les schistes, résultant de l’allumage de foyers, remplies de charbons et de roches éclatées. Un foyer placé contre la paroi, dernier état d’une attaque abandonnée, a montré trois niveaux bien individualisés, dont le plus profond était riche en bois carbonisés. Un maillet en riébeckite a servi à <b>détacher</b> le minerai de la roche encaissante. Le charbon de bois issu du remplissage a permis de réaliser une étude anthracologique qui a corroboré les résultats déjà obtenus sur la mine et l’atelier. Les trois espèces arborescentes identifiées dans les échantillons révèlent un choix délibéré dans l’utilisation du combustible pour l’abattage au feu, en l’occurrence le pin cembro. Le mélèze et le bouleau sont anecdotiques, tandis que dans la mine la préférence est allée au pin sylvestre/ pin à crochets. L’étude confirme aussi que les hommes ont utilisé le bois qu’ils avaient à proximité, que la végétation alpine autour du site était bien plus forestière qu’elle ne l’est {{de nos jours}} et que l’activité minière a contribué à la déforestation du versant ainsi qu’à la raréfaction du pin cembro. The copper deposit of Clausis Saint-Véran (Hautes-Alpes, France) is a lens of ore included between an oceanic substratum, with serpentinite and shale, and a sedimentary cover with marble and quartzite with riebeckite. The sulphide ore is a high-grade massive bornite (45 / 65 % copper) associated with native copper. Prehistoric mining activity was located between 2 400 and 2 600 metres, and thus represents the highest mine in Europe for this period. The miners excavated the ore systematically in the oxidation rich outcrop, from the soft shale, {{in contact with the}} ore, up to a wall of quartzite. The mined ore was then taken down into the valley, 250 metres below the level of the mine, to the mineralogical/ metallurgical workshop of Cabane des Clausis for treatment. The metallurgists used all the technical processes necessary to change the ore into copper metal : hand-picking, washing, crushing and smelting. The earliest date obtained is 3815 ± 50 BP (2460 - 2140 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 22621), cf. Barge, 2002 and 2003; Barge ed., 2006. On the main vein, the most important extraction was from an open cut called Tranchée des Anciens. In places, the irregular and rounded rock faces show tool-prints (fine grooves, hammer marks) resulting from green stone picks and grooved mauls. Numerous well-conserved waterlogged wood fragments (pit-props, floor planks, sticks from torches) have dated the exploitation to between 3656 ± 44 BP (2189 - 1888 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 36604) and 3418 ± 43 BP (1877 - 1618 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 36603). However the presence of charcoal remains is not necessarily proof of fire-setting in the mine, as they could come from torches. A second old mine working was discovered on the eastern branch of the copper deposit, {{at the top of the}} outcrop at an altitude of 2 650 m. Here, short excavations were dug into small secondary mineral veins (native copper ?). They show the prehistoric workers’ intensive search to collect copper ore from the slightest irregularities of the rock. Contrary to all expectations, traces of the fire-setting technique were found in this second zone, little studied previously. This exploitation, situated near a modern prospection (gallery no. 0) on a quartzite outcrop between shale and ophiolite, has been dated to the Early Bronze Age, between 3366 ± 42 BP (1750 - 1520 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58833) and 3524 ± 41 BP (1960 - 1730 cal. BC [2 σ] : Tucson AA 58831), which remains exceptional in the Southern Alps. This open cut, excavated over a surface of 5 m 2, show a succession of circular or oval thermal hollows containing broken stones and charcoals. These hollows are the result of successive and contiguous fires with a diameter of 0. 60 m. A hearth structure was preserved against the rock face and represents the last stage of an abandoned fire-setting attempt. The cross-section shows three particularly well characterised levels : a superficial filling material above a dense level of brown and grey sediments with numerous small plates of shale and quartz, then an unstable level with small plates of shale and quartz and charcoal. The ore was extracted with stone tools like those discovered in situ, including a riebeckite maul bearing percussion marks. Numerous small and dense cup-like marks are also visible on the green shale. More than one kilo of charcoals was collected during the excavation of the fire-setting open cut and from thermal hollows or hearths. From the point of view of species selection, it is obvious that the anthracological assemblage is not very rich. Only three species were identified, all trees. They were Pinus Cembra, largely dominant in our results, larch and pubescent birch. No shrubs, such as juniper, bilberry or rhododendron, were identified, pointing to a deliberate choice of the wood used. Pinus Cembra was especially selected for fire-setting, while larch and birch were merely occasional. On the contrary, the results of the anthracological study of the underground workings showed a preference for Norway pine/ Mugho pine. These results confirm those of the anthracological analysis of the fire-setting open cut, the underground workings and the mineralogical/ metallurgical workshop. Therefore, anthracological analysis of the material found in the fire-setting open cut at Saint-Veran provides interesting information about the choice of the combustible used preferentially for fire-setting, i. e. Pinus Cembra. It also proves that the alpine vegetation around the site was more wooded than at present and that prehistoric men used the wood found nearby. Thus, the mining activity largely contributed to deforestation of the mountainside and to rarefaction of the Pinus Cembra. Barge-Mahieu Hélène, Talon Brigitte.
