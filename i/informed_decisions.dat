5|$|Smallpeice {{formally}} joined BOAC on 1 January 1950, {{taking the}} title and role of financial comptroller. The title reflected his intention to provide useful financial information to managers within the company, allowing them to take <b>informed</b> <b>decisions,</b> rather than dictating what the company would be doing from head office. The financial comptroller position became a board position in 1953, and accordingly Smallpeice {{was appointed to the}} board. He would then be promoted to the additional position of deputy chief executive in June 1954.|$|E

5|$|Three related {{targets of}} MDG5 were {{adolescent}} birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were {{monitored by the}} Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Contraceptive use was part of Goal 5B (universal access to reproductive health), as Indicator 5.3. The evaluation of MDG5 in 2015 showed that amongst couples usage had increased worldwide from 55% to 64%. {{with one of the}} largest increases in Subsaharan Africa (13 to 28%). The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own <b>informed</b> <b>decisions</b> regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care (p.31).|$|E

40|$|Background: It is {{believed}} that making an <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> about (screening) participation is associated with better health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes. This is the first study in cancer screening to explore this association in subjects participating in a lung cancer computed tomography (CT) screening trial. Methods: Participants that made either an <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> to participate (n = 155) or not (n = 133) were selected for this study. Differences in HRQoL, measured as generic HRQoL (Short Form 12 [SF- 12] and EuroQol questionnaire [EQ- 5 D]), anxiety/distress (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI- 6], Impact of Event Scale [IES] and Consequences of Screening-Lung Cancer [COS-LC]), were tested with Mann-Whitney U tests and ANOVA at three assessment points (when deciding about participation, before trial randomisation and 2 months after receiving the CT result). Results: Subjects who made an <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> to participate had no better scores {{than those who did}} not make an <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> for 23 out of 24 HRQoL comparisons, except for a better mean score for mental health (Mental Component Summary (MCS) = 53. 9 +/- 9. 2 versus 51. 0 +/- 10. 1, p = 0. 003) before randomisation. For subjects with an indeterminate CT result (n = 64), no significant differences were found between subjects with (n = 35) or without (n = 29) an <b>informed</b> <b>decision.</b> Conclusion: Subjects who did not make an <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> to participate in lung cancer CT screening trial did not experience worse HRQoL during screening than subjects who did make an <b>informed</b> <b>decision,</b> either in general or after receiving an indeterminate result.

40|$|<b>Informed</b> <b>decision</b> {{making about}} {{participation}} {{has become an}} explicit purpose in invitations for screening programmes in western countries. An informed choice is commonly defined as based on: (i) adequate levels of knowledge of the screening and (ii) agreement between the invitee's values towards own screening participation and actual (intention to) participation. We systematically reviewed published studies that empirically evaluated the effects of interventions aiming at enhancing <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making in screening programmes targeted at the general population. We focused on prenatal screening and neonatal screening for diseases of the foetus/new-born and screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. The Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for studies published till April 2012, using the terms 'informed choice', 'decision making' and 'mass screening' separately and in combination and terms referring to the specific screening programmes. Of the 2238 titles identified, 15 studies were included, which evaluated decision aids (DAs), information leaflets, film, video, counselling and a specific screening visit for <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making in prenatal screening, breast and colorectal cancer screening. Most of the included studies evaluated DAs and showed improved knowledge and <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making. Due to {{the limited number of}} studies the results could not be synthesized. The empirical evidence regarding interventions to improve <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making in screening is limited. It is unknown which strategies to enhance <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making are most effective, although DAs are promising.

40|$|Making an <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> about {{participation}} in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening may be challenging for invitees with lower health literacy skills. The {{aim of this}} systematic review is to explore {{to what extent the}} level of a person’s health literacy is related to their <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making concerning CRC screening. We searched for peer-reviewed studies published between 1950 and May 2013 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO. Studies were included when health literacy was studied in relation to concepts underpinning <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making (awareness, risk perception, perceived barriers and benefits, knowledge, attitude, deliberation). The quality of the studies was determined and related to the study results. The search returned 2254 papers. Eight studies in total were included, among which seven focused on knowledge, four focused on attitudes or beliefs concerning CRC screening, and one focused on risk perception. The studies found either no association or a positive association between health literacy and concepts underpinning <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making. Some studies showed that higher health literacy was associated with more CRC screening knowledge and a more positive attitude toward CRC screening. The results of studies that obtained a lower quality score were no different than studies that obtained a higher quality score. In order to obtain more insight into the association between health literacy and <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making in CRC cancer screening, future research should study the multiple aspects of <b>informed</b> <b>decision</b> making in conjunction instead of single aspects...|$|R

The app-based field or crop monitoring also lowers the hassles of managing crops at multiple locations. For example, farmers can now detect which areas have been fertilised (or mistakenly missed), if the land is too dry and predict future yields.|$|E
25|$|The {{answer to}} the appellant's action lay in the navy's offer of an {{alternative}} post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given {{the background of the}} appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to make <b>informed</b> <b>decisions.</b> The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer was anything but superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by fairness to deal with him. His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute fair dealing. The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.|$|E

Under Bloomberg's leadership, the city passed a Green Carts bill, which supports mobile produce vendors in lower-income areas; expanded farmers' markets using the city's Health Bucks program which provides coupons to eligible individuals to buy produce at farmers' markets in lower-income areas; and committed $111 million in capital funding for playground improvements.
