5|$|The last {{assignment}} for Armstrong in the Gemini program was as the back-up Command Pilot for Gemini 11, announced {{two days after}} the landing of Gemini 8. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> systems and was more in a teaching role for the rookie backup Pilot, William Anders. The launch was on September 12, 1966, with Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as CAPCOM.|$|E
5|$|In January 1977, Victor diSuvero and {{his firm}} Sapphire-Yogo Mines became the next owner {{to tackle the}} Yogo dike. DiSuvero was a {{native-born}} Italian {{who grew up in}} Tientsin, China, and had been successful with a jade mine in California. DiSuvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mining side of the business. Unable to make payments, his venture folded in late 1979.|$|E

In 1904 Clement traveled to Hawarden, Iowa to watch her brother Hank pitch in a semi-professional game. The umpire for the amateur game taking place before Hank's did not show, and Hank suggested that Amanda, who had played baseball with her brothers and was <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game, serve as the umpire. In so doing, Clement became the first woman paid to umpire a baseball game. Her performance was so well received that she was hired to umpire further semi-professional games.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|After Wilfrid's {{return to}} Northumbria in about 658, Cenwalh, King of Wessex, {{recommended}} Wilfrid to Alhfrith, Oswiu's son, as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy. Alhfrith was a sub-king of Deiria under his father's rule, {{and the most}} likely heir to his father's throne as his half-brothers were still young. Shortly before 664 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a monastery he had recently founded at Ripon, formed around a group of monks from Melrose Abbey, followers of the Irish monastic customs. Wilfrid ejected the abbot, Eata, because he would not follow the Roman customs; Cuthbert, later a saint, was another of the monks expelled. Wilfrid introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into Ripon, claiming {{that he was the}} first person in England to make a monastery follow it, but this claim rests on the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi and does not say where Wilfrid became <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Rule, nor exactly what form of the Rule was being referred to. Shortly afterwards Wilfrid was ordained a priest by Agilbert, Bishop of Dorchester in the kingdom of the Gewisse, part of Wessex. Wilfrid was a protégé of Agilbert, who later helped in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop. The monk Ceolfrith was attracted to Ripon from Gilling Abbey, which had recently been depopulated {{as a result of the}} plague. Ceolfrith later became Abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow during the time the medieval chronicler and writer Bede was a monk there. Bede hardly mentions the relationship between Ceolfrith and Wilfrid, but it was Wilfrid who consecrated Ceolfrith a priest and who gave permission for him to transfer to Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E

The two eventually became engaged, and, on July 5, 1946, Miss Talavera and Ahn were married, The two went to the island of Majorca, where Ahn founded the Orquesta Sinfónica de Mallorca. In the same year, he sought to work in the United States, but his past association with Strauss, who was regarded as tainted by his work with the Nazi regime, obstructed his goal for two years; in the end, however, he was admitted into the Philadelphia Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} among American physicians as {{to whether}} the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Around the world there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of physician assisted death, or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the Hemlock Society of the United States and the Dignity in Dying campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient’s life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{political}} knowledge on the attitudes of European citizens towards the possible distribution of responsibilities between European level institutions and national governments in three policy areas: foreign policy, defence and immigration policy. The hypothesis tested is that if citizens are not <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> how <b>the</b> EU works, {{they are more likely}} to be wrong <b>about</b> <b>the</b> consequences of a mismatch in the allocation of competences. In order to identify the causal e¤ect of political knowledge on attitudes we use an instrumental variables approach. The results show that more informed citizens have a considerably higher probability of being in favour of the process of EU integration...|$|R

25|$|User {{submission}} to the database is encouraged. To {{contribute to the}} database, one must submit: contact info, PubMed identifier and the two molecules that interact. The person who submits a record {{is the owner of}} it. All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance. BIND curation has two tracks: high-throughput (HTP) and low-throughput (LTP). HTP records are from papers which have reported more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology. HTP curators typically have a bioinformatics backgrounds. The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications. LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research. LTP curators are given further training through the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops. Information on small molecule chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> subject. The priority for BIND curation is to focus on LTP to collect information as it is published. Although, HTP studies provide more information at once, there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks. In 2004, BIND collected data from 110 journals.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} research {{in recent times}} {{on the role of}} cognitive variables among the set of factors that can lead to rape. A detailed conceptual analysis shows that objectification might underlie denial of agency and personhood that leads to rape. Sexually violent men {{have been shown to be}} more likely to consider victims responsible for the rape and are less <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> impact of rape on victims. Such men may misread cues given out by women in social situations and may lack the inhibitions that act to suppress associations between sex and aggression. They may have coercive sexual fantasies, and overall are more hostile towards women than are men who are not sexually violent. In addition to these factors, sexually violent men are believed to differ from other men in terms of impulsivity and antisocial tendencies. They also tend to have an exaggerated sense of masculinity. Sexual violence is also associated with a preference for impersonal sexual relationships as opposed to emotional bonding, with having many sexual partners and with the inclination to assert personal interests at the expense of others. A further association is with adversarial attitudes on gender, that hold that women are opponents to be challenged and conquered.|$|E
25|$|The Army Council instead sanctioned {{a mortar}} attack on Downing Street, and in mid-1990 two IRA members {{travelled}} to London {{to plan the}} attack. One of the IRA members was <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> trajectory of mortars and the other, from the IRA's Belfast Brigade, was familiar with their manufacture. An active service unit bought a Ford Transit van and rented a garage, and an IRA co-ordinator procured the explosives and materials {{needed to make the}} mortars. The IRA unit began making the mortars and cutting a hole in the roof of the van for the mortars to be fired through. They reconnoitred locations in Whitehall to find a suitable place from which the mortars could be fired at the back of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence and office. Once preparations were complete the two IRA members returned to Ireland, as the IRA leadership considered them valuable personnel and did not wish to risk them being arrested in any follow-up operation by the security services. In November 1990 Margaret Thatcher unexpectedly resigned from office, but the Army Council decided the planned attack should still go ahead, targeting her successor John Major. The IRA planned to attack when Major and his ministers were likely to be meeting at Downing Street, and waited until the date of a planned cabinet meeting was publicly known.|$|E

Specifically, the model explains how the top management team’s (TMT’s) information technology (IT) knowledge and experience impact both assimilation and firm performance. The hypotheses were tested using survey data from SMEs that have implemented COSES. Results from structural equation modeling suggest that SMEs benefit, through higher levels of assimilation and performance, from adopting innovative enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems such as COSES {{when they have a}} TMT that has experience with and is <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>about</b> technology. <b>The</b> study also highlights the importance of the TMT in facilitating IT assimilation...|$|R
