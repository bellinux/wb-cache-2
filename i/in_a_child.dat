5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} in the Protestant line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E

25|$|Neglect {{is a type}} of maltreatment {{related to}} the failure to provide needed, age-appropriate care, {{supervision}} and protection. It is {{not to be confused with}} abuse, which, in this context, is defined as any action that intentionally harms or injures another person. Neglect most often happens during childhood by the parents or caretakers. Oftentimes, parents who are guilty of neglect were also neglected as children. The long-term effects of neglect are reduced physical, emotional, and mental health <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and throughout adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Treatment for {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{also depends}} upon {{the severity of the}} curvature, the spine’s potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild scoliosis (less than 30 degrees deviation) may simply be monitored and treated with exercise. Moderately severe scoliosis (30–45 degrees) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> who is still growing may require bracing. Severe curvatures that rapidly progresses may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement. Bracing may prevent a progressive curvature, but evidence for this is not very strong. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results.|$|E

25|$|Common {{causes for}} acute liver failure are {{paracetamol}} (acetaminophen) overdose, idiosyncratic reaction to medication (e.g. tetracycline, troglitazone), excessive alcohol consumption (severe alcoholic hepatitis), viral hepatitis (hepatitis A or B — {{it is extremely}} uncommon in hepatitis C), acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and idiopathic (without an obvious cause). Reye syndrome is acute liver failure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with a viral infection (e.g. chickenpox); it appears that aspirin use may play a significant role.

According to another story, they disguised themselves as merchants bearing trinkets and weaponry, and Achilles was marked out from the other women for admiring weaponry instead of clothes and jewelry.|$|E

25|$|Azathioprine {{can cause}} birth defects. A 2003 {{population-based}} study in Denmark {{showed that the}} use of azathioprine and related mercaptopurine resulted in a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. Birth defects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> whose father was taking azathioprine have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed. Transplant patients already on this drug should not discontinue on becoming pregnant. This contrasts with the later-developed drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which are contraindicated during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> custody case {{following}} a divorce, {{a woman was}} denied custody of her children outside of holidays for various reasons, including her membership of Jehovah's Witnesses; {{the court of appeals}} of Nîmes considered that the educational rules applied by the Witnesses to their children were essentially inappropriate because of their hardness, their intolerance, and the obligation for children to practice proselytism. The case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled that the court should have based its decision on the mother's actual handling of her children and not on abstract, general notions pertaining to the mother's religious affiliation.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} case studies of {{language}} acquisition <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with delayed linguistic development outside of studies on deaf children. Susan Curtiss argued that, even if humans possess the innate ability to acquire language, Genie demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start. Since Genie never fully acquired grammar, Curtiss submitted that Genie provided evidence for a weaker variation of the critical period hypothesis. Genie's nonverbal skills were exceptionally good, which demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was fundamentally different from language. Because Genie's language acquisition occurred in the right hemisphere of her brain, its course also aided linguists in refining existing hypotheses on the capacity for right-hemisphere language acquisition in people after the critical period.|$|E
