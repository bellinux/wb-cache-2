60|$|The Gambia River here {{opens its}} mouth {{directly}} to the north; and, after a great elbow, assumes its normal east-west course. We ran before a nine-knot breeze, and shortly before noon, after two hours' southing, we were off the half-way house, reef-girt Dog Island, and <b>Dog</b> <b>Point,</b> in the Barra country. The dull green stream sparkled in the sun, and the fringe of mangroves appeared deciduous: some trees were bare, as if dead; others were clothed with bright foliage. Presently we passed British Albreda, where our territory now ends. This small place has made a fuss in its day. It was founded by the French in 1700 as a dependency of Goree, and it carried on a slave-trade highly detrimental to English interests. In 1783 the owners had abandoned all right to its occupation, and in 1858 they ceded it to their English rivals. The landing is bad, especially when the miry ebb-tide is out. The old village of the French company was reduced when we visited it to a few huts and two whitewashed and red-roofed houses, occupied by a Frenchwoman in native dress and by an English subject, Mr. Hughes. The latter did the honours of the place and showed us the only 'punkah' at that time known to the West African coast.|$|E

30|$|The SIFT {{algorithm}} used [43] makes a scale-space {{transformation and}} calculates {{the difference of}} Gaussian (DoG) for the images at different scales. Local extremes are calculated by comparing the DoG sampling points to eight neighboring points in the same scale and nine neighboring points in higher and lower scales. The <b>DoG</b> <b>point</b> is a key point if its value is the highest or lowest in the neighborhood. Other points are excluded. Next, key points with low contrast or along an edge are excluded. Orientation histograms with 36 bins are calculated for the remaining key points. The orientation histogram is based on gradient orientations calculated from the surroundings of a key point after Gaussian filtering. The highest peak of the orientation histogram describes the key point orientation. If the histogram includes peaks with heights that are at least 80 % of the highest peak, they are marked as the new key points for that direction. Finally, the key-point descriptors are defined. A key-point descriptor includes the orientation histograms from the neighborhood of the key point. In our implementation, the descriptors have four orientation histograms with eight bins that describe the cell values for the feature vectors.|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Geography) Maputoland {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} wilderness areas along the South African coast on which to base a progressive tourist industry. The area between <b>Dog</b> <b>Point</b> and Sodwana Bay was selected as the study area, as the area calls for responsible development. The area lends itself to various nature-orientated activities and therefore the development of a hiking trail will be investigated. Compliance with the following two principles is necessary in order to ensure the success of a hiking route: (a) the environment must be protected and (b) the environment must satisfy the needs of a hiker. Both the principles mentioned are taken into account in the application of Hugo and Bewsher's (1993) comprehensive trail development model. It is for this reason that the model is applied to designate the most suitable location for a hiking corridor. In order to identify a hiking corridor the five planning phases of the comprehensive trail development model must be applied. Identification of primary parameters that in conjunction form ecological units: When vegetation and geomorphological units, which can be represented spatially, are laid over one another, new units known as ecological units, are formed. These units are placed in order to suitability and divided into functional planning zones [...] ...|$|E

She talks about how the land was beautiful and plentiful [...] fish, caribou, moose. She quotes her father at length who taught her about the land and how she should pass on that knowledge later on. - Her father used to tell her to admire the darkness of the far away land - and that if you took time to admire it and thank the Creator for it, you would live a good life! He used to sing for love of the land (ehts'ela). - She recalls her brother William who was quite the singer of ula but who was raised very strictly by his father. - That is also when they (she and her sister Margaret) learned not to 'talk' to their brother, because girls didn't talk to older brothers. - They learned to sing and to be playful and active. - The girls also learned all the restrictions imposed on women about moving around the meat brought in by the men, and about the distance they had to keep from the men. Also, how to treat the caribou meat with respect and cleanliness. - Throws in some remarks about when a girl becomes t'sát'ine (when she has her first period). - Talks about how her father used to make an underground 'freezer' for storing meat for longer periods of time. It would stay really fresh in there, even in summer. - Dora then moves on to talk about the children of today, who don't listen to their parents anymore and who will be lost [...] . - Recalls when her father talked about the beauty of the dark land mass across the lake : - Dora sings three songs. - To her, her father was an amazing man, hard-working and successful as trapper and hunter and who raised his kids alone because his first wife died. - Dora says she sings when people ask her too, because they need to remember the old songs, but also because she needs to express her joy when she looks at the land (mentions one occasion in Simpson, another at <b>Dog</b> <b>Point</b> (Grizzly Bear Mountain), another when Dogrib came to visit (about 40 sleds) and crossed the lake in front of Deline. - Dora sings two songs. - Recalls when she used to go out alone with the dog team to fetch wood - she was so happy she used to sing all the time. - Recalls her youth when the Elders used to 'really' talk to her, because she listened and was good to the. She would often work on getting lice out of their hair or let them sleep with their head on her lap. - Recalls one occasion when she went to get wood, joining her aunt who was already out there with other people. She learned to pile wood the right way. She also brought some back for the Elders, making them really happy. - Dora sings one song. - More talking about become ts'át'ine - the only outing permitted was to go for wood and the things one must not do at that time. - Dora wonders why Nicole is so interested in love songs - "Where's your boyfriend?" - Dora sings one song.

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{external and internal}} factors on the course of semen collection and quality of ejaculate has been evaluated in this work. This observation included 30 dogs of various breeds, each of which we collected 3 ejaculates from within one week (first, third and fifth day). The internal factors included {{the weight of the}} dog, order of semen collection and the age of the dog. The external factors included type of housing, utilization of the <b>dog,</b> <b>point</b> of the collection and type of nutrition. Average length of preparation of a dog for a collection and onset of sexual reflex was 95. 7 sec. The observations showed that none of the evaluated internal factors had any influence on the length of preparation for the semen collection. The largest volume of ejaculate was collected from the first collection (10. 5 cm 3), at the second collection it was 8. 9 [*]cm 3 and the third one the volume was the smallest – with only 6. 6 [*]cm 3. The average volume of 8. 7 [*]cm 3 was found in the whole set of observed dogs. No statistically conclusive difference was found among groups. The average activity of sperm in the observed set was 68. 8 %. Activity declined from the first to the third collection from 73 % to 65. 5 %. The difference in sperm activity was not statistically conclusive in any indicator. Sperm concentration in whole set of dogs was 143. 6 103. mm− 3 and was not significantly affected by any monitored internal factors. The longest preparation for the collection was found in dogs housed in pens (134. 4 sec), dogs living in households (84. 7 sec) and the shortest preparation was needed in dogs with freedom of movement. The longest onset of sexual reflexes was found in Police forces dogs, then family dogs and sport dogs (130. 0 sec, 97. 8 sec and 68. 3 sec). In dogs collected in laboratory, the emergence of sexual reflex was longer (110. 7 sec) than in dogs collected in their own natural environment (80. 7 sec). The average length of the whole ejaculation was 396. 0 sec in the whole set of dogs. The longest ejaculation was found in dogs held home (468. 0 sec), the shortest in dogs with freedom of movement (290. 0 sec). Family dogs had the longest ejaculation time, Police forces dogs had the shortest. The highest volume of semen was found in dogs kept in households (11. 0 cm 3), the smallest volume was in dogs with freedom of movement (4. 2 cm 3). Dogs used in sport, family dogs and Police forces dogs had the volume of semen 12. 7 [*]cm 3, 6. 3 [*]cm 3 and 5. 7 [*]cm 3. Statistically highly significant differences in the activity of sperm was found between dogs with freedom of movement (35. 0 %) and dogs kept in pens and household of the breeder (77. 8 %, respectively 77. 0 %), between Police dogs (49. 4 %) and sport dogs (76. 7 %) and family dog (77. 8 %), {{as well as in the}} place of collection (P ≤ 0. 01). The lowest sperm concentration was found in dogs kept in households (124. 103. mm− 3), in dogs kept in pens (152. 103. mm− 3), the highest sperm concentration was in dogs with freedom of movement (180. 103. mm− 3). Police, sport and family dogs had the concentration of 175. 103. mm− 3, 126, 5. 103. mm− 3, respectively 135, 0. 103. mm− 3.
