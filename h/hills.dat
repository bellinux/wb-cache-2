5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold in the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in the}} potential for gold mining in the Black <b>Hills.</b> In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black <b>Hills</b> for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the <b>Hills.</b> Custer's announcement {{of gold in}} the Black <b>Hills</b> triggered the Black <b>Hills</b> Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black <b>Hills.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere {{volcanic}} activity, {{possibly as}} a result of the closing of the Iapetus Suture, created the Cheviot <b>Hills,</b> Ochil <b>Hills,</b> Sidlaw <b>Hills,</b> parts of the Pentland <b>Hills</b> and Scurdie Ness on the Angus coast.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plains cover most of {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the {{landscape}} becomes more arid and rugged, consisting of rolling <b>hills,</b> plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped <b>hills</b> called buttes. In the south, east of the Black <b>Hills,</b> lie the South Dakota Badlands. Erosion from the Black <b>Hills,</b> marine skeletons which fell {{to the bottom of}} a large shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area.|$|E

5|$|After Iron Bridge, the {{character}} of the Way changes with the steeper <b>hills</b> of the earlier sections giving way to a gentler gradient that meanders between low <b>hills.</b> These latter sections also contain a great deal of road walking as the Way crosses farmland via minor roads and boreens.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm together with sections of the lateral railway line in the Judean <b>Hills</b> between Tulkarm and Nablus, a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, which supplied the two Ottoman Armies, including the important railway junction at Messudieh in the Judean <b>Hills.</b> The infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean <b>Hills</b> towards Messudieh.|$|E

5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the <b>hills</b> and common land and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor indicated {{that they would like to}} give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern <b>hills</b> and the first Malvern <b>Hills</b> Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern <b>Hills</b> Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black <b>Hills</b> differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black <b>Hills</b> forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black <b>Hills</b> spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the <b>Hills.</b> Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black <b>Hills</b> gold jewelry.|$|E
