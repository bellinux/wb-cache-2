5|$|Widerøe is a {{regional}} airline and uses Dash 8 aircraft to operate routes from south to north in Norway. Northwards, Widerøe uses Trondheim Airport as a hub to serve six airports in Nord-Trøndelag and Helgeand on {{public service obligation}} contracts with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. Scandinavian Airlines is the airline with the most domestic services to Trondheim. The main route is to its hub at Oslo; additional services are operated to Bergen, Bodø, Stavanger, Tromsø and Ålesund, all with Boeing 737, CRJ900 and ATR 72 aircraft. Internationally, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> weekly flight to Alicante, 2 times daily to its hub in Stockholm and 2 times daily flights to its hub in Copenhagen. Norwegian Air Shuttle is a low-cost airline which operates the main domestic services to Oslo, Bergen, using Boeing 737 aircraft. <b>It</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> range of international flights.

5|$|Altrincham has two theatres, the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse and the Club Theatre (latterly {{known as}} the Altrincham Little Theatre). The Altrincham Garrick group was formed in 1913. The Garrick held the world stage premier of Psycho in 1982. In 1998, it {{received}} a grant of £675,000 from the National Lottery {{as part of a}} £900,000 redevelopment of the theatre, which was completed in 1999. The Club Theatre group began in 1896, as the St Margaret's Church Institute Amateur Dramatics Society. <b>It</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> venue for the Trafford Youth Theatre production each year, and it runs the Hale One Act Festival, an annual week-long event started in 1972. The club has received awards from both the Greater Manchester Drama Federation and the Cheshire Theatre Guild. Altrincham also had Greater Manchester's only Michelin starred restaurant, the Juniper.|$|E

5|$|NY45 runs {{parallel}} to the {{small portion of the}} Garden State Parkway (GSP) that enters New York. Officially this portion is considered an extension of the New York State Thruway. While NY45 never intersects the GSP, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> link to the parkway. South of the New Jersey border in Bergen County, CR73 intersects the GSP, and in New York, NY45 intersects CR41, which intersects the parkway. Through Chestnut Ridge (where it is known as Chestnut Ridge Road, just as CR73, its southern extension, is in New Jersey), it crosses the New York State Thruway.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice because <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides {{of the desired}} sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E

5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} {{is a key}} {{marker for}} the Bronze Age chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean world. <b>It</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the second millennium BCE in the Aegean, {{as evidence of the}} eruption is found throughout the region. Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE. Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The Puncheon Run Connector is an {{unnumbered}} four-lane freeway in Dover, Delaware. It {{is named}} after Puncheon Run, a stream it follows. <b>It</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> connection between U.S. Route 13 (US 13) and the northbound direction of the Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) toll road, with an intermediate interchange at Bay Road. The road {{is part of the}} National Highway System and serves as part of a north-south route for traffic crossing the Delmarva Peninsula. Planning for the Puncheon Run Connector began in the 1980s and originally included a freeway upgrade for US 13 south to Woodside. The connector was scaled back to its current routing in 1992. The freeway was built between 1998 and 2000 at a cost of $25 million.|$|E

The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown, West Virginia, and Cumberland, Maryland. Although the freeway serves no major metropolitan areas, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
