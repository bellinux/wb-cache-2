De Landa {{had been one of}} those charged with disseminating the Roman Catholic faith amongst the Maya peoples in Spain's new Central American possessions during the period after the Spanish conquest of Yucatán, and had lived there for several years. His manuscript (Relación de las Cosas de Yucatán) had been written upon his <b>enforced</b> <b>return</b> to Spain, where he was charged with illegally or improperly conducting an Inquisition (he was later absolved, returning to the New World as the appointed Bishop of Yucatán). In the manuscript de Landa had recorded much information about the Maya peoples and customs, based on his own observations and discussions with Mayan informants. Brasseur de Bourbourg's main interest in the document, however, was a section in which de Landa reproduced what he termed [...] "an alphabet" [...] of the as-yet undeciphered Maya hieroglyphics, the writing system of the ancient Maya civilization. In this passage de Landa had annotated the Mayan symbols (or glyphs) which supposedly corresponded to the letters of the Spanish alphabet, as given to him by a Maya informant who he had quizzed. Brasseur de Bourbourg realised that this could prove to be basis of deciphering the Maya script, and he announced this discovery when republishing the manuscript (in a bilingual Spanish-French edition) during late 1863 with the title, Relation des choses de Yucatán de Diego de Landa.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{critics like}} Renee C. Hoogland and Neil Corcoran {{believe that the}} novel carries satirical and comic {{elements}} that target the Anglo-Irish and English society. Hoogland states: “In traditional generic terms, The Last September can be classified as a social comedy that satirizes the manners and the morals of the Anglo-Irish landed gentry and the English upper-middle classes.” [...] Hoogland also points Myra Naylor’s class “arrogance and bigoted nationalist views allow Bowen to display her exquisite talent for social satire. The main target of the Irish lady’s scorn are the English upper-middle classes:I always find the great thing in England is to have plenty to say, and mercifully they are determined to find one amusing. But if one stops talking, they tell one the most extraordinary things, about their husbands, their money affairs, their insides. They don’t seem discouraged by not being asked. And they seem so intimate with each other; I suppose it comes from living so close together. Of course they are very definite and practical, {{but it is a}} pity they talk so much about what they are doing. I can’t think why they think it should matter.In Elizabeth Bowen: The <b>Enforced</b> <b>Return,</b> Corcoran explains the comic depiction of the Anglo-Irish society:Constantly playing against the brightness of social comedy in The Last September, therefore - notably the comedy of edgy insinuation and misunderstanding that characterizes Anglo-Irish/English/Irish relations - is a pervasive effect of attenuation, bathos, desuetude. ‘They were delayed, deflected,’ it is said of Hugo’s and Marda’s lengthy failure to pay a return visit to Danielstown; but, in fact, this could be said more generally of the Anglo-Irish in the novel too.Corcoran also thinks that “…The Last September maintains throughout the parity, if not the primacy, of its comic tone. Inventing the marriage of Hugo and Laura, for instance, the fastidious Laurence also, with a shudder, envisages a time when they and four sons ‘all hurried out to coarsen in Canada’; on the wedding morning, he thinks, ‘the four young sons jiggled in excitement among the cherubim.’” ...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{research}} on HIV/AIDS in India has predominantly focused on known risk {{groups such as}} sex workers, STI clinic attendees and long-distance truck drivers, and has largely been undertaken in urban areas. There is evidence of HIV spreading to rural areas but very {{little is known about}} the context of the infection or about issues relating to health and social impact on people living with HIV/AIDS. In-depth interviews with nineteen men and women infected with HIV who live in rural areas were used to collect experiences of testing and treatment, the social impacts of living with HIV and differential impacts on women and men. Eight focus group discussions with groups drawn from the general population in the four villages were used to provide an analysis of community level views about HIV/AIDS. While men reported contracting HIV from sex workers in the cities, women considered their husbands to be the source of their infection. Correct knowledge about HIV transmission co-existed with misconceptions. Men and women tested for HIV reported inadequate counselling and sought treatment from traditional healers as well as professionals. Owing to the general pattern of husbands being the first to contract HIV women faced a substantial burden, with few resources remaining for their own or their children’s care after meeting the needs of sick husbands.

30|$|Second, {{in terms}} of competences and powers in {{migration}} control, the national level dominates sub-national authorities in both countries. In Austria, the power to issue and <b>enforce</b> <b>return</b> decisions remains solely with the federal state (Ministry of the Interior, Federal Agency for Immigration and Asylum/BFA). In turn, federal authorities and the authorities of the provinces have executive competences and financial obligations {{for the welfare of}} (rejected) asylum seekers. This institutional design of shared responsibilities in welfare creates {{a situation in which the}} rules are the same across the country, but they do not all apply in the same way. In practice, some provinces act more restrictively, others more supportively (Rosenberger & König, 2011). A similar structure applies to the Netherlands, where powers in migration and asylum also rest with the national government (State Secretary of Security and Justice). Certain responsibilities pertaining to welfare, such as housing, are delegated to local government, giving the local authorities a degree of leeway in the interpretation of these policies (Kos et al., 2015).|$|R
5000|$|New {{regulations}} called Zurück für die Zukunft, or [...] "Backwards for the Future" [...] in English, {{were established}} for the 2015 rally to <b>enforce</b> a <b>return</b> to the event's spartan roots.

30|$|Regardless of the explanation, several policy {{implications}} emerge. First, {{there is an}} urgent need to properly design immigration policies such that they improve the selection of immigrants who best match Spanish labor market conditions to avoid waste and erosion of human capital. Moreover, it is most important to regulate these immigration policies and insure that they are correctly implemented. Within this context, the promotion of circular migration schemes, which allow the systematic and regular movement of migrants typically seeking work between their homelands and foreign countries, might be particularly useful especially among low-skilled workers. According to Constant et al. 2011, circular migration is widely perceived as a potential “win-win-win situation” that can help to relax the potential social tension from migration {{for at least the}} following three reasons. First, circular migrants take advantage of better employment and payment opportunities in the host country; they optimize and re-optimize their income, savings and assets strategies, and thus improve their economic, social and personal situation at each stage. Second, for receiving countries circular migration is desirable because it may help to plug labor market shortages by matching excessive labor demand in host countries and excessive labor supply in sending countries. And third, sending countries benefit from remittances sent by migrants abroad, and if the better skilled return, they are highly valuable since they transfer knowledge acquired abroad and bring back new ideas. As the German guests workers experience from the late 1950 s and 1960 s and the Bracero US program for Mexicans during the early 1960 s have shown, immigration restrictions and <b>enforced</b> <b>return</b> migration often result in an unintended increase of (illegal) immigrants. In contrast, free mobility and the option to return to the hosting country would encourage circularity because immigrants who belong to these programs can return to the host country whenever desired, they can search for and accept the best jobs offered – in the home or the host country (Constant et al. 2011).|$|E

Emperor Henry IV gave Ulrich insignia of rank and banner (vexillum) for their reign as Moravian dukes, while Luitpold's brother officially renounced all claims to the Prague throne.

40|$|Non-repudiation allows an {{exchange}} of data between two principals {{in such a manner}} that the principals cannot subsequently deny their participation in the exchange.

In this paper a new scheme for achieving mandatory mutual non-repudiation is proposed, encompassing both mandatory proof of origin and mandatory proof of receipt. The fundamental feature of the scheme is that the proofs of origin and receipt are not exchanged until both principals have submitted their digitally signed evidence to a trusted third party intermediary. This ensures that if the non-repudiation protocol is not completed, neither principal can gain from the exchange. An added advantage is that the process of dispute arbitration is considerably simplified since a small number of rules are required to decide whether an alleged data exchange took place...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about how a command system {{allocated}} resources under profound uncertainty. The command system was the Soviet economy, the period was Stalin's dictatorship, and the resources were designated for military research & development. The context was formed by {{the limits of the}} existing aviation propulsion technology, the need to replace it with another, and uncertainty as to how to do so. We observe the formation of a quasi-market in which rival agents proposed projects and competed for funding to carry them out. We find rivalry and rent seeking, imperfectly regulated by principals. As rent seeking spread and uncertainty was reduced, the quasi-market was closed down and replaced by strict hierarchical allocation and monitoring. In theory, a dictator cannot commit to refrain from taxing the returns from today's effort tomorrow; therefore, we expect agents in a command system to seek only short-term returns from quasi-market activity. Agents’ willingness to invest in the Soviet quasi-market for inventions is ascribed to a reputation mechanism that <b>enforced</b> long-run <b>returns...</b>|$|R

Only half of the courts had recorded such decisions. Other actions were even less emotive and in 1880 the position of the Bulgarians in Eastern Rumelia had improved. The Plovdiv government introduced new methods for authenticating claims, allowing local courts to issue new title deeds if they were satisfied that existing documentation proved ownership, or if local communal councils had issued certificates attesting ownership. Most local councils were entirely Bulgarian or were dominated by Bulgarians and decided in favour of their co-nationals far more often than did the mixed commissions with whom the prerogative of adjunction had previously rested. In many instances, too, Bulgarians refused to relinquish land they had seized and as late as 1884 there were still Turkish landlords demanding the implementation of court orders restoring their property.|$|R
