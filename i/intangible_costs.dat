25|$|The {{economic}} impact of inadequate sanitation has been estimated at 344 billion Rupees (US$5.7 billion), equivalent to almost 4 percent of GDP. 87% of the impact is on health, 5% on increased costs of water supply and 8% are other impacts. The main health impacts are premature mortality and productivity losses, followed by treatment costs. Water supply costs include higher costs for the supply of piped water, higher expenses for bottled water {{and the cost of}} household water treatment. Other costs include the cost of increased time for open defecation and the use of shared toilets, and a relatively small cost of lost tourism revenues.

Many argue that a retreat from the general principle is warranted when designing capitalization rules, and even those who argue that capitalization rules ought to be sweeping usually conclude that exceptions are necessary or desirable. For instance, most commentators accept uncritically that expenses incurred to procure certain intangible capital should be expensed, as under current law, without exploring whether expensing of <b>intangibles</b> <b>costs</b> is inevitable, although some have considered the implications of excepting <b>intangibles</b> <b>costs</b> from capitalization. Although the arguments with respect to exceptions to capitalization for tangible assets have received more attention, no consensus view has emerged regarding whether many of the exceptions are desirable as a matter of policy.

50|$|The {{construction}} of large dams entails many tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>costs.</b> The financial cost itself is already substantial. Resettlement {{adds to the}} social costs of the dams. Sedimentation from unchecked erosion in the upper watershed of rivers reduces the lifespan of reservoirs. Environmental costs are imposed on communities living downstream of the dams in Ethiopia. And neighboring countries, in particularly Egypt, see their historical water rights affected and threaten {{to take action against}} the dams. The almost exclusive reliance on hydropower makes electricity generation vulnerable to droughts, which may be exacerbated by climate change. Earthquakes can also endanger the dams and associated tunnels. There were a total of 16 recorded earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 and higher in Ethiopia's seismic active areas in the 20th century. Last but not least, the dams are built in an environment of poor governance: Most contracts have been awarded without competitive bidding, raising the suspicion of corruption. The above concerns have hampered access to financing from international financial institutions, slowing down the dam building program.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{indirect costs}} through human capital approach and <b>intangible</b> <b>costs</b> through willingness-to-pay (WTP), and identify factors potentially affecting these costs in multiethnic Asian patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

A closed-ended iterative bidding contingent valuation method was used to elicit willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical cure of OA {{as a proxy for}} <b>intangible</b> <b>costs.</b> Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis H-tests were performed in univariate analyzes, and linear regression in multivariate analyses. Results: Indirect costs per year and <b>intangible</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated at US$ 1. 008 and US$ 1200, accounting for 2. 8 % and 3. 3 % of annual household income, respectively.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the <b>intangible</b> <b>costs</b> of MS, and determine whether these costs increase as disability progresses. We studied 211 consecutive patients with MS who attended our MS unit. Patients mean age was 41. 6 (SD: 10. 7) years, 69 % were female, and their mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 2. 47 (SD: 2. 05). Quality-of-life was measured with the EuroQoL visual analogue scale. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was calculated for each patient. Patients were grouped into five disability stages according to their EDSS, and QALY was compared between patients and a group of healthy controls matched by age and sex. A benchmark value was ascribed to each QALY lost, and the <b>intangible</b> <b>costs</b> per patient-year were calculated as t 0 (EDSS/ 0), t 1100 (EDSS/ 13), t 8250 (EDSS/ 3. 55. 5), t 9900 (EDSS/ 67) and t 11 000 (EDSS / 7. 5).
