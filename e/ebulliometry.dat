40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} behaviour of { 1 -bromo- 1 -chloro- 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethane (halothane) + tetrachloromethane or trichloromethane or 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane} {{has been}} investigated. Excess molar volumes were determined at 298. 15 K with a tilting dilution dilatometer, vapour-liquid equilibria were measured at 318. 15 K by a dynamic method, and limiting activity coefficients {{were determined by}} comparative <b>ebulliometry.</b> The results obtained for the (vapour + liquid) equilibria were verified by effective statistical procedures and used to calculate excess Gibbs molar energies. The unknown second cross virial coefficients were calculated {{on the basis of}} redundant information provided by complete results for the (vapour + liquid) equilibria. The results support the hypothesis of weak solvation effects in (halothane + trichloromethane or 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} using the {{headspace}} solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique {{was used to}} evaluate the infinite dilute activity coefficient (&# 947; 1 &# 8734;) in an alcohol/water/salt system. The studied systems were ethanol and water with NaCl and NH 4 Cl at salt concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 % m/v and temperatures of 303. 15 and 313. 15 K. The method was used to investigate the salt effect on vapor/liquid equilibrium in an ethanol/water system, yielding satisfactory results. The study focused on the rich side in ethanol. The data were compared with the literature infinite dilution data determined by other methods such as differential <b>ebulliometry</b> (EBUL), differential static cell equilibrium (STAT), and gas-liquid chromatography with no gas phase correction (GC). In this study, NaCl showed better separation rates than NH 4 Cl...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to carry out an experimental study and describe the vapor-liquid and vapor-solid phase equilibrium of high boiling organic pollutants. The aims of this work were as follows. Firstly, to modify and calibrate the static apparatus for measurement of vapor pressure located in the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague. Secondly, to study systematically thermodynamic properties, namely vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, heat capacites in the liquid and solid phases, of the selected high boiling organic pollutants. Three groups of pollutants, chlorobenzenes (1, 2 -dichlorobenzene, 1, 3 -dichlorobenzene, 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene, 1, 2, 3 -trichlorobenzene, 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene, 1, 3, 5 -trichlorobenzene, pentachlorobenzene), esters of phthalic acid (dimethyl ester, diethyl ester, dibutyl ester, benzylbutyl ester, bis(2 -ethylhexyl ester) and chlorophenols (2 -chlorophenol, 3 -chlorophenol, 4 -chlorophenol) were studied. Experimental part {{of this study was}} concerned with measurement of vapor pressure and of heat capacities in the liquid and solid phases. Three apparatuses were used for measurement of vapor pressure: a static apparatus in the University Claude Bernarde in Lyon, a modified static apparatus in the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague and an apparatus for measurement by comparative <b>ebulliometry</b> in the Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals in Prague. Experimental determination of heat capacity of liquids and solids was carried out using a commercial heat conduction calorimeter C- 80 Setaram in the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague and commercial Setaram calorimeters Micro DSC II and DCS 141 in the Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg. All experimental data from literature on vapor pressure, liquid, solid and ideal gas heat capacity, enthalpy of vaporization were compiled, critically evaluated and selected values were merged with newly determined data. Using exact thermodynamic relationship, vapor pressures and thermal data treated simultaneously. As a result of this work, recommended data for chlorobenzenes, esters of phthalic acid and chlorophenols of vapor pressure, heat capacities in the liquid and solid phases and enthalpy of vaporization were developedAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
