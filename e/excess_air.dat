5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> to spill out between the lips.|$|E
25|$|Helmets {{also have}} a {{spring-loaded}} exhaust valve which allows <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> to leave the helmet. The spring force is adjustable by the diver to prevent the suit from deflating completely or over-inflating and the diver being floated uncontrollably to the surface. Some helmets have an extra manual exhaust valve known as a spit-cock. This allows the diver to vent <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> when {{he is in a}} position where the main exhaust can not function correctly.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{dry suits}} do not {{normally}} have exhaust valves, but the wearer may vent <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the neck seal.|$|E
50|$|In {{industrial}} fired heaters, {{power plant}} steam generators, and large gas-fired turbines, {{the more common}} terms are percent <b>excess</b> combustion <b>air</b> and percent stoichiometric <b>air.</b> For example, <b>excess</b> combustion <b>air</b> of 15 percent means that 15 {{percent more than the}} required stoichiometric air (or 115 percent of stoichiometric air) is being used.|$|R

50|$|Lean-burn {{refers to}} the burning of fuel with an <b>excess</b> of <b>air</b> in an {{internal}} combustion engine. In lean-burn engines the air:fuel ratio may be as lean as 65:1 (by mass). The air / fuel ratio needed to stoichiometrically combust fuel, by contrast, is 14.64:1. The <b>excess</b> of <b>air</b> in a lean-burn engine emits far more hydrocarbons (see Manufacturers Specifications ie. Waukesha 7042GSIrich 2g/Bhp-hp vs. Waukesha 7042GLlean 5.5g/Bhp-hp). High air-fuel ratios {{can also be used}} to reduce losses caused by other engine power management systems such as throttling losses.|$|R
25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, blow-off valve (BOV), or dump valve. It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|E
25|$|The {{compressor}} {{should be}} provided with an accumulator and a relief valve. The accumulator functions as an additional water trap, but the main purpose {{is to provide a}} reserve volume of pressurised air. The relief valve allows any <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> to be released back to the atmosphere while retaining the appropriate supply pressure in the accumulator.|$|E
25|$|The scuba mask (half-mask) is {{equalised}} during descent by periodically exhaling {{through the}} nose. During ascent it will automatically equalise by leaking <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> round the edges. A helmet or {{full face mask}} will automatically equalise as any pressure differential will either vent through the exhaust valve or open the demand valve and release air into the low-pressure space.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a photodiode to control combustion, instead of a spectrometer (which is an expensive sensor to be used in commercial burners). For that purpose, the flame emission has been measured in a hot-water boiler fired with light fuel-oil, whose nominal output power goes up to 370 kW. The parameters investigated were: overall <b>air</b> <b>excess,</b> combustion <b>air</b> distribution, burner power and atmospheric conditions. High influence of air distribution on the flame emission was detected by the diode, since it modifies directly the mixing quality reducing rich-fuel regions where soot can be formed. Low influence of <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> and burner power was found. When these parameters increase, the flame emission decreases. This behavior is explained by the better mixing attained at high burner power and at high <b>air</b> <b>excess.</b> However the high emission level observed at low firing rate can be reduced with a good burner adjustment. With the photodiode, it was possible to find the optimum <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> value where NO, CO and soot are as low as possible. As the photodiode measures locally in the flame, results were compared with images obtained with a CCD camera. Finally, these results are in good agreement with those obtained previously with the spectrometer...|$|R

25|$|More fuel is {{sometimes}} {{added to the}} turbine's exhaust. This is possible because the turbine exhaust gas (flue gas) still contains some oxygen. Temperature limits at the gas turbine inlet force the turbine to use <b>excess</b> <b>air,</b> above the optimal stoichiometric ratio to burn the fuel. Often in gas turbine designs part of the compressed air flow bypasses the burner and is used to cool the turbine blades.|$|E
25|$|When the diver descends {{the ambient}} {{pressure}} rises {{and it becomes}} necessary to equalise the pressure inside the mask with the ambient pressure to avoid the barotrauma known as mask squeeze, This is done by blowing sufficient air out through the nose into the mask to relieve the pressure difference. This requires that the nose {{is included in the}} airspace of the diving mask. Equalisation during ascent is automatic as <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> easily leaks past the seal from inside.|$|E
25|$|Compressor diving is {{a method}} of surface-supplied diving used in some {{tropical}} sea areas including the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask covering the eyes-and-nose and (often home-made) fins and are supplied air from the boat by plastic hoses from an industrial low-pressure air compressor of the type commonly used to supply jackhammers.

40|$|During the {{operation}} of certain older types of annular shaft kilns used for lime burning, one may encounter the dilemma of how to operate the kiln at an optimal <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio. Due to excessively high temperatures in the combustion chambers at optimal <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio, the flame must be cooled witha greater amount of relatively cold secondary air. This results in greaterheat loss with the exhaust kiln gas (stack losses), greater fuel consumption and lower kiln efficiency. The effects of increasing <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio {{during the process of}} lime burning in an annular shaft kiln are specifically analysed. The paper presents a case of a remodelled annular shaftkiln, in which the <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio can be reduced to its optimal level by recirculation of recuperator waste gas and its injection into the combustion chambers. This also reduces stack losses, while the temperatures inthe combustion chambers remain within the permissible range, which means that the specific energy consumption for lime burning is reduced...|$|R
25|$|A {{weighted}} dump {{line will}} automatically start open the valve to start dumping <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> if the weight is lifted off the bottom. This {{will stop the}} lift from ascending any further if the dump valve releases air fast enough. When the weight is lowered back to the bottom by the sinking load, the valve will close again, and should hold the load steady. The stability of this system depends on the preload of the valve spring {{and the size of}} the valve opening.|$|E
25|$|By {{designing}} the fan blades with proper hub-to-tip ratio and analyzing {{performance on the}} number of blades so that the flow doesn't separate on the blade surface these effects can be reduced. Some of the methods to overcome these effects are re-circulation of <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> through the fan, axial fans are high specific speed devices operating them at high efficiency and to minimize the effects they have to be operated at low speeds. For controlling and directing the flow use of guide vanes is suggested. Turbulent flows at the inlet and outlet of the fans cause stalling so the flow should be made laminar by the introduction of a stator to prevent the effect.|$|E
25|$|The bag {{or set of}} bags is used to {{lift the}} load {{directly}} to the surface. This is simple, {{but there is a}} risk if the lift bag is too large and cannot be vented fast enough the lift may get out of control and ascend so fast that the bag breaks the surface, capsizes and collapses, losing so much air that it then cannot support the weight of the load, and will then sink back to the bottom. If there is a marker buoy attached it will at least not be lost. A lift bag which is only slightly larger than needed to support the load will ascend more slowly, and is less likely to capsize at the surface, as <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> will be spilled continuously during the ascent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical model of fuel consumption (AMFC) {{to coordinate the}} driving power and manage the overall fuel consumption for an internal combustion engine vehicle. The model calculates the different loads applied on the vehicle including road-slope, road-friction, wind-drag, accessories, and mechanical losses. Also, it solves the combustion equation of the engine under different working conditions including various fuel compositions, <b>excess</b> <b>airs</b> and air inlet temperatures. Then it determines the contribution of each load to signify the energy distribution and power flows of the vehicle. Unlike the conventional models in which the vehicle speed needs to be given as an input, the developed model can predict the vehicle speed and acceleration under different working conditions by allowing the speed to vary within a predefined range only. Furthermore, the model indicates the ways to minimises the vehicles 2 ̆ 7 fuel consumption under various driving conditions.

25|$|Lungs: There {{is a risk}} pneumothorax, {{arterial}} gas embolism, and mediastinal and subcutanous emphysemas during ascent, {{which are}} commonly called burst lung or lung overpressure injury by divers. To equalise the lungs, all that is necessary is not to hold the breath during ascent. This risk does not occur when breath-hold diving from the surface, unless the diver breathes from an ambient pressure gas source underwater; breath-hold divers do suffer squeezed lungs on descent, crushing in the chest cavity, but, while uncomfortable, this rarely causes lung injury and returns to normal at the surface. Some people have pathologies of the lung which prevent rapid flow of <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> through the passages, {{which can lead to}} lung barotrauma even if the breath is not held during rapid depressurisation. These people should not dive as the risk is unacceptably high. Most commercial or military diving medical examinations will look specifically for signs of this pathology.|$|E

2500|$|It is not {{a problem}} for {{close-fitting}} neoprene suits, or hybrid suits with neoprene bottoms, which prevent air from easily moving into the legs of the suit. Wearers of baggy surface dry suits can mitigate the problem by venting out as much <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> as possible before entering the water. This is typically done by crouching down and leaning forward, wrapping the arms around the knees, and then having an assistant zip the suit shut while it is stretched out tightly. <b>Excess</b> <b>air</b> can also be [...] "burped" [...] out of the neck or cuff seal.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the work}} was the {{investigation}} of the effect of operational parameters of the combustion process (combustion <b>air</b> <b>excess,</b> primary fuel ratio) and burner constructional parameters (the pitch angle of secondary nozzles, tangential orientation of secondary nozzles towards the axis of the burner) on the formation of NOx and CO, flue gas temperature, the shape, dimensions and stability of the flame, in-flame temperatures in the horizontal symmetry plane of the combustion chamber and the amount of heat extracted from the hot combustion gases in the combustion chamber’s shell. Experimental activities were carried out in the laboratory of the Institute of Process and Environmental Engineering, which is focused on burners testing. The combustion tests were performed with the experimental low-NOx type burner, namely the two-gas-staged burner. Mathematical model developed based on the experimental data describes the dependency of NOx on the operating parameters of the combustion process and burner constructional parameters. The model shows that increasing <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> and increasing angle of tangential orientation of the secondary nozzles reduce the formation of NOx. The temperature peaks in the horizontal symmetry plane of the combustion chamber decreases with increasing combustion <b>air</b> <b>excess.</b> The thermal load to the combustion chamber’s wall {{along the length of the}} flame was evaluated for selected settings. It was validated that the thermal efficiency of is reduced when higher <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> is used...|$|R

Hans had sunk to his knees; his hands were joined in the {{attitude}} of prayer and his ugly little face reminded me of that of a big fish out of water and dying from <b>excess</b> of <b>air.</b> Robertson, startled out of his abstraction, stared at the royal-looking woman on the couch with his mouth open.|$|R
5000|$|In physostomous swim bladders, a {{connection}} is retained between the swim bladder and the gut, the pneumatic duct, allowing {{the fish to}} fill up the swim bladder by [...] "gulping" [...] <b>air.</b> <b>Excess</b> gas can be removed in a similar manner.|$|R
2500|$|It {{increases}} the risk on an inversion. [...] Dry suit inversions are dangerous and are best controlled by minimising the volume of air in the suit. If using the BCD for buoyancy control, and the suit inflation only to avoid a squeeze, the suit will never contain an excess of air. [...] If it does contain <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> {{as a result of}} using it for buoyancy or to compensate for being over-weighted the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> may migrate to the legs causing the diver to invert to a dangerous legs-up position making venting the dry suit difficult or impossible and leading to an uncontrolled ascent.|$|E
2500|$|Constant volume {{dry suits}} {{have a system}} {{allowing}} the suit to be inflated to prevent [...] "suit squeeze" [...] caused by increasing pressure and to prevent excessive compression of the insulating undergarments.

2500|$|If {{there is}} more air in the dry suit than is needed to {{counteract}} [...] "squeeze" [...] on the undersuit, that <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> creates a [...] "bubble" [...] which moves to the highest point of the suit; in an upright diver this is the shoulders. In such cases, divers wearing loose baggy suits need to keep their legs at level or below their waist. Otherwise the bubble quickly moves to the highest point, [...] and if the legs are above the waist, the bubble moves into the legs and feet, causing the legs to rise, and [...] "inverting" [...] the diver's body into a head-down position.|$|E
50|$|All {{concretes}} cast against wood or {{steel in}} the concrete cover zone, have a reduced cement content and increased water/cement ratio (i.e. less dense and more porous) compared to concrete located beyond the reinforcement. Within the core of any structural element the matrix is generally a denser and of better quality compared to the surface {{as a direct result}} of the concrete compaction. This compaction process drives <b>excess</b> mix <b>air</b> and water within the cover zone towards the formed surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Within these {{refrigerators}} and freezers, vaccines {{are also}} compromised through improper {{use of the}} door gasket to feed cables from data loggers and thermometers, allowing <b>excess</b> warm <b>air</b> in, and cold {{air out of the}} refrigerator or freezer. Over time this causes the compressor to work harder and eventually leads to failure. This can be remedied by using probe access ports, found on most clinical refrigerators and freezer. These are easy to open up and drastically reduce air intake and loss from inside the units.|$|R
40|$|Biomass boiler houses {{face some}} typical {{problems}} and a task {{of this work}} is to recognize these problems, {{to find out the}} causes and solutions how to decrease its influence for boiler house operation. Main tasks of the first tests were to perform operating parameters measurements when feeding furnace with average moisture content fuel and dry fuel, to calculate boiler efficiency and to analyze boiler behavior combusting various moisture content fuel. Different grate movements cycles ratio values was noticed. This ration influence in fuel layer thickness on grate, and the higher the ratio, the thicker fuel layer is. Primary air pressure dependence on fuel layer thickness confirms this statement. Different movement of first and second grate part causes fuel layer to fracture. As fuel moisture increases, grate movements cycles ratio should be increased as well. Biomass combustion from bottom to top was noticed. Thin hot coal layer covers the grate and primary air works as catalyst. Hot flue gas dries wet fuel as it flows thru it. Possibilities to improve combustion process were determined. Increasing primary air amount would speed up fuel drying process. Combustion air-preheating acts as catalyst not only for drying, but also for ignition and intensification of combustion process. Recirculation flue gas flow will dry fuel more quickly if it will not be mixed with primary air. Mixing hot flue gas with cold air, mixture temperature drops below water vapor saturation temperature and excess moisture condensates. Increasing grate movements cycle’s ratio improves combustion of wet fuel, however primary air flows has to be redistributed as well. There was no need to change any settings to combust biomass with 54 % moisture content, existing regime card was enough. Feeding wet fuel causes boiler water outlet temperature to decrease, i. e. boiler load decreases. In order to increase boiler load, fuel feeding was increased manually. After increasing fuel amount, secondary and tertiary air fans speed increased automatically, causing higher <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio. Tertiary <b>air</b> set value was decreased manually to maintain lower <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio. Combustion process has stabilized after increasing primary air first and second fan load and decreasing third primary air fan load. Wet fuel contained high amount of conifers spikes, which has ~ 1, 8 % fuel nitrogen content, therefore higher nitrogen oxides emissions were measured. Fuel moisture content has a highest influence for thermal capacity of flue gas condensing economizer, moreover the higher moisture content is the more significant effect on economizer capacity it has. Flue gas temperature after economizer and <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio also has significant effect. To increase flue gas condensing economizer efficiency, <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio must be kept as low as possible. Continuously CO measurement would help to decrease <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> ratio. Flue gas inlet temperature has low effect to the thermal capacity of condensing economizer...|$|R
