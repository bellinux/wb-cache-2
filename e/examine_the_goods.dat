In their desire to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> the ladies speedily lifted their veils, and, seating themselves on cushions they had brought in with them, chattered unrestrainedly; examining the quality of the silks which Surajah and Dick, squatting behind their wares, handed for their inspection; comparing the colours, asking each other's advice, and endeavouring to beat down the terms Surajah named.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{not only}} in {{relation}} to investments that this absorption of small parcels of savings goes on. In every town the intelligent and sympathetic observer may see, vivid before the eyes of all who are not blind by use and wont, the slow subsidence of petty accumulations, The lodging-house and the small retail shop are, as it were, social [...] "destructors"; {{all over the country}} they are converting hopeful, enterprising, ill-advised people with a few score or hundreds of pounds, slowly, inevitably into broken-hearted failures. It is, to my mind, the crudest aspect of our economic struggle. In the little High Street of Sandgate, over which my house looks, I should say between a quarter and a third of the shops are such downward channels from decency to despair; they are sanctioned, inevitable citizen breakers. Now it is a couple of old servants opening a [...] "fancy" [...] shop or a tobacco shop, now it is a young couple plunging into the haberdashery, now it is a new butcher or a new fishmonger or a grocer. This perpetual procession of bankruptcies has made me lately shun that pleasant-looking street, that in my unthinking days I walked through cheerfully enough. The doomed victims have a way of coming to the doors at first and looking out politely and hopefully. There is a rich and lucrative business done by certain wholesale firms in starting the small dealer in almost every branch of retail trade; they fit up his shop, stock him, take his one or two hundred pounds and give him credit for forty or fifty. The rest of his story is an impossible struggle to pay rent and get that debt down. Things go on for a time quite bravely. I go furtively and <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> in the window, with a dim hope that this time something really will come off; I learn reluctantly from my wife that they are no better than any one else's, and rather dearer than those of the one or two solid and persistent shops that do the steady business of the place. Perhaps I see the new people going to church once or twice very respectably, as I set out for a Sunday walk, and if they are a young couple the husband usually wears a silk hat. Presently the stock in the window begins to deteriorate in quantity and quality, and then I know that credit is tightening. The proprietor no longer comes to the door, and his first bright confidence is gone. He regards one now through the darkling panes with a gloomy animosity. He suspects one all too truly of dealing with the [...] "Stores." ... Then suddenly he has gone; the savings are gone, and the shop--like a hungry maw--waits for a new victim. There is the simple common tragedy of the little shop; the landlord of the house has his money all right, the ground landlord has, of course, every penny of his money, the kindly wholesalers are well out of it, and the young couple or the old people, as the case may be, are looking for work or the nearest casual ward--just as though there was no such virtue as thrift in the world.|$|E

40|$|When {{goods are}} sold internationally, {{it is common}} that the seller {{receives}} the purchase price against documents. In many cases, the buyer {{does not have a}} chance to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> before the seller obtains payment. Therefore, the buyer must rely on the accuracy of the information contained in the documents. The objective of the thesis is to discuss the risks that are related to the purchase price being paid against the documents. Furthermore, the thesis analyses what additional roles documents play in the contract of sale and contracts supplementing it. The main focus is on the bill of lading, which is a sea transportation document issued by the carrier, because it enables, for example, the goods to be sold during transit. A documentary credit is a commonly used method of payment. In order for the seller to obtain the purchase price, the seller must deliver conforming documents to the bank. This creates a documentary risk, meaning that there is a risk that documents provided by the seller might not be in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. If this happens the bank must refuse payment. From the buyer’s perspective, there is a risk that the documents do not communicate accurately the status of the goods on loading. The description of the goods in the bill of lading is subject to the carrier’s obligation to check the quantity, quality, and condition of the goods. In practice, the carrier’s obligation to check is limited in particular when goods are containerised. Therefore, the information cannot be entirely reliable. Moreover, the carrier is not able to assess whether the goods are in accordance with the contract of sale because he is not an expert surveyor and not aware of the terms of the sale contract. According to the Finnish Maritime Code, the carrier is liable for inaccurate information in some situations which enhances the transferability of the document. The research illustrates that the system seeks to ensure that the documents are accurate. However, is not without gaps and thus, there is a risk that the seller obtains the payment even when the goods are not in accordance with the agreement between the seller and the buyer. Moreover, the system has not been constructed in a way which would easily detect the seller’s fraud. This is because the banks that examine the documents supplied by the seller adopt a formalistic approach which does not seek to assess the actual condition of the goods, rather {{it is based on the}} assumption that their description is sufficient. The bill of lading is also a tool needed in the delivery of the goods. Goods might arrive before the documents which certainly increases the likeliness of the carrier delivering the goods to the wrong party without complying with the rules on delivery as stipulated in the Finnish Maritime Code. The industry has developed arrangements to mitigate the risks related to delivery without a bill of lading which shows that the document is not able to meet the needs of today’s trade...|$|E
