25|$|The engine's design {{concentrated}} on the reduction of moving parts. The cooling fan and dynamo were built integrally with the one-piece crankshaft, removing the need for <b>drive</b> <b>belts.</b> The use of gaskets, seen as another potential weak point for failure and leaks, was also kept to a minimum. The cylinder heads are mated to the cylinder barrels by lapped joints with extremely fine tolerances, as are {{the two halves of}} the crankcase and other surface-to-surface joints.|$|E
25|$|Both Chippewa and Wesco heavily {{increased}} {{sales of}} engineer boots {{in the late}} 1940s. There was a post-war production boom for the boots, with high demand coming from returning veterans and bikers. The latter adopted engineer boots because the laceless design wouldn't interfere with motorcycle <b>drive</b> <b>belts,</b> the shafts were well insulated from heat, and they provided full lower leg protection {{in case of an}} accident. The footwear's popularity was furthered by its use by celebrities such as Marlon Brando and James Dean in their respective films The Wild One (1953) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955).|$|E

40|$|In {{this design}} project an elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> system is {{optimized}} using an algorithm of automated optional design, AOD. First, some basic background information on AOD and elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> systems is reviewed. An elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> system configuration is defined, mathematically formulated, and optimized. The mathematical formulation, including {{a set of}} constraints, is completely derived. It is set up to be as general as possible so {{that it may be}} applied {{to a wide variety of}} different problems. In several places the formulation uses the recommendations of an elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> manufacturer for a good design. A sample design problem is optimized using the A 0 D-P 519 RE algorithm of AOD. The following optimization studies are carried out: 1. Minimization of bearing load 2. Maximization of power transmission 3 Minimization of power requirement Standard belt material compounds and thicknesses are considered. To illustrate the usefulness of algorithms of AOD, an existing hand calculation design method for elastic <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> systems is demonstrated. These two techniques are then compared as design optimization tools. It is shown that an algorithm of AOD is superior for this purpose. At the conclusion of this project several detailed discussions regarding the work and results are presented. The AOD search process, derivation of the final equation set, significance of the results, and other items are analyzed. A set of final design recommendations for the sample problem are given and a list of conclusions is presented...|$|R

5000|$|In automobiles, a 42-volt {{electrical}} system was an electrical power standard {{proposed in the}} late 1990s.

50|$|The DAF 66 was {{introduced}} {{as a successor}} to the 55. It featured new, boxy styling of the front, and a new rear-axle design. The two <b>drive</b> <b>belts</b> now powered a differential, and the axle was changed from a swingaxle design to a leaf-sprung de Dion-axle. It was a major improvement over the (tricky) handling of the swing axles of the earlier 33, 44 and 55 models.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide belt {{conveyors}} {{are used to}} transport {{a great variety of}} bulk solid materials. The desire to carry higher tonnages over longer distances and more diverse routes, while keeping exploitation costs as low as possible, has fuelled many technological advances. An interesting development in the recent past is the distribution of drive power along the path of a belt conveyor, which has resulted in the multiple <b>driven</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor. The main idea behind this study is based on finding the right balance between the locally applied drive power and the occurring resistances in such a multiple <b>driven</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor system, so the belt tension stays within the safety margins in a controlled manner. Existing sub models describing belt dynamics, mechanical resistances and the transfer of drive force onto the belt are investigated, and expanded if necessary, so they can be combined to create a complete model of a distributed <b>driven</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor. The combined model serves as a base to test existing design rules used for conventional single <b>drive</b> <b>belt</b> conveyors and to investigate what modifications are required in the multiple drive case.

50|$|Most punch presses {{today are}} {{hydraulically}} powered.
