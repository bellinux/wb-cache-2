5000|$|The {{roof of the}} {{convention}} center and tunnel beneath Lakeside Avenue began to be laid during the summer. The roof over the Lakeside Avenue tunnel was finished in early July. It consisted of 20 in of concrete reinforced with 1.125 in thick steel rods. By July 18, fill earth forming the roadbed for the street was in place over the tunnel roof. For {{the convention}} center roof, cranes were used to pipe concrete {{on top of the}} superstructure. Where the cranes could not reach, a 300 ft long, 8 in wide steel pipe—one of only a few such pipes in the nation—was used. Twin electric pumps pushed concrete through the pipe at 3000 lb per 1 sq in. The pipe could pour [...] of concrete per hour. Metal cables running through the still-liquid concrete were vibrated to ensure a <b>flush</b> <b>fit</b> against previously poured concrete and to eliminate voids.|$|E
50|$|Galvanic anodes are {{generally}} shaped to reduced drag {{in the water}} and <b>fitted</b> <b>flush</b> to the hull to also try to minimize drag.|$|R
50|$|The {{stock was}} {{enlarged}} in October 1937 so the takedown screw would <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> with the bottom, the forearm {{was changed to}} a semi-beavertail shape, and the pistol grip was made more pronounced.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the trafficator arm is closely based upon the {{shape of the}} {{semaphore}} signal arm used by the Royal Bavarian Railway beginning in 1890. The only difference from the railway arm is that it is halved down its length so as to <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> with the vehicle's exterior.|$|R
50|$|In August 1935, {{the bolt}} was {{redesigned}} to incorporate a rebounding firing pin {{in compliance with}} Canadian import regulations. In October 1937, the stock was enlarged so the takedown screw would <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> with the bottom, the forearm was changed to a semi-beavertail shape, and the pistol grip was made more pronounced.|$|R

25|$|All of the 13 Wooler-Hodec {{cars were}} {{modified}} to the OEM front turn signal lens fixing method {{in order to}} make them <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> with the front fascia. The cars' headlights were also changed for right-hand drive spec lights that incorporate a UK sidelight feature. The rest of the lights appear to have been left untouched by Wooler-Hodec during the conversion process.|$|R
5000|$|The Ruger 77/22 is a bolt-action rimfire rifle {{chambered}} for the [...]22 Long Rifle, [...]22 WMR, or [...]22 Hornet.

50|$|The {{standard}} 10-round 10/22 magazine stores the cartridges in a rotary fashion, {{rather than}} stacked, {{as seen in}} a box magazine. This allows the magazine to <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> into the rifle without protruding from the stock at the natural balance point for one-handed carry. The action of the rifle strips a cartridge from the magazine with each shot, allowing the next cartridge to feed into place.|$|R
5000|$|The Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter are {{a network}} adapter and 56k dial-up modem, respectively, for the GameCube.

50|$|Jewelers prepare cuttlebone {{for use as}} a mold {{by cutting}} it in half and rubbing the two sides {{together}} until they <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> against one another. Then the casting can be done by carving a design into the cuttlebone, adding the necessary sprue, melting the metal in a separate pouring crucible, and pouring the molten metal into the mold through the sprue. Finally, the sprue is sawed off and the finished piece is polished.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the C-82, the cockpit was moved forward to <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> with the nose rather than its previous location over the cargo compartment. This resulted in more usable cargo space and larger loads than the C-82 could accommodate. The C-119 also featured more powerful engines, and a wider and stronger airframe. The first C-119 prototype (called the XC-82B) first flew in November 1947, with deliveries of C-119Bs from Fairchild's Hagerstown, Maryland factory beginning in December 1949.|$|R
50|$|The {{tailgate}} opens over six-feet {{high and}} 60/40 rear seatbacks fold {{down for a}} flat cargo area.

The cabin includes several storage areas including a lockable center console that can hold a standard size laptop computer. The cargo hold is small size compared to most rivals and {{does not have the}} adjustable cargo tracks or a rear parcel shelf.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{the front}} and rear styling of the {{limousine}} and formal limousine was revised for 1987. A new grille, header moldings and composite headlights with wraparound bezel and cornering lamps were used. Rear styling now featured elongated quarter extensions against which the taillamps, bumper and bumper trim fascia <b>fit</b> <b>flush.</b> Also new was grooved six-inch wide rocker molding made of stainless steel/aluminum composite with a single-rib accent grrove. For 1987, new hydro-elastic engine mounts were used to further isolate powertrain vibration.|$|R
50|$|The Ultrastars firing pin/safety {{system is}} {{substantially}} {{that of the}} M28/30/31. The safety lever is arranged opposite that of other modern Star pistols (protruding {{to the rear of}} the axis) and is designed to <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> when on fire, instead of sticking out like most others. The firing pin stop plate is set up as usual; depress the firing pin to slide the plate up and off. The drop safety will, of course, have to be depressed to allow enough travel in the firing pin.|$|R
50|$|The Ocean Drive is a four-door {{cabriolet}} concept vehicle {{based on}} long-wheelbase version of S 600, but with two-tone yarn fabric roof. The vehicle features an oversized grille, redesigned LED headlights and restyled trunk, LED head and tail lamps, a revised air dam, restyled flanks without the wheelhouse bulges, door handles that <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> into the body, AIRSCARF neck-level heating system, on all 4 seats.

5000|$|The Ruger 10/22 is a {{semi-automatic}} rimfire rifle chambered in [...]22 Long Rifle cartridges, {{produced by}} American firearm manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Co.. It has a removable 10-round rotary magazine {{which allows the}} magazine to <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> with {{the bottom of the}} stock. Higher capacity magazines are also available. A magnum version, chambered for the [...]22 WMR cartridge, was made from 1998 to 2006, and a [...]17 HMR version, the 10/17 was announced in 2004, but was only listed in the catalog for two years. The standard version has been in production continuously since 1964.|$|R
50|$|The Yak-30 {{was to be}} {{very similar}} to the former Yak-25, with only a few changes. The {{fuselage}} was that of the Yak-25 but with a circular cross-section. The tail was as on the Yak-25 but with a one-piece rudder, and slightly enlarged horizontal surfaces. The three NR-23 cannon armament was retained, and the cockpit layout was unchanged. The wingtip tanks could not be used, as they moved the aircraft's center of gravity too far forward, so they were redesigned to <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> under the wing, midway from the fuselage. The aircraft was powered by a 1,590 kgf (3,505 lbf) RD-500 turbojet.|$|R
50|$|At {{the front}} of the vehicle, a front-hinged lid {{encloses}} space for the spare tyre, radiators and cooling fans, battery (ahead of a wheel arch), heating and cooling systems and the vehicle's electric control systems. At the rear, a full-width, insulated and trimmed luggage boot with a gas-strut-supported lid sits behind the engine bay, sizeable enough to hold several sizeable soft bags or set of golf clubs. Electrically actuated pop-up headlights <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> to the vehicle nose, and contain twin round lamps in each for all 8, QV and 3.2 models, and a single homofocal rectangular unit each side of the Mondial t.|$|R
5000|$|The Ultrastar, {{also known}} as Model 205, uses the same {{operating}} method as the Model M31, but with an ejector port locking block, the Ultrastar pistols are smaller and lighter guns for carry and concealment. A single-column pistol in either 9 mm Parabellum or [...]40 S&W cal., their primary feature of interest is a polymer frame. This is constructed with steel inserts and a ribbed magazine well for extra stiffness and strength. Fitted with a straight barrel instead of a cone, the Ultrastars are lightweight and well-suited for their intended role, with even the safety lever designed <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> when on 'fire.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Through the mid-1960s, {{the most}} common way of {{measuring}} pressure was drilling a hole through the chamber of the barrel and inserting a copper slug that <b>fit</b> <b>flush</b> with the chamber walls. When a cartridge is fired, it compresses the copper slug. It is then removed, measured, and compared to the original dimensions. Using the known properties of copper, the chamber pressure can then be calculated and expressed in copper units of pressure (CUP). [...] While {{there are now more}} accurate methods of measuring chamber pressure, the copper crusher method is still used for verification purposes.|$|R
50|$|The Nintendo DS Browser {{ships with}} an 8 MB RAM pack which {{fits into the}} {{accessory}} slot, and which {{is required for the}} browser to run. Two versions of the Memory Expansion Pak are available. One is compatible with both the original DS and DS Lite, although the cartridge sticks out of the DS Lite. The second is a smaller translucent version which <b>fits</b> <b>flush</b> with the body of the DS Lite, but it can be used in the original DS if modified. The Expansion Pak is not used by any other commercial software, but some homebrew applications such as MoonShell can use it.|$|R
50|$|The {{variants}} {{with the}} extended magazine tubes use different barrels, as the barrel {{is held in}} place by attaching {{at the end of the}} magazine tube. The shortest barrel length available for the eight- and nine-shot models is 20 in, which <b>fits</b> <b>flush</b> with the long magazine tube. A ribbed 28 in modified choke field barrel was also manufactured for the 8-shot model 500. The shortest barrel for Title I six-shot models is 18.0 in, while military and law enforcement personnel (as well private persons in NFA states) can also get a 14 in barrel (the 590 Compact), which uses a special 5-shot magazine.|$|R
50|$|Two {{versions}} of the Memory Expansion Pack are available. One is compatible with both the DS and DS Lite, although the cartridge sticks out of the DS Lite. A smaller version is available which <b>fits</b> <b>flush</b> with {{the body of the}} DS Lite, and cannot be used with the original DS without modification. Two different Browser packages are available, one containing the large Expansion Pak, and one containing the Lite-only Expansion Pak. Availability varies by region - in Japan and Europe, both were available at launch, while in North America and other regions, the version containing the larger Expansion Pak is only available by mail order.|$|R
5000|$|The LC9 has a 3.12 inch 0 cm barrel, and is [...] {{long and}} 4.5 inch 0 cm tall. The LC9 is 0.9 inch 0 cm wide, and weighs 17.1 oz {{with an empty}} magazine. It {{features}} a black polymer (glass-filled nylon) frame and blued alloy steel slide and barrel. The gun ships with one magazine, including two interchangeable base pads—one that <b>fits</b> <b>flush</b> with the frame, and the other (fitted to the magazine from the factory) that provides a grip extension of about 0.5 inch 0 cm.
