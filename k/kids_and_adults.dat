500|$|Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle {{wrote that}} [...] "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie retains the 2-D {{charm of the}} hugely popular Nickelodeon cartoon but adds a few tricks – a little 3-D here, a little David Hasselhoff there. The series' appeal never lay in its visuals, however. 'SpongeBob' endeared itself to <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>adults</b> through {{sweetness}} and cleverness, also abundant here." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave it a score of four out of five: [...] "If you're tired of... bluster and swagger, SpongeBob is your man." [...] Tom Maurstad of The Dallas Morning News also gave the film a B-minus grade: [...] "Being so good is what led to making the movie, and it's also the reason that many small-screen episodes are better than this big-screen venture." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt Back to the Future {{had similar}} themes to the films of Frank Capra, {{especially}} It's a Wonderful Life. Ebert commented [...] " [...] Steven Spielberg is emulating the great authentic past of Classical Hollywood cinema, {{who specialized in}} matching the right director (Robert Zemeckis) with the right project." [...] He gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times believed the film had a balanced storyline: [...] "It's a cinematic inventing of humor and whimsical tall tales {{for a long time}} to come." [...] Christopher Null, who first saw the film as a teenager, called it [...] "a quintessential 1980s flick that combines science fiction, action, comedy, and romance all into a perfect little package that <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>adults</b> will both devour." [...] Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader felt Gale and Zemeckis wrote a script that perfectly balanced science fiction, seriousness and humor. Variety praised the performances, arguing Fox and Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. BBC News lauded the intricacies of the [...] "outstandingly executed" [...] script, remarking that [...] "nobody says anything that doesn't become important to the plot later." [...] Back to the Future appeared on Gene Siskel's top ten film list of 1985.|$|E

500|$|Romano {{described}} Kim as a [...] "very ambitious, very skilled, very smart" [...] character, {{and attempted}} to make her {{as much of a}} role model as possible. The actress also described the character as [...] "a really confident, sweet girl who everybody loves. And she is a heroine who little girls look up to. ... She is a typical role model, perfect in every way. How could you not like Kim?" [...] Romano initially doubted that the show would be successful, but eventually admitted that [...] "the animation was great and the writing was amazing. It's done so that <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>adults</b> can enjoy it; families can share an amazing experience together." [...] Additionally, Romano's character greatly influenced her own career, and considers Kim to be a positive role model for young girls. Romano identified the season one episode [...] "Mind Games" [...] in which Kim and Ron switch bodies as her favorite. By the end of the series, Romano was 21 years old and attending Columbia University for political science. Kim's final line in the series is [...] "uuhhh...huh?", which Romano recorded tearfully due to the series ending. Writing for 7M Pictures, Kevin Carr considered the fact that Kim is only a voice-acted role beneficial to the series because [...] "they could always get someone else to mimic her original voice" [...] should Romano depart, unlike Lizzie McGuires Hilary Duff.|$|E

On November 20, 2012, for the release of The Dark Knight Rises DVD and Blu-ray, Warner Bros. launched a countdown on the film's website where fans could share the countdown on websites like Facebook or Twitter to unlock an [...] "exclusive reward". On December 3, 2012, the [...] "exclusive reward" [...] was revealed to be an official Man of Steel teaser poster. The poster, which depicts Superman being arrested, generated a positive response and much speculation about the film's story. On December 10, 2012, a website appeared at dsrwproject.com that provided audio signals to be decoded by viewers. It was discovered to be related to the film due to the copyright on the website. By December 11, 2012, the decoded message led readers to another website with a countdown that led to the public release of the trailer. In anticipation of the film, Mattel unveiled a toy line which includes Movie Masters action figures. In addition, Lego will release three Man of Steel sets, inspired by scenes from the film; Rubie’s Costume Co. also released a new line of Man of Steel-inspired costumes and accessories for both <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>adults.</b> The film has reportedly earned over $160 million from promotional tie-ins.|$|E
500|$|Steven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote [...] "DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name {{to trust}} for imaginative, funny {{animated}} movies that delight <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>adults</b> equally." [...] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek {{is the sort of}} unlikely hero that nobody could love -- except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eerie, Indiana {{was well}} {{received}} by critics when it debuted on television. Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B" [...] rating and Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "You watch Eerie for the small-screen spectacle of it all — to see the way, in the show's first few weeks, feature-film directors like Joe Dante (Gremlins) and Tim Hunter (River's Edge) oversaw episodes that summoned up an atmosphere of absurdist suburban dread." [...] In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Miles Beller wrote, [...] "Scripted by Karl Schaefer and José Rivera with smart, sharp insights; slyly directed by feature film helmsman Joe Dante; and given edgy life by the show's winning cast, Eerie, Indiana shapes up {{as one of the}} fall season's standouts, a newcomer that has the fresh, bracing look of Edward Scissorhands and scores as a clever, wry presentation well worth watching." [...] In his review for the Orange County Register, Ray Richmond wrote, [...] "It's the kind of knowingly hip series with equally strong appeal for both <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>adults,</b> the kind that preteens will watch and discuss." [...] USA Today described the show as [...] "Stephen King by way of The Simpsons", and Matt Roush wrote, [...] "Eerie recalls Edward Scissorhands and even – heaven help it – David Lynch in its garish nightmare-comedy depiction of the lurid and silly horrors that lurk beneath suburban conformity." [...] In his review for the Washington Times, David Klinghoffer wrote, [...] "Everything about the pilot exceeds the normal minimal expectations of TV. Mr. Dante directs as if he were making a movie, and a good one. In a departure from usual TV operating procedures, he sometimes actually has more than one thing going on on screen at the same time!" ...|$|E
