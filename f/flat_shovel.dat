He also wishes to thank Dr. Greg Wall and his {{research}} team at the Land Resource Division, Centre for Land and Biological Resource Research, Agriculture Canada, Guelph, for their assistance in obtaining the soil blocks used in this study. He also wishes to thank Dr. Martin Shipitalo, U. S. D.

A technique has been developed to study in detail and under controlled conditions, the preferential flow of water and solutes in large, intact soil blocks, isolated at field sites and transported to the laboratory. The soil blocks, 46 -cm (18 ") on each side (145 kg, 320 lb) were carefully cut with a <b>flat</b> <b>shovel,</b> then encased on the vertical sides with a polyurethane foam shell (inside a plywood box) to stabilize it during transport and later experimentation. The blocks were cut at least 46 cm deep to ensure that the A/B horizon interlayer was included. Unstable, preferential water flow (and solute movement) often occur...|$|E
6000|$|Toady was {{so taken}} aback by this {{explosion}} that he let go his shoe-strings, fell over with a crash, and lay <b>flat,</b> with <b>shovel</b> and tongs spread upon him like a pall. In rushed Mrs. Snow and Polly, to find the boy's spirits quite quenched, for once, and Aunt Kipp in a towering passion. It all came out in one overwhelming flood of words, and Toady fled from the storm to wander round the house, a prey to the deepest remorse. The meekness of that boy at dinner-time was so angelic that Mrs. Snow would have feared speedy translation for him, {{if she had not}} been very angry. Polly's red eyes, and Aunt Kipp's griffinesque expression of countenance, weighed upon his soul so heavily, that even roly-poly pudding failed to assuage his trouble, and, taking his mother into the china-closet, he anxiously inquired [...] "if it was all up with Polly?" ...|$|R
60|$|He never remembered all he did. There was a {{constant}} clanging of shovels, whirring of coal trucks, and slamming of iron doors that opened to let out fiery heat and radiance and take the flying fuel in. Men came and went like phantoms, gasping, panting, groaning now and then, {{and the voice of}} their leader rose stridently at intervals. He was a man of low degree, and his commands were not characterised by any particular delicacy, but he was the man they needed, and when he emphasised his instructions with a grimy hand, and now and then the <b>flat</b> of the <b>shovel,</b> nobody resented it. During one brief interlude he found breath for a deprecatory word or two with Austin.|$|R
60|$|The {{fields are}} either {{terraces}} upon the hill slopes or {{the sides of}} valleys, divided by flowery hedges with lanes between, not unlike those of rustic England; and on a nearer approach the daisy, the thistle, and the sweet briar pleasantly affected my European eyes. The villages are no longer moveable: the Kraal and wigwam are replaced by the Gambisa or bell- shaped hut of Middle Africa [9], circular cottages of holcus wattle, Covered with coarse dab and surmounted by a stiff, conical, thatch roof, above which appears the central supporting post, crowned with a gourd or ostrich egg. [10] Strong abbatis of thorns protects these settlements, which stud the hills in all directions: near {{most of them are}} clumps of tall trees, to the southern sides of which are hung, like birdcages, long cylinders of matting, the hives of these regions. Yellow crops of holcus rewarded the peasant's toil: in some places the long stems tied in bunches below the ears as piled muskets, stood ready for the reaper; in others, the barer ground showed that the task was done. The boys sat perched upon reed platforms [11] in the trees, and with loud shouts drove away thieving birds, whilst their fathers cut the crop with diminutive sickles, or thrashed heaps of straw with rude flails [12], or winnowed grain by tossing it with a <b>flat</b> wooden <b>shovel</b> against the wind. The women husked the pineapple-formed heads in mortars composed of a hollowed trunk [13], smeared the threshing floor with cow-dung and water to defend it from insects, piled the holcus heads into neat yellow heaps, spanned and crossed by streaks of various colours, brick-red and brownish-purple [14], and stacked the Karbi or straw, which was surrounded like the grain with thorn, as a defence against the wild hog. All seemed to consider it a labour of love: the harvest-home song sounded pleasantly to our ears, and, contrasting with the silent desert, the hum of man's habitation was a music.|$|R
