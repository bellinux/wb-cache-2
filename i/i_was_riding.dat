500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy thing out there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E

It was then we talked about racing under the Union Flag, and we stayed in touch." ...|$|E

LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society. Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher.

She stated during a special event for her film Cake, [...] "I basically have a real fear of going underwater.

So, I can't go underwater {{and no one will}} believe me. I honestly can't." [...] The incident led to filming a swimming pool scene 30 times on the set of the film with director Daniel Barnz before getting it right.|$|E

6000|$|... "The zemindar is {{a generous}} man, indeed.

6000|$|Hans never hesitated. He {{had been}} with me through my recent campaign, and was {{accustomed}} to sudden orders.

2500|$|Jacques {{was a real}} Norman {{with the}} nuances of speech that make the Normans famous, they almost say Yes to mean No, and vice versa.

6000|$|... "Shame on you, Michelot," [...] I {{returned}} with some heat. [...] "You {{do not yet}} understand the ways of gentlemen.

60|$|One Sunday {{afternoon}} as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> {{over to the}} Grove, I met Burton plodding homeward along the grassy lane, walking with hanging head and sagging shoulders.
