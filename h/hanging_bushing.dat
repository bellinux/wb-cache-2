50|$|The natural {{vegetation}} of Southern Chile is mainly the Valdivian temperate rainforests. These forest {{are characterized by}} large trees, chiefly evergreen Nothofagus and Conifers plus Myrtles. The understory is made of vines, <b>hanging</b> vines, <b>bushes,</b> small trees, moss, dead trunks and decomposing matter. Despite of being largely evergreen the Valdivian temperate rainforests do contain a number of deciduous tree species like Nothofagus obliqua and Nothofagus alpina. Other vegetations types of southern Chile include Fitzroya forests, Araucaria forests and wetlands called ñadis.|$|R
60|$|We {{drew near}} and looked {{carefully}} at the place. The first thing I noticed was that the rock, which was not quite perpendicular, had been worn by the continual passage of baboons; the second, that something white was <b>hanging</b> on a <b>bush</b> {{near the top of}} the ascent.|$|R
60|$|Kennan was {{thoroughly}} {{aware of the}} gravity of his peril. Helpless himself, a man-killing lunatic was about to kill him and to kill him most horribly.

2500|$|John Josselyn, {{who visited}} New England in 1638 and again from 1663–1670, wrote [...] "there be {{infinite}} numbers of tikes <b>hanging</b> upon the <b>bushes</b> in summer time that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches eating {{themselves in a}} short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockins of those that have gone through the woods covered with them." ...|$|R

For {{the last three days}} the necks of not only my children but of my wife and myself, as well, have been <b>hanging</b> on the <b>bushes</b> to be cured; so we could not possibly have eaten your plum-pudding. Indeed, it was only an hour ago when I finished putting the neck on the last of my children, and at that moment your soldiers came and arrested me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Drift, I suppose,' I answered, and we drifted accordingly. All the {{afternoon}} and well into the evening we floated on in the gloom beneath the far-off line of blue sky, scarcely knowing when day ended and night began, for down in that vast gulf {{the difference was not}} marked, till at length Good pointed out a star hanging right above us, which, having nothing better to do, we observed with great interest. Suddenly it vanished, the darkness became intense, and a familiar murmuring sound filled the air. 'Underground again,' I said with a groan, holding up the lamp. Yes, there was no doubt about it. I could just make out the roof. The chasm had come to an end and the tunnel had recommenced. And then there began another long, long night of danger and horror. To describe all its incidents would be too wearisome, so I will simply say that about midnight we struck on a flat projecting rock in mid-stream and were as nearly as possible overturned and drowned. However, at last we got off, and went upon the uneven tenor of our way. And so the hours passed till it was nearly three o'clock. Sir Henry, Good, and Alphonse were asleep, utterly worn out; Umslopogaas was at the bow with the pole, and I was steering, when I perceived that the rate at which we were travelling had perceptibly increased. Then, suddenly, I heard Umslopogaas make an exclamation, and next second came a sound as of parting branches, and I became aware that the canoe was being forced through <b>hanging</b> <b>bushes</b> or creepers. Another minute, and the breath of sweet open air fanned my face, and I felt that we had emerged from the tunnel and were floating upon clear water. I say felt, for I could see nothing, the darkness being absolutely pitchy, as it often is just before the dawn. But even this could scarcely damp my joy. We were out of that dreadful river, and wherever we might have got to this at least was something to be thankful for. And so I sat down and inhaled the sweet night air and waited for the dawn with such patience as I could command.|$|R

50|$|They {{are a part}} of {{the rose}} family (Rosaceae) and related to the apple. The botanical genus name derives from the Greek word photeinos for shiny and refers to the often glossy leaves. Most species are evergreen, but {{deciduous}} species also occur. The small apple-shaped fruit has a size of 4 to 12 mm and forms in large quantities. They ripen in the fall and often remain <b>hanging</b> on the <b>bush</b> until well into the winter. The fruits are used as food by birds, which excrete the seeds with their droppings and thereby distribute the plant.|$|R
60|$|There was a square, {{whitewashed}} house {{standing by}} the roadside, which appeared, from the <b>bush</b> <b>hanging</b> over the door, {{to be one of}} those wayside tabernas which are provided for the muleteers. A lantern was hung in the porch, and by its light we saw two men, the one in the brown habit of a Capuchin monk, and the other girt with an apron, which showed him to be the landlord. They were conversing together so earnestly that we were upon them before they were aware of us. The innkeeper turned to fly, but one of the Englishmen seized him by the hair, and held him tight.|$|R

5000|$|Duggan was {{dismissed}} from duty as Marshal after a February, 1879 drinking binge. But was quickly reinstated {{when it became}} obvious no one could replace him at that time, given the town's rowdy status. On March 10, 1879, Bill and Jim Bush, businessmen and also friends to Mayor Tabor, became involved in a dispute on a vacant lot with Mortimer Arbuckle, another businessman who had evidently set up his small shanty shack business on a lot belonging to the Bush brothers. In {{the heat of a}} physical exchange, Jim Bush pulled a pistol and shot Arbuckle, killing him. Arbuckle was unarmed, and was well liked in town. Another mob formed, intent on burning the hotel owned by Bill <b>Bush,</b> and <b>hanging</b> Jim <b>Bush.</b> Duggan again backed down the mob, and arrested Jim Bush for murder. By dawn the next day, it was apparent that trouble was again brewing, so Duggan took Jim Bush, under guard, to Denver, for safe keeping until trial. Leadville businessman G. W. Bartlett would later claim years later, [...] "There was not a braver man in camp", speaking of Duggan.|$|R
50|$|The wattled ibis usually nests {{in small}} to large colonies on rocky cliffs, over <b>bushes</b> <b>hanging</b> in the walls, {{but it has}} also been {{reported}} to nest singly on top of trees or ledges of buildings. Few colonies are known above 3000 meters, and those in trees at lower elevations (1800 - 2000 m) in Lake Awasa. In the Bale Mountains there are nesting colonies of 500 or more birds. The nest is a platform of branches and sticks, lined with grass and strips of bark; sometimes at high and cold altitudes, they are located to the east for maximum exposure to morning sun. The wattled ibis breeds from March to July; and occasionally in December, during the dry season. It lays two or three rough shelled eggs which are dirty white in color.|$|R

Thin trees with few leaves line the river's right bank at center with several wooden structures standing in the dusty industrial yard behind them. Plants are bound together and piled in stacks among the short structures on the right and animals appear to be in pens behind them. Just beyond the pens, several people stand along the bridge which extends over the shimmering river to the dusty hills on the left.

60|$|These are a peaceable {{and ugly}} tribe of Mulgars, with {{extremely}} long and sinewy tails, which are tufted at the tip, {{like those of}} the Moona-mulgars, with a bunch of fine silky hair. They smear upon this tuft the pulp of a fruit that grows on a <b>bush</b> <b>hanging</b> over the water, called Soota, which the fish that swim in this torrent never weary of nibbling. Then, sitting huddled up and motionless in some little inlet or rocky hole in the bank, the Fishing-mulgar pays out his long tail and lets it drift with the stream. By-and-by, maybe, some hungry fish comes swimming by that way and smells the pounded Soota. He softly stays, nibbling and tasting. Very slowly the Fishing-mulgar, who instantly perceives the least commotion in his tail-tuft, draws back his bait without so much as blinking an eyelid. And when he has enticed the fish quite close to the bank, still all intent on its feeding, he stoops in a flash, and, plunging his sharp-nailed hands in the water, hooks the struggler out.|$|R
500|$|In {{the parking}} lot, Andy has not shown {{up for the}} duel, instead leaving a {{deliberately}} verbose note <b>hanging</b> in the <b>bushes</b> saying he has given up. As Dwight reads it, Andy sneaks up behind him in his Toyota Prius, a hybrid car that remains completely silent when driven below five miles per hour due to the electric motor. Impressed by Andy's deviousness, {{the rest of the}} office does not warn Dwight, saying that Andy [...] "deserves the win". Andy pins Dwight between the car and the large bushes in the parking lot. Jim races out to check that Andy and Dwight are not seriously injured, but they snap at him to go away. The two bicker back and forth about Angela. However, the fight goes out of Dwight when he learns Andy has had sex with Angela, because she told him that {{he was the only one}} she had had sex with. Crestfallen, Dwight and Andy both admit defeat and return to the office, where Andy calls to cancel his wedding cake, and Dwight throws away a bobblehead doll Angela previously bought him as a gift. A saddened Angela realizes she has lost both men.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after 3 PM on 8 July 1996, {{parents and}} {{teachers}} at St. Luke's School were organising a teddy bear picnic to celebrate {{the end of the}} school term. A man described as being in his mid-30s with a slight build whom parents had seen <b>hanging</b> around the <b>bushes</b> prior to the attack, jumped over a fence surrounding the children's play area and pulled out a large machete. As parents attempted to distract and stop the attacker, he calmly began slashing the machete indiscriminately at the adults and children. Three children and four adults, most notably Lisa Potts, were injured in the attack. Potts was a 21-year-old teacher at the school who suffered cuts to her head, back, arms, and one of her arms was almost severed in the attack. [...] A parent chased the man out of the area towards a housing area known as Villiers Flats. Police surrounded the area, and approximately two hours later took away a man who turned out to be someone other than the assailant. On the following day, after hours of searching the area, police arrested 32-year-old Horrett Irving Campbell in connection with the attack.|$|R
5000|$|... 'The {{delightful}} {{village of}} Shanklin. In this sequestered spot {{is a good}} inn, fitted up for the accommodation of visitors. The object of attraction at Shanklin is the Chine, (which is situated at about ten minutes walk from the inn. This phenomenon of nature {{is a combination of}} beauty and grandeur; it is formed by the separation of a lofty cliff, whose height is 280 feet perpendicular, and 100 feet wide at the top. On entering the Chine from the shore, we pass along one side, rugged and barren; through which a winding path has been cut by a poor fisherman; while below the rippling stream urges its way to the ocean, which pours its rolling waters at its feet, and spreads its boundless expanse before it. On the other side the cliff is fertile, covered with <b>hanging</b> wood and <b>bushes,</b> adorned with a neat cottage, and having a little rustic inn. About the middle of the Chine is a small Chalybeate: and the path now conducts by a serpentine course to a scene of awful grandeur, formed by stupendous masses of matter on each side, and the rustling of a small cascade, which falls from the head of the Chine, and passes between the dark and overhanging cliffs.Extract from Beauties of the Isle of Wight published by S Horsley 1828 ...|$|R
60|$|At length, when we {{had made}} about seven miles, as far as Billerica, we moored our boat {{on the west side}} of a little rising ground which in the spring forms an island in the river. Here we found huckleberries still <b>hanging</b> upon the <b>bushes,</b> where they seemed to have slowly ripened for our especial use. Bread and sugar, and cocoa boiled in river water, made our repast, and as we had drank in the fluvial {{prospect}} all day, so now we took a draft of the water with our evening meal to propitiate the river gods, and whet our vision for the sights it was to behold. The sun was setting on the one hand, while our eminence was contributing its shadow to the night, on the other. It seemed insensibly to grow lighter as the night shut in, and a distant and solitary farm-house was revealed, which before lurked in the shadows of the noon. There was no other house in sight, nor any cultivated field. To the right and left, as far as the horizon, were straggling pine woods with their plumes against the sky, and across the river were rugged hills, covered with shrub oaks, tangled with grape-vines and ivy, with here and there a gray rock jutting out from the maze. The sides of these cliffs, though a quarter of a mile distant, were almost heard to rustle while we looked at them, it was such a leafy wilderness; a place for fauns and satyrs, and where bats hung all day to the rocks, and at evening flitted over the water, and fire-flies husbanded their light under the grass and leaves against the night. When we had pitched our tent on the hillside, a few rods from the shore, we sat looking through its triangular door in the twilight at our lonely mast on the shore, just seen above the alders, and hardly yet come to a stand-still from the swaying of the stream; the first encroachment of commerce on this land. There was our port, our Ostia. That straight geometrical line against the water and the sky stood for the last refinements of civilized life, and what of sublimity there is in history was there symbolized.|$|R
6000|$|Our way to {{the high}} sand-bank, which I have {{described}} as extending all along the coast, led, as usual, through patches of Bayberry bushes which straggled into the sand. This, next to the Shrub-oak, {{was perhaps the most}} common shrub thereabouts. I was much attracted by its odoriferous leaves and small gray berries which are clustered about the short twigs, just below the last year's growth. I know of but two bushes in Concord, and they, being staminate plants, do not bear fruit. The berries gave it a venerable appearance, and they smelled quite spicy, like small confectionery. Robert Beverley, in his [...] "History of Virginia," [...] published in 1705, states that [...] "at the mouth of their rivers, and all along upon the sea and bay, and near many of their creeks and swamps, grows the myrtle, bearing a berry, of which they make a hard brittle wax, of a curious green color, which by refining becomes almost transparent. Of this they make candles, which are never greasy to the touch nor melt with lying in the hottest weather; neither does the snuff of these ever offend the smell, like that of a tallow candle; but, instead of being disagreeable, if an accident puts a candle out, it yields a pleasant fragrancy to all that are in the room; insomuch that nice people often put them out on purpose to have the incense of the expiring snuff. The melting of these berries {{is said to have been}} first found out by a surgeon in New England, who performed wonderful things with a salve made of them." [...] From the abundance of berries still <b>hanging</b> on the <b>bushes,</b> we judged that the inhabitants did not generally collect them for tallow, though we had seen a piece in the house we had just left. I have since made some tallow myself. Holding a basket beneath the bare twigs in April, I rubbed them together between my hands and thus gathered about a quart in twenty minutes, to which were added enough to make three pints, and I might have gathered them much faster with a suitable rake and a large shallow basket. They have little prominences like those of an orange all creased in tallow, which also fills the interstices down to the stone. The oily part rose to the top, making it look like a savory black broth, which smelled much like balm or other herb tea. You let it cool, then skim off the tallow from the surface, melt this again and strain it. I got about a quarter of a pound weight from my three pints, and more yet remained within the berries. A small portion cooled in the form of small flattish hemispheres, like crystallizations, the size of a kernel of corn (nuggets I called them as I picked them out from amid the berries), Loudon says, that [...] "cultivated trees are said to yield more wax than those that are found wild." [...] (See Duplessy, Vegetaux Resineux, Vol. II. p. 60.) If you get any pitch on your hands in the pine-woods you have only to rub some of these berries between your hands to start it off. But the ocean was the grand fact there, which made us forget both bay berries and men.|$|R
