In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that {{reduces the risk of}} clotting diseases.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Heart disease <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> are {{the first}} and third leading causes of death of American women, respectively. African American women {{experience}} a disproportionate burden of these diseases compared with Caucasian women and {{are also more likely to}} delay seeking treatment for acute symptoms. As knowledge is a first step in seeking care, this study examined the knowledge of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> symptoms among African American women. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study analyzing 2003 – 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) data. A composite <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> knowledge score was computed for each respondent from the 13 <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> symptom knowledge questions. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using low scores on the <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> knowledge questions as the dependent variable. Results: Twenty percent of the respondents were low scorers, and 23. 8 % were high scorers. Logistic regression analysis showed that adult African American women who earned low scores on the composite <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> knowledge questions (range 0 – 8 points) were more likely to be aged 18 – 34 (OR = 1. 36, CI 1. 35, 1. 37), be uninsured (OR = 1. 32, CI 1. 31, 1. 33), have an annual household income <$ 35, 000 (OR = 1. 46, CI 1. 45, 1. 47), and have a primary healthcare provider (OR = 1. 22, CI 1. 20, 1. 23). Conclusions: The findings indicated that knowledge of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> symptoms varied significantly among African American women, depending on socioeconomic variables. Targeting interventions to African American women, particularly those in lower socioeconomic groups, may increase knowledge of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> symptoms, subsequently improving preventive action taken in response to these conditions...|$|R
5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>strokes)</b> was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} treatable with initial {{treatment}} primarily focused on diet and lifestyle interventions. Influenza may make <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>strokes</b> more likely and therefore influenza vaccination may decrease {{the chance of}} cardiovascular events and death in people with heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everyone}} with rheumatoid arthritis responds favorably to treatment with methotrexate, but multiple studies and reviews {{showed that the}} majority of people receiving methotrexate for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and their doctors. X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many people receiving methotrexate, with the progression being completely halted in about 30% of those receiving the drug. Those individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate have been found to have a lower risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions (<b>heart</b> <b>attacks)</b> <b>and</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{higher number}} of {{cardiovascular}} events has been observed in people taking sibutramine versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%). [...] In 2010 the FDA noted the concerns that sibutramine {{increases the risk of}} <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>strokes</b> in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
2500|$|Pre-approval Phase III {{clinical}} trials, {{like the}} APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events {{for the first}} eighteen months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others {{have pointed out that}} [...] "study 090," [...] a pre-approval trial, showed a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a 7-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another [...] ), and an 8-fold increase in <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>strokes</b> combined compared to both control groups. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{association}} of vitamin D with <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> remains unclear. METHOD: Using {{data from the}} Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), we collected dietary vitamin D data from 5, 995 participants and serum (25) OH vitamin D from 1, 606 participants. The {{association of}} vitamin D with prevalent <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>strokes</b> was studied using an unconditional logistic regression model. Then, incidence of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> was prospectively studied using a log binomial model. RESULTS: In the analysis of prevalence, a non-significant inverse relationship between vitamin D <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> was observed. However, participants in the highest quartile of dietary vitamin D reported significantly fewer prevalent strokes than men in the lowest quartile (prevalence ratio, 0. 72; p= 0. 04). In the incidence analysis, the data was largely inconclusive. In the dietary vitamin D analyses, the highest quartile dietary vitamin D was generally associated with a non-significant decreased odds of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> (odds ratio, 0. 98; p= 0. 91) <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> (odds ratio 0. 97; p= 0. 98). Similarly, in the serum analysis, the highest quartile of serum vitamin {{was associated with a}} non-significant decreased odds of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> (odds ratio, 0. 82; p= 0. 49) <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> (odds ratio 0. 57; p= 0. 10). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D was not significantly protective against incidents of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke.</b> While the majority of our results showed a minor protective effect, it was too small to make definitive conclusions...|$|R
