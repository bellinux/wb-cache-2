25|$|Long {{duration}} bonds {{tend to be}} mean reverting, {{meaning that}} they readily gravitate to a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5–10 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even if <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> not changed. The long-end does not move quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue price}} at which investors buy the bonds {{when they are}} first issued will {{typically}} be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or {{there is a high}} probability of default on the bond).|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} two centuries, <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> been {{variously}} set either by national governments or central banks. For example, the Federal Reserve federal funds rate in the United States has varied between about 0.25% to 19% from 1954 to 2008, while the Bank of England base rate varied between 0.5% and 15% from 1989 to 2009, and Germany experienced rates close to 90% in the 1920s down to about 2% in the 2000s. During an attempt to tackle spiraling hyperinflation in 2007, the Central Bank of Zimbabwe increased interest rates for borrowing to 800%.|$|E
30|$|Expectations and {{uncertainties}} are also {{considered to be}} important determinants of investment. For instance, any increase in the prices of material or energy will reduce investment. Onwumere et al.

After liberalization, however, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>has</b> had a negative non-significant effect on saving, and a negative but significant effect on investment.|$|R

We use Korean high-frequency (weekly) data during the crisis and its aftermath {{to examine the relationship between}} the increase in <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and the behaviour of exchange rates.

500|$|In mid-2012, due to {{successful}} fiscal consolidation {{and implementation of}} structural reforms in the countries being most at risk and various policy measures taken by EU leaders and the ECB (see below), financial stability in the eurozone has improved significantly and <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> steadily fallen. This has also greatly diminished contagion risk for other eurozone countries. [...] only 3 out of 17 eurozone countries, namely Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus still battled with long-term interest rates above 6%. By early January 2013, successful sovereign debt auctions across the eurozone but most importantly in Ireland, Spain, and Portugal, shows investors believe the ECB-backstop has worked. In November 2013 ECB lowered its bank rate to only 0.25% to aid recovery in the eurozone. As of May 2014 only two countries (Greece and Cyprus) still need help from third parties.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{purchases}} {{are made}} by New Zealanders or foreigners, it is generally those who are already well off that are buying the bulk of properties on the market. This has had a dramatic effect on home ownership rates by Kiwis, now at its lowest level since 1951. Even as recently as 1991, 76% of New Zealand homes were occupied by their owners. By 2013, this was down to 63%, indicating {{that more and more}} people are having to rent. Raewyn Cox, chief executive of the Federation of Family Budgeting, says: [...] "High prices and high <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>have)</b> sentenced a rising number of New Zealanders to be lifetime tenants" [...] where they are [...] "stuck in expensive rental situations, heading towards retirement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Negative <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>have</b> been {{proposed}} in the past, notably in the late 19th century by Silvio Gesell. A negative interest rate can be described (as by Gesell) as a [...] "tax on holding money"; he proposed it as the Freigeld (free money) component of his Freiwirtschaft (free economy) system. To prevent people from holding cash (and thus earning 0%), Gesell suggested issuing money for a limited duration, after which it must be exchanged for new bills; attempts to hold money thus result in it expiring and becoming worthless. Along similar lines, John Maynard Keynes approvingly cited {{the idea of a}} carrying tax on money, (1936, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money) but dismissed it due to administrative difficulties. More recently, a carry tax on currency was proposed by a Federal Reserve employee (Marvin Goodfriend) in 1999, to be implemented via magnetic strips on bills, deducting the carry tax upon deposit, the tax being based on how long the bill had been held.|$|E

40|$|We {{find that}} real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> paid on {{government}} debt depend significantly upon current and expected future levels of debt, in Europe {{as in the}} US.

The previously strong effect of debt on US <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>has</b> been diluted {{by the addition of}} 2004 - 2006 data to the sample, perhaps reflecting the effect of massive purchases of US securities by foreign central banks.

Using univariate and multivariate regressions, the results suggest that the level of the volatility of the overnight <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>has</b> significantly decreased after March 2004, whereas the sensitivity of the overnight <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>has</b> increased, especially over {{the last days of the}} reserve maintenance periods.
