500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1950 Chance of a Lifetime was {{released}} into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques [...] "really made her mark", according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied [...] "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> That's not enough money!" [...] and the offer was raised accordingly. The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had [...] "the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front of an angry [...] MacGinnis".|$|E
2500|$|Since modular {{arithmetic}} {{has such}} {{a wide range of}} applications, it is important to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to solve a system of congruences. A linear system of congruences can be solved in polynomial time with a form of Gaussian elimination, for details see linear congruence theorem. [...] Algorithms, such as Montgomery reduction, also exist to allow simple arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and exponentiation modulonbsp&, to be performed efficiently on large numbers.|$|E

5000|$|Several US radio {{stations}} declined to broadcast the song {{because of what}} they saw as sacrilegious use of the words Christ and crucify in the chorus: Christ, you know <b>it</b> ain’t easy,You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> can be,The way things are going,They’re gonna crucify me.

5000|$|When {{cartoonist}} Al Capp visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono {{at their}} 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, Capp pointedly asked Lennon {{about the meaning}} of the lyrics of the song. Their testy exchange later appeared in the 1988 documentary film Imagine: John Lennon. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify Capp!" ...|$|R
60|$|But on this occasion, Mr Gazebee {{stayed a}} long time at the castle, and {{singular}} rumours as {{to the cause of}} his prolonged visit became current in the little town. No female scion of the present family of Courcy had, as yet, found a mate.

6000|$|... "No, dear," [...] I replied, [...] "I shall {{always love}} you.

6000|$|... “I {{have never}} heard him say {{anything}} on this subject,” returned the clergyman’s daughter; “but I suppose that, as they are poor, they very naturally are anxious to keep the little that they honestly own.

5000|$|Her friend, {{transgender}} activist Andrea James, co-stars in the series, and was {{a consulting}} producer. In a 2013 interview, James explains that she saw an opportunity for social progress in a program that accurately represented men who are attracted to trans women. Typically, she says, in US media trans-attracted men are stigmatized and shamed, and that can make them hate themselves—and [...] "lead to unhealthy and even dangerous situations for trans women." [...] "No one <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> {{is for us to}} date!" [...] Addams adds. Both Addams and James hoped the show would also undermine the media stereotype of trans women as [...] "tragic and serious".|$|R

I <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> would be on father and the kids--especially little Mary. (Her voice trembles a bit.) And then the doctor said if I stayed I'd be putting them all in danger. He even ordered me not to kiss them any more. (She bites her lip to {{restrain}} a sob--then coughs, a soft, husky cough. Nicholls shrinks away from her to the edge of his chair, his eyes shifting nervously with fright. Eileen continues gently.) So I've got to go and get well, don't you see? ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2011, it was {{announced}} that Katy Armstrong will decide that she wants a baby with Chesney in a forthcoming storyline. Katy (Georgia May Foote) will make the suggestion of starting a family to Chesney in the weeks ahead - leaving him shocked as he believes they are too young for parenthood. However, after Katy continues to push the idea, Chesney (Sam Aston) is expected to change his mind and begin looking for a flat that he can rent with his girlfriend. Discussing Fiz's reaction, a Coronation Street source said [...] "After just having a child herself she <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> is. She doesn't want him ruining his life by becoming a dad when he's still a kid." [...] But they have a baby boy called Joseph anyway.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, hush, darling!" [...] Rhoda {{cried in}} an awed voice, stooping down half alarmed {{to kiss her}} pale forehead. [...] "You mustn't talk like that, Olive dearest.

5000|$|Michigan 23, Iowa 6. Michigan (ranked No. 6 in the AP Poll) {{defeated}} Iowa, 23-6, {{before a}} crowd of 104,617 at the annual homecoming game at Michigan Stadium. Rick Leach completed nine of 12 passes for 202 yards, including touchdown passes covering 63 yards to Russell Davis, six yards to Gene Johnson, and 32 yards to Rick White. Leach's three touchdown passes gave him 25 for his career, breaking the record of 23 set by Bob Chappuis in the 1940s. Michigan also scored on a safety {{in the fourth quarter}} when linebacker Dom Tedesco tackled Iowa's quarterback in the end zone.

In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko", with Lennon singing the lines, [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> can be, The way things are going, They're gonna crucify me." [...] In a BBC interview a few months later, Lennon called himself [...] "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church.|$|R
