Interior fabrics matched those on the Laurel, with standard features including automatic headlights, lighted <b>keyslot,</b> rear-illuminated instrument cluster, integrated sound-system, automatic climate control, digital temperature control, adjustable shoulder height seat-belts, 4-way adjustments, lumbar support for the driver's seat, windscreen wipers with adjustable intermittent timings, remotely controlled wing mirrors that folded close and most importantly, frameless windows that mimicked the NX Coupe and Silvia.In fact, so feature-full and advanced was the car that many units had 4-disc brakes with ABS and a rear windscreen wiper.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} an explanation of the reason causing the magnetic particle pattern in radiating form near corners of a <b>keyslot</b> on workpiece surface in theory. An item analysis was conducted on the distribution of magnetic charges along the convex edges of a discontinuity on the ferromagnetic workpiece surface at magnetization and the magnetic force acting upon a magnetic particle near the corners. The principle finding of the item analysis was that around a large square hole, a parallelogram slot and near corners of a <b>keyslot</b> on the workpiece surface there sometimes will appear magnetic particle pattern in radiating long straight lines starting from the corners of them and spreading out along the 45 °lines. On the basis of these findings the deduction mentioned above was verified not only by a magnetic particle testing experiment made in the summer of 1995 by the author etc, but also by some experiences of magnetic particle inspection in production. Reference[1] successfully explained quantitatively the reason causing the strange magnetic particle pattern around a small square hole (0. 6 × 0. 6 mm) on the workpiece surface—four long straight lines starting from the four corners of the square hole. Some of the readers asked:“Will this radiating type of magnetic particle pattern also appear around a large square hole on the workpiece surface? ” In order to answer this question the autho...|$|E

These include the following contents: 1) Magnetic field of a magnetic dipole, a linear magnetic dipole of finite length and a strip magnetic dipole of finite length; 2) Magnetic force acting upon a magnetic particle; 3) The effect of magnetizing field orientation on the revelation of defects by magnetic particles; 4) Longitudinal magnetization of a rod, tube and cuboid steel component; 5) Magnetic leakage field yielded by a slot on the workpiece surface; 6) The analytic expressions for some results of classical experiments (made by Japanese Society for NDI and Dr. F. Förster); 7) Theoretical explanation of some strange magnetic particle patterns (around a square hole, near corners of a <b>keyslot</b> and over cylindrical surface of a pin with throughout hole) and abnormal phenomena in magnetic NDT (reversing of magnetic poles in a slot after discontinuation of magnetization, non-relevant magnetic particle indications along the lateral edges of a cuboid steel component magnetized longitudinally and along the base apex lines of a workpiece magnetized circumferentially); 8) Seeking new electromagnetic law and conception for NDT; 9) The distribution of magnetic charges in a region on the plane; 10) Approximate theory for the ring standard specimens (magnetic leakage field from a subsuface flaw) and so on...|$|E
