40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> has assumed an {{important}} {{place in the}} policy and practice of English health and social care. Yet, despite much being claimed for this way of working {{there is a lack}} of evidence to demonstrate the outcomes of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning.</b> This paper examines the types of impacts that have been claimed for <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> within the literature. Method: The paper reviews the extant literature concerning <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> employing an interpretive schema to examine the different meanings afforded to this concept. The paper reviews over 100 documents that discuss <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning,</b> adopting an interpretive approach which sought to identify a series of discourses, each of which view the processes and outcomes of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> differently. Results: This paper finds that although much has been written about <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> there is little evidence to link it to changes in outcomes. Much of the evidence base focuses on the processes of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> and few studies have systematically studied the outcomes of this way of working. Further, there does not appear to be one single definition of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> and it is used in a variety of different ways across health and social care. The paper identifies three dominant discourses of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> – prevention, empowerment and efficiency. Each of these offers a different way of seeing <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> and suggests that it should achieve different aims. Conclusions: There is a lack of clarity not only in terms of what <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> has been demonstrated to achieve but even in terms of what it should achieve. <b>Joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> is far from a clear concept with a number of different potential meanings. Although this ambiguity can be helpful in some ways in the sense that it can bring together disparate groups, for example, if <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> is to be delivered at a local level then more specificity may be required in terms of what they are being asked to deliver...|$|R
40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} alluded to in English health and social care policy {{as a way of}} improving services and outcomes. Yet {{there is a lack of}} specificity pertaining to what <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> actually is and what success would look like. In this paper we adopt a Q methodology approach to understand the different meanings of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> that those involved in these arrangements hold. In doing so we get beyond the more orthodox interpretations of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> found in the literature although the appeal of <b>joint</b> <b>commissioning</b> as a ‘good thing’ is still prominent across these accounts...|$|R
