5|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a <b>diver</b> suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} events may result in the <b>diver</b> drowning or further injury to the <b>diver</b> during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the <b>diver,</b> and suspending the <b>diver</b> from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby <b>diver</b> attend the <b>diver</b> undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|E
5|$|A <b>diver</b> {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic <b>diver</b> training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the <b>diver</b> to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. <b>Diver</b> injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the <b>diver</b> is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a <b>diver</b> in a vast ocean—after waking up {{floating}} on the ocean's surface, the <b>diver</b> begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the <b>diver</b> is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the <b>diver</b> unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the <b>diver</b> through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The <b>diver</b> can accelerate, and interact with marine life using sonar chimes. The <b>diver</b> can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. Each area sports hidden collectables for the <b>diver</b> to find.|$|E

This paper presents the occurrence of <b>diver's</b> hand and describes the disease in clinical and epidemiological terms. Three studies of <b>diver's</b> hand have been carried out, in 1990, 1994, and 1995. Most long term saturation <b>divers</b> have had <b>diver's</b> hand at some time in their professional career. <b>Diver's</b> hand seems able to occur without any previous skin symptoms, and <b>divers</b> without <b>diver's</b> hand can have several other skin symptoms during a saturation period. It is likely that <b>diver's</b> hand is a specific phenomenon associated with saturation diving...|$|R
5|$|A scuba <b>diver</b> moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a <b>diver</b> propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the <b>diver</b> certification organisations which issue these <b>diver</b> certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped <b>diver</b> experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E
5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a <b>diver</b> {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the <b>diver</b> should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} <b>diver</b> could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The <b>diver</b> would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the <b>diver</b> to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E

5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the <b>diver</b> is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} <b>diver</b> may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the <b>diver</b> from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|Open {{water is}} {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the <b>diver</b> has direct vertical access {{to the surface of}} the water in contact with the atmosphere.

5|$|The ascent is {{made at the}} {{recommended}} rate until the <b>diver</b> reaches {{the depth of the}} first stop. The <b>diver</b> then maintains the specified stop depth for the specified period, before ascending to the next stop depth at {{the recommended}} rate, and follows the same procedure again.

5|$|The <b>diver</b> ascends {{along the}} shotline, and may use it purely {{as a visual}} reference, or can {{hold on to it}} to {{positively}} control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand.

5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the <b>diver</b> and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the <b>diver</b> and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to <b>diver</b> safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} of Abzû is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, {{taking place in}} a vast ocean. The player character, {{referred to as a}} female <b>diver,</b> awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by a great white shark to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the <b>diver</b> sees the great white shark attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean—and mortally wounds the great white shark, which dies as the <b>diver</b> comforts it. After activating the final well, the great white shark manifests and guides the repaired <b>diver</b> back to the pyramid. The <b>diver</b> destroys the pyramid, causing life to return to the ocean. During the credits, the <b>diver</b> and great white shark swim together through the revitalized ocean.|$|E
5|$|Underwater <b>diver</b> {{training}} is normally {{given by a}} qualified instructor {{who is a member}} of one of many <b>diver</b> training agencies or is registered with a government agency.

40|$|Abstract: Great Lakes <b>divers</b> pride {{themselves}} in being hardy, tough, and robust {{in order to}} dive under innately challenging environmental conditions, suggests qualitative focus group data collected from New York SCUBA <b>divers.</b> Since Great Lakes participants tend to dive in both fresh and saltwater, dive three or four seasons a year, belong to dive clubs, and subscribe to dive magazines more often than other <b>divers,</b> {{it was hypothesized that}} these segments of <b>divers</b> would report lower degrees of constraints. In 1999, a total of 869 New York State <b>divers</b> returned mail surveys (37 % response rate). <b>Divers</b> with Great Lakes experience did report significantly lower constraint levels for 7 of 11 factors than <b>divers</b> who had not used these lakes. All other hypothesized relationships were also supported; <b>divers</b> using both fresh and saltwater tended to experience constraints to a lower degree (differing significantly on 6 factors), as did year-round <b>divers</b> (10 factors), dive club members (6 factors), and magazine subscribers (7 factors), with one exception: magazine subscribers experienced higher degrees of constraint for conflict with other users. These results suggest that Great Lakes <b>divers</b> are able to negotiate perceived constraints more successfully than other types of <b>divers,</b> supporting the notion that they are a hardier and more robust “breed. ” In addition, dive clubs and magazines also seem to be associated with lower levels of constraint, suggesting their socializing, supportive, and educational influence on <b>divers...</b>|$|R
