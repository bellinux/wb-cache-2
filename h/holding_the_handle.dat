25|$|On {{the first}} slab, BM 536, {{the battle is}} evenly balanced, one Amazon and one Greek having the better of the {{fighting}} {{in a pair of}} duels. On the following slab, BM 533, appears the first casualty, BM 533:1, an Amazon probably <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of an axe in her right hand as she collapses. Her helmet lies on the ground to her right side. The dress of the dying Amazon here, an overgirt peplos and mantle, distinguishes her from the other Amazon warriors who wear the more typical chitoniskos. The axe and helmet identify her as a combatant, and the peplos therefore must indicate that {{she is one of the}} three Amazonian queens who take part in the battle. As a queen and the first casualty she must be Melanippe, and the Greek who kills her must be Telamon. Telamon, BM 533:2, stands adjacent to his victim but now has tumed his spear to another.|$|E
60|$|Lord Marshmoreton {{had reached}} the door, and was {{standing}} <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> He seemed to gather strength from its support.|$|E
60|$|Something in Mr. Smith's {{manner as}} he uttered this simple {{statement}} made his listeners anxious to hear more. Mr. Kybird, {{who had just}} entered the room and was standing {{with his back to}} the door <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> regarded him expectantly.|$|E

60|$|It {{was evident}} {{that they had not}} {{expected}} to find the door unlocked, and the absence of resistance when they applied their weight had surprising effects. Two of the three did not pause in their career till they cannoned against the table. The third checked himself by <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{handle of}} the door began to revolve slowly and quietly. The next moment three figures tumbled into the room. It was evident {{that they had not}} {{expected}} to find the door unlocked, and the absence of resistance when they applied their weight had had surprising effects. Two of the three did not pause in their career till they cannoned against the table. The third, who was <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> was more fortunate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{as regards}} the threats you make. I shall try to meet them as {{occasion}} arises, and if I cannot do {{so it will be}} my misfortune. But one thing they show me, though I am sorry to have to say it to any man in a house which I can still call my own--they show me that my first impressions of you were the correct ones. /You are not a gentleman/, Mr. Cossey, and I must beg to decline the honour of your further acquaintance," [...] and with another bow he opened the vestibule door and stood <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> in his hand.|$|E
50|$|Bum slider is {{a plastic}} toy used for going down a snowy slope, {{mountain}} or hill. The use {{is similar to}} a pulk, sledge or toboggan but instead of sitting in the pulk the rider just sits on <b>the</b> plastic and <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> in front.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Many {{tools are}} {{designed}} to be easy to hold and use for their intended purpose. For example, a screwdriver typically has a handle with rounded edges and a grippable surface, {{to make it easier for}} <b>the</b> user to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> and twist it to drive a screw.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experimenter}} {{should avoid}} excessive movement during the experiment.

60|$|Bertie {{put on an}} old {{overcoat}} {{and took}} a lantern. He went out from the side door. He shrank from the wet and roaring night. Such weather had a nervous effect on him: too much moisture everywhere made him feel almost imbecile. Unwilling, he went through it all. A dog barked violently at him. He peered in all the buildings. At last, {{as he opened the}} upper door of a sort of intermediate barn, he heard a grinding noise, and looking in, holding up his lantern, saw Maurice, in his shirt-sleeves, standing listening, <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of a turnip-pulper. He had been pulping sweet roots, a pile of which lay dimly heaped in a corner behind him.|$|E
5000|$|Bite handle: The {{handle that}} closes on the sharp {{edge of the}} blade, and will cut the user if they are <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> {{when they go to}} close it. It's the handle that usually has the latch on it.|$|E

6000|$|... "There you are, sir," [...] I cried. [...] "Hire {{that boy}} to tow you. Your butler {{can sit in}} the back of <b>the</b> cart and <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of your bath-chair. It may take long to get a carriage, and the cart will go much faster. You may {{overtake}} them in a mile." ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{devices were}} {{patented}} to <b>hold</b> coffee cups. <b>The</b> main {{problem in the}} endeavor {{is to provide a}} mechanism to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of <b>the</b> cup which usually protrudes a few centimeters {{from the side of the}} mug. Another problem facing the inventors is the varying sizes of coffee cups.Some devices which were patented are as follows.|$|R
5000|$|Renegade row: Also {{called a}} plank row, the trainee starts in <b>the</b> plank {{position}} <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> of two grounded kettlebells. One bell is rowed {{to the chest}} while maintaining the plank position, {{then returned to the}} ground and repeated with the other arm. Alternatively performed with a single kettlebell, one arm at a time.|$|R
5000|$|... {{musical saw}} is a {{flexible}} handsaw played by <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> between the knees and bending the blade while bowing along the flat edge. The musical saw {{is found in}} the folk music of Russia and rural America, and is a popular vaudeville instrument.|$|E

50|$|Before {{launching}} the L type {{it is necessary}} to remove the metal tab security {{at the base of the}} cylinder containing the explosive charge, then, firmly <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> remove the pin at the base of the handle. Make sure that the wire rewind safely. When the grenade is thrown, the wire releases the second safety pin.|$|E
5000|$|Pushup: Starting in <b>the</b> plank {{position}} <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handles</b> of two grounded kettlebells, the trainee {{performs a}} pushup. This requires more control than an ordinary pushup {{and results in}} a greater range of motion. This is often combined with the renegade row. Feet may be elevated to increase the difficulty, until the trainee is performing a handstand push-up on the kettlebells.|$|R

5000|$|Part of {{the traits}} {{that make a}} basic set of DJing skills {{is the ability to}} select music. This process to curate a related and {{meaningful}} collection of songs together starts by previewing songs. Where a DJ prefers to use vinyl records, while a record is playing, the process to preview the songs can be quickly achieved by <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of the cartridge on the tone arm, and picking up the needle and gently dropping it further along into the song. If you repeat this quickly, this is also known as [...] "needle dropping".|$|E
5000|$|Mega Shuttle (Mega Shatoru): The orbiter forms Galaxy Mega's head (the engine {{becomes the}} [...] "mullet", and the cockpit becomes the cranium). The Shuttle Booster forms the Booster Rifle (with {{the fuel tank}} <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> and muzzle). The orbiter docks in the nose. The Shuttle Booster can be docked to the {{underside}} of the Mega Ship. On the toy, the Shuttle Booster can also add weapons to the Mega Ship by separating into three pieces with the fuel tank becoming a cannon on the underbelly and the rocket boosters on the sides. This function is never seen in film.|$|E
50|$|Some large combo amps {{and large}} speaker {{cabinets}} have ball-bearing-mounted caster wheels {{to make it}} easier to move them. All combo amplifiers and speaker cabinets have some types of carry handles, either a folding handle on the top or recessed handles on the sides. There are two types of recessed handles: some equipment has folding, spring-loaded metal handles, with the spring <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> flush against the chassis until it is pulled out for use; the second type is handles that are non-moving, and which are flush with the surface of the amp/cab, but with a hollow area behind the handle for the hand to go. In both cases, the handle does not project out beyond the amp/cab, preventing the handle from catching on items during transportation and/or being damaged.|$|E

5000|$|If {{there is}} a hand washing basin provided, perform Temizu: take the dipper in your right hand and scoop up water. Pour some onto your left hand, then {{transfer}} the dipper to your left hand and pour some onto your right hand. Transfer the dipper to your right hand again, cup your left palm, and pour water into it, from which you will take the water into your mouth (never drink directly from the dipper), silently swish it around in your mouth (do not drink), then quietly spit it out into your cupped left hand (not into the reservoir). Then, <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> of the dipper in both hands, turn it vertically so that the remaining water washes over the handle. Then replace it where you found it.|$|E
50|$|Rotary mowers {{can throw}} out debris with extreme {{velocity}} and energy. Additionally, the blades of a self-powered push mower (gasoline or electric) can injure a careless or inattentive user; as such, many come {{equipped with a}} dead man's switch to immediately disable the blade rotation when the user is no longer <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> In the United States, over 12,000 people per year are hospitalized {{as a result of}} lawn mower accidents. The vast majority of these injuries can be prevented by wearing protective footwear when mowing. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be at least 12 years old before they are allowed to use a walk-behind lawn mower and at least 16 years of age before using a riding mower. They also should demonstrate proper judgment and maturity. Persons using a mower should wear heavy footwear, eye protection, and hearing protection in the case of engine-powered mowers.|$|E
5000|$|The Seemiller grip {{is named}} after the American table tennis {{champion}} Danny Seemiller, who used it. It is achieved by placing your {{thumb and index finger}} {{on either side of the}} bottom of the racquet head and <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> with the rest of your fingers. Since only one side of the racquet is used to hit the ball, two contrasting rubber types can be applied to the blade, offering the advantage of [...] "twiddling" [...] the racket to fool the opponent. Seemiller paired inverted rubber with anti-spin rubber; many players today combine inverted and long-pipped rubber. The grip is considered exceptional for blocking, especially on the backhand side, and for forehand loops of backspin balls.The Seemiller grip's popularity reached its apex in 1985 when four (Danny Seemiller, Ricky Seemiller, Eric Boggan and Brian Masters) of the United States' five participants in the World Championships used it.|$|E

6000|$|In {{this way}} the tandem riders were carried a good hundred yards or more beyond their quarry. Then Phipps {{realized}} his possibilities, slacked up with the brake, and let the thing go over sideways, dropping on to his right foot. With his left leg still over the saddle, and still <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>handles,</b> he {{looked over his shoulder}} and began addressing uncomplimentary remarks to Dangle. [...] "You only think of yourself," [...] said Phipps, with a florid face.|$|R
