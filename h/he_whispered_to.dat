500|$|His tragic efforts, however, were {{consistently}} ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber {{in the role}} of Richard III made love to Lady Anne, the Grub Street Journal wrote, [...] "he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart". Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's The Relapse, Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne's Sir Courtly Nice, and Sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege's Man of Mode were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing, described Cibber as [...] "the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb". These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber's affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738–39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he wanted to go home, perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Dryden and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber's adaptation of Richard III in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John.|$|E

He maintained a soft-spoken, unassuming demeanor despite his fame. [...] While strolling through the Centre Pompidou Museum in 1979, and happening upon an exhibit for Amnesty International, <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> a colleague [...] "Amnesty, you know, was one of my children." ...|$|E

Bochkay, [...] "If {{we are going to do}} things like this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side."

2500|$|A PBS {{interview}} of six experts {{noted that the}} memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship. Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China. When undergraduate students at Peking University, which {{was at the center of}} the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they were [...] "genuinely mystified." [...] One of the students said that the image was [...] "artwork." [...] It is noted in the documentary Frontline: The Tank Man that <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> the student next to him [...] "89," [...] which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a letter}} written 30 years later to Francis Darwin, when Huxley heard this <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> Brodie, [...] "The Lord hath {{delivered}} him into mine hands". This quotation first appears {{more than thirty years}} later, and is almost certainly a later insertion to the story. Huxley's own contemporary account, in a letter to Henry Dyster on September 9, 1860, makes no mention of this remark. Huxley rose to defend Darwin's theory, finishing his speech with the now-legendary assertion that he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth. Again, later retellings indicate that this had a tremendous effect on the audience, and Lady Brewster is said to have fainted.|$|E
2500|$|Burnham {{became very}} ill and {{was allowed to}} return to Switzerland for his health. The French {{government}} quickly transported Burnham to Cannes, France. From his death bed, Burnham shared his secrets with other intelligence officers and the French government transported his family from England to Cannes. The data Burnham had gathered was convincing: the Germans were not opening a new front in Alps and {{there was no need to}} move allied troops away from the Western Front. [...] His dying words <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> his surgeon: [...] "Always have I wanted to help pay the debt my country has owed to France. Go back to the front and save the living. [...] I am already dead." [...] He was buried in Cannes beside the tomb of A. Kingsley Macomber, another American, to honor the French Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse whose fleet had enabled George Washington to force the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia in 1781.|$|E
