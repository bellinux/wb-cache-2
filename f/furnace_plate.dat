50|$|Prior to the First World War the {{facilities}} in Turku consisted of two-floor engineering works, forging shop, foundry with four <b>furnaces,</b> thin <b>plate</b> shop and carpentry shop. On the riverside {{there were two}} slipways, of which the bigger one was for 400-tonne ships and other one for small vessels, and a 20-tonne mast crane. The larger slipway was covered by a wooden hall in 1915. The products were internal combustion engines, locomobiles, pumps, steam engines and steam ships. Additionally, the company repaired ships. The number of personnel ranged from 200 up to 500 people.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} six years, CEN TC 127 and more in {{particular}} its working groups ad hoc 14 and ad hoc 7 have been active in evaluating and improving the reproducibility of fire resistance testing. Ad hoc 14 developed a draft procedure {{for the evaluation of}} the performance of fire resistance furnaces in 1994. The two working groups were subsequently responsible for an extensive series of proving tests aimed at evaluating the procedure, but also at investigating the possible role of the Plate Thermometer in harmonising thermal exposure. The results of the work are that, when furnaces are controlled using small diameter sheathed thermocouples, the thermal exposure of a test specimen differs greatly over the various furnaces. Controlling the <b>furnaces</b> on <b>Plate</b> Thermometer readings brings thermal exposures much closer together. This paper gives an overview and a quantitative explanation of the findings...|$|R

Fragments of panty hoses, shoelaces, brush bristles, chain links, wire mesh, string bags, twigs and beechnuts were pasted into compositions in the collage technique. Chewing gum, pressed flat into moulds as bas-reliefs, slightly raise figures above the surface to produce sculptural effects. During that same period, Karl Hurm also experimented with different surfaces like old <b>furnace</b> doors, iron <b>plates,</b> metal sheets, or pieces of wood as base materials {{in order to create}} paintings that seem to have originated in distant prehistoric times.

50|$|In 1896 {{the company}} began {{stamping}} sheet metal, and in 1900 the plant expanded to include a Martin process hearth (7 tonnes capacity), and facilities to forge wheels; the plant had three activities: forging, machining, and stamping. The company continued to expand in the 1900s; with orders from the Compagnie du Midi for high capacity wagons, and a large order from the Compagnie du Nord the business acquired 3 more hectares of land in Douai to build a second plant in 1908 specialising in railway vehicles. Parts for artillery pieces, and other military equipment began to be produced around this time in Douai. In 1910 a third plant was opened which included an open hearth <b>furnace,</b> a steel <b>plate</b> mill and other equipment for the working of steel.|$|R

Additionally the aerosol printer was adapted to hot melt printing by heating all parts which are {{in contact with the}} ink, including the atomizer, virtual impactor, printing head and atomization gas. Front side contacts on silicon solar cells were printed with a metal aerosol jet printer using this hotmelt ink. Improved line resolution, higher aspect ratio and higher solid content compared to conventional aerosol inks could be achieved. To demonstrate the industrial feasibility, a multi-nozzle printing system was used. Line widths of 40 µm could be achieved. The aspect ratio of the fingers is increased from 1 : 40 to 1 : 6. Large-area multicrystalline silicon solar cells were, printed at room temperature at different printing speeds, fired in an in-line belt <b>furnace</b> and finally <b>plated</b> in an industrial plating machine.

5000|$|Ben-my-Chree {{was driven}} by three Parsons steam {{turbines}} which were built under licence by Vickers Sons and Maxim, the turbines developing 14,000 shaft horsepower, thereby resulting in a designed service speed of 24.5 knots. The turbines were so arranged so as to work in series, with one high-pressure ahead turbine driving the centre shaft, and two low-pressure ahead turbines driving their respective wing shaft. Astern turbines were incorporated in the casing, with each low-pressure turbine fitted with valves to control the admission of steam for ahead and astern working. These manoeuvring valves were independent of the high-pressure turbine which would run idle when the ship was manoeuvring. The valve gear was arranged for easy operation and was placed at the forward end of the high-pressure turbine. The main valves were of the vertical equilibrium type operated by large handwheels. Two condensers were fitted, {{one on each side}} of the turbine run, and were supplied with circulating water by two large centrifugal pumps. The air pumps were direct acting twin-type pumps, fitted in duplicate for each condenser and independently driven.

40|$|To build multi story {{buildings}} out {{of timber}} is {{of a common}} interest in the building sector. Timber as a building material has many profits, such as the low cost, the availability {{and the ability to}} recycle it, the low carbon footprint and the workability. Although, when it comes to fire protection of buildings with a timber based structure there are challenges regarding prevention of the spread of fire while timber surface is exposed to fire. There have been cases in which timber buildings have caught fire leading to severe fire spread and ruined buildings. One example concerns a student modulus accommodation in Luleå that caught fire in august 2013. The fire started on the fourth floor after which a vertical fire spread occurred in concealed spaces between the volume modules. According to the fire investigation lack of knowledge regarding performance of detailed building solutions has led to the poor fire performance of the building. This master thesis mainly consists of a model scale tests that is prepared and performed according to the standard EN 1363 - 1. The purpose of the test is to investigate the performance of various cavity barriers exposed to fire. The main objective is to examine which temperatures that can be expected at different positions at various cavity barriers when using model scale test as a test method. There are two main kinds of cavity barriers: barriers that are airtight and closed inside the voids of the construction; and ventilated barriers. The most common cavity barriers {{are the ones that are}} airtight and closed. The material can be solid wood, gypsum board or mineral wool. The installation areas for these cavity barriers are anywhere, besides where the concealed spaces shall be ventilated and in every joint that shall be sealed using sealant. The ventilated cavity barriers are mounted in concealed spaces where the ventilating function is provided. These concealed spaces are often situated in, for example, ventilated attics, facades and roofs. The purpose of the ventilated barriers is to maintain the air flow in the cavity during regular conditions but also to form a protecting barrier between fire compartments when exposed to fire. The model scale test includes test apparatuses such as thermocouples and a fire resistance <b>furnace</b> with <b>plate</b> thermometers and burners. In addition, a test rig consisting of test specimens and the products to be tested are essential.   In this report, two model scale tests have been performed and prepared according to EN  1363 ‑ 1. The test period endured for four hours and the thermocouples measured the temperatures during the whole time. During the first hour the test specimens were exposed to the standard ISO 834 fire curve by controlling the burners in the furnace. After one hour the burners were turned off and the specimens were no longer exposed to fire. The measurements of the temperatures continued during three more hours. After the first two of these three hours the furnace was opened to confer more oxygen in the purpose to record any changes in the temperatures. Results of the performed experiments have indicated parameters that affect the performance of the cavity barriers. The cavity surface itself has an influence to the fire spread. The number of barriers in the cavity and the material properties of the material that is used as the cavity barrier lead to the different protection by those cavity barriers. Some of the tested barriers were plastic covered, which had effect on the performance of the cavity barriers. The dimensions of the barriers, moreover the width and the thickness, are important parameters for the proper function of the barrier. The test results indicate that glowing combustion occurs in the cavity between various cavity barriers.   It can be seen that the temperature rises when the furnace is opened. This indicates the appearance of smouldering since the combustion increases when the amount of oxygen increases, which leads to a temperature rise. Furthermore, the appearance of smouldering (glowing combustion) can be indicated by the observation of the damages of the specimens after the test. The temperatures that may be expected at the unexposed side of the cavity barrier depend on the surface material of the cavity, dimensions, and the material of the cavity barriers. Smouldering is a consequence of the temperature rise in closed cavities between cavity barriers. The performed test endured for approximately four hours and this indicates that fires in cavities can stay for a long time. To ensure the performance of various cavity barriers and verification by a model scale test it is important to perform further experiment and analyses to investigate the effects of the various parameters. To ensure the effectiveness of the performance of the cavity barriers they should be tested in cavities with various widths and various heights. Further investigation of the risk for smouldering is needed with measuring the amount of oxygen and the pressure...|$|R
