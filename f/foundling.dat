5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another <b>foundling</b> were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{was born}} Thomas John Marcel on September 15, 1938, and was {{immediately}} placed for adoption at the New York <b>Foundling</b> Hospital. He was adopted by Adele and David Kahn, and renamed Thomas David Kahn. His father, {{a member of the}} Communist Party USA, became President of the Transport Workers Local101 of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina Bicknell (1757 – 8 September 1843), {{better known}} as Sabrina Sidney, was a British <b>foundling</b> girl taken in when she was 12 by author Thomas Day, who wanted to mould her into his perfect wife. Day had been {{struggling}} to find a wife who would share his ideology and had been rejected by several women. Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's book Emile, or On Education, he decided to educate two girls without any frivolities, using his own concepts.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina {{was born}} in 1757 in Clerkenwell, London, and was left at the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (more {{commonly}} known as the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's baptismal name was Manima Butler and that she had been baptised in St James's Church, Clerkenwell. Her name was likely a misspelling of Monimia but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish.|$|E
5|$|The {{apprenticeship}} {{was approved}} by the governors of the orphanage on 30 June 1769; Day and Bicknell collected Sabrina on 17 August. She was brought to lodgings in London, where she met Edgeworth for the first time. Day changed her name to Sabrina Sidney: Sabrina, the Latin name for the River Severn, which her orphanage overlooked; and Sidney after Algernon Sidney, one of Day's heroes. Day became a benefactor, and subsequently governor, of the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital, and on 20 September 1769 he chose another girl for his experiment, renaming her Lucretia after the Roman matron.|$|E
5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and <b>foundling</b> colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|Millar ordered William Strahan {{to print}} {{the work on}} two of his {{printing}} presses to produce a total of 5,000copies for the first run of the work (in comparison, only 3,500copies of The History of Tom Jones, a <b>Foundling</b> were printed {{for the first and}} second edition). This amount proved to be enough for Millar to sell, although he had to back down from a second printing of 3,000copies immediately after the first edition to ensure that the originals were completely sold. The work had two German translations published in 1752, a Dutch translation in 1756, and a French edition in 1762.|$|E
5|$|The History of Sir Charles Grandison, {{commonly}} called Sir Charles Grandison, is an epistolary novel by English writer Samuel Richardson {{first published in}} February 1753. The book {{was a response to}} Henry Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a <b>Foundling,</b> which parodied the morals presented in Richardson's previous novels. The novel follows the story of Harriet Byron who is pursued by Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. After she rejects Pollexfen, he kidnaps her, and she is only freed when Sir Charles Grandison comes to her rescue. After his appearance, the novel focuses on his history and life, and he becomes its central figure.|$|E
5|$|After her {{engagement}} to Day ended, Sabrina {{spent eight years}} at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met {{and went on to}} marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the <b>foundling</b> hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E

25|$|Exhibitions of {{pictures}} at the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital, which were organised by the Dilettante Society, {{led to the}} formation of the Royal Academy in 1768. The <b>Foundling</b> Hospital art collection can today be seen at the <b>Foundling</b> Museum.|$|E
25|$|In 1749 Handel {{composed}} Music for the Royal Fireworks; 12,000 {{people attended}} the first performance. In 1750 he arranged {{a performance of}} Messiah to benefit the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital. The performance was considered a great success and was followed by annual concerts that continued throughout his life. In recognition of his patronage, Handel was made a governor of the Hospital {{the day after his}} initial concert. He bequeathed a copy of Messiah to the institution upon his death. His involvement with the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital is today commemorated with a permanent exhibition in London's <b>Foundling</b> Museum, which also holds the Gerald Coke Handel Collection. In addition to the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital, Handel also gave to a charity that assisted impoverished musicians and their families.|$|E
25|$|Lady Arabella Denny was a {{supporter}} of the Dublin <b>Foundling</b> Hospital, which had been established to care for children abandoned due to poverty and/or illegitimacy. In 1760 she presented a clock to the Dublin Workhouse; it was put up in the nursery for <b>foundling</b> children and used to regulate the feeding of infants.|$|E

25|$|Richmond {{was one of}} the {{founding}} Governors of London's <b>Foundling</b> Hospital, which received its Royal Charter from George II in 1739. The <b>Foundling</b> Hospital was a charity dedicated to saving London's abandoned children. Both the Duke and the Duchess took great interest in the project. The Duke attended committee meetings and both took part in the baptism and naming of the first children accepted by the hospital in March 1741.|$|E
25|$|There {{were some}} unfortunate incidents, {{such as the}} case of Elizabeth Brownrigg (1720–1767), a {{severely}} abusive Fetter Lane midwife who mercilessly whipped and otherwise maltreated her adolescent female apprentice domestic servants, leading {{to the death of}} one, Mary Clifford, from her injuries, neglect and infected wounds. After the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital authorities investigated, Brownrigg was convicted of murder and sentenced to hang at Tyburn. Thereafter, the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital instituted more thorough investigation of its prospective apprentice masters and mistresses.|$|E

25|$|It {{also appears}} in three books by Jacqueline Wilson: Hetty Feather, Sapphire Battersea and Emerald Star. In the first story, Hetty Feather, Hetty has just {{arrived in the}} Hospital, after her time with her foster family. This book tells us about her {{new life in the}} <b>Foundling</b> Hospital. In Sapphire Battersea, Hetty has just left the Hospital and speaks ill of it. The <b>Foundling</b> Hospital is {{mentioned}} in Emerald Star, although it is mainly about Hetty growing up.|$|E
25|$|Its {{location}} was partly that now called Coram's Fields in the London Borough of Camden. Coram's Field is {{situated on the}} former site of the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital, established by Thomas Coram {{in what was then}} named Lamb's Conduit Field in 1739. It is {{not to be confused with}} White Conduit Fields, in Islington, which was another venue of 18th century cricket. It is believed that Lamb's Conduit Field ceased to be a cricket venue when construction of the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital was approved in or before 1739.|$|E

25|$|The main {{character}} in the Hervey Allen novel Anthony Adverse, and the 1936 film of the same name, is an abandoned child who is placed in a <b>foundling</b> wheel on the saint's feast day, and given the name Anthony in his honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{restriction}} {{does not}} prevent a mamzer from marrying another mamzer, nor from marrying a convert to Judaism, or a non-Jewish slave. However, foundlings suspected of being mamzerim were not so free; they were neither permitted to marry a mamzer, nor even to marry another <b>foundling.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Foundling</b> Hospital grew {{to become}} a very fashionable charity, and it was {{supported}} by many noted figures {{of the day in}} high society and the arts. Its benefactors included a number of renowned artists, thanks to one of its most influential governors, the portrait painter and cartoonist William Hogarth.|$|E
25|$|His ecclesiastical {{administration}} {{was characterized by}} works of social welfare, which he pursued with diligence and honor. He expanded and furnished the Hospital of San Lázaro and endowed the Hospicio de Pobres (poorhouse) and the Casa de Niños Expósitos (<b>foundling</b> home). In the University he founded the chair of ecclesiastical discipline.|$|E
25|$|Sulman's {{concept of}} arcaded loggias {{was derived from}} Brunelleschi's Ospedale degli Innocenti (<b>Foundling</b> Hospital) and the cloisters of the 15th century Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze. The Mediterranean {{influence}} was maintained by Kirkpatrick with Roman roof tiles and cast embellishments such as roundels. The buildings were originally constructed with open first floor verandahs which have since largely been glazed in.|$|E
25|$|Pollock's {{father was}} Dr. Arthur Julius Pollock (7 February 1835 – 11 May 1890). He was {{the eldest son}} in the second {{marriage}} of Sir Frederick Pollock, though he ranked thirteenth among the twenty-four children that Sir Frederick had. Dr. Pollock was a physician and lecturer in the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital. He was also a Council member of the Royal College of Physicians.|$|E
25|$|The {{next stage}} of adoption's {{evolution}} fell to the emerging nation of the United States. Rapid immigration and the American Civil War resulted in unprecedented overcrowding of orphanages and <b>foundling</b> homes in the mid-nineteenth century. Charles Loring Brace, a Protestant minister became appalled by the legions of homeless waifs roaming the streets of New York City. Brace considered the abandoned youth, particularly Catholics, {{to be the most}} dangerous element challenging the city's order.|$|E
25|$|There is a gap of {{over twenty}} years before the venue recurs in the cricket records. It was used in 1731 for a minor match which London played against an Enfield team and was then used twice in 1736 for London v Surrey and Middlesex v Surrey. By this time, the London club was using the Artillery Ground as its primary venue and the {{construction}} of the <b>Foundling</b> Hospital probably ended its interest in Lamb's Conduit Field.|$|E
25|$|In a {{competitive}} market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves {{with a wide range}} of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy, 1796), the medicinal (The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen, 1730), the festive or feast (A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies, 1746), the curious (A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies, 1751–82), and the curatorial (The <b>Foundling</b> Hospital for Wit, 1743–64).|$|E
25|$|The stone {{appears in}} several {{chapters}} of Edward Rutherfurd's novel, London (1997). In the second chapter {{we see it}} as the marker stone for all the roads in Roman Londinium, and also sitting beside the wall of the Governor's Palace as mentioned above as a hypothesis of its use or origin. It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the <b>foundling</b> who is found propped up against it. The stone {{is one of the many}} central focus points in the novel that the author uses to tie the different time periods together.|$|E
25|$|Apsley House {{stands at}} the site of an old lodge that belonged to the crown. During the Interregnum newer {{buildings}} were erected between what is now Old Regent Street and Hyde Park Corner. In the 1600s after the Restoration they were leased by James Hamilton (died 1673) and renewed by Elizabeth his widow in 1692 on a 99-year lease (Hamilton Place takes its name from that family). Immediately before Apsley House was built the site was occupied by a tavern called the Hercules Pillars (immortalised by Henry Fielding in The History of Tom Jones, a <b>Foundling</b> as the location where Squire Western resides when he first journeys up to London).|$|E
25|$|Hogarth, who was childless, {{had a long}} {{association}} with the Hospital and was a founding governor. He designed the children's uniforms and the coat of arms, {{and he and his}} wife Jane fostered <b>foundling</b> children. Hogarth also decided to set up a permanent art exhibition in the new buildings, encouraging other artists to produce work for the hospital. By creating a public attraction, Hogarth turned the Hospital into one of London's most fashionable charities as visitors flocked to view works of art and make donations. At this time, art galleries were unknown in Britain, and Hogarth's fundraising initiative is considered to have established Britain's first ever public art gallery.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Jacobite risings has {{inspired}} many stories and songs. Sir Walter Scott drew on the second rising for his first novel Waverley, which features a vivid description of the Battle of Prestonpans and {{a description of the}} Jacobite stronghold of Doune Castle. Scott returned to the first rising for his novel Rob Roy. In The Master of Ballantrae by Robert Louis Stevenson, a family decides that their two sons will take opposing sides in the forty-five rebellion to preserve the estates whoever wins. Stevenson's Kidnapped is based on real events {{in the aftermath of the}} 1745 rebellion, which also provides the political backdrop to the narrative of Henry Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a <b>Foundling.</b>|$|E
