5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> way without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find {{a different sort of}} gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

He and Livingstone {{also appeared in}} Ed Sullivan's Mr. Broadway (1933) as themselves. Benny often parodied contemporary movies and movie genres on the radio program, and the 1940 film Buck Benny Rides Again features all the main radio characters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> Western parody adapted from program skits. The failure of one Benny vehicle, The Horn Blows at Midnight, became a running gag on his radio and television programs, although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest.|$|E

500|$|Both of Benn's grandfathers were Liberal Party MPs; his {{paternal}} {{grandfather was}} John Benn, a successful politician, MP for Tower Hamlets and later Devonport, who was created a baronet in 1914 (and who founded a publishing company, Benn Brothers), and his maternal grandfather was Daniel Holmes, MP for Glasgow Govan. Benn's contact with leading politicians of the day, {{dates back to}} his earliest years. He met Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald when he was five years old, whom he described as: [...] "A kindly old gentleman [...] leaned over me and offered me a chocolate biscuit. I've looked at Labour leaders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> way ever since." [...] Benn also met former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was twelve, and later recalled that, while still a boy, he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi; in 1931, while his father was Secretary of State for India.|$|E
500|$|Attorney {{and author}} Roberta A.

Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said that Davis' imprisonment was part of the [...] "criminalization of Christianity", while columnist Jennifer Rubin compared Davis' refusal to obey the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] in 1963. A few weeks after her release from jail, Davis met with Pope Francis in Washington, D.C. The Holy See Press Office later noted that the pope met with many others as well, and said that the meeting was not a form of support for Davis's actions.

500|$|Gaga {{began to}} play the piano at the age of four, wrote her first piano ballad at 13, and began playing at open mic nights a year later. At her high school, she played the lead roles of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls and Philia <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>Funny</b> Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years. Gaga unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though she did appear in a small role as a mischievous classmate in the 2001 Sopranos episode [...] "The Telltale Moozadell". In 2003, at age 17, Gaga gained early {{admission}} to Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21)—a music school at New York University (NYU)'s Tisch School of the Arts—and lived in a NYU dorm.

500|$|In {{describing}} the D.Gray-mans cast, Sandra Scholes referred to Lenalee as the [...] "rational one" [...] and commented on her varied personality. In {{one of the}} anime's original episodes not featured in the manga, Scholes found her favorite was the one where Lenalee is apparently on a date yet her companion {{turns out to be}} an Akuma who considers her to be attractive which results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> episode. Kimberly Morales of Animation Insider commented on Lenalee's tragic backstory noting she was forced to join the Black Order organization, but her reunion with her brother Komui became [...] "paramount to her character". Morales also praised how Lenalee and Allen work together on a mission to help Miranda Lotto, who has a poor life, but thanks to the duo becomes a better person. Luci Christian's work as Lenalee's English voice actress was also complimented by Morales. Lenalee's new type of Innocence was well received by Chris Zimmerman of the Comic Book Bin who liked how how she accepted the powers she previously hated in order to assist Allen Walker in his fight against the 4th Level Akuma who was attacking the Black Order. This led to an appealing fight sequence which Zimmerman felt was a satisfactory end to the story arc. Manga News was more critical stating that the reason the Level 4 Akuma was defeated {{was the result of a}} power up in Lenalee.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E
