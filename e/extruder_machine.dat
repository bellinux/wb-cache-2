This paper presents a study on the comparison analysis of water absorption between two types of twin-screw extruders, namely, counterrotating and corotating with presence of variable antioxidants content. Composites of mixed fibres between rice husk and saw dust with recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) were prepared with two different <b>extruder</b> <b>machines,</b> namely, counterrotating and corotating twin screw, respectively.

Rheological {{studies of}} {{polymers}} are {{of great importance}} in optimizing the processing conditions and in designing processing equipments like injection molding <b>machines,</b> <b>extruders,</b> and dies required for various products. Melt rheological studies give us valuable viscosity data that will be helpful in optimizing the processing conditions. Parameters like melt viscosity {{as a function of}} shear rate or shear stress and temperature have become more and more important. Previous study indicated that the flow behaviour of the compound depends on the filler loading. Lesser elastic torque was found with compound containing lower filler content as compared to higher filler content. In this work, effect of dual filler, based on Carbon Black / Silica filled Epoxidised Natural Rubber (ENR) compound was investigated. A total of 80 phr of filler content based on passenger tyre tread formulation was used in the experiment. The compounds were prepared by melt mixing in tangential type of an internal mixer. The rheological and the processability properties of the compounds were determined using three different testing instruments namely Capillary Rheometer, Mooney viscometer and Rubber Process Analyzer (RPA). A variation of shear rates (ranging from low to high) was performed, in order to better reflect the actual processing condition in rubber manufacturing.

40|$|Parison length {{control in}} {{extrusion}} blow molding of plastic parts has been studied and attempted for the past quarter-century. Most methods used involve cycle-to-cycle control where the next part shows an improvement over the previous one using either weight measurement of the part or a simple photocell initiating the cutting of the parison. In the present thesis, plant models are developed using a control engineering technique called system identification. Since the process model thus determined is based on experimental data, sag and swell of the parison are implicitly taken into account. Furthermore, an in-cycle robust controller is designed and simulated where the die gap opening and the extrusion speed are adjusted as the parison is being extruded. The outlined control strategy focuses on controlling the parison length against process disturbances and machine drifts.

40|$|YesWhen {{compounding}} polymers with additives {{to develop}} materials at specifications (colouring plastics is the simplest example), the difficulties is {{in getting the}} formulation right the first time. Also, when developing completely new materials such as in nanotechnology applications, {{there is a need}} to do the initial trials safely and with as small quantities as possible to enable a wide range of experimentation. Wiith traditional applications, often the initial compounding formulation is done using small single or twin screw <b>extruders</b> but with <b>machines</b> that have a fair output to instruct the large scale operation. This step is costly in material wastage and time but more importantly it often does not provide the right formulation which in turn results in bigger wastage cost at the industrial scale before the right formulation is eventually obtained. With the very new material formulations, any reduction in cost of development is always essential. With these aims in mind, we have developed a new minimixer capable of handling tiny quantities of order 10 - 100 g but the minimixer is capable of reproducing the very high mixing conditions experienced in large machines. This invention provides a new opportunity to develop new products quickly, safely and cheaply. The application is not restricted to polymers and can be extended to other soft materials. It has also other spin-offs as a research tool for studying mixing and developing new, more efficient, mixing flows. In this paper we explain the principle of operation we have engineered to produce such intense mixing. Basically, the device is based on combining two opposing flows: a single screw extruder circulation flow with a twin screw extruder mixing flow. The mixing is carried out as a batch but on its completion, the single screw extruder flow is reversed and becomes co-current with the twin extruder flow to enable the discharging of the batch through a die. In the paper we present mixing data obtained with various polymer-additive combinations tested in the minimixer under various conditions of screw speeds, mixing times and temperatures and at the larger scale to underpin the operation of this novel mixer. The quality of mixing of the extrudate was measured using a variety of methods depending on applications: using image analysis of microtome sections of the extrudate or of blown film samples produced from the formulations or measuring electrical properties...|$|R
40|$|Although {{more and}} more twin screw {{extruders}} are {{being used in the}} polymer industry, the theoretical background is relatively undeveloped. The literature abounds in contradictions and often informs the reader that all extrusion problems can be solved if a certain new design is considered. The development of successful machines has mainly been possible through the application of commercially valuable empirical knowledge. In this research some understanding has been gained of the relevant phenomena that control the working of a counter-rotating intermeshing twin screw <b>extruder.</b> In these <b>machines</b> the two screws form more or less C shaped chambers with leakage gaps between them. The basis of the model presented in this thesis is that the extruder can be regarded as two series of chambers moved from hopper to die by the rotation of screws, while the leakage flows provide interactions between these chambers. The throughput of a twin screw extruder can be calculated with this model by subtracting the total amount of leakage from the total volume of the C shaped chambers that come free per unit time. This has been checked with model extruders fully filled with Newtonian liquids giving completely satisfactory results. For these conditions the throughput to pressure relationship, presented in terms of two new dimensionless groups, Q/ 2 NmV and AP/Nn, can be represented by a straight line independent of viscosity and rotational speed. In order to obtain insight into the importance of the geometrical variables for the throughput to pressure relationship a sensitivity analysis has been made using computer programs based on the calculations of the leakage gaps. When using the two dimensionless numbers the characteristics are retained when the extruder is scaled up geometrically. Many quantitative articles report that twin screw extruders provide a better homogenisation on micro scale {{and that there is a}} narrower spread in residence time distributions than in single screw extruders. The experiments described in this thesis show that the dimensionless exit age distribution of a twin screw extruder can be worse than that of single screw extruders. Video recordings of tracer injections in a perspex model extruder have shown that the mixing within the chambers is also generally overestimated. The last two chapters deal with the extrusion of real polymers. The model as proposed in the first part of the thesis is extrapolated to practical situations. An explanation of the relative insensitivity of the throughput to the die pressure in a twin screw extruder when working with polymer granules is given. Experiments in which a real twin screw polymer extruder was stopped and dismantled confirm the predictions of the model that the length over which the extruder is fully filled with melt changes with die pressure. Finally it is shown quantitatively that the melting process in an intermeshing counter rotating twin screw extruder is markedly different from that in a single screw extruder.

Both HDPE and PAPF were compounded using <b>extruder</b> <b>machine</b> and then prepared for tensile test (ASTM D 638), flexural test (ASTM D 790) and impact test (ASTM D 256) by using injection moulding machine. The PAPF/HDPE composites were characterized using Melt Flow Index (MFI), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). MFI values of PAPF/HDPE composites decreased as the content of PAPF increased. SEM analysis clarified that the structure of 30 wt % PAPF/HDPE has fewer voids introduced by fibre pull out. FTIR results showed that O-H peak become broader with the increment of the fibre loading. As the PAPF loading in HDPE increased in term of wt%, the Youngâ€™s Modulus increased with fibre loading at the beginning and experienced optimum raise at 30 wt % of fibre loading. Conversely, it is found that the tensile strength declined as the fibre concentration in composite increased. It was also observed that the flexural modulus and strength of PAPF reinforced HDPE composite increased linearly with increment of fibre loadings.

30|$|The {{manufacture}} of HDPE pipes of 32  mm outer diameter involves an extrusion process for extruding a hollow pipe using blow molding technique. The elements required for extrusion process are the extruding machine setup and PolyEthylene (PE) granules. The selected {{material for the}} pipe (PE granules) is first heated in the mixer machine. After attaining the required temperature, it is manually fed into the <b>extruder</b> <b>machine</b> through a feeder. Here, the material enters into the long barrel of the machine where the material is fed all through the process through the feeding zone, melts in the melting zone and is pushed into the die head in the pushing zone. Here, the barrel {{is divided into three}} zones to maintain equal material flow rate throughout the process. For this purpose, a rotating screw is fixed inside the barrel (which would be almost the size of the barrel). This screw pushes the material from the feeder to the die head. The die head is fixed, based on the diameter of the pipe required. At this die head, pressurized air is sent in between the material for attaining hollow shape. The pipe coming out of the die head is cooled using cooling water supply for the solidification purpose. Proper cooling temperature should be maintained for the solidification and smooth finish of the pipe at the die head. The pipe coming out of die head is first sent into the cooling tank and then it is pulled by the take-off machine. The speed of the take-off machine is set based on the required pipe thickness. This pipe will be further sent for pressure testing to test the withstanding pressure. HDPE plastic pipes are mainly used for transportation of water {{from one place to another}} place. Hence, these pipes undergo tremendous pressure by water. Higher withstanding pressure is supposed to result in a better condition of the pipe. Therefore, the withstanding pressure should be set the higher the better.|$|E
40|$|High {{temperature}} ultrasonic transducers (HTUTs) {{have been}} developed for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of metals and on-line monitoring of industrial polymer processes at elevated temperatures. Developed HTUTs are two types; one is sol gel sprayed HTUTs and the other is a crystal of high Curie temperature permanently bonded onto a steel substrate by brazing or diffusion bonding. In sol gel method, piezoelectric powders were dispersed into sol gel precursor. Sol gel precursor of Al 2 O 3, PZT or BIT, serves as adhesion material between powders, LT, PZT or BIT and a substrate to be coated. Spray technique was used so that thick films could be fabricated even onto curved or large surfaces. The composite material, BIT/PZT, derived from bismuth titanate (BIT) powders and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sol gel precursor had presented excellent characteristics, such as high signal-to-noise ratio, broadband frequency, and acceptable signal strength up to more than 450 °C. The film properties such as dielectric constant, piezoelectric constant, density and electromechanical coupling coefficient were characterized. Nondestructive testing of extent of sub-surface defect using BIT/PZT film HTUT was given at 440 °C. High temperature immersion type HT ultrasonic probes using BIT/PZT film were also fabricated. They were immersed in molten zinc at 450 °C, and able to measure the thickness of the steel sample. Surface and sub-surface imaging with fine resolution were obtained using this HT ultrasonic probe with a focused lens in silicone oil at 200 °C. On-line monitoring of industrial polymer processes had been performed. Sol gel HTUTs had been fabricated on a steel extruder adaptor of a polymer <b>extruder</b> <b>machine,</b> mold inserts of an injection machine and a micro-molding machine, and a barrel of the micro-molding machine. Ultrasonic signals were obtained at the elevated temperatures. The capability for monitoring the barrel wear and screw status during polymer extrusion at 190 °C and the filling completion conditions for injection molding at 120 °C and micromolding processes up to 200 °C have been shown. Brazing and diffusion bonding had been tried to establish permanent acoustic bonding between a lithium niobate crystal and a steel substrate. The HTUT fabricated by brazing technique had demonstrated broadband characteristics up to 460 °C. The HTUT made by diffusion bonding technique had also demonstrated broadband characteristics up to 350 °C. This latter HTUT had 20 dB higher signal strength than that of the sol gel BIT/PZT thick film HTUTs...|$|E
