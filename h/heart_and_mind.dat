5|$|Suzanne Jones sees a {{substantive}} difference between active listening as originated by Gordon and empathic listening {{as recommended by}} Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said {{to let them know}} you are listening, whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind</b> and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.|$|E
5|$|In his {{commentary}} on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote {{of the importance of}} choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind</b> could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his {{commentary on}} the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E

25|$|For Bernard, {{faith is}} based on the {{testimony}} of Scripture and on the teaching of the Fathers of the Church. Thus, Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and, in a more general way, with those who would subject the truths of faith to the critical examination of reason — an examination which, in his opinion, posed a grave danger: intellectualism, the relativizing of truth, and the questioning of the truths of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in contemplative prayer, by the affective union of the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind</b> with God, with only one purpose: to promote the living, intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.|$|E
25|$|Visitors to a Shinto shrine {{follow a}} {{purification}} ritual before presenting {{themselves to the}} kami. This ritual begins with hand washing, and swallowing and later spitting {{a small amount of}} water in front of the shrine to purify the body, <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind.</b> Once this is complete they turn their focus to gaining the kami’s attention. The traditional method of doing this is to bow twice, clap twice and bow again, alerting the kami to their presence and desire to commune with them. During the last bow, the supplicant offers words of gratitude and praise to the kami; if they are offering a prayer for aid they will also state their name and address. After the prayer and/or worship they repeat the two bows, two claps and a final bow in conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Similarly well-versed in {{the mystic}} {{tradition}} was the German Johann Arndt, who, {{along with the}} English Puritans, influenced such continental Pietists as Philipp Jakob Spener, Gottfried Arnold, Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf of the Moravians, and the hymnodist Gerhard Tersteegen. Arndt, whose book True Christianity was popular among Protestants, Catholics and Anglicans alike, combined influences from Bernard of Clairvaux, John Tauler and the Devotio moderna into a spirituality that focused its {{attention away from the}} theological squabbles of contemporary Lutheranism and onto the development of the new life in the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind</b> of the believer. Arndt influenced Spener, who formed a group known as the collegia pietatis ("college of piety") that stressed the role of spiritual direction among lay-people—a practice with a long tradition going back to Aelred of Rievaulx and known in Spener's own time from the work of Francis de Sales. Pietism as known through Spener's formation of it tended not just to reject the theological debates of the time, but to reject both intellectualism and organized religious practice in favor of a personalized, sentimentalized spirituality.|$|E

25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind</b> as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E

500|$|Part of the {{transformative}} {{power of the}} Wood Badge experience is the effective use of metaphor and tradition to reach both <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind.</b> In most Scout associations, [...] "working your ticket" [...] {{is the culmination of}} Wood Badge training.

The ticket consists of specific goals that must be accomplished within a specified time, often 18 months due to the large amount of work involved. Effective tickets require much planning and are approved by the Wood Badge course staff before the course phase ends. Upon completion of the ticket, a participant is said to have earned his way back to Gilwell.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said that}} the album was [...] "refreshing", and that Collins was [...] "adept" [...] at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden {{described}} [...] "Only You Know and I Know" [...] as an [...] "angry love song" [...] that had some sampling of [...] "Motown" [...] style music mixed in. [...] "In 'One More Night', Mr. Collins's recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects a whisper of lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, tenderer reprise of 'Against All Odds'", says Holden. Holden concluded by saying [...] "On the surface, No Jacket Required, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. But beneath its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins's drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind,</b> obsession and repression." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1868 Cosima {{asked her}} husband for a divorce, to which he would not {{initially}} agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately {{after the birth of}} her and Wagner's third and final child, Siegfried, Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what she called a [...] "final attempt at an understanding". His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: [...] "You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind</b> to a higher being: far from censuring you for this step, I approve of it". Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.|$|E

500|$|Bannon {{followed}} Odd Girl Out with I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?) in 1959. I Am a Woman (the {{working and}} common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as {{she finds herself}} in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character {{that proved to be}} her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly [...] tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind...</b> She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." [...] The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.|$|E

[...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist {{is the stuff of}} Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey." [...] Bob Mondello criticized the film's character for the NPR in these words: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club is just about a selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity, because while looking out for No. 1, he paved the way for change for everyone else." [...] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine praised McConaughey's performance, highlighting that the movie [...] "traffics in deep hindbrain emotions: fear and rage and lust and, above all, the pure animal drive to go on living." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2016, Affleck {{confirmed}} that the film was on track to begin shooting in spring 2017. Later that month, Warner Bros. executive Greg Silverman stated that the film would be released in 2018. Around the same time, Affleck stated that the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it. Affleck planned to shoot the film in Los Angeles as doubling for Gotham City. [...] He reaffirmed his commitment to direct the film in his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In late January 2017, Affleck decided to step down as director, but would remain involved as producer and actor. By this point, writer Chris Terrio, who won an Academy Award for writing Affleck's Argo and also helped script , had turned in a rewrite of the script. On February 10, 2017, {{it was announced that}} Matt Reeves was in talks to replace Affleck {{as the director of the}} film, however on February 17 it was reported that talks had broken down. Two weeks later, Reeves had officially signed on to direct and co-produce the film. Production was delayed until 2018 as Reeves was tied up in post-production on War for the Planet of the Apes until June 2017, and The Batman is being re-written to allow Reeves more creative freedom as a director. Reeves in an interview stated that the film will feature [...] "an almost-noir driven, detective version of Batman" [...] that will emphasize the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>mind</b> of the character and will take inspiration from Alfred Hitchcock.|$|E
