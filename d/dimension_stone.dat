5|$|Mines in Labrador, {{the iron}} ore mine at Wabush/Labrador City, {{and the new}} nickel mine in Voisey's Bay {{produced}} a total of $2.5 billion worth of ore in 2006. A new mine at Duck Pond (30 kilometres (18mi) south of the now-closed mine at Buchans), started producing copper, zinc, silver and gold in 2007 and prospecting for new ore bodies continues. Mining accounted for 3.5% of the provincial GDP in 2006. The province produces 55% of Canada’s total iron ore. Quarries producing <b>dimension</b> <b>stone</b> such as slate and granite, account for less than $10million worth of material per year.|$|E

25|$|Quarries {{that produce}} <b>dimension</b> <b>stone</b> or crushed stone (used as {{construction}} aggregate) are interconvertible. Since most quarries can produce either one, a crushed stone quarry {{can be converted}} to <b>dimension</b> <b>stone</b> production. However, first the stone shattered by heavy and indiscriminate blasting must be removed. <b>Dimension</b> <b>stone</b> is separated by more precise and delicate techniques, such as diamond wire saws, diamond belt saws, burners (jet-piercers), or light and selective blasting with Primacord, a weak explosive.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} was made to use <b>dimension</b> <b>stone</b> for the exterior of the building. Due to the monumental demand for stone, stone from Sóskút, widely used in Budapest, was also used.

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the Maastoren is wrapped in panels, that give the building its colors. The windows are located in between those panels. The color of the Maastoren changes gradually as the building rises: the building is colored dark grey {{at the bottom and}} silver white at the top. To create these color changes, the panels at the bottom are made of <b>dimension</b> <b>stones</b> and the panels higher in the building are made of 22 shades of aluminium. The aluminium panels cover {{a little bit more than}} the upper half of the Maastoren, and the become lighter as the building rises. The different colors of the facade were chosen to make the building resemble the horizon. The dark grey <b>dimension</b> <b>stones</b> at the bottom are meant to resemble the basalt wharf. However, the facade near the elevators is in contrary to the rest of the facade entirely made out of glass. The parking garage has grids instead of windows, to reduce nuisance caused by the wind.|$|R

25|$|King Louis XI rarely visited Paris, but he {{rebuilt the}} old wooden Pont Notre Dame, which had {{collapsed}} on 25 October 1499. The new bridge, opened in 1512, {{was made of}} <b>dimension</b> <b>stone,</b> paved with stone, and lined with sixty-eight houses and shops. On 15 July 1533, King Francis I laid the foundation stone for the first Hôtel de Ville, the city hall of Paris. It was designed by his favourite Italian architect, Domenico da Cortona, who also designed the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley for the king. The Hôtel de Ville was not finished until 1628. Cortona also designed the first Renaissance church in Paris, the church of Saint-Eustache (1532) by covering a Gothic structure with flamboyant Renaissance detail and decoration. The first Renaissance house in Paris was the Hôtel Carnavalet, begun in 1545. It was modelled after the Grand Ferrare, a mansion in Fontainbleau designed by Italian architect Sebastiano Serlio. It is now the Carnavalet Museum.|$|E

It contains an estimated 50,400 tons of limestone with a volume of some some of the individual blocks weigh up to 6 tons.

The coarse-grained soft reddish [...] shelly limestone, [...] known locally as [...] "Pierre de Vers", [...] lends itself very well to <b>dimension</b> <b>stone</b> production. The blocks were precisely cut to fit perfectly together by friction alone, eliminating the need for mortar.

The material most likely to be recycled is concrete, and this represents the largest volume of recycled construction material.

[...] Stone recycling is usually done by specialists that monitor local demolition activity, looking for stone-containing houses, buildings, bridge abutments, and other <b>dimension</b> <b>stone</b> structures scheduled for demolition. Particularly treasured are old hand-carved stone pieces with the chisel marks still on them, local stones no longer quarried or that are quarried in a different shade of color or appearance. There is no national or regional trade in reclaimed stone, so a large storage yard is required, since the recovered stone may not be quickly sold and reused.

40|$|The use of <b>dimension</b> <b>stones</b> in {{architecture}} and civil engineering implies {{the knowledge of}} several mechanical, physical and chemical properties. Even though it has been usual practice to measure physical and mechanical properties of <b>dimension</b> <b>stones</b> the same is not true for thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, specific heat capacity, and heat production. These properties are particularly important when processes related with heating and cooling of buildings must be considered. Thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat capacity are related with the way thermal energy is transmitted and accumulated in stones; heat production {{has to do with}} the amount of radioactive elements on the rocks and so with the environmental impact of radioactivity and public health problems. It is important to start to measure on a routine basis those four thermal properties in rocks and, in particular, in dimension rocks so that their application can be improved and optimized. With this is mind three sets of different rock types (granites, limestones, and marbles) were collected to measure the thermal conductivity, the thermal diffusivity, and the specific heat capacity with the objective of characterizing them in terms of those properties. Since the same set of rocks has also been studied for other physical properties, a correlation amongst all the measured properties is being attempted. For each rock type several samples were used to measure the thermal conductivity, the thermal diffusivity, and the specific heat capacity, and average values were obtained and will be presented. As an example, for granites the thermal conductivity varies between 2. 87 and 3. 75 W/mK; for limestones varies between 2. 82 and 3. 17 W/mK; and for marbles varies between 2. 86 and 3. 02 W/mK.
