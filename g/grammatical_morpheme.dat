This can also be categorized as SVO (subject verb object) and SVX (subject verb other). Lynch in his review of Oceanic languages found that this constituent order {{is in fact the}} most widely geographically distributed pattern. Verbs in Toqabaqita can include a variety of affixes, both suffixes and pre-fixes, which mark other grammatical categories of tense aspect, sequentiality and negation. Lexical objects are usually indexed on the verb as a suffix. In Toqabaqita the basic noun phrase consists minimally of a noun or an independent personal pronoun. Noun phrases may contain modifiers, which are generally suffixes.Lexical morphemes consist of at least two syllables in Toqabaqita. Where a monosyllabic word occurs, such as a <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme,</b> it then attaches as a clitic to the preceding word, with some notable exceptions. If speech is slow then the <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> may have its vowel lengthened and take stress.|$|E

As a <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme,</b> suffix-a {{is similar to}} Mandarin diminutive suffix-zi as in yi-zi “chair”. While Mandarin suffix-zi always has a neutral tone or belongs to an unstressed syllable, Taiwanese-a is widely accepted as having a full tone. However, due to the same functional use of the <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> as Mandarin one, we expect to find similar patterns in Taiwanese. Therefore, we compared F 0 contours, mean F 0, and duration of Taiwanese suffix-a with a lexical morpheme of the same tone tsa “early ” in both juncture position {{and in the middle}} position of tri-syllabic words. Different speaking rates were also manipulated, since we expect to see some reductions of the weak element in faster speech rate. Our results show that Taiwanese diminutive suffix-a behaves exactly like other full-tone content words and also undergoes tone sandhi as other lexical morphemes do. Even in the middle of tri-syllabic words, there is no reduction in mean F 0 and duration. Index Terms: Taiwanese, diminutive suffix, F 0, duration 1...|$|E

40|$|Many English-speaking {{children}} with specific language impairment have unusual difficulty with grammatical morphemes such as past tense and third-person singular verb inflections and function {{words such as}} articles. Unfortunately, {{the source of this}} difficulty is not yet clear, in part because some of the possible contributing factors are confounded in English. In the present study, alternative accounts of <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> difficulties were evaluated using {{children with}} specific language impairment who were acquiring Hebrew. We examined the <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> production and comprehension of 15 Hebrew-speaking children with specific language impairment, 15 normally developing compatriots matched for age and 15 normally developing children matched for mean length of utterance in words. The results provided tentative support for the notion that grammatical morphemes are less difficult for children with specific language impairment if they take the form of stressed and/or lengthened syllables and if they appear in a language in which nouns, verbs, and adjectives must be inflected. The possibility that features such as person, number, and gender are missing from the underlying grammars of these children seems less likely.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} with typically developing children has begun to show that the acquisition of grammatical morphemes interacts not only with a developing knowledge of syntax, but also with developing abilities at the interface with prosodic phonology. In particular, a Prosodic Licensing approach to these issues provides a framework for understanding why children's early use of grammatical morphemes is so variable. This in turn provides a means for making predictions, given the prosodic structure of a particular language and the location of a particular <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme,</b> if {{it is likely to be}} produced or not. Given that many of the patterns of development found in typically developing children are found in older children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) as well, the Prosodic Licensing Hypothesis should provide a better understanding of some of the variable use of grammatical morphemes found in children with SLI. 14 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Whether you’re {{working with}} {{students}} who have learn-ing disabilities or those who are learning English as a Second Language, a fundamental instructional step when introduc-ing verb morphology is to train the regular past and past perfect tenses. Most verbs in English are “regular ” verbs. These verbs follow “regular ” rules of inflection that allow a child to accurately predict each of the morphological forms of the verb from knowledge of its base form. The rules are simple; regular verbs have four morphological forms. The third person singular, progressive, and past tense forms are derived from the base form simply by adding the appropriate <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> to the verb stem (-s,-ing, or-ed).

40|$|A {{time-based}} {{approach to}} agrammatic speech is presented. The paper {{consists of three}} parts. In the first part, the literature which deals with agrammatic compre-hension as a problem of disrupted timing, that is, as a slow-down of syntactic computation and/or a rapid decay {{of the results of}} syntactic processing, is re-viewed. In a second part, the hypothesis that similar timing problems cause diffi-culties in production as well is discussed. Two possible ways in which this can happen are described. First, slow down or rapid decay can lead to desynchroniza-tion within the process of syntactic tree formation. Second, a slow down of syntactic processing can cause asynchrony between the production of a syntactic slot and the retrieval of the proper <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> from the mental lexi-con. This hypothesis predicts that morphemes which are dependent on a relatively complex part of the syntactic tree will elicit relatively many errors. Results from the literature which seem to confirm this prediction are discussed. In the third part of the paper, the possible ways in which a patient can adapt to the reduced temporal window that would result from a timing deficit are discussed. Messag...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{the degree of}} complexity of a grammatical component in a language would impact on its representation in the brain through identifying the neural correlates of <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> processing associated with nouns and verbs in Chinese. In particular, the processing of Chinese nominal classifiers and verbal aspect markers were investigated in a sentence completion task and a grammaticality judgment task to look for converging evidence. The Chinese language constitutes a special case because it has no inflectional morphology per se and a larger classifier than aspect marker inventory, contrary to the pattern of greater verbal than nominal paradigmatic complexity in most European languages. The functional imaging results showed BA 47 and left supplementary motor area and superior medial frontal gyrus more strongly activated for classifier processing, and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus more responsive to aspect marker processing. We attributed the activation in the left prefrontal cortex to greater processing complexity during classifier selection, analogous to the accounts put forth for European languages, and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus to more demanding verb semantic processing. The overall findings significantly contribute to cross-linguistic observations of neural substrates underlying processing of grammatical morphemes from an analytic and a classifier language, and thereby deepen our understanding of neurobiology of human language. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{hypothesis}} that the linguistic deficit presented by children with specific language impairment (SLI) is caused by limited cognitive resources (e. g., S. Ellis Weismer & L. Hesketh, 1996) was tested against the hypothesis of a limitation in linguistic knowledge (e. g., M. L. Rice, K. Wexler, & P. Cleave, 1995). METHOD: The study examined {{the influence of the}} argument-structure complexity of a target sentence on the production of grammatical morphemes in French children with SLI compared with younger children matched for grammatical level in production (GL) and children of the same chronological age (CA). A sentence production task was used where the target sentences varied in terms of argument complexity and length. RESULTS: The results indicated that children with SLI used articles and auxiliaries in obligatory contexts significantly less often than both the GL and CA control groups: More complex argument structures elicited the highest number of <b>grammatical</b> <b>morpheme</b> omissions; this effect was larger in children with SLI than in the GL group and was independent of the length of the sentences, which failed to show any influence on the production of grammatical morphemes. CONCLUSION: These results support the {{hypothesis that}} grammatical-morpheme deficit in SLI depends at least in part on limited processing capacities...|$|E
