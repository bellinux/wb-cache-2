40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of benzene measurements {{obtained by the}} analysis of thermally desorbable Radiello diffusive samplers was evaluated according to the recent standard EN 14662 - 4 (2005). Considering the results of laboratory experiments, all the sources of uncertainty regarding the <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler</b> method characteristics were accessed for the sampling times of 7 and 14 days. The {{major part of the}} uncertainty budget (> 79 %) was explained by the variation of the sampling rate due to the environmental factors (temperature and concentration level). For weekly sampling, the <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler</b> method satisfies the data quality objectives of the European Directive to supply the indicative measurements as well as the reference measurement, since the expanded uncertainty is found lower than 25 %. Using a model-predicted sampling rate which depends on the concentration and temperature, the expanded uncertainty is significantly decreased.

The test sites have extensive monitoring well networks and {{more than five years}} of historical water quality data. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including purgeable aromatics (petroleum hydrocarbons) and halogens (chlorinated solvents) have impacted the ground water of the subject properties.

The <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampling</b> devices consist of a polyethylene membrane capsule suspended in a flexible protective covering.

40|$|International audienceDiffusive {{samplers}} {{are today}} widely used for air quality control in {{indoor and outdoor}} environments and for personal exposure studies as well. The uptake rate is a fundamental parameter of a sampler for the calculation of the concentration of the substance to be monitored depends directly on it. Uptake rates can be affected by numerous factors. Their values {{and the range of}} validity have to be determined in an appropriate exposure chamber. The laboratory test chamber presented here consists of a loop made of glass, stainless steel and PTFE containing the generated atmosphere in which diffusive samplers can be tested. It is possible to accommodate several samplers simultaneously and simulate various environmental conditions such as temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, atmospheric composition, total pressure and exposure duration. All working parameters have to be monitored including the concentrations of the components of the generated atmosphere. It is shown that the expected concentration of a volatile compound like benzene can be reached very quickly whereas those of less volatile compounds like toluene or xylenes takes longer. The procedure for overcoming this difficulty is described in this paper. By means of an application it is also shown that exposure duration can unequally affect <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler</b> uptake rates depending on sampler geometry {{and the nature of the}} adsorbent. It appears that a radial high-uptake rate <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler</b> packed with a thermally desorbable material may be unsuitable for long-term monitoring of a volatile compound like benzene. However an axial low-uptake rate <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler,</b> also packed with a thermally desorbable material, seems more appropriate for this application due to the higher stability of its uptake rate...|$|E
40|$|In indoor environments NO 2 {{hydrolysis}} {{can take}} place on surfaces covered by {{a thin layer of}} humidity leading to the formation of nitrous and nitric acid.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{investigated}} the <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler</b> method for measuring NO 2 and SO 2 in ambient air. The two pollutants are either independently or simultaneously analysed using the <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler.</b> Different types of diffusive samplers can be used e. g badge type, radial type or open-ended longitudinal diffusion tubes. The Palmes tube, coated with triethanolamine (TEA), allows the simultaneous determination of NO 2 and SO 2. However, field measurements showed that the open-ended diffusion tube is affected by a strong artefact on the SO 2 determination arising from sulphate particulate matter. To avoid this interference, a teflon membrane has been introduced at the open end of the Palmes tube able to prevent contamination coming from the particulate matter. However {{the introduction of the}} membrane creates an additive resistance to the diffusion of molecules to the absorbent and therefore modifies the uptake rate of the Palmes tube.

40|$|Abstract—The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} into the differences in formaldehyde atmospheres generated from different source materials are presented. It was initiated after discrepancies were found between the results obtained from pumped and <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampling</b> methods when using formalin as the source material for formaldehyde atmosphere generation. The compositions of formaldehyde vapours produced from various source materials have been determined using infra-red (IR) spectroscopy and chemical analysis. These showed that those atmospheres generated from paraformaldehyde yield almost entirely formaldehyde monomer, whereas those generated from formalin yield a mixture of formaldehyde monomer and methoxymethanol. This has the effect of varying the effective molecular weight of the formaldehyde species in the atmosphere, thereby changing the effective <b>sampling</b> rate of <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampling</b> devices. Results in this study suggest that {{there is a possibility that}} diffusive samplers will give erroneous results if they are used in field environments where the formaldehyde atmosphere differs in composition from that used in the laboratory calibration. This emphasizes the need to be certain of the nature and composition of any pollutant vapour in order that the sampling device can be appropriately calibrated.

40|$|We {{consider}} the conductance of an Andreev interferometer, i. e., a hybrid structure where a dissipative current flows through a mesoscopic normal (N) sample {{in contact with}} two superconducting (S) "mirrors". Giant conductance oscillations are predicted if the superconducting phase difference ϕ is varied. Conductance maxima appear when ϕ is on odd multiple of π due to a bunching at the Fermi energy of quasiparticle energy levels formed by Andreev reflections at the N-S boundaries. For a ballistic normal sample the oscillation amplitude is giant and proportional {{to the number of}} open transverse modes. We estimate using both analytical and numerical methods how scattering and mode mixing [...] - which tend to lift the level degeneracy at the Fermi energy [...] - effect the giant oscillations.

40|$|Abstract—The {{diffusive}} samplers {{that have}} been developed in recent years have depended on two essentially different techniques of evaluation: adsorptivc collection and subsequent laboratory evaluation, and the use of reagent layers giving a direct reading. Since no pumps are required for sampling, they offer a cost<ffective means of measurement, in particular for routine personal monitoring. According to Fick's first law of gaseous diffusion, the molecules of airborne contaminants migrate into diffusive samplers where they are either trapped on collection media such as activated charcoal, or where they undergo a chemical reaction with a reagent layer yielding a colorimetnc stain. When a <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler</b> is exposed in a contaminated environment there is a concentration gradient between the ambient air and the air inside the sampler. This gradient can be regarded as the force that drives the molecules to migrate into the <b>diffusive</b> <b>sampler.</b> As adsorption or direct chemical reactions take place in the sampler {{it can be said that}} there will be virtually no free vapour molecules in the air inside. The full concentration gradient therefore is maintained during exposure. The charcoal-filled diffusive samplers, such as the Draeger ORSA 5, are first desorbed by solvents, e. g. carbon disulphide, for subsequent analysis by gas chromatography. As a final step the average concentration over the exposure time is calculated. Direct-reading diffusive samplers, like Draeger diffusion tubes, are marked with a scale calibrated in terms of the dose (ppm h) of a contaminant. For evaluation, the measured dose is divided by the exposure time in order to calculate the average concentration of a challenge chemical over a work-shift. Comparison measurements with active systems or other suitable devices have shown good correlation for diffusive samplers, especially in the range of OEL-concentrations...|$|E
