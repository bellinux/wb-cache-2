40|$|Abstract The Inhibitor of Growth (<b>ING)</b> {{proteins}} {{represent a}} type II tumor suppressor family comprising five conserved genes, <b>ING</b> 1 to <b>ING</b> 5. While <b>ING</b> 1, <b>ING</b> 2 and <b>ING</b> 3 proteins are stable {{components of the}} mSIN 3 a-HDAC complexes, the association of <b>ING</b> 1, <b>ING</b> 4 and <b>ING</b> 5 with HAT protein complexes was also reported. Among these the <b>ING</b> 1 and <b>ING</b> 2 have been analyzed more deeply. Similar to other tumor suppressor factors the <b>ING</b> proteins are also involved in many cellular pathways linked to cancer and cell proliferation such as cell cycle regulation, cellular senescence, DNA repair, apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis and modulation of chromatin. A common structural feature of <b>ING</b> factors is the conserved plant homeodomain (PHD), which can bind directly to the histone mark trimethylated lysine of histone H 3 (H 3 K 4 me 3). PHD mutants lose the ability to undergo cellular senescence linking chromatin mark recognition with cellular senescence. <b>ING</b> 1 and <b>ING</b> 2 are localized in the cell nucleus and associated with chromatin modifying enzymes, linking tumor suppression directly to chromatin regulation. In line with this, the expression of <b>ING</b> 1 in tumors is aberrant or identified point mutations are mostly localized in the PHD finger and affect histone binding. Interestingly, <b>ING</b> 1 protein levels increase in replicative senescent cells, latter representing an efficient pathway to inhibit cancer proliferation. In association with this, suppression of p 33 <b>ING</b> 1 expression prolongs replicative life span and is also sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence. Recent analyses of <b>ING</b> 1 - and <b>ING</b> 2 -deficient mice confirm a tumor suppressive role of <b>ING</b> 1 and <b>ING</b> 2 and also indicate an essential role of <b>ING</b> 2 in meiosis. Here we summarize the activity of <b>ING</b> 1 and <b>ING</b> 2 as tumor suppressors, chromatin factors and in development. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe INhibitor of Growth (<b>ING)</b> {{proteins}} are encoded as multiple isoforms in five <b>ING</b> genes (<b>ING</b> 1 - 5) {{and act as}} type II tumor suppressors. They are growth inhibitory when overexpressed and {{are frequently}} mislocalized or down-regulated in several forms of cancer. <b>ING</b> 1 and <b>ING</b> 2 are stoichiometric members of histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes while <b>ING</b> 3 - 5 are stoichiometric components of different histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) complexes. The <b>INGs</b> target these complexes to histone marks, thus acting as epigenetic regulators. <b>ING</b> proteins affect angiogenesis, apoptosis, DNA repair, metastasis and senescence, but how the proteins themselves are regulated is not yet clear. Here we find a small ubiquitin like modification (SUMOylation) of the <b>ING</b> 1 b protein and identify lysine 193 (K 193) as the preferred <b>ING</b> 1 b SUMO acceptor site. We also show that PIAS 4 is the E 3 SUMO ligase responsible for <b>ING</b> 1 b SUMOylation on K 193. Sequence alignment reveals that the SUMO consensus site on <b>ING</b> 1 b contains a phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation motif (PDSM) and our data indicate that the SUMOylation on K 193 is enhanced by the S 199 D phosphomimic mutant. Using an <b>ING</b> 1 b protein mutated at the major SUMOylation site (<b>ING</b> 1 b E 195 A), we further demonstrate that <b>ING</b> 1 b SUMOylation regulates the binding of <b>ING</b> 1 b to the ISG 15 and DGCR 8 promoters, consequently regulating ISG 15 and DGCR 8 transcription.

Here, we demonstrate a role for the protein <b>ING</b> 2 in mediating responses by the transforming growth factor (TGF) -β-Smad signaling pathway. We show that <b>ING</b> 2 promotes TGF-β-induced transcription. Both gain-of-function and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous <b>ING</b> 2 reveal that <b>ING</b> 2 couples TGF-β signals to the induction of transcription and cell cycle arrest.

Knockdown of endogenous SnoN blocks the ability of <b>ING</b> 2 to promote TGF-β-dependent transcription, and conversely expression of SnoN augments <b>ING</b> 2 enhancement of the TGF-β response.

40|$|The INhibitor of Growth tumor {{suppressors}} (<b>ING</b> 1 -ING 5) affect aging, apoptosis, DNA {{repair and}} tumorigenesis.

Here we identify a novel ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) that overlaps with the PBR of <b>ING</b> 1 and shows similarity to previously described UBDs involved in DNA damage responses. The <b>ING</b> 1 UBD binds ubiquitin with high affinity (K(d) ∼ 100 nM) and ubiquitin competes with PtIn-MPs for <b>ING</b> 1 binding. <b>ING</b> 1 expression stabilized wild-type, but not mutant p 53 in an MDM 2 -independent manner and knockdown of endogenous <b>ING</b> 1 depressed p 53 levels in a transcription-independent manner. <b>ING</b> 1 stabilized unmodified and six multimonoubiquitinated forms of wild-type p 53 that were also seen upon DNA damage, but not p 53 mutants lacking the six known sites of ubiquitination.
