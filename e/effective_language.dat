25|$|Frequently, {{acquisition}} {{planning is}} {{integrated into a}} larger language planning {{process in which the}} statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities. This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a bilingual language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language’s script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language’s status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote language revitalization, which can change a language’s status or reverse a language shift, or to promote linguistic purism. In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain <b>effective</b> <b>language</b> acquisition.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} event {{that took place}} during this period (c. 1150 CE) is the social and religious movement of Basaveshwara {{who was in the}} court of Bijjala. The literature that flourished under Basaveshwara, Allamaprabhu, Channabasavanna and Akkamahadevi during this period gave rise to [...] "Vachanna" [...] in Nadugannada (middle Kannada) which was simple to understand, elegant and effective in reaching the people. The Vachanna form of literature was instrumental in removing the Sanskrit influence to a large extent and thus popularised Kannada as an <b>effective</b> <b>language</b> for literature. The Kashmiri poet Bilhana came to his court and lived there. The Kalachurya took over their empire and ruled for about 20 years but were ineffective to see the integrity of the empire. Thus the empire got broke up which was shared by Sevunas in the north and Hoysalas in the south.|$|E

The <b>effective</b> English <b>language</b> {{teacher has}} {{different}} characteristics with those ordinary one.

Therefore this research aims to investigate the characteristics of <b>effective</b> English <b>language</b> teachers that they possess based on their competence in Makassar and the backgrounds of <b>effective</b> English <b>language</b> teachers that contribute to develop their abilities in teaching. This research applied a qualitative research method using case study approach. The findings of this research show the characteristics of <b>effective</b> English <b>language</b> teachers in Makassar are divided into several categories; professional competence, pedagogical competence, social competence, personal qualities, and intra and intercultural awareness. <b>Effective</b> English <b>language</b> teachers emphasized their characteristics mostly on professional and pedagogical competence while the students categorized their teachers based on their personal qualities. In terms of personal background, there are several characteristics that could be concluded, they were inspired by their teachers that make them interested in English and become English teachers, they have positive attitudes toward English since they were students, and the second and the third research subject come from teachers’ family while the first research subject does not come from teachers’ family, but they all admitted that their families have important roles to their career as teachers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{reports on}} a study of teacher {{perceptions}} concerning teaching behaviors and attitudes that contribute to <b>effective</b> foreign <b>language</b> teaching and learning. The data were collected {{by means of a}} questionnaire to which 457 postsecondary foreign language teachers of French, German, and Spanish who are members of ACTFL responded. Based on current research on second language acquisition (SLA), various teaching behaviors and attitudes of <b>effective</b> foreign <b>language</b> teachers were identified for inclusion on the questionnaire. The results indicate an emerging professional consensus regarding a number of teacher behaviors and attitudes related to foreign language teaching. The more that is known about teacher beliefs, the more likely the profession will be to create models for foreign language teacher preparation and evaluation that reflect relevant behaviors and attitudes of foreign language teaching.
