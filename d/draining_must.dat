Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia Civil, Florianópolis, 2012 A pesquisa estuda as propriedades mecânicas quanto a desagregação, permeabilidade e deformação permanente dos concretos asfálticos drenantes modificados por polímero SBS e borracha moída de pneus na condição com e sem ciclagem de água. Os granulares utilizados foram de origem granítica oriundos da Empresa Vogelsanger em Palhoça # SC e os ligantes de elevada consistência (CAP 30 / 45) fornecidos pela Refinaria Duque de Caxias (REDUC) e modificados a fim de atender o objetivo da pesquisa pela Empresa CBB Asfaltos em Curitiba # PR. Utilizou-se o CAP 30 / 45 com a intenção de obter misturas mais resistentes ao elevado tráfego que provoca o aumento da deterioração das rodovias e modificados para aumentar ainda mais essa resistência. A modificação caracterizou-se pela adição de 4 % de polímero SBS por já ter sido tema de outras pesquisas e 20 % de borracha moída de pneus pelo apelo ambiental, sendo que tal percentagem foi utilizada pois é a adotada pelas curvas granulométricas descontínuas que caracterizam as misturas drenantes. Para a realização de ambas as misturas, para que sejam comprovadamente drenantes, devem ter volume de vazios acima de 20 % e permeabilidade com velocidade de escoamento acima de 0, 6 cm/s e além disso, possuírem desagregação {{inferior}} a 25 % e deformação permanente inferior a 10 % para que não haja afundamentos nas trilhas de roda. A razão de estudar as condições das misturas com e sem ciclagem, é verificar o comportamento dessas misturas tanto em pista seca quanto com pista úmida ou molhada. Mas acima de tudo, o estudo busca desenvolver um bom pavimento que proporciona conforto, economia e segurança o que o pavimento drenante oferece por não haver a formação da hidroplanagem, viscoplanagem, reflexão luminosa, névoa d#água, irregularidades, graças à eliminação da lâmina d#águaThe {{research studies}} the mechanical properties as to disintegration, permeability and permanent deformation of drainage asphalt concretes modifieds for polymer SBS and ground rubber tires in the condition {{with and without}} water cycling. The granulars used are of granitic origin from the Vogelsanger Firm in Palhoça - SC and the binders of high consistency (CAP 30 / 45) were provided by Duque de Caxias Refinery (REDUC) and modifieds for the purpose accord {{the objective of the}} research by CBB Asphalt Firm in Curitiba - PR. Was used himself the CAP 30 / 45 with the intention of obtaining mixtures more resistant to high traffic which causes the increase of the deterioration of the highways and modifieds to further increase this resistence. The modification was characterized himself by the addition of 4 % of polymer SBS for already have been theme of other researchs and 20 % of ground rubber tires by environmental appeal, being that such percentage was used because is adopted by the discontinuous granulometric curves that characterize the draining mixtures. For the realization of both mixtures, so that are provenly <b>draining,</b> <b>must</b> have void volume above than 20 % and permeability with flow velocity above than 0, 6 cm/s and furthermore, will possess disintegration less than 25 % and permanent deformation less then 10 % so that no there sags in the wheel tracks. The reason for study the conditions of mixtures with and without water cycling, is check the behavior of these mixtures both in dry runway as with moist or wet runway. But above all, the study search to develop a good paviment that provides comfort, economy and safety which the drainage paviment provides for have not the formation of hydroplaning, viscoplanagem, light reflection, water mist, irregularities, due to elimination of water dept...|$|E

Methods: Each drain was weighed soon after removal; they were then washed, dried and weighed again. The difference between the first andsecondw eights was taken {{as the amount of}} clot deposit formed. Results: We found more clots accumulated inside the drains that were temporarily obstructed by the clamp. Conclusion: In this study, there were more clots formation inside thoracic drains clamped, even if they were occluded intermottently. This can lead thoracic drains to function improperly.

40|$|The basin {{clay soil}} occupying an {{extensive}} {{area between the}} great rivers in the Netherlands {{is characterized by a}} profile with a highly permeable surface layer (20 cm) over a poorly permeable second layer (50 cm, K = 0. 05 metre/ day) and a highly permeable subsoil (KD) = 1 metre 2 /day). In this profile, a deep discharge in vertical direction through the second layer and in horizontal direction through the subsoil takes place. A shallow discharge in horizontal direction may occur, through the surface layer. There is surface run-off under special conditions. The occurrence of shallow discharge is determined by the relation between precipitation rate and infiltration capacity of the second layer. When the watertable remains below the top of this second layer, infiltration occurs in unsaturated soil, since infiltration capacity exceeds or practically equals the hydraulic conductivity of the second layer. But when the watertable reaches the top of the second layer, infiltration capacity becomes equal to the discharge rate of the drainage system in the highly permeable subsoil. The lower the initial watertable in the subsoil {{at the start of a}} rainy period, the longer the rain has to infiltrate into an unsaturated soil. Good drainage can be achieved under the rainfall of the Netherlands with an adequate system of ditches and tile lines only if in the highly permeable subsoil, so reducing radial resistance. Otherwise trench <b>drains</b> <b>must</b> be used...|$|R

50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: The Trap - The contestants must {{install a}} trap {{as part of}} the tub installation. Two <b>drains</b> <b>must</b> be {{installed}} for the tub: one for the main drain and another for the overflow, and both must connect to only one trap, which must be installed in the hotel's basement and connected to the hotel's existing system. Due to there only being two drills available for all the contestants, only Dan and Charlene have first access to the drills; Ajay, denied a drill by Natasha, instead grabs a jackhammer and uses the coring bit to cut a hole through the concrete floor, damaging both the floor and the bit, and cutting a hole too big for his drain pipe. Furthermore, he attaches his pipes to the tub before installing his drains in the basement, and he places his trap too far away from his drains (by Ontario's codes, the trap may only be at most 60 cm from his drain). On top of all that, his pipes leak when tested. Needless to say, he fails. Matt originally misinterprets his notes from the lesson taught by Geoff (who will also test the traps by pouring a bucket of water into the drain pipes), but he eventually finishes his connection. However, beyond the trap his connection to the hotel's existing system runs uphill, so he fails. Neither Dan nor Rob encounter any issues in installing their drains to an acceptable quality, and both pass. Charlene runs out of time, and fails.|$|R
50|$|The Toilet - The contestants must {{replace the}} toilets in their bathrooms. Dan resorts to smashing his toilet in {{frustration}} {{after the two}} bolts stubbornly refuse to come off. Matt accidentally drops a bolt into his toilet <b>drain,</b> and <b>must</b> resort to sticking {{his hand in the}} drain in order to retrieve the bolt, much to his chagrin. He fails the challenge after failing to find the bolt and giving up. Ajay, despite initially attaching the toilet tank {{to the bottom of the}} toilet bowl, manages to pass. Dan also passes without incident. Rob also manages to install his tub successfully, though he is slightly unsanitary at his task. Testing Charlene's toilet installation causes all her bathtub pipes to leak and burst, making her fail.|$|R

Bioremediation is sometimes {{used in conjunction with}} a pump and treat system. In bioremediation, either naturally occurring or specially bred bacteria are used to consume contaminants from extracted groundwater. This is sometimes referred to as a bio-gac system. Many times the groundwater is recycled to allow for continuously flowing water and enhanced bacteria population growth. Occasionally the bacteria can build up to such a point that they can affect filtration and pumping. The vessel should then be partially <b>drained.</b> Care <b>must</b> be taken to ensure that a sharp change in the groundwater chemistry does not kill the bacteria (such as a sudden change in pH).|$|R

It is of importance in order to explain these phenomena to study the hydrodynamical interaction between the fluid phase and the suspensed particles and this is the principal purpose of this paper. Density currents are examples or two-phase flow, the suspensed material acting as a determining factor. They are particularly discussed as they give a remarkable illustration of the interaction between solids and liquids and play moreover an important part in the study of reservoirs formed by dams in arid regions. This memoir analyses too the similarity between sand or dust storms and density currents...|$|R

5000|$|A drain {{is defined}} as {{plumbing}} fitting installed on the suction side of a pump in a pool, spa or hot tub. Drains are now required to be [...] "unblockable." [...] This term has previously been defined in the [...] "definitions" [...] section. Four main ways of keeping a drain from being blockable are outlined as: large aspect covers, long channels, large outlet grates and circulation designs that do not include fully submerged suction outlets. In the United States, if a pool or spa does not employ an unblockable <b>drain,</b> it <b>must</b> include, at a minimum, {{one of the following}} safety systems: a safety vacuum release system (SVRS) as defined in [...] "definitions,' a suction limiting vent system with a tamper resistant atmospheric opening, a gravity drainage system that utilizes a collector tank, an automatic pump shut-off system, a device or system that disables the drain or any other system certified by the consumer product safety commission.|$|R
40|$|In {{face-to-face}} contexts, {{information about}} the activities, context or emotions of others is typically available and often taken for granted. In computer-mediated communication (CMC) contexts, this awareness information is not readily available and thus needs to be actively signaled by users or technology or otherwise conveyed as byproduct of the ongoing interaction. We present a theory of the dynamic creation of awareness via computer-mediated communication illustrated by a metaphor of pools fed from streams of interaction. Pools of awareness are held within users and gradually fill via signals from others. Users need different pools to be fed and draw from the streams of interaction to feed their pools and reciprocally place information in the streams to feed the pools of others. In addition, pools <b>drain</b> and <b>must</b> be replenished when a new CMC encounter begins. Awareness is thus created actively or as byproduct of social communicative practice, but is not an instant product of technology. We formulate theoretical propositions and discuss implications of our proposed theory for CMC researchers and practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Variability of nanometer-size devices {{is a major}} {{challenge}} for circuit design. Apart from the as-fabricated variability, the postfabrication degradation introduces a time-dependent variability, originating from statistical distribution of charge location and number. The existing characterization techniques do not always capture the maximum degradation. Some of them does not separate the device-to-device variation from the charging fluctuation within the same device, either. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a new analysis method for characterizing time-dependent device-to-device variation, accounting for within-device fluctuation (TVF). The TVF captures the maximum degradation, separate device-to-device variation from within-device fluctuation, and reduce the data points by three orders of magnitude. It is shown that the popular data acquisition at discrete time points does not capture the fluctuation well and <b>drain</b> current <b>must</b> be measured continuously. The TVF shows that degradation has two components-a fluctuation with time and one whose discharge is not observed under a given bias. Although both of them increase with stress time, the correlation between them is weak, indicating two different origins...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary concern}} of {{agricultural}} drainage engineers is, as {{reflected by the}} contents of this Monograph, the control of water table conditions within an area of crop production. However, as concern about environmental impacts continues to grow, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to be aware that agricultural effects may extend beyond the boundary of a field or a farm. Thus, drainage will inevitably affect the pattern of water flows from the land and into the receiving watercourses. It is these `downstream' or `offsite' impacts of farmland drainage on the timing and magnitude of flows which are considered in this Chapter. The impacts of drainage on flows may be considered at two scales: the individual field outfall, where discharge can be related directly to conditions in the field (water table height, soil type, drain spacing etc), and at the river catchment scale, where not only the distributed effects of the <b>drained</b> areas <b>must</b> be integrated, but also the role of improvements to the main (arterial) channels must be considered...|$|R

50|$|A drainback {{system is}} an active {{indirect}} system where the HTF (usually pure water) circulates through the collector, driven by a pump. The collector piping is not pressurized and includes an open drainback reservoir that is contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space. The HTF remains in the drainback reseervoir unless the pump is operating and returns there (emptying the collector) when the pump is switched off. The collector system, including piping, <b>must</b> <b>drain</b> via gravity into the drainback tank. Drainback systems {{are not subject to}} freezing or overheating. The pump operates only when appropriate for heat collection, but not to protect the HTF, increasing efficiency and reducing pumping costs.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} {{principles are}} used in chest drainage management: The Heber-Drain principle and the Bülau-Drain principle.The “Heber-Drain” {{is based on the}} Heber principle, which uses hydrostatic pressure to transfer fluid from the chest to a collection canister. It produces permanent passive suction. As the Heber drain is a classical gravity <b>drain,</b> the canister <b>must</b> be placed below chest level to be active. The difference in height between the floor and the patient bed determines the resultant sub-atmospheric pressure. With a difference, for example, of 70 cm in height, a pressure of minus 70 cm of water is created. A water seal component is always combined with a Heber-Drain.|$|R

The {{amount of energy}} she has retained from her victims does seem to correlate somewhat with her physical strength and resistance to injury. Selene can momentarily move at superhuman speeds of around 175 miles/hour, though this requires a heavy expenditure of energy and can cause her to age rapidly and require more life energy immediately. It is not known how often Selene <b>must</b> <b>drain</b> a human's life force in order to survive. Great expenditure of power causes Selene to age rapidly, but she can rejuvenate herself by absorbing more life force.|$|R
50|$|Since the incisions are small, and {{the amount}} of fluid that <b>must</b> <b>drain</b> out is large, some {{surgeons}} opt to leave the incisions open, the better to clear the patient's body of excess fluid. They find that the unimpeded departure of that fluid allows the incisions to heal more quickly. Others suture them only partially, leaving space for the fluid to drain out. Others delay suturing until most of the fluid has drained out, about 1 or 2 days. In any case, while the fluid is draining, dressings need to be changed often. After one to three days, small self-adhesive bandages are sufficient. Doctors disagree on the issues of scarring with not suturing versus resolution of the swelling allowed by leaving the wounds open to drain fluid.|$|R
