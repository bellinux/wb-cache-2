5|$|At 11:35, Kinkaid {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Enterprise and her screening ships from battle, since Hornet {{was out of}} action, Enterprise was heavily damaged, and surmising, correctly, that the Japanese <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two undamaged carriers in the area. Leaving Hornet behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat {{as soon as they}} were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave {{for a tour}} of France; Rochemont's {{mental health}} had been deteriorating and {{he was no longer}} able to carry out his {{teaching}} duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two pupils living with them, who had been recommended by personal friends.|$|E

5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the crewmen, soldiers, sailors and gunners alike, nothing has been recorded. The only source of information for these men has been through osteological analysis of the human bones found at the wrecksite. An approximate composition of some of the crew has been conjectured based on contemporary records. The Mary Rose would have carried a captain, a master responsible for navigation, and deck crew. There would also have been a purser responsible for handling payments, a boatswain, the captain's second in command, at least one carpenter, a pilot in charge of navigation, and a cook, all of whom <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more assistants (mates). The ship was also staffed by a barber-surgeon who tended to the sick and wounded, along with an apprentice or mate and possibly also a junior surgeon. The only positively identified person who went down with the ship was Vice-Admiral George Carew. McKee, Stirland and several other authors have also named Roger Grenville, father of Richard Grenville of the Elizabethan-era Revenge, captain during the final battle, although the accuracy of the sourcing for this has been disputed by maritime archaeologist Peter Marsden.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} is best {{represented by}} YGSP 32727, {{one of two}} specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris. It preserves both {{the right and left}} sides of the dentary, back {{to the level of the}} fourth lower premolars (p4), but is also damaged at the front. The jaw is deep below p4, but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front. The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved; the three roots cluster together, with the canine root above the incisor roots, suggesting that these teeth shared some function. The mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone, is below p4. A root for the deciduous second premolar (dp2) is preserved on both the left and right sides, but the tooth itself is not and it is not possible to determine whether dp2 <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two roots. The right permanent second premolar (p2) is unerupted, but partially visible; it is a blade-shaped cutting tooth. The p3 bears a single cusp, somewhat anterior to the middle of the tooth, with crests descending from it towards the front and back, and weak cingula on the inner and outer sides. It is supported by two roots, which are close together.|$|E
