50|$|<b>Dock</b> <b>work</b> was {{hit hard}} by the depression, and between 1929 and 1932 the sixteen {{locomotives}} which made up the first two batches delivered were withdrawn, nine being sold to industrial use while the remainder were scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|The Dry <b>Dock</b> Engine <b>Works</b> {{had always}} had a special {{relationship}} with the nearby Detroit Dry Dock Company, which only increased as the years passed. [...] In the 1870s, Dry <b>Dock</b> Engine <b>Works</b> sold over 1/3 of their engines to Detroit Dry Dock; by the early 1890s that fraction had increased to nearly 2/3. [...] The ties were enhanced {{by the fact that}} Frank Kirby, John Owen, and James McMillan of Detroit Dry Dock slowly acquired shares in Dry <b>Dock</b> Engine <b>Works.</b> [...] By the end of the 1880s, virtually all of the Dry <b>Dock</b> Engine <b>Works</b> shares were owned by Detroit Dry Dock principals. [...] In 1892, James McMillan took over the presidency of Dry <b>Dock</b> Engine <b>Works,</b> and the two firms were controlled by the same person. [...] It was around this time that the oldest of the remaining structures in the complex, the machine shop and dry dock no. 2, were built.|$|R

50|$|A more {{effective}} system of workplace inspection was set up, {{together with the}} Health and Safety Executive, {{in response to the}} plight of many workers who suffered accidents or ill-health as a result of poor working conditions (whose plight, according to Eric Shaw, had long been ignored by the media). Industrial tribunals also provided protection through compensation for unfair dismissal, while the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service performed an effective function in the management of industrial disputes. Income inequality also fell during the years of the Wilson and Callaghan governments. Full employment and income policy helped to reduce wage differentials, while subsidies on coal, gas, and electricity increased the social wage. Other reforms introduced by Labour included the Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act of 1976 (which provided children who were born disabled due to cases of negligence with a statutory right to claim damages and the <b>Dock</b> <b>Work</b> Regulation Act of 1976 (which extended registered <b>dock</b> <b>work</b> to cold-storage depots and warehouses five miles from any waterfront).|$|E

[...] At the London County Council election, 1892, he was elected as a Labour and Progressive Party candidate in Bow and Bromley.|$|E
50|$|As {{the second}} {{generation}} of Irish families obtained better-paying work, and <b>dock</b> <b>work</b> was increasingly mechanized, the Irish began {{moving out of the}} Flats. By 1900, more than half of this area's residents were of Eastern European origin, although the Irish families still owned many of the properties. Irishtown Bend was gradually abandoned; by 1910, {{more than a third of}} the homes had been torn down. In 1952, only 5 of the original 80 buildings were left standing.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{to install}} {{additional}} weapons were made, which includes one Mk. 38 Mod 1 25 mm chain gun aft, two Mk.16 20 mm autocannons midships, and six 12.7 mm machine guns.

50|$|Greenpoint {{has long}} held a {{reputation}} of being a working class and immigrant neighborhood, and it initially attracted families and workers with its abundance of factory jobs and longshoreman or <b>dock</b> <b>work.</b> Since the early 2000s, a building boom in the neighborhood, especially of multifamily dwellings, has made the neighborhood increasingly a center of nightlife, attracting more bohemian residents. However, there have been efforts to reclaim the rezoned Greenpoint / Williamsburg East River waterfront for recreational use and also to extend a continuous promenade into the Newtown Creek area.|$|E
50|$|Access {{from the}} Qingdao Paralympic Village to the <b>dock,</b> <b>work</b> areas, etc. was {{provided}} by numerous golf carts making endless daytime rounds. Both ends of the work area had 2 cranes apiece, which could lift large keelboats like the Sonar from cradles and lower these into the water. At night, a laser light show from the main breakwater lighthouse would play from early evening to midnight. Facing the Yellow Sea, the main breakwater with spectator seating, windmills, flags and lighthouse was also the viewing area for the sailing competitions when not on the spectator ferry. Across the bay, the famous May 4 monument and Qingdao's landmark seaside building are easily visible.|$|E

50|$|Even {{before the}} {{waterfront}} development was proposed, there was {{demand for a}} new marina in Barrow. However, after it was approved, interest soared even further. Eight sailing clubs reported immediate demand for berths and winter storage. The new marina will come {{at a cost of}} £8 million and will be able to accommodate up to 400 privately owned boats at any one time. An overland boat lift has also been proposed with access for up to six boats simultaneously, with 24-hour-a-day access. Marina berths will be located on the mainland side of Buccleuch Dock, whilst further berths will be situated on the Barrow Island side of Ramsden <b>Dock.</b> <b>Work</b> is due to begin on the marina sometime in 2017.|$|E
50|$|Aimee is Nick Sobotka's {{girlfriend and}} the mother of his daughter, Ashley. Aimee could not stay {{overnight}} at Nick's home because he still lived with his parents. Aimee hopes to get a place for her young family to share and encourages Nick to go house hunting with her despite his lack of income from his <b>dock</b> <b>work.</b> She is shocked when she discovers a bundle of cash in his basement room, but he explains it by telling her that it comes from a new warehouse manager position. Aimee was at Nick's home when the police raided it and found a stash of heroin. She accepted his misdeeds and went into protective custody with him; the two finally sharing a home for a night.|$|E
50|$|In Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History (1977), Richard Gambino, a {{professor}} at City University of New York, raises numerous questions about the investigation and trial and proposes an alternative theory about Hennessy's murder. Among other things, Gambino notes that Hennessy had a colorful past which provided any number of possible motives, none of which the police chose to investigate. He also notes that shortly after the lynching, the city passed an ordinance handing over control of all New Orleans <b>dock</b> <b>work</b> to the newly formed Louisiana Construction and Improvement Corporation, a business headed by several of the lynch mob leaders. Italian waterfront merchants and workers, who had been making remarkable economic progress up to then, were thus eliminated as competitors.|$|E

50|$|Born in England, Urban Broughton studied civil {{engineering}} at the University of London. Upon graduation, he worked {{on a variety of}} projects including railways, drainage systems, and <b>dock</b> <b>works.</b> He became involved with the Shone sewer system, a pneumatic-pump-based system invented by Welsh mechanical and civil engineer Isaac Shone and first installed in the British Houses of Parliament. This work led him to the United States around 1887.|$|R
50|$|Stephenson's early {{professional}} work mainly involved surveys for railway {{routes in}} Ireland, <b>dock</b> <b>works</b> (he {{worked on the}} extension of Sunderland docks under John Murray), design of iron railway bridges (working {{for two years in}} partnership with William Dredge, and later with Robert King), English railway projects (he was engineer to the Ware, Hadham and Buntingford Railway), and arbitration work. From 1858 he designed and managed several town gas lighting projects in Germany and Holland, later serving on the boards of several UK and overseas gas companies. Elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1853, he became a full member in 1864.|$|R
