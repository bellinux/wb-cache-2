25|$|Some of {{the stands}} that feature rata-kamahi {{have trouble with}} <b>die-back</b> caused in part by opossums that like to find shelter within older trees (around 300 years), {{especially}} ones that grow on fertile ground.|$|E
25|$|Deadwood {{techniques}} {{are used for}} reasons both practical and aesthetic. Practically, collected specimens of aged trees often have dead wood present. Dead wood can also appear on a bonsai under cultivation for many reasons, including branch <b>die-back,</b> pest infestation, or disease. It can be partially or completely removed by the bonsai artist, but doing so may damage the tree's overall shape or the illusion of age. If dead wood is retained, however, it must be chemically treated to preserve it and to produce the coloration of weathered wood. In addition, the dead wood usually needs to be shaped to fit the aesthetic plan for the bonsai.|$|E
25|$|Soil volume: Giving a bonsai a {{relatively}} large soil volume encourages the growth of roots, then corresponding growth {{of the rest of}} the tree. With a large amount of soil, the tree trunk extends in length and increases in diameter, existing branches increase in size and new branches appear, and the foliage expands in volume. The grower can move an outdoor bonsai from a pot to a training box or to open ground to stimulate this sort of growth. Replacing the tree in a bonsai pot will slow or halt the tree's growth, and may lead to <b>die-back</b> if the volume of foliage is too great for the limited root system to support. Managing the tree's available soil volume allows the grower to manage the overall size of the bonsai, and to increase vigor and growth when new branches are required for a planned styling.|$|E
40|$|Lake Ontario, as {{many other}} lakes in the world, has {{suffered}} {{from a variety of}} environmental problems over the past fifty years. Massive blooms followed by <b>die-backs</b> of Cladophora, a filamentous algae, and by diebacks of the alewife, a fish, fouled beaches along the Lake Ontario shoreline in the 1960 s. The phosphorus abatement program, agreed to by both Canada and the United States, successfully reduced the levels of phosphorus that stimulated the growth of algae. As a result of the reduction of phosphorus, once commonly found in detergents and sewage plant effluent, algae populations including the once ubiquitous shoreline Cladophora species were reduced by the late 1980 s. Similarly with the introduction of the alewife-eating Pacific Salmon [11], lake alewif...|$|R
25|$|The {{environmental}} factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock or sand), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual irradiance dose > 50 E m−2). Especially productive kelp forests {{tend to be}} associated with areas of significant oceanographic upwelling, a process that delivers cool, nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean’s mixed surface layer. Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column. Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, giant kelp (Macrocystis spp.) can grow as much as 30-60 cm vertically per day. Some species, such as Nereocystis, are annuals, while others such as Eisenia are perennials, living for more than 20 years. In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and <b>die-backs</b> correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods, and increased storm frequency.|$|R
40|$|The role {{of disease}} in the {{long-term}} dynamics of threatened species is poorly quantified, {{as well as being}} under-represented in ecology and conservation management. To understand persistent host–pathogen interaction operating in a vulnerable habitat, we quantified dynamics driving patterns of seagrass density using a longitudinal study in a relatively pristine site (Isles of Scilly, UK). Replicated samples of eelgrass (Zostera marina) density and wasting disease prevalence, presumably caused by Labyrinthula zosterae, were taken from five meadows {{at the height of the}} growing season, over the years 1997 – 2010. Data were used to parameterise a population dynamic model, incorporating density-dependent factors and sea temperature records. We found that direct density and disease-mediated feedback operate within a network of local populations. Furthermore, our results indicate that the strength of limitation to seagrass growth by disease was increased at higher temperatures. This modification of the coupled host–pathogen dynamics forms a novel hypothesis to account for dramatic <b>die-backs</b> of Z. marina widely reported elsewhere. Our findings highlight the importance of disease in structuring distributions of vulnerable species, as well as the application of population modelling in order to reveal ecological processes and prioritise future mechanistic investigation...|$|R
2500|$|The unique {{environmental}} {{pressures of the}} Hunter Valley also conspire to give growers problem with [...] "dieback diseases" [...] that damage the wood parts of the vine and eventually lead to death. While the fungus Eutypa lata {{is present in the}} Hunter, research in the 2000s indicated that another pathogenic species related to Botryosphaeria is also present in the area. Semillon vines, in particular seem to be susceptible to Botryosphaeria (also known as bot canker) while, conversely, Eutypa dieback is rarely observed in the variety. Vines suffering from Eutypa <b>die-back</b> and bot canker exhibit similar wood symptoms and similarly experiences reduce growth and yields. A major difference between the two is that bot canker do not exhibit the same outward foliage symptoms that Eutypa <b>die-back</b> leave on the leaves and buds of the vine.|$|E
2500|$|In {{northern}} Europe elms were, moreover, {{among the}} few trees tolerant of saline deposits from sea spray, which can cause [...] "salt-burning" [...] and <b>die-back.</b> This tolerance made elms reliable both as shelterbelt trees exposed to sea wind, in particular along the coastlines of southern and western Britain and in the Low Countries, and as trees for coastal towns and cities.|$|E
5000|$|In Belgium, elm <b>die-back</b> {{and death}} was {{observed}} in 1836 and 1896 in Brussels, and in 1885-6 in Ghent. In the later outbreaks the <b>die-back</b> was attributed to the elm bark beetle.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} abiotic drivers on inter-annual and phenological patterns of aboveground biomass for Marsh Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, on the Central Georgia Coast. The linkages between drivers and plant response via soil edaphic factors are captured in our graphical conceptual model. We used geospatial techniques to scale up in situ measurements of aboveground S. alterniflora biomass to landscape level estimates using 294 Landsat 5 TM scenes acquired between 1984 and 2011. For each scene we extracted data from the same 63 sampling polygons, containing 1222 pixels covering about 1. 1 million m 2. Using univariate and multiple regression tests, we compared Landsat derived biomass estimates for three S. alterniflora size classes against a suite of abiotic drivers. River discharge, total precipitation, minimum temperature, and mean sea level had positive relationships with and best explained biomass for all dates. Additional results, using seasonally binned data, indicated biomass was responsive to changing combinations of variables across the seasons. Our 28 -year analysis revealed aboveground biomass declines of 33 %, 35 %, and 39 % for S. alterniflora tall, medium, and short size classes, respectively. This decline correlated with drought frequency and severity trends and coincided with marsh <b>die-backs</b> events and increased snail herbivory {{in the second half}} of the study period...|$|R
40|$|Insular “middle {{mountains}} ” of the Hercynian chain {{are poor}} on alpine insect species due to small areas overtopping the timberline. There are two relic butterflies native to Jesenik Mts. (max. 1495 m), NW Czech Republic, each traditionally {{classified as a}} endemic subspecies: Erebia sudetica sudetica (Staudinger, 1851), a species protected by EU Habitat Directive, and E. epiphron silesiana Meyer & Dür, 1852. Whereas E. epiphron silesiana is restricted to summit Nardus-dominated grasslands and never enters continuous mountain forests, E. sudetica sudetica inhabits damp locations at the timberline plus open wet sites within mountains forests, descending to ca 700 m. Whereas E. epiphron silesiana forms continuous populations, the distribution of E. sudetica sudetica conforms to a metapopulation model, with local colonies interconnected by dispersal. Being restricted to relatively low mountains, these two species, but particularly epiphron, {{are thought to be}} particularly threatened by warming climate. However, their locally restricted distribution might be an outcome of limited range of available habitats, rather than some ecophysiological constraints. A non-native population of E. epiphron in Krkonose Mts. (max. 1620 m), transferred there from the Jesenik Mts. in the 1930 s, descends to ca 1100 m, colonising large clearings opened up during forest <b>die-backs</b> in the 1980 s, and also hay meadows within the forest belt.

40|$|Analyses of pollen, macrofossils and {{microscopic}} charcoal in {{the sediment}} {{of a small}} sub-alpine lake (Karakol, Kyrgyzstan) provide new data to reconstruct the vegetation history of the Kungey Alatau spruce forest during the late-Holocene, i. e. the past 4, 000 years. The pollen data suggest that Picea schrenkiana F. and M. was the dominant tree in this region {{from the beginning of}} the record. The pollen record of pronounced <b>die-backs</b> of the forests, along with lithostratigraphical evidence, points to possible climatic cooling (and/or drying) around 3, 800 cal year B. P., and between 3, 350 and 2, 520 cal year B. P., with a culmination at 2, 800 - 2, 600 cal B. P., although stable climatic conditions are reported for this region for the past 3, 000 - 4, 000 years in previous studies. From 2, 500 to 190 cal year B. P. high pollen values of P. schrenkiana suggest rather closed and dense forests under the environmental conditions of that time. A marked decline in spruce forests occurred with the onset of modern human activities in the region from 190 cal year B. P. These results show that the present forests are anthropogenically reduced and represent only about half of their potential natural extent. As P. schrenkiana is a species endemic to the western Tien Shan, it is most likely that its refugium was confined to this region. However, our palaeoecological record is too recent to address this hypothesis thoroughly...|$|R

50|$|C. graminicola is a fungal {{pathogen}} that colonizes and infects many turfgrass e.g., Bluegrass, Ryegrass, fescue. In {{addition to}} the grasses, C. graminicola also infects many grain crops such as barley, wheat, sorghum and corn. The fungus can infect many {{different parts of the}} corn plant, typically the kernels, tassels, roots, leaves, stalk and husks. The most common area of infection is the stalk. C. graminicola produces three major symptom types: leaf blight, stalk rot and top <b>die-back.</b> The leaf blight is characterized by round yellowing water soaked lesions on the leaves. These lesions usually occur early in the season and are how this pathogen is distinguished from other diseases. Top <b>die-back</b> is the necrosis of the top leaves and stalk of the corn. This occurs around the same time as grain formation. The stalk rot phase becomes prominent during the late reproductive stages of the corn life cycle. It is characterized by blackening of the pith tissue in the stalk and also of the rind, beginning at the nodes closest to the soil. Along with these symptoms, seedling blight and post emergence damping off are also found.|$|E
