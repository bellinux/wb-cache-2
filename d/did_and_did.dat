Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also {{knew that he was}} still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of {{the aspects}} of grammar that Genie <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not acquire aided {{linguists}} in determining which structures were more dependent on exposure to language. In particular, the auxiliary component of language had been known {{to be one of}} the few children acquire at different rates depending on the amount of speech they heard. Genie's inability to master it supported the idea that its development and that of other similar systems of grammar is more sensitive than vocabulary or more basic grammar, such as word order or recursion, requiring a more conducive language environment to properly develop and having a more specific critical period. Linguists also noted the grammatical skills Genie acquired and used bore striking resemblance to the grammar of pidgin languages and the gesture systems deaf children invent when isolated from other deaf people, which contain certain aspects of language, such as vocabulary, recursion, and word order, but always lack other components such as auxiliary structures.|$|E
25|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{indicator of}} the importance Berlioz placed on journalistic integrity and even-handedness were the journals which he both <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not write for. During {{the middle of the}} 1830s the Gazette was considered an intellectual journal, strongly supporting the progressive arts and Romanticism in general, and opposing anything which it considers as debasing this. Exemplified in its long-standing criticism of Henri Herz, and his seemingly endless stream of variations on opera themes, but to its credit, it also positively reviewed his music on occasion. Its writers included Alexandre Dumas, Honoré de Balzac and George Sand. The Gazette wasn't even unanimous in its praise of Berlioz's music, although it always recognised him as an important and serious composer to be respected. An example of another journal of the same time is the Revue musicale, which thrived on personal attacks, many against Berlioz himself from the pen of critic François-Joseph Fétis. At one point, Robert Schumann was motivated to publish a detailed rebuttal of one of Fétis' attacks on Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique in his own Neue Zeitschrift für Musik journal. Fétis would later contribute to the debasement of the reputation of the Gazette when his journal failed and was absorbed by the Gazette, he found himself on the editorial board.|$|E
500|$|Despite the scholar-officials' {{suspicion}} and disdain for powerful merchants, the latter often colluded with the scholarly elite. The scholar-officials themselves often {{became involved in}} mercantile affairs, blurring the lines of who <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> {{not belong to the}} merchant class. Even rural farmers engaged in the small-scale production of wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods. Theoretically it was forbidden for an official to partake in private affairs of gaining capital while serving and receiving a salary from the state. In order to avoid ruining one's reputation as a moral Confucian, scholar-officials had to work through business intermediaries; as early as 955 a written decree revealed the use of intermediary agents for private business transactions with foreign countries. Since the Song government took over several key industries and imposed strict state monopolies, the government itself acted as a large commercial enterprise run by scholar-officials. The state also had to contend with the merchant and artisan guilds; whenever the state requisitioned goods and assessed taxes it dealt with guild heads, who ensured fair prices and fair wages via official intermediaries. Yet joining a guild was an immediate means to neither empowerment nor independence; historian Jacques Gernet states: [...] " [...] were too numerous and too varied to allow their influence to be felt." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E

[...] In all-female groups, there were many shifts in when individuals <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not employ deception in their negotiation tactics.|$|E

[...] Virtually no conspiracy defendants voluntarily withdraw; Gall <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> so years before he even knew he {{was the target of}} a federal investigation. [...] In the Court's eyes, this was a sign of genuine rehabilitation. [...] "Compared to a case where the offender's rehabilitation occurred after he was charged with a crime, the District Court here had greater justification for believing Gall's turnaround was genuine, as distinct from a transparent attempt to build a mitigation case." [...] The Eighth Circuit had faulted the district court for taking into account Gall's youth {{at the time of the}} crime; the Supreme Court noted that such a consideration was permissible as part of the [...] "history and characteristics of the defendant." [...] The Government had never contended that a probation-only sentence was inappropriate in a case such as Gall's; in fact, it had conceded that such a sentence might sometimes be appropriate. [...] These differing policy choices were incompatible with an abuse-of-discretion review; hence, the Eighth Circuit's decision could not stand.|$|E
