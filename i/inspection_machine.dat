5000|$|... {{the ability}} to {{automatically}} read {{the current state of}} a system for detecting and diagnosing the root-cause of output product defects, and subsequently correct operational defects quickly. Diagnosability has two aspects: detecting machine failure and detecting unacceptable part quality. The second aspect is critical in RMS. As production systems are made more reconfigurable, and their layouts are modified more frequently, it becomes essential to rapidly tune (or ramp-up) the newly reconfigured system so that it produces quality parts. Consequently, reconfigurable systems must also be designed with product quality measurement systems as an integral part. For example, a Reconfigurable <b>Inspection</b> <b>Machine</b> (RIM) embedded in the RMS enables quick detection. These measurement systems are intended to help identify the sources of product quality problems in the production system rapidly, so they can be corrected utilizing control methods, statistics, and signal processing techniques.|$|E
