500|$|Webster's Yorkshire Bitter was {{launched}} {{in the summer of}} 1982. Largely a cask product, by 1984 Grand Metropolitan had transformed Yorkshire Bitter into a [...] "massive" [...] national brand, available in the company's 5,000 tied houses and 15,000 free houses. It was marketed as their response to the growing popularity of Yorkshire bitter in the south of England, particularly John Smith's. Yorkshire Bitter was the highest selling off trade bitter by 1985 with 18 per cent of the market. It had become the fifth best selling bitter nationally by 1989, helped by a competitive pricing policy, and was the highest selling bitter in London. The beer was not without its critics, with the 1990 Good Beer Guide describing it as [...] "weak flavour, reminiscent of a poor quality home brew â€“ worty, bland, cloying, with a <b>dirty</b> <b>finish</b> on the tongue". In 1993, Yorkshire Bitter was reduced from 3.8 per cent [...] to 3.5 per cent ABV in order to save money on duty.|$|E

40|$|In the {{finished}} laboratory and cavity top {{areas of the}} observatory, appropriately coated wall, ceiling and floor surfaces are required for cleanliness and light reflection purposes. This document outlines SNO requirements for these surfaces, and classifies the revised underground layout sections as to finish type. This classification {{is based on the}} preliminary design of the ventilation system and the assigning of laboratory rooms into three categories: clean, semi-clean and <b>dirty.</b> Surface <b>finish</b> procedures are outlined for clean and semi-clean areas, starting with the basic screen/rockbolt and 2 inch (5 cm) shotcrete layer required for ground control purposes. Prior to shotcreting, an inspection of screening is specified. In areas of concern where the screen is not close enough to the rock surface, it will be recommended that screening be pushed back against the rock, or cut and reinstalled using additional rock bolts. During shotcreting, areas for extra shotcrete fill will be identified, and a surface finish step prior to the setting of the shotcrete is specified. In some critical areas, prior to final wall coating, surface remedial work as outlined below will be specified following an inspection. Finally, specifications are given for an epoxy or other suitable pain...|$|R
