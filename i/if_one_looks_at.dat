25|$|<b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> {{this train}} from the fixed {{non-rotating}} frame {{on top of}} the center of the Earth, at that speed it remains stationary as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is gravity and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%) than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.|$|E

In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the {{building}} programs for FY39 and FY40, the US Navy had 194 destroyers (some ordered in June and July 1940), 140 Patrol Craft (PC's 173', 165', 110'), 78 Sub Chasers (SC’s) and 129 YMS’s (which could be utilized for anti-sub role if necessary). Of the Destroyers {{laid down in}} 1940-1 that were not commissioned on December 7, twenty-eight were commissioned between January and June of 1942 with 16 assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet or the European Theater of Operations (ETO) and 12 assigned to the US Pacific Fleet (and of the 12, 1/3 conducted anti-submarine/convoy duty in the Atlantic/Caribbean prior to reporting to the Pacific Fleet) and, of the remaining fifty-two of the classes of 1940-1, 35 were commissioned and assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet and/or the ETO.|$|E
500|$|Jesus {{emphasized}} the need for pure thoughts as well as actions, and stated, [...] "Everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" [...] (Matthew 5:28). The Catechism states that, {{with the help of}} God's grace, men and women are required to overcome lust and bodily desires [...] "for sinful relationships with another person's spouse." [...] In Theology of the Body, a series of lectures given by Pope John Paul II, Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:28 is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another's spouse, but also with his/her own spouse <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him/her lustfully or treats him/her [...] "only as an object to satisfy instinct".|$|E

2500|$|... ※ Discrepancy: This {{statement}} is not exact or inaccurate: [...] "... ACT percentiles are calculated {{on the basis}} of the percent of test takers scoring the same score or a lower one, not (as is the case for many other assessments) only the percent scoring lower". Specifically, it applies to the scores of 35 or lower but not the highest score of 36. This is because if 99.96% of test takers scored 36 AND lower, what score did the remaining 0.04% of test takers get? Obviously the answer is none because there is no score higher than 36. Therefore, the correct percentile for 36 appears to be 0.04% (100% — 99.96%). But <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the next line (the score of 35) it appears to be 0.3% instead (100% — 99.7%). In other words, 99.7% of the test takers had a score of 35 or lower, meaning the only higher score, 36 (no scores between 35 and 36 as the increment is 1), belongs to the remaining 0.3% of test takers. But which is the true answer, 0.3% or 0.04%? If it's 0.3%, then 0.04% is a calculation error? Or the vice versa (0.04% is true and 0.3% is a calculation error). Please clarify by checking on the original data! It's surprising to see such discrepancy for such a popular and critical test.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{evidence}} of Chinese alchemy being openly discussed in history is during the Ch'in's First Emperor's period when Huan K'uan (73-49BC) states how modifying forms of nature and ingesting them will bring immortality {{to the person who}} drinks them (Pregadio. 1995.) Before Huan K'uan, the idea of alchemy was to turn base metals into gold. Conflicting research on the origins of alchemy are further demonstrated by Cooper, who claims that alchemy [...] "flourished well before 144 BCE, for at that date the Emperor issued an edict which ordered public execution for anyone found making counterfeit gold" [...] (Cooper, 1991). This suggests that people were well aware of how to heat the metals in order to change them into a desired form. A further counter to Pregadio from Cooper is the latter's contention that an emperor in 60 BCE had hired [...] "a well-known scholar, Liu Hsiang, as Master of the Recipes so that he could make alchemical gold and prolong the Emperor's life." [...] All of these conflicting origins considered, it is nearly impossible to claim any absolute knowledge on the origins of Chinese alchemy. Today, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the teachings in Daoism one can find alchemical practices in these texts. Most of which posit the existence of an elixir or the Golden Elixir that when ingested gives the drinker eternal life. Since one can make a direct and certain connection between Daoism and Laozi, it is a fair statement to suggest that he {{played a major role in}} the creation of Chinese alchemy.|$|E
60|$|Chaldicotes is a {{house of}} much more {{pretension}} than Framley Court. Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the ancient marks about it, rather than at those of the present day, {{it is a place}} of very considerable pretension. There is an old forest, not altogether belonging to the property, but attached to it, called the Chace of Chaldicotes. A portion of this forest comes up close behind the mansion, and of itself gives a character and celebrity to the place. The Chace of Chaldicotes--the greater part of it, at least--is, as all the world knows, Crown property, and now, in these utilitarian days, is to be disforested. In former times it was a great forest, stretching half across the country, almost as far as Silverbridge; and there are bits of it, here and there, still to be seen at intervals throughout the whole distance; but the larger remaining portion, consisting of aged hollow oaks, centuries old, and wide-spreading withered beeches, stands in the two parishes of Chaldicotes and Uffley. People still come from afar to see the oaks of Chaldicotes, and to hear their feet rustle among the thick autumn leaves. But they will soon come no longer. The giants of past ages are to give way to wheat and turnips; a ruthless Chancellor of the Exchequer, disregarding old associations and rural beauty, requires money returns from the lands; and the Chace of Chaldicotes is to vanish from the earth's surface.|$|E
