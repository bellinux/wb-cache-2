30|$|The scaling {{behaviour}} {{was computed}} through a log-log plot. In this scaling analysis, we considered the annual <b>harvested</b> <b>areas.</b> Only official <b>harvested</b> <b>areas</b> at CAR scale {{are available from}} the data source used (Statistics Canada 2014). Therefore, the annual <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> in a given ECD or RM was calculated as a percentage of this unit area within the corresponding CAR multiplied by the ratio annual <b>harvested</b> area/unit <b>area</b> in this CAR. Whereas the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> at field scale was set at 50  ha for the three selected sites. For each of the selected sites, we determined the spatially-dependent (i.e. site specific) scaling factors for the mean and variance of crop yield. All the analyses were performed using R (R Core Team 2014).|$|R

Until 1930, 93 % of agricultural growth is explained {{by the addition of}} new arable land, while improvements in yields account for the remaining 7 %. Between 1931 and 1952, the decline in production is mostly due to a reduction in <b>harvested</b> <b>area.</b> From 1952 to 1987, yields and <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> equally explain production growth.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{a quantitative}} {{analysis on the}} regional diversity of the Javanese farm agriculture and the pattern of its change which has taken place during the six decades in this century. The source material of this analysis is {{the two sets of}} five years average date (of the years 1916 - 20 and 1975 - 79) on the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven major food crops in 65 regions covering the whole area of Java and Madura which have been derived from the official statistical documents and processed by the author. Major findings which have been acquired by this analysis are as follows: (1) The extension of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven crops during the six decades is very remarkable, and this is mainly caused by the increase of multiple cropping. (2) The percentage of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of rice to the total <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven crops is much higher {{in the western part of}} the island than its eastern part. On the contrary the percentage of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of maize is higher in the eastern part. (3) The pattern of extension of the farm agriculture is regionally different and sometimes contrastive. Generlly speaking, in West Java and the “East Hook” of East Java the agricultural development is highly wet rice oriented, while in many regions of the eastern half of Central Java and the western half of East Java the non-rice crops oriented development has taken place. (4) The share of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of soybean and peanuts has extended outstandingly. In case of soybean this tendency is particularly remarkable in East Java. (5) In West Java the agriculturally developing regions are not identical with the regions with big population increase, which means that the interregional exchange of agticultural products has increased within this part of island. On the contrary, the agricultural development in Central and East Java is much more oriented for the self supply of foods within each region. (6) When viewed as a support factor to the population increase, the non-rice crops production has been no less important than the rice production. (7) However, the agricultural development as a whole cannot be seen the sole factor supporting the population increase, because the regional correlation between the increase of <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven crops and the population increase is not prominently high (+ 0. 5040 for the whole Java) ...|$|R
