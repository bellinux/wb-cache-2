5|$|In 2007, Miguel {{was signed}} to Jive Records-imprint label ByStorm Entertainment. He {{subsequently}} recorded All <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You, but legal issues {{with his former}} production company prevented the album from being released for two years. Miguel continued working with various underground acts and writing songs for mainstream recording artists, including Johnson, Asher Roth, Jaheim, and Usher. Recording sessions for the album took place at Black Mango Studios in Van Nuys, California, Germano Studios in New York City, Glenwood Studios and Instrument Zoo in Miami, Florida, Studio 609 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and The Gym in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E

In total, the album sold 45,000 copies in Singapore and 15,000 copies in Malaysia. In 2007, his second album i伟联 (i-Weilian) was released and the song 普通的人 (Ordinary Man) topped the Singapore charts that October. This album eventually sold 15,000 copies in Singapore and 20,000 copies in Taiwan. Several songs that Tan composed himself were included in his third album, 走唱陈伟联 (Moving Notes...Kelvin Tan), which he promoted through busking appearances. Although its sales figures are not known, the songs 永远的朋友 (Forever Friends) and 分手的请书 (Break Up Letter) topped the Singapore charts in October 2009, while the album peaked at 5th in the Taiwan charts in February 2010. In addition, 分手的请书 won two awards at the 2010 Singapore Entertainment Awards and 我们 (Together) won Best Theme Song at the 2010 Star Awards.

Her dialogue, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> what I have coming to me.

Just as Charlie Brown is with Sally, Finn is appalled by how much Rachel wants, though she assures him that five of the items are enough. When she later hints that an early gift would not be amiss, he surprises her with the donation of a sow in her name to needy Africans. Rachel is unhappy, reminds Finn that she is a vegan, and recommends that he stick to her list to avoid embarrassment, while pointedly mentioning earrings.|$|E

500|$|According to The Independents Holly Rubenstein, Kaleidoscope Dream is [...] "widely {{considered}} a leading example" [...] of alternative R; Miguel himself {{described it as}} [...] "avant soul". In the opinion of NPR's Frannie Kelley, the record combined R, pop, funk, rock and soul genres. Its music features sparse production, eccentric details, thick bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Allmusic's Andy Kellman found the album [...] "funkier and weirder" [...] than All <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You and observed an [...] "illusory atmosphere ... intensified by some unexpected touches". Maura Johnston said much of it [...] "sounds, as the title might suggest, fractal." [...] As an R album, The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski said, Kaleidoscope Dream deviated from genre conventions by minimizing the influence of hip hop; Jim DeRogatis believed it drew heavily on psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop. Music writers compared the album's style to Prince, Alex Macpherson of The Guardian perceives a [...] "headier aesthetic" [...] than on All <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Is</b> You, with [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "intimate experiments in Purple Rain-esque rock". Writing about the record for WNYC, Gretta Cohn claimed Miguel was [...] "redefining what contemporary R can be". Miguel said he [...] "definitely think it's an R record, though other people may not ... are so conditioned to expect certain things out of current R, and it's about following a formula. But R was once live music, it was psychedelic, it was rock, it was funk, and all these genres stem from soul music ... There would be no hip-hop or rock without R It was {{important for me to}} be true to what R is, and that is soulful." ...|$|E
