The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not {{explicitly}} try to integrate elves into Christian thought.

5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} be overturned by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>perspective</b> a redefinition of Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>perspective,</b> {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{research}} in {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) using resonant inductive coupling has demonstrated very high efficiencies (above 40 %) at large distances compared to the antenna dimensions, which has exponentially {{increased the number of}} potential applications of WPT. Since resonant inductive coupling is a very multidisciplinary field, different approaches have been proposed to predict the behaviour of these systems from physical theory of resonators, reflected load theory and the circuit point of view. However, the relation between these methods is still obscure. In this article, we compare the results of these models to find the efficiency of a Resonant Inductive Coupling WPT system under Steady-State sonditions and to analyze the relation between the optimal load values obtained <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>perspectives</b> and the ones obtained using impedance matching techniques...|$|R
