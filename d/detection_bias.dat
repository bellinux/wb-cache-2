40|$|Detecting causal {{associations}} in time series datasets {{is a key}} challenge for novel insights into complex dynamical systems such as the Earth system or the human brain. Interactions in high-dimensional dynamical systems often involve time-delays, nonlinearity, and strong autocorrelations. These present major challenges for causal discovery techniques such as Granger causality leading to low <b>detection</b> power, <b>biases,</b> and unreliable hypothesis tests. Here we introduce a reliable and fast method that outperforms current approaches in detection power and scales up to high-dimensional datasets. It overcomes <b>detection</b> <b>biases,</b> especially when strong autocorrelations are present, and allows ranking {{associations in}} large-scale analyses by their causal strength. We provide mathematical proofs, evaluate our method in extensive numerical experiments, and illustrate its capabilities in a large-scale analysis of the global surface-pressure system where we unravel spurious associations and find several potentially causal links {{that are difficult to}} detect with standard methods. The broadly applicable method promises to discover novel causal insights also in many other fields of science. Comment: 58 pages, 28 figure...|$|R

After initial projects to systematically map protein interactions in model organisms such as yeast, worm and fly, researchers have begun {{to focus on the}} mapping of the human interactome. To tackle this enormous challenge, different approaches have been proposed and pursued. While several large-scale human protein interaction maps have recently been published, their quality remains to be critically assessed. We present here a first comparative analysis of eight currently available large-scale maps with a total of over 10000 unique proteins and 57000 interactions included. They are based either on literature search, orthology or by yeast-two-hybrid assays. Comparison reveals only a small, but statistically significant overlap. More importantly, our analysis gives clear indications that all interaction maps suffer under selection and <b>detection</b> <b>biases.</b> These results have {{to be taken into account}} for future assembly of the human interactome. ...|$|R

These dynamical structures, including classical, resonant, and scattering subpopulations, have been predicted by large-scale numerical simulations of the migration of the giant planets during the early history of our Solar System. With the results from large Kuiper Belt surveys, we can begin statistically testing these simulation predictions to quantify the timing, mode, and distance of the giant planets’ migration in order to determine where the planets and planetesimal belts initially formed in our Solar System. The structure of the Kuiper Belt also places constraints on the history of stellar flybys and on possible undiscovered distant planets in the outer Solar System...|$|R
