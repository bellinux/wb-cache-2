This is about honesty and cruelty. <b>For</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> it was about undermining the justice system." [...] In the same article he writes that Gary Condit, a moderate Democratic congressman from California who had an extramarital affair with Chandra Levy prior to her disappearance and death, should be held to the same standard.|$|E
5000|$|<b>For</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Mr. Jordan's roles {{have been}} manifold: Golfing companion. Smoother of ruffled {{feathers}} (he put the president {{back in touch}} with Zoë Baird after the withdrawal of her nomination to be attorney general). Consoler in chief (after Mr. Clinton was defeated for re-election as governor in 1980, after the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr. in 1993). Conduit to the high and mighty (he took Mr. Clinton in 1991 to the Bilderberg conference in Germany, an exclusive annual retreat for politicians and businessmen). Go-between (he told Mike Espy he had to go as secretary of agriculture, helped win Warren Christopher a larger role as secretary of state and sounded out Gen. Colin L. Powell for a Cabinet job).|$|E

5000|$|She adds: [...] "Sexism is insidious, {{unconscious}} and affects {{women as well}} as men. Just because women didn't turn out in big enough numbers <b>for</b> <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> does not mean we should dismiss the troubling sexism and misogyny that marred the campaign... The fact so many women in America voted <b>for</b> <b>Mr</b> Trump over <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> is a get-out-of-jail-free card: female voters weren't bothered, so it can't be sexist. It can, and it is." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 2008 Presidential election's Democratic primary Hispanics and Latinos {{participated in}} larger numbers than before, with Hillary Clinton {{receiving}} {{most of the}} group's support. Pundits discussed whether {{a large percentage of}} Hispanics and Latinos would vote for an African-American candidate, in this case Barack Obama, Clinton's opponent. Hispanics/Latinos voted 2 to 1 <b>for</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton,</b> even among the younger demographic. In other groups, younger voters went overwhelmingly for Obama. Among Hispanics, 28% said race was involved in their decision, as opposed to 13% for (non-Hispanic) whites.|$|R
5000|$|Subodh Chandra, {{a lawyer}} in Ohio and Obama {{supporter}} {{filed a complaint with}} the Federal Election Commission, calling on them to open an investigation, shut down the organization and seek criminal penalties against its directors and donors. He said the new organization allows Mrs. Clinton's backers to [...] "cheat the system" [...] by paying for their own ads <b>for</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> even through they have already donated the maximum $2,300 allowed by law to her campaign. It took three years for the FEC to settle similar complaints lodged against independent political entities operating in the 2004 election.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times {{wrote that}} the stated aim of the book was to [...] "offer an {{intimate}} view {{of what it was}} like <b>for</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> to run as the first female presidential candidate from a major party in United States history, in an often vicious and turbulent campaign." [...] Her third memoir, following 2003's Living History and 2014's Hard Choices, advance publicity for the work said it would be her [...] "most personal" [...] yetand quoted from her words in the book's Introduction: “In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I’ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I’m letting my guard down.” Media outlets from the Associated Press to The Guardian to Politico framed Clinton's promise of a new level of candor as a major theme of the initial publicity surrounding the book. The work is also said to include some self-help ideas about how to get past highly unpleasant experiences. Assuming she does not run for office again, this will be the first book she has written while not either in a public position or seeking to run for one.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{adjectival}} {{phrase is}} sometimes {{used instead of}} adjective phrase. However, there is tendency to call a phrase an adjectival phrase {{in such a case}} where that phrase is functioning like an adjective phrase would, but does not contain an actual adjective. <b>For</b> example, in <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> is a man of wealth, the prepositional phrase of wealth modifies a man the way an adjective would, and it could be reworded with an adjective, e.g. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> is a wealthy man. Similarly, that boy is friendless (the adjective [...] "friendless" [...] modifies the noun [...] "boy") and That boy is without a friend (a prepositional phrase where [...] "without a friend" [...] modifies [...] "boy").|$|R
50|$|On January 19, Clinton {{visited the}} Arlington Cemetery {{to visit the}} graves of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. The visit was not on Clinton's schedule, and only {{a small group of}} reporters and photographers was allowed to witness the {{gathering}} from 150 yards away. After kneeling at the graveside for a few moments, <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Clinton</b> each placed a white rose on the grave of Robert Kennedy, who was shot June 5, 1968, while campaigning <b>for</b> the presidency. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Clinton</b> then walked alone to John F. Kennedy's grave and placed another white rose on the marker. He knelt for several seconds before the grave of the man who was shot on Nov. 22, 1963. Clinton had met President Kennedy briefly as a teenager in 1963, and credits that encounter with leading him to enter public service.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{bought a}} new outfit of clothes and a book on {{etiquette}} and made a dead set <b>for</b> <b>Mrs.</b> De <b>Clinton.</b> She was a fine-looking woman, cheerful and gay. At first, I almost had to hobble her {{to keep her from}} loping around at George's heels; but finally I got her so she seemed glad to go riding with me and sailing on the lake; and she seemed real hurt on the mornings when I forgot to send her a bunch of flowers. Still, I didn't like the way she looked at George, sometimes, {{out of the corner of}} her eye. George was having a fine time now, going with the whole bunch just as he pleased. Yes'm," [...] continued Bell, [...] "she certainly was a fine-looking woman at that time. She's changed some since, as you might have noticed at the supper table." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{arrived at}} the mortuary, a gay red and white building, which had been newly erected and consecrated by a duke with much festivity and rejoicing. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was sworn with the other jurymen, and with them {{repaired}} to see the bodies on which they were to sit. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was squeamish.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> as before, {{had gone}} out, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{did her best}} to {{entertain}} the two doctors. The specialist, who talked most incessantly himself, was extremely impatient of other people's conversation.|$|R
60|$|The morning came at {{last and}} found him feverish and parched, unable to move. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> sent <b>for</b> the doctor, a slow, {{cautious}} Scotchman, in whose wisdom <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> implicitly relied, since he always agreed with her own idea of her children's ailments. This prudent gentleman ventured to assert that <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> had caught cold and had something wrong with his lungs. Then, promising to send medicine and come again next day, went off on his rounds. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> grew worse; he became delirious. When his wife, smoothing his pillow, {{asked him how he}} felt, he looked at her with glassy eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{crossed her}} hands over her stomach and looked at her husband with self-satisfaction. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was awake, staring in front of him with wide-open, fixed eyes; various {{thoughts}} confusedly ran through his head.|$|R
60|$|The Clintons {{lived in}} the fifth house down in the Adonis Road, {{and the house was}} {{distinguishable}} from its fellows by the yellow curtains with which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> had furnished all the windows. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a woman of taste. Before marriage, the happy pair, accompanied by Mrs Clinton's mother, had gone house-hunting, and fixed on the Adonis Road, which was cheap, respectable and near the station. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> would dearly have liked a house on the right-hand side of the road, which had nooks and angles and curiously-shaped windows. But <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> was firm in his refusal, and his mother-in-law backed him up.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton,</b> in fact, became worse. He {{came home}} later and later every night, {{and his wife}} was disgusted {{at the state of}} uncleanness which his curious wanderings brought about. He refused to take the baths which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{prepared}} <b>for</b> him. He was more silent than ever, but when he spoke it was in biblical language; and always hovered on his lips the enigmatical smile, and his eyes always had the strange, disconcerting look. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> perseveringly made him take his medicine, but she lost faith in its power when, one night at twelve, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> brought home with him a very dirty, ragged man, who looked half-starved and smelt distinctly alcoholic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I never!' said <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton,</b> quite aghast; and as {{she walked}} by the flower girl, snorted at her and looked so savagely that the poor little maiden quite started. <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> walked very slowly, {{stopping}} {{now and then to}} look at a couple of women seated on a doorstep, or the children round an ice-cream stall. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> saw him pay a penny and give an ice to a little child who was looking with longing eyes at its more fortunate companions as they licked out the little glass cups. He remained quite a long while watching half a dozen young girls dancing to the music of a barrel organ, and again, to his wife's disgust, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> gave money.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> looked helplessly at her friend; {{she feared}} {{something}} was wrong, and she didn't {{know what to}} do. But the neighbour, with a significant look, pointed to the Daily Telegraph, which was lying on a chair. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> brightened up {{and took it to}} her husband.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my man,' he said, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> at last came in, 'what are you {{complaining}} of?... One moment,' he added, as <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{was about}} to reply. He opened his notebook {{and took out a}} stylographic pen. 'Now, I'm ready for you. What are you complaining of?' ...|$|R

60|$|On Sunday, <b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> put on Sunday clothes, {{and heading}} the little {{procession}} formed by <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{and the two}} children, went to church, carrying in his hand a prayer book and a hymn book. After dinner he took a little walk with his wife along the neighbouring roads, avenues and crescents, examining {{the exterior of the}} houses, stopping now and then to look at a garden or a well-kept house, or trying to get a peep into some room. <b>Mr</b> and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> criticised as they went along, comparing the window curtains, blaming a door in want of paint, praising a well-whitened doorstep....|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{looked at}} him; {{he was quite}} calm, and smilingly {{returned}} her glance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In my bed!' screamed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Clinton.</b> 'Not if I know it! 'Ere, you,' she said, {{addressing}} the man, and pushing past her husband. 'Out you get!

60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{reached his}} office at a quarter to ten, except when the train, by some mistake, arrived up to time, {{when he arrived at}} nine-thirty precisely.
