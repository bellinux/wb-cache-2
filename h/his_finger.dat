5|$|Another {{story has}} St Moluag and St Mulhac {{conducting}} a boat race across the Lynn of Lorn {{with the first}} to land on Lismore having the right to found a monastery there. Realising {{that he was going}} to lose, Moluag cut off <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and threw it ashore north of the broch of Tirefour, enabling him to claim victory.|$|E
5|$|Medieval folk traditions enumerate the pestilences and misfortunes which befell Lalli {{after his}} slaying of the bishop. His hair and scalp {{are said to}} have fallen out as he took off the bishop's cap, taken as a trophy. Removing the bishop's ring from <b>his</b> <b>finger,</b> just bones remained. Eventually he ran into a lake and drowned himself.|$|E
60|$|She {{held up her}} hand. The soft tips of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> {{brushed the}} palm of her glove as he placed the money within it. She {{wondered}} why <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> should have touched her.|$|R
60|$|The young Cantab put <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> on the assistant's upper arm, {{then with}} his other hand on his wrist, he bent the forearm sharply, and felt the biceps, as round and hard as a cricket-ball, spring up under <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|R

5|$|While a {{high school}} student working {{part-time}} at an Arby's restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right middle finger on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. <b>His</b> <b>finger</b> was partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.|$|E
5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking {{through a hole in}} a door. <b>His</b> <b>finger</b> is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E

60|$|At this {{exposure}} of his plot to escape, Paul was startled out of impassivity. He rubbed <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> <b>His</b> hands twitched.|$|R
5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than <b>his</b> <b>finger,</b> nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|England {{started their}} second innings with {{a deficit of}} 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the {{premature}} {{end of the second}} day due to bad light. The following morning, they made slow and steady progress as Johnston bowled <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. The four men in the off side ring had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were few scares.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E

5000|$|Lucker's {{signature}} black bars {{that he has}} on each of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> were cover-ups. The original tattoos he {{had displayed}} across <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> was [...] "FORXEVER", a common word used within the straight edge community. In 2007 these tattoos were covered with black bars because he had renounced his straight-edge lifestyle.|$|R

5|$|Kinslow {{made his}} MLB debut with the Washington Nationals of the NL on June4, 1886 as their {{starting}} catcher. He injured <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> {{in the third}} inning trying to catch a bad pitch thrown by Bob Barr, and had to leave the game. On June15, he was again injured by a Barr pitch, and forced to leave the game with a dislocated finger. He played in three games for the Nationals in 1886, collecting two hits in eight at bats.|$|E
5|$|Luongo first {{appeared}} with the Canadian men's {{team at the}} 2001 World Championships in Germany. He played backup to Fred Brathwaite of the Calgary Flames before injuring <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> during {{the first game of}} the qualification round against Switzerland on May 4, 2001. Luongo returned home to Florida, as Vancouver Canucks goaltender Dan Cloutier replaced him, ending his tournament debut with a 1.44 GAA in two games. Canada finished in fifth place.|$|E
5|$|While we did {{not always}} {{see eye to eye}} on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> on the {{existence}} and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.|$|E

5|$|Whitlock {{is the son}} of Raymond and Genny Whitlock. Whitlock was {{originally}} going to be named Sergio Nehemiah Whitlock, but his grandmother did not like the name. His father, who worked for Yellow Pages, opened up a phone book to a random page and put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> down to select his name, ending up with Nikita. Whitlock graduated from Wake Forest with a Health and Exercise Science major.|$|E
5|$|Because of Bangladesh's meagre batting performance, the Australian innings began {{before lunch}} and opener Adam Gilchrist scored a {{typically}} quick-fire 18 {{before he was}} caught behind from Mortaza. Hayden (46) and Ponting then got valuable batting practice as they shared a 74-run partnership. Ponting was eventually bowled by Rafique for 29. Damien Martyn's stay at the crease was cut short, in his first International match since breaking <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he faced just one ball before Australia won by eight wickets with more than 27 overs to spare. Along with the wicket of Ponting, Rafique conceded just seven runs in five overs.|$|E
5|$|By 1883, Gilligan {{had become}} the Grays {{starting}} catcher. Despite breaking <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and missing two weeks in May, Gilligan led the National League in assists as a catcher, while his team {{finished third in the}} NL. He continued his tenure with the Grays the following season. Gilligan played in a career-high 82 games, while also recording career highs in RBI (38), strikeouts (41), and on-base percentage (.325) and leading MLB in defensive games as a catcher (81). After finishing {{at the top of the}} NL, the Grays played in the 1884 World Series against the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. Gilligan went 4–for–9 over the three-game series, with the Grays defeating the Metropolitans three games to none.|$|E

5|$|Clippard began 2007 {{with the}} Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. He was 3–2 with a 2.72 ERA {{in his first}} eight starts, {{striking}} out 41 in 39 2/3 innings but allowing 40 hits and 17 walks. Though the Yankees experienced injuries in the starting rotation, they called on Matt DeSalvo and Chase Wright before Clippard. When Darrell Rasner broke <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in May, Clippard was called up to New York. He became the seventh rookie to start a game for the 2007 New York Yankees, following Hughes, DeSalvo, Rasner, Wright, Kei Igawa and Jeff Karstens.|$|E
5|$|Hansen scored {{his first}} NHL regular season point on 11 October 2008, an assist on a Ryan Kesler goal against the Calgary Flames. He scored his first NHL goal two games later against goaltender Chris Osgood in a 4–3 win against the Detroit Red Wings. Midway through the season, Hansen was briefly {{sent back to}} Manitoba for the Canucks to make room on the roster for the {{recently}} acquired Mats Sundin. He was, however, recalled within three days. In late-February, he broke <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and was sidelined for 14 games. He completed the season with 21 points in 55 games, ranking 26th in scoring among NHL rookies. In the off-season, he became a restricted free agent before re-signing with the Canucks to a one-year, two-way contract worth a reported US$550,000.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{ten people}} were {{admitted}} to hospital with radiation sickness: the four scrap collectors, the two scrapyard employees, the scrapyard owner, her husband, her mother, and her maid. Of these, four people (those {{working at the}} scrapyard) were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 gray (Gy). All patients were ultimately referred to Rajavithi Hospital, where they received inpatient care. All {{but one of the}} patients developed agranulocytosis or bicytopenia (depletion of white blood cells and/or platelets). Several also developed burns, and one (the first scrap collector) had to have <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> amputated. Three patients (the two scrapyard workers and the owner's husband) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and sepsis, all within two months of exposure.|$|E
