5000|$|Harrington Emerson (August 2, 1853 - September 2, 1931) was an American <b>efficiency</b> <b>engineer</b> and {{business}} theorist, {{who founded the}} management consultancy firm Emerson Institute in New York City in 1900. Known for his pioneering contributions to scientific management, Emerson may have done {{more than anyone else}} to popularize the topic: his public testimony in 1910 to the Interstate Commerce Commission that the railroads could save $1,000,000 a day started a nationwide interest in the subject of [...] "efficiency".|$|E
50|$|Mattessich (2007) added {{about the}} {{spin-off}} of Whitmore's work:Whitmore (1908) suggested idle capacity costs {{ought to be}} charged and written off in a separate account. Furthermore, he contributed to the standard costing notions of A. Hamilton Church (1901-02, 1908, 1910, 1917) who himself advocated the use of 'production centres'. The American <b>efficiency</b> <b>engineer</b> Emerson's (1908-09) classic on standard costing employed the standard hour as the 'real standard unit cost', as well as using a single overall variance between actual and standard costs.|$|E
50|$|The story {{opens with}} typical {{days in the}} lives of a family in the 1920s, with 12 {{children}} and an <b>efficiency</b> <b>engineer</b> as the parent. This includes scenes where Frank employs his unorthodox teaching methods on his children, and classic clashes between conservative parents and their children's desire for more freedom (flashier clothing, make up, etc.). Frank takes every opportunity to study motion and increase efficiency, and even films his children's tonsillectomies {{to see if there are}} ways to streamline the operation.|$|E
5000|$|This {{variant of}} the {{phenomenon}} is named for the Hawthorne Works, a factory built by Western Electric, where <b>efficiency</b> <b>engineers</b> in the 1920s and 1930s were trying to determine if improved working conditions such as better lighting improved the performance of production workers. The engineers noted that when they provided better working conditions in the production line, efficiency increased. But when the engineers returned the production line to its original conditions and observed the workers, their efficiency increased again. The engineers determined that it was merely the observation of the factory workers, not {{the changes in the}} conditions in production line, that increased the measured efficiency. The term [...] "Hawthorne effect" [...] was coined in 1955 by Henry A. Landsberger. Many researchers believe that the evidence that a Hawthorne effect exists has been exaggerated.|$|R

40|$|Using {{telephone}} interviews with 100 welfare-to-work program managers in North Carolina, {{we examine the}} ways in which manager identities shape the perceptions of challenges and barriers to achieving client self-sufficiency and {{the ways in which}} these managers would make changes to the welfare-to-work program. Drawing from Watkins-Hayes (2009) and (author citation, we find that manager identities are distinct in the ways in which they talk about the program and clients. Social work managers focus on challenges and barriers that are out of the control of the client, such as the economy, {{and the ways in which}} they can help clients. <b>Efficiency</b> <b>engineers</b> stress the importance of agency standards and meeting benchmarks to make clients self-sufficient. Conflicted managers however are caught between helping clients and policing them for not meeting agency standards, similar to Lipsky's street-level bureaucrats.

40|$|This work investigates {{mathematical}} {{details and}} computational aspects of Metropolis-Hastings reptation quantum Monte Carlo and its variants, {{in addition to}} the Bounce method and its variants. The issues that concern us include the sensitivity of these algorithms' target densities to the position of the trial electron density along the reptile, time-reversal symmetry of the propagators, and the length of the reptile. We calculate the ground-state energy and one-electron properties of LiH at its equilibrium geometry for all these algorithms. The importance sampling is performed with a single-determinant large Slater-type orbitals (STO) basis set. The computer codes were written to exploit the <b>efficiencies</b> <b>engineered</b> into modern, high-performance computing software. Using the Bounce method in the calculation of non-energy-related properties, those represented by operators that do not commute with the Hamiltonian, is a novel work. We found that the unmodified Bounce gives good ground state energy and very good one-electron properties. We attribute this to its favourable time-reversal symmetry in its target density's Green's functions. Breaking this symmetry gives poorer results. Use of a short reptile in the Bounce method does not alter the quality of the results. This suggests that in future applications one can use a shorter reptile to cut down the computational time dramatically...|$|R

50|$|Emerson {{was born}} in Trenton, New Jersey to Edwin Emerson, a Professor of Political science, and Mary Louisa (Ingham) Emerson, {{daughter}} of Samuel D. Ingham, a U.S. Congressman and U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Andrew Jackson. Emerson attended private schools in Europe, and from 1872 to 1875 studied engineering at the Technical University Munich.After returning to the United States in 1876, Emerson was appointed as Professor of Modern Languages at the University of Nebraska, where he was dismissed in 1882 because of his progressive educational ideas. In the years after, Harrington had several jobs, including a frontier banker, land speculator, tax agent, troubleshooter, lecturer, and educator. In 1893, he joined William Jennings Bryan's campaign for the presidential election of 1896, which created the foundation for his career as <b>efficiency</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mary Louise Harrington Emerson {{was born}} in 1901 in Philadelphia, the {{youngest}} of three daughters of Mary Crawford Suplee and Harrington Emerson (1853-1931). Harrington Emerson was an <b>efficiency</b> <b>engineer</b> who established the Emerson Institute in New York City in 1900. Prior to 1900, Harrington had several careers, including a frontier banker, land speculator, tax agent and troubleshooter for the Union Pacific and Burlington and Missouri railroads, lecturer, and educator. Louise Emerson’s great grandfather, Samuel D. Ingham (on her mother’s side), was Secretary of the Treasury under Andrew Jackson, the U.S.‘s seventh President (1829-1837). Emerson graduated from Barnard College in 1922, followed by three years of study at the Art Students League New York. During her studies at the League, she was particularly influenced by one of her teachers, Kenneth Hayes Miller (1876-1952). He was an outstanding American Scene artist, but also made quite a mark teaching in the 1920s and 1930s, his other students included Reginald Marsh, Edward Hopper and Isabel Bishop. She spent the summers of 1923 and 1924 at the The Ecoles d'Art Américaines at Fountainebleu, France, studying fresco painting.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Since {{biological}} organisms {{have evolved}} in a noisy environment, {{it is likely}} that they have intricate mechanisms in place to deal with noise, and even to exploit it. Engineers can learn much from biology, and to this end we briefly review some methods in which noise can be used in systems in an advantageous way. Among these methods are: stochastic search, encoding and transmission of information by noise, stochastic resonance, fluctuation-enhanced sensing, and synchronization through noise. This paper gives some examples in which these mechanisms are expected to improve the <b>efficiency</b> of <b>engineered</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|This study {{traces the}} {{influence}} of scientific management {{on the development of}} modem management methods in Britain {{from the end of the}} 19 th century to the outbreak of the second world war. It is concerned with both the organisation of work and the management of the worker, with employers' labour strategies and worker and trade union responses. The Introduction discusses key concepts like Taylorism, Fordism and mass production; chapter one identifies technical and managerial changes taking place at the turn of the century and the reception Taylorism received in Britain; chapter 2 is mainly concerned with premium bonus schemes and the impact of the first world war; chapter 3 analyses the growth of new management functions and roles, particularly production engineering between the wars; chapter 4 discusses the impact of mechanisation and deskilling on workers in the engineering industry; chapter 5 traces the growth of piecework schemes and time study, the significance of the Bedaux system, and the impact of worker resistance. A postscript and a conclusion relate these themes to the post second world war history of work study and to contemporary debates about flexible specialisation and post-Fordism. Three key issues are addressed the meaning of scientific management, the extent to which employers adopted scientific management practices, its impact on workers and the effect of worker resistance. It is argued that, if scientific management is located historically, it is seen to be concerned with the management of production as well as the management of the worker; with production engineering, progress and planning departments, as well as time and motion study and incentive payment schemes. As such it is not reducible to any particular form of Taylorist practice. Employers were slow to develop the new management methods. Slow adaptation to change was part of the more general problem of relative economic decline. But both were uneven. British employers were reluctant to abandon tools and techniques which still made money but some did, and more followed. Taylorism was more positively received in Britain than has been suggested and was widely accepted by the end of the first world war. Its impact on managerial practice can be traced in the inter-war period in the development of production engineering and more rigorous payment systems, including those inspired by Bedaux. A 'deskilling dynamic', centred on a new split between mental and manual labour, was fatally undermining both craftsman and foreman in the engineering industry, though it owed more to the jig and tool designer, and more broadly, the management of mechanisation than the <b>efficiency</b> <b>engineer.</b> But changes in the labour process also affected women and semi and unskilled men and they were centrally involved in shop floor resistance to 'speed-up'. Resistance modified but could not prevent the restructuring of the labour process consequent upon scientific management...|$|E

40|$|Naturalization and {{universal}} application of {{concepts such as}} ‘efficiency’ and ‘productivity’ by policy makers and water experts in the water sector leads water managers and water users to internalize these norms. As we show in this exploratory paper, the effects could be threefold: first, evidence suggests that ‘efficiency’ discourses may justify policies and projects that deprive smallholders of water use rights; second, expert-driven water policy and project notions of efficiency tend to interfere with existing local water management practices and may harm livelihood and production strategies, and third, water users may come to blame themselves for underachieving according to the norms that are established in the dominant power-knowledge structures. This article deals with three mutually connected water policy arenas where maximization of water productivity and efficiency is fiercely promoted: technical water use <b>efficiency</b> (the <b>engineer's</b> realm), allocation <b>efficiency</b> (the economist's realm) at national levels, and the arena of international trade, where allocation efficiency is sought through virtual water flows embedded in agricultural commodities trade.
