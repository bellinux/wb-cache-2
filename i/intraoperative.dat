5|$|There {{are five}} methods {{that can be}} used to deliver breast brachytherapy: Interstitial breast brachytherapy, Intracavitary breast brachytherapy, <b>Intraoperative</b> {{radiation}} therapy, Permanent Breast Seed Implantation and non-invasive breast brachytherapy using mammography for target localization and an HDR source.|$|E
5|$|<b>Intraoperative</b> {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) delivers radiation {{at the same}} time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision.|$|E
25|$|Early {{prosthetic}} valve endocarditis {{is usually}} due to <b>intraoperative</b> contamination or a postoperative bacterial contamination {{which is usually}} nosocomial in nature.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesiology {{residency}} {{training in}} the U.S. encompasses the full scope of perioperative medicine, including pre-operative medical evaluation, management of pre-existing disease in the surgical patient, <b>intraoperative</b> life support, <b>intraoperative</b> pain control, post-operative recovery, intensive care medicine, and chronic and acute pain management. After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of sub-specialty training {{in areas such as}} pain management, sleep medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, pediatric anesthesiology, neuroanesthesiology, regional anesthesiology/ambulatory anesthesiology, obstetric anesthesiology, or critical care medicine.|$|E
25|$|Intradural disc {{herniation}} {{is a rare}} form of disc herniation with an {{incidence of}} 0.2-2.2%. Preoperative imaging can be helpful, but <b>intraoperative</b> findings are required to confirm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intraoperative</b> blood salvage (autologous) or cell-saver scavenging, {{a method}} of picking up blood that has spilled from the circulatory system into an open wound, {{cleaning}} and re-infusing it.|$|E
25|$|Cardiothoracic {{anesthesiology}} is a subspeciality of {{the medical}} practice of anesthesiology devoted to the preoperative, <b>intraoperative,</b> and postoperative care of adult and pediatric patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and related invasive procedures.|$|E
25|$|Some {{surgeons}} do {{not only}} verify {{the placement of}} complex endografts intraoperatively, they also use their angiography system and the applications it offers for planning the procedure. As anatomy changes between a preoperative CT and <b>intraoperative</b> fluoroscopy because of patient positioning and the insertion of stiff material, a much more precise planning is possible if the surgeon performs an <b>intraoperative</b> rotational angiography, takes an automatic segmentation of the aorta, places markers for the renal arteries and other landmarks in 3D and then overlays the contours on 2D fluoroscopy. This guidance is updated with any change in C-Arm angulation/position or table position.|$|E
25|$|Complications due to LASIK {{have been}} {{classified}} {{as those that}} occur due to preoperative, <b>intraoperative,</b> early postoperative, or late postoperative sources: According to the UK National Health Service complications occur in fewer than 5% of cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} post {{traumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) may arise after <b>intraoperative</b> awareness, causing {{the patient to}} require counseling for an extended period. Sometimes neurological and brain injuries caused during the operation are wrongly diagnosed and described as PTSD.|$|E
25|$|New {{technology}} has also allowed more precise delivery of radiotherapy in a portable fashion mdash& {{for example in}} the operating theatre. Targeted <b>intraoperative</b> radiotherapy (TARGIT) is a method of delivering therapeutic radiation from within the breast using a portable X-ray generator called Intrabeam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intraoperative</b> {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, {{such as a}} cancer tumor, while the area is exposed during surgery. The goal of IORT is to improve local tumor control and survival rates for patients with different types of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Though imaging {{has been}} a {{standard}} part of the OR {{for a long time}} in the form of mobile C-Arms, ultrasound and endoscopy, these new minimally-invasive procedures require imaging techniques that can visualize smaller body parts such as thin vessels in the heart muscle and can be facilitated through <b>intraoperative</b> 3D imaging.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesiologists provide {{medical care}} to {{patients}} in many different ways. During preoperative evaluation, {{in consultation with the}} surgical team, they create an anesthetic plan tailored for each individual patient taking into consideration the patient’s medical history and the type of surgical procedure planned. This may include invasive monitoring (TEE, CVP, arterial pressure), neuraxial nerve blocks (spinal or epidural), peripheral nerve blocks (selectively anesthetizing a specific part of the body), and/or various levels of sedation including reversible unconsciousness known as “General Anesthesia.” Anesthesiologists are acute care physicians and as such often provide intensive care techniques as they are the experts of airway management, <b>intraoperative</b> life support and provision of pain control, <b>intraoperative</b> diagnostic stabilization, and proper postoperative management of patients. An anesthesiologist's scope of practice also involves in-hospital and pre-hospital emergencies, work within intensive care units, acute pain units, and chronic pain consultations.|$|E
25|$|The double {{incision}} {{surgery and}} {{minimally invasive surgery}} seeks to reduce soft tissue damage through reducing {{the size of the}} incision. However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures is significantly impaired. This can result in unintended fractures and soft tissue injury. Surgeons using these approaches are advised to use <b>intraoperative</b> x-ray fluoroscopy or computer guidance systems.|$|E
25|$|Development in polymer {{chemistry}} {{has allowed}} introduction of newer biocompatible material such as porous polyethylene (PP) {{to be introduced}} into the ﬁeld of orbital implant surgery. Porous polyethylene enucleation implants have been used since at least 1989. It is available in dozens of prefabricated spherical and non-spherical shapes and in different sizes or plain blocks for individualized <b>intraoperative</b> customizing.|$|E
25|$|A {{specialized}} growing {{subset of}} interventional MRI is <b>intraoperative</b> MRI, in which doctors use an MRI in surgery. Some specialized MRI systems allow imaging concurrent with the surgical procedure. More typical, however, {{is that the}} surgical procedure is temporarily interrupted so that MRI can verify {{the success of the}} procedure or guide subsequent surgical work.|$|E
25|$|Patients with cardiothoracic {{pathology}} who {{present for}} non-cardiothoracic surgery are {{at increased risk}} for serious perioperative complications. Cardiothoracic anesthesiologists are often consulted by their colleagues to provide expert management during <b>intraoperative</b> hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest by evaluating heart function with the aid of TEE and placement of other invasive advanced hemodynamic monitors, such as pacing swans.|$|E
25|$|The most {{traumatic}} case of anesthesia {{awareness is}} full consciousness during surgery {{with pain and}} explicit recall of <b>intraoperative</b> events. In less severe cases, patients may have only poor recollection of conversations, events, pain, pressure, or difficulty in breathing. Some cases of difficulty in breathing are caused by intubation errors and/or problems with the ventilator and a patient might be suffocating.|$|E
25|$|Complications and {{injuries}} {{related to the}} use of a surgical tourniquet include: nerve injury, post-tourniquet syndrome, <b>intraoperative</b> bleeding, compartment pressure syndrome, pressure sores and chemical burns, digital necrosis, toxic reactions, thrombosis and other complications such as tourniquet pain, thermal damage to tissues, hyperthermia, Rhabdomyolysis and metabolic changes. Risk of complications {{and injuries}} can be minimized by taking all reasonable preventative measures when using surgical tourniquets.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{is often}} the first medical imaging test {{performed}} when gallbladder disease such as gallstones are suspected. An abdominal X-ray or CT scan is another form of imaging {{that may be used}} to examine the gallbladder and surrounding organs. Other imaging options include MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), ERCP and percutaneous or <b>intraoperative</b> cholangiography. A cholescintigraphy scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder.|$|E
25|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping (CSM) {{is considered}} {{the gold standard for}} mapping functional regions of the brain to create a presurgical plan that maximizes the patient's functional outcome. The history of beneficial outcomes and the amount of information already established about the CSM technique makes it advantageous in clinical and research applications. However, because it has the drawback of being an <b>intraoperative</b> technique, there is growing debate about its status as the preferred method. Instead, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a new procedure that does not carry the same amount of surgical risk, is being considered.|$|E
25|$|Three-dimensional {{echocardiography}} (also {{known as}} four-dimensional echocardiography when {{the picture is}} moving) is now possible, using a matrix array ultrasound probe and an appropriate processing system. This enables detailed anatomical assessment of cardiac pathology, particularly valvular defects, and cardiomyopathies. The ability to slice the virtual heart in infinite planes in an anatomically appropriate manner and to reconstruct three-dimensional images of anatomic structures make it unique for {{the understanding of the}} congenitally malformed heart. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography can be used to guide the location of bioptomes during right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, placement of catheter-delivered valvular devices, and in many other <b>intraoperative</b> assessments.|$|E
25|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that biofilms are present on the removed tissue of 80% of patients undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis. The patients with biofilms were shown to have been denuded of cilia and goblet cells, unlike the controls without biofilms who had normal cilia and goblet cell morphology. Biofilms were also found on samples from two of 10 healthy controls mentioned. The species of bacteria from <b>intraoperative</b> cultures did not correspond to the bacteria species in the biofilm on the respective patient's tissue. In other words, the cultures were negative though the bacteria were present. New staining techniques are being developed to differentiate bacterial cells growing in living animals, e.g. from tissues with allergy-inflammations.|$|E
25|$|The A. Vassiliadis Pavilion for Advanced Surgery has 14 {{operating}} rooms of 650 sq ft each. It occupies {{the second and}} third floors of the medical center and is named for Carol Vassiliadis' $8.5 million gift on behalf of her deceased husband Alkiviadis. The pavilion is staffed by 200 surgeons and provides technology to perform surgeries not possible elsewhere in the county. These include minimally invasive surgeries to treat cancer and obesity; microsurgeries to restore voice, hearing, and facial function; MRI-guided gene therapy for brain cancer; heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for abdominal cancer; spine and joint reconstruction; and robotic surgery for several cancers. The technologies at work include the region's only four <b>intraoperative</b> MRI machines, which allow real-time imaging of tumors and gene therapies during surgery to ensure complete treatment, as well as the nation's only Restriction Spectrum Imaging technology, which color code brain fibers to better plan for complex surgeries in advance. The area also includes three Intensive Care Units with 36 private rooms.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the use of}} extraoperative and <b>intraoperative</b> ECoG in resectioning surgery {{has been}} an {{accepted}} clinical practice for several decades, {{recent studies have shown}} that the usefulness of this technique may vary based on the type of epilepsy a patient exhibits. [...] Kuruvilla and Flink reported that while <b>intraoperative</b> ECoG plays a critical role in tailored temporal lobectomies, in multiple subpial transections (MST), and in the removal of malformations of cortical development (MCDs), it has been found impractical in standard resection of medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). A study performed by Wennberg, Quesney, and Rasmussen demonstrated the presurgical significance of ECoG in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) cases.|$|E
