5|$|As Grant {{continued}} to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led {{a group to}} meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg reached Ragusa on 24 August 1461 {{along with}} the Pal Engjëlli, the Archbishop of Durrës. His men stayed on the ships {{anchored}} in the harbor while {{he went into the}} city. Due to papal pressure, the Ragusans had reconsidered Skanderbeg's requests. His fame was visible when <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the city-gates and the population poured into the streets to see him. He had been greeted with a ceremony and a tour of the city inspecting its walls and weaponry. He then received the financial sum he had come for. His men were also supplied with food for their coming campaign. His popularity allowed him to be well-kept by the Ragusans where the largest Albanian community outside of Albania was present. On 29 August 1461, Skanderbeg set off for Apulia, but a storm forced him to anchor off a Dalmatian island. On 3 September 1461, Skanderbeg finally reached Barletta.|$|E
5|$|The journalists quickly {{decided they}} needed expert advice on {{ballistics}} and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, GC, a retired British Army {{officer who had}} served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault {{on the day of the}} shootings, after which <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.|$|E

In this scene a large chandelier can be seen, continuing the theme from the cover art of the single. There are also a few shots of the band playing the song as a group intercut with the [...] "dramatic" [...] scenes.|$|R
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E
25|$|In his {{campaign}} against the Democratic candidate, former District Attorney (and later two-term Pennsylvania Governor) Edward G. Rendell, Rizzo was expected to again employ hardball tactics. On the Friday before his death, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the largely black 52nd Street neighborhood in West Philadelphia with community leaders. But on July 16, 1991, he suffered a massive heart attack while campaigning for the general election. He was pronounced dead at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital at 2:12p.m. EDT.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door. He removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He walked across the street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} {{continued to}} escalate as a superior {{court ruled that}} neither Alonzo or Robertson should be seated until situation was resolved. They then forwarded {{the case to the}} Indiana Supreme Court who ruled in favor of Robertson. On the morning of February 24, Robertson entered the Senate chamber to take his seat, but as soon as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the door, he was attacked by several Democratic Senators who rushed him and beat him to the floor. The Senate leader ordered him removed from the chamber by guards, who then locked him out. The Republicans immediately went wild, attacking their nearest Democrat. The fight continued for several minutes until one Democrat pulled a gun and fired it into the ceiling threatening to start killing Republicans, ending the fight but making the rest of the building aware of it. The brawl soon spread to the House of Representatives and throughout the building as Republicans began to attack Democrats. Unlike the Senate, the rest of the building had a strong Republican majority, and the Democrats were soon overwhelmed. Six-hundred Republicans then beat down the door of the Senate Chamber and dragged out the Democratic Senators, threatening to kill them. Gray ordered police and other officials to break up the fight, which ended after nearly a full four hours of fighting.|$|E
500|$|The ACLU defended Sydney Street, who {{was arrested}} for burning an American flag to protest the {{reported}} assassination of civil rights leader James Meredith. In the Street v. New York decision, the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was constitutionally protected form of expression. The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, {{who was arrested}} for wearing a jacket with the words [...] "fuck the draft" [...] on its back, while <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in Cohen v. California, held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey {{the intensity of the}} message.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{was known}} by various nicknames during his {{basketball}} playing career. He hated {{the ones that}} called attention to his height such as [...] "Goliath" [...] and [...] "Wilt the Stilt", which was coined during his high school days by a Philadelphia sportswriter. He preferred [...] "The Big Dipper", which was inspired by his friends who saw him dip his head as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> doorways. After his basketball career ended, Chamberlain played volleyball in the short-lived International Volleyball Association, was president of this organization, and is enshrined in the IVA Hall of Fame for his contributions. Chamberlain was also a successful businessman, authored several books, and appeared in the movie Conan the Destroyer.

Eminem's final shoot before wrapping up was a mirror scene, which included many glass mirrors, and a fake one among them, through which {{he would have to}} break through. On May30,2010, Eminem confirmed the video's release date in a Twitter message: [...] "For those 'patiently waiting,' the NOT AFRAID video will premier Saturday 6/5. Details later..." [...] The day before the video's premiere, a teaser trailer was uploaded onto video sharing site YouTube, which combines many clips from the full video. The music video was uploaded on video website VEVO on June5,2010 at 11:30amET. VEVO stylized their logo with the E reversed, similar to Eminem's logo. On June7, the television premiere took place on MTV and VH1, and the former featured a primetime encore the day after.|$|E
500|$|The {{veterans}} made {{camp in the}} Anacostia flats {{while they}} awaited the congressional decision {{on whether or not}} to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to do anything that would cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a [...] "Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican".|$|E
500|$|The {{beauty of}} his Villa des Fleurs {{home and the}} warm {{reception}} he received in French Algeria pleased Rainilaiarivony and contributed to a positive impression of his new life in Algiers. He quickly developed an excellent reputation among the local high society, who perceived him as a kind, intelligent, generous and charming figure. The Governor-General of French Algeria regularly invited him to diplomatic balls and social events where Rainilaiarivony danced with the enthusiasm and endurance of a much younger man. When not busy with diverse social engagements, Rainilaiarivony avidly read the newspaper and corresponded with contacts in Madagascar. As an insurrection in Madagascar emerged against French rule, {{the former prime minister}} wrote a letter published in a Malagasy newspaper on 5 July 1896 that condemned the participants as ungrateful for the benefits that contact with the French would bring to the island. His last outing in Algiers was on 14 July 1896 to watch the Bastille Day fireworks show. As <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the streets to join other spectators in his party, he was greeted with cheers and calls of [...] "Vive le Ministre!" [...] ("Long live the Minister!") from admiring onlookers.|$|E

500|$|Minority Report's {{world premiere}} {{took place in}} New York City on June 19, 2002. An online [...] "popcorn cam" [...] {{broadcast}} live from inside the premiere. Cruise attended the London premiere the following week, and mingled with thousands of adoring fans as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the city's Leicester Square. It debuted at {{first place in the}} U.S. box office, collecting $35.677 million in its opening weekend. Forbes considered those numbers below expectations, as they gave the film a small edge over Lilo & Stitch, which debuted in second place ($35.260 million). Lilo & Stitch sold more tickets, but since much of the film's attendees were children, its average ticket price was much lower. The movie opened {{at the top of the}} box office in numerous foreign markets; it made $6.7 million in 780 locations in Germany its opening weekend, and accounted for 35% of France's total box office weekend office gross when it collected $5 million in 700 theaters. In Great Britain, Minority Report made $36.9 million in its first three days, in Italy, $6.2 million in its first ten, in Belgium, $815,000 in its 75 location opening weekend, and in Switzerland, $405,000 in an 80 theater opening weekend. The BBC felt the film's UK performance was [...] "buoyed by Cruise's charm offensive at last week's London premiere." [...] Minority Report made a total of $132 million in the United States and $226.3 million overseas.|$|E
500|$|On June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported [...] {{from the}} Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He had elected {{to serve as}} his own attorney, and as such, was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles. During a recess he asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case. Concealed behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped from the second story, spraining his right ankle as he landed. After shedding an outer layer of clothing <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked southward onto Aspen Mountain. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle. The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of Crested Butte, but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, he broke into a camping trailer on Maroon Lake, [...] south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; but instead of continuing southward, he walked back north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way. Three days later, he stole a car {{at the edge of}} Aspen Golf Course. Cold, sleep-deprived, and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days. In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Caryn Campbell's body (as his own attorney, Bundy had rights of discovery), indicating that his escape was not a spontaneous act, but had been planned.|$|E
