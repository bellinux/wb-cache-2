25|$|According to {{producer}} Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> {{was led by}} Warren Beatty, {{whose own}} picture Heaven Can Wait had multiple nominations. Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: Julie Christie, serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted {{a friend of his}} in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter.</b> Fonda replied she had not seen the film, and to this day she still has not.|$|R
2500|$|As the Oscars drew near, the {{backlash}} against The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> gathered strength. When the limos {{pulled up to}} the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on April 9, 1979, they were met by demonstrators, mostly from the Los Angeles chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. The demonstrators waved placards covered with slogans that read [...] "No Oscars for racism" [...] and [...] "The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> a bloody lie" [...] and thrust pamphlets berating <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> into long lines of limousine windows. Washburn, nominated for Best Original Screenplay, claims his limousine was pelted with stones. According to Variety, [...] "Police and The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunter</b> protesters clashed in a brief but bloody battle that resulted in 13 arrests." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} plan of {{the city}} was designed by Dutch colonist, Cornelis Jansz. Plockhoy, the designer of this new settlement, laid a 25-30m wide main street (on today’s Minquan Rd Sec. 2) across the settlement and radial roads than ran deep into agricultural developments [...] The Han Chinese settlement “Heliaogang Jie” (today’s Zhongyi Rd) later crossed the main street of Provintia and formed the so-called Shizi Dajie (十字大街) or The Great Cross Street. With the fall of the Ming dynasty, new migrants flooded into the settlement. Chinese population boomed from 5,000 to 35,000 between 1640 and 1661. As a result, farmers, <b>deer</b> <b>hunters,</b> traders and craftsmen each formed a colony on the cross street.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the onset}} of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Emperor Meiji officially ended Japan's long-standing {{isolationism}} through the Charter Oath, and sought to modernize Japan's agriculture by replacing its dependence on rice farming with American-style ranching. Ohio rancher Edwin Dun was hired as a scientific adviser in 1873 for the Kaitakushi (Hokkaido Development Agency), and began promoting ranching with state-run experimental farms. As wolf predation was inhibiting the propagation of horses in southeastern Hokkaidō and allegedly causing hardship to Ainu <b>deer</b> <b>hunters,</b> the Meiji government declared wolves as [...] "noxious animals" [...] (yūgai dōbutsu), entrusting Dun to oversee the animals' extermination. Dun began his work at the Niikappu ranch with a mass-poisoning campaign involving the use of strychnine-laced baits. This was supplemented by a bounty system established by the Kaitakushi.|$|E
2500|$|Most breeds {{with similar}} {{physical}} traits are bred {{for a single}} purpose, but the Drever has been bred to hunt all sizes of game, both hares and roe deer, and {{is also used to}} hunt fox and red deer. The Drever has a lot of stamina, and has become a popular hunting hound for <b>deer</b> <b>hunters</b> in northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland (in Finland drevers are not allowed in deer hunting yet, but it is used for hare and fox hunting). Roe deer are nervous quarry, and the hounds which are used to hunt them must move slowly, especially in areas where heavy snow can be expected in late autumn. [...] This is given as the reason for breeding of a dog with a medium-sized body but short legs.|$|E

2500|$|Film {{producer}} and [...] "old-fashioned mogul" [...] Allan Carr used his networking abilities to promote The Deer Hunter. [...] "Exactly how Allan Carr came into The <b>Deer</b> <b>Hunters</b> orbit I {{can no longer}} remember," [...] recalled producer Deeley, [...] "but the picture became a crusade to him. He nagged, charmed, threw parties, he created word-of-mouth– everything {{that could be done}} in Hollywood to promote a project. Because he had no apparent motive for this promotion, it had an added power and legitimacy and it finally did start to penetrate the minds of the Universal's sales people that they actually had in their hands something a bit more significant than the usual." [...] Deeley added that Carr's promotion of the film was influential in positioning The Deer Hunter for Oscar nominations.|$|E
