And the consequence {{is that he has}} made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and <b>graphic</b> <b>rotation</b> of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E

It praised the screen, stating that [...] "it almost has {{to be seen to}} be believed; imagine playing games at home (or in the office) using vector <b>graphics</b> with three-dimensional <b>rotation</b> and zoom", and noted that [...] "It is unusual and refreshing to see a product appearing on the market with its software ready to run".|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the VQM-set and study {{some of its}} algebraic properties. Its elements are triplets consisting of a vector, a quaternion and amatrix, hence the VQM abbreviation. Operations such as addition, scalar multiplication, are defined on the VQM-set, which {{turn it into a}} vector space. A special multiplication turns a subset of the VQM-set into a group, called the VQM-group. We show how this VQM-group could be used to represent the generalized transformations in three-dimensional computer <b>graphics,</b> with translation, <b>rotation</b> and non-uniform scaling factor components...|$|R
40|$|Time series showing seasonality- marked {{variation}} {{with time}} of year- {{are of interest}} to many scientists, including climatologists, other environmental scientists, epidemiologists, and economists. The usual graphs plotting response variables against time, or even time of year, are not always the most effective at showing the fine structure of seasonality. I survey various modifications of the usual graphs {{and other kinds of}} graphs with a range of examples. Although I introduce here two new Stata commands, cycleplot and sliceplot, I emphasize exploiting standard functions, data management commands, and graph options to get the graphs desired. cycleplot, sliceplot, seasonality, time series, <b>graphics,</b> cycle plot, <b>rotation,</b> state space, incidence plots, folding, repeating...|$|R
5000|$|By about 1980 many {{laboratories}} both {{in academia}} and industry had recognized {{the power of}} the computer to analyse and predict the properties of molecules, especially in materials science and the pharmaceutical industry. The discipline was often called [...] "molecular graphics" [...] and in 1982 a group of academics and industrialists in the UK set up the Molecular Graphics Society (MGS). Initially much of the technology concentrated either on high-performance 3D <b>graphics,</b> including interactive <b>rotation</b> or 3D rendering of atoms as spheres (sometimes with radiosity). During the 1980s a number of programs for calculating molecular properties (such as molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics) became available and the term [...] "molecular graphics" [...] often included these. As a result, the MGS has now changed its name to the Molecular Graphics and Modelling Society (MGMS).|$|R
40|$|It is {{overview}} of the measurement methods of free oscillations of console tools and forced vibrations during cutting. Non-contact inductive and capacitive sensors are commonly used for such measurements. Often used measurement methods are using inductive and capacitive sensors. Aim: The aim is to probe the stand developed by the authors for non-contact measurement of vibration of the rotating tool and then comparing the amplitude and frequency characteristics at noncutting rotation and during processing using wide blade to establish the vibration resistance of cutting process. Materials and Methods: To measure the tool vibration displacement relatively to the part at low frequency vibrations, it is proposed to use non-contact measurement method, using sensors, that are operate {{on the basis of}} Hall effect. Results: the stand for non-contact vibration measurement instrument in real time has been developed. The oscillograms of tool center amplitude during rotation, spectral analysis data of tool vibrations relative to processed part and moving center tool <b>graphics</b> noncutting <b>rotation</b> and in the process cutting were obtained during the experiments. The analysis of measurement data at various stages of processing of the hole scan carried out. It is shown that the tool is able to correct the initial error of the preprocessed hole in the range of 25 to 50 %. Conclusions: Processing of the data allows estimating the parameters of the dynamical system both at noncutting rotation speed and during processing to estimate data deviations of eccentricity at the base of oscillograms amplitude on axes Y and Z, deviation from roundness and make conclusions about the dimensional accuracy in the processing of workpieces with different modes of cutting...|$|R
5000|$|On release, Famicom Tsūshin {{scored the}} game a 31 out of 40, {{giving it a}} 9 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. Sega Saturn Magazine gave it an 80%, arguing that the game has too little story to win over European gamers, most of whom held a firm dislike for RPGs at the time Mystaria was released. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it an 8 out of 10, commenting that the menu system seems {{cumbersome}} at first but proves to be easily accessible and engaging. Though some of the reviewers felt the battles went on too long, they all praised {{the high level of}} strategy the game demands of the player. Maximum contended that Mystaria has too much gameplay, and that it should have focused more on cutscenes. They also criticized the absence of voice acting, and concluded that [...] "at times it's even quite good fun and it's certainly big enough to warrant a purchase if you like these kinds of titles anyway. However, it's not going to win over any new recruits, because it gets very tedious at times." [...] They gave it 3 out of 5 stars. Scary Larry of GamePro praised the <b>graphics,</b> particularly the <b>rotation</b> and scaling used in the attack animations, but criticized the music and absence of voice acting, and argued that turn-based strategy games are by definition boring.|$|R
40|$|Questionnaire {{surveys and}} motor {{performance}} tests {{were performed on}} 37 female students in the Department of Dance and Physical Education, Ochanomizu University, to investigate lateral differences in dance movements. Some typical movements employed for the classical ballet-balance (Developpe), jump (Grant jete) and turns (Pirouettes en dehors, Fouette en tournant, Tour piques) -were examined. The questionnaire survey showed that students tend to prefer the left lower limb as the supporting leg for each movement. Especially pirouettes en dehors were studied in detail by means of 3 -dimensional graphical analysis (Ariel Performance Analysis System) of 11 students who had been trained for classical ballet. They were divided into advanced or beginning groups according to their skillfulness. The ratio of time required for each phase of pirouettes en dehors to the whole motion was analyzed with-the aid of the 3 -dimensional <b>graphics.</b> Single <b>rotations</b> were broken down into 6 phases and double serial rotations into 8 phases. The advanced group showed large lateral differences: more for double serial rotations than for single r otations. The beginning group showed the opposite tendency. Large differences were found {{at the end of}} the rotations in both groups. Precessional rotation-which unavoidably accompanies pirouettes en dehors-was analyzed for each group with stick figures. Large lateral differences indicated in the double serial rotations for the advanced group could neither be recognized in the double serial rotations nor in the single rotations in the case of the beginning group. Large differences in the displacement of the centre of body mass are shown in the beginning group based on analysis of every movement. Larger lateral differences were shown in the double serial rotations than in single rotations in the advanced group. In the case of the advanced and begining group, the changes in acceleration of the centre of body mass indicate large lateral differences at the beginning and the end of rotations. It seems to be difficult for both groups to control the long axis during rotations, especially in the two phases when the swinging leg leaves the floor and touches it again. From the conscious and functional point of view, lateral differences in dance movements indicated between the advanced and beginning groups are reasonably explained from thei r level of skill...|$|R
40|$|Computer-aided {{design is}} the generic {{term for a}} rapidly proliferating set of {{techniques}} which have become mandatory for all who wish to maintain their competitive positions in {{an increasing number of}} industries. CAD practitioners in advanced technology industries such as aerospace and electronics are usually highly sophisticated in computer usage and therefore able to configure their own CAD environments to suit their requirements. Those, however, who are relatively new to computers, are faced with a bewildering set of choices over which they have to make decisions. Should they have a cheap terminal linked to a remote time-sharing bureau? Should they attempt to do their whole design job on a dedicated, medium-sized in-house computer? Or should they invest in a high capability, intelligent terminal backed up by access to a central (or network-distributed) number-crunching and data-bank facility? What graphic facilities should they use? A drum plotter, a storage-tube display, interactive refresh <b>graphics</b> unit, hardware <b>rotation,</b> conic generation, zooming, are all choices that are presented to them and the manufacturers' praise of their own line is often more confusing than helpful. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, IIASA, has recently embarked on a World Survey of CAD, one of whose aims has been to provide guidance to would-be users on the establishment of CAD facilities suited to their needs. In this work IIASA has relied heavily on the analysis of the activity phases in CAD, currently being conducted by W. G. 5. 2 (Computer-Aided Design) of IFIP (The International Federation for Information Processing) ...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} backup for big volumes of data. Data backup is a {{overlooked}} area {{of information technology}} and the data can be lost by trivial user error or breakdown on any components. In this thesis is discussed theory of backup - archive bit and his behavior based on various type of backup (full, incremental, differential or combination thereof), duration and frequency of backups or the point of ultimate recovery. In addition there are mentioned rotation schemes Round-Robin, GFS and Tower of Hanoi, where are described their principles and <b>graphic</b> diagram of <b>rotation.</b> In chapter Strategy of backup describes the backup strategy via choosing the right choice, taking into technical and economic parameters. Impact analysis, which is explained also in this chapter, describes the important moments in data recovery. For select the optimal strategy is necessary to consider not only the whole capacity of the backup data, but also {{the size of the}} backup window for data storage or storage location. In chapter Media storage you can acquainted with all backup media and their technical parameters that are available on the market and can be used for data backup. In section Guide methodology of large volumes of data backup is designed a backup plan with the necessary inputs for the actual implementation of the backup. The design methodology puts emphasis on regular backups and check their location. On practical demonstration is shown that the rotation scheme Tower of Hanoi are among the smallest need for backup media. A part of this thesis is also design of methodology for backup small amounts of data...|$|R
