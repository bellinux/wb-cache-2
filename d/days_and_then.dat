5|$|The egg size is {{independent}} of the clutch size and the nest site, but may vary between different females. The female incubates for 17–18days before the altricial downy chicks are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. The female broods the newly hatched chicks for around ten <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The chicks fledge 31–41days after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} for three <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned {{in favor of an}} open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be part of the group. At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E

5|$|Sentiments {{changed with}} the XYZ Affair. Adams {{appointed}} a three-member commission to represent the United States to negotiate with France. The commission consisted of John Marshall, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. Supposedly this was {{to make up for}} offenses given to France by Adams in his speech. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) {{program was}} {{initiated}} in 2010 {{with the purpose}} of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> returning them back to Earth. It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace. Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.|$|E
5|$|All dinosaurs lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian naval defences were weak. The Egyptian fleet had {{declined}} from its Umayyad-era peak and was mostly {{employed in the}} Nile {{rather than in the}} Mediterranean. Fortifications along the coastal marshes, which had been manned by volunteer garrisons, had been abandoned in the later 8th century. The Byzantines had exploited this in 811/12 and again in ca. 815 launching raids against the coasts of Egypt. The Byzantine fleet arrived at Damietta on 22 May 853. The city garrison were absent at a feast for the Day of Arafah organized by the governor Anbasah ibn Ishaq al-Dabbi in Fustat. Damietta's inhabitants fled the undefended city, which was plundered for two <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> torched by the Byzantines. The Byzantines carried off some six hundred Arab and Coptic women as well as large quantities of arms and other supplies intended for Crete. The fleet then sailed east and attacked the strong fortress of Ushtun. Upon taking it, they burned the many artillery and siege engines found there before returning home.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, {{which had}} {{oversight}} over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific {{use of the}} extracted berkelium. The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330days: after that time, half the berkelium produced would have decayed. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, {{it had to be}} completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 November, along with the 20th Battalion, it was tasked with the capture of Belhamed, a hill {{adjacent}} to Sidi Rezegh. With two companies leading the battalion's portion of the advance, the objective was captured with a bayonet charge. Peart was wounded during the attack but remained in command. The battalion held the hill for three <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> swapped its positions with the 20th Battalion before, on 30 November, the 15th Panzer Division surrounded and attacked Belhamed. While the 20th Battalion was effectively destroyed, the 18th Battalion, with Peart maintaining tight control of some personnel who were close to panicking, managed to evacuate in time and reached the British 70th Division in Tobruk. Here it manned the lines, with Gray back in command, fending off German attacks, until 11 December when it was withdrawn to Baggush. Meeting up {{with the rest of}} the division, it was brought back up to strength and manned defences to protect the lines of communication to the front.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes {{sent the}} first {{shipments}} of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr Frederick Rutherfoord Harris and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula {{had so far}} accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued {{to do so for}} years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document.|$|E
5|$|In late 1940, an {{engineer}} had created some military inventions which Gjems-Onstad's group {{wanted to bring}} to the Allied forces. It was decided that one of them was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to Stockholm. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, and they decided to let themselves be arrested in Östmark in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian legation was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British military attaché. He got in contact with Major Malcolm Munthe, who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> for 59 days in the Stockholm Remand Prison. On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war). He was originally scheduled to be deported to Canada via Moscow and China, but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in Öreryd. He was ordered by the British to escape from Öreryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the Swedish Home Guard close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December.|$|E
