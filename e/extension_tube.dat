Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures {{for hours in}} the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie {{for over an hour}} in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an <b>extension</b> <b>tube.</b> He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{is common}} {{practice}} to wash and reuse low-profile gastrostomy (LPG) <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> {{for several weeks}} or {{as long as the}} tubes remain functional. This laboratory study investigated three different cleaning methods and their effectiveness for lowering the microbial contamination of <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> challenged with Staph-ylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida albicans, and Acinetobacter. The Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) limit of an aerobic plate count exceeding 10, 000 (10 “) organisms per gram of product for microbial contamination of enteral formulas was used as the stan-dard. One hundred thirty-two <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> were used (66 analyzed a t 8 days and the remaining 66 analyzed at 18 days), 30 per each inoculated group and 12 with uninoculated formula. Each group was divided into thre...|$|R
50|$|For other lens types, an adapter {{would act}} as an <b>extension</b> <b>tube,</b> causing the lens to lose the ability to focus to infinity. Alternatively, the lens {{adapters}} would include optical elements and act as weak teleconverters, as well as possibly losing optical quality.|$|E
50|$|Other {{items like}} lens {{adapters}} may unintentionally {{have an effect}} similar to an <b>extension</b> <b>tube.</b> A lens designed for a small flange focal distance {{may not be able}} to focus to infinity when a lens adapter places the sensor too far away.|$|E
50|$|This lens can be {{used with}} an <b>extension</b> <b>tube,</b> which {{increases}} the maximum magnification to 1.19× (EF 12 II) or 1.39× (EF 25 II). In these cases, focusing at infinity is sacrificed, with maximum distance reduced to 1002 mm (3.3 ft) and 606 mm (2.0 ft) respectively.|$|E

5000|$|Astronomical Barlow lenses {{are rated}} {{for the amount}} of {{magnification}} they induce. Most commonly, Barlow lenses are 2x or 3x, but adjustable Barlows are also available. The power of an adjustable Barlow lens is changed by adding an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> between the Barlow and the eyepiece to increase the magnification.|$|E
5000|$|Strictly speaking, {{macrophotography}} is technical photography {{with actual}} image size ranging from near life-size (1:1 image-to-object ratio) to about ten or twenty times life-size (10 or 20:1 ratio, at which photomicrography begins). [...] "Macro" [...] lenses were originally regular formula lenses optimized for close object distances, {{mounted on a}} long <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> or bellows accessory to provide the necessary close focusing, but preventing focusing on distant objects.|$|E
5000|$|The tube {{contains}} no optical elements; its sole {{purpose is to}} move the lens farther from the image plane. The farther away the lens is, the closer the focus, the greater the magnification, and also the greater the loss of light (requiring a longer exposure time). Lenses classically focus closer than infinity by moving all optical elements farther from the film or sensor; an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> simply enables this movement.|$|E

The 887 Nitro Mag Waterfowl is very similar to the base version, with the main difference being the finish. The waterfowl version includes a finish covered in Mossy Oak's Break-Up Infinity and also Realtree Advantage Max-4 HD camo, which makes it ideal for hunting, as per its namesake. The 887 Waterfowl is also slightly heavier than the 887.|$|E
50|$|Commonly, a breech-end <b>extension</b> <b>tube,</b> {{known as}} a bore guide or rod guide, is also used in {{conjunction}} with the cleaning rod to prevent cleaning solvent from spilling out into the receiver, and to keep the rod supported and centered inside the bore in order to minimize potential damage to riflings. Similarly, a muzzle guide or muzzle guard might be used if the cleaning rod is to be inserted from the muzzle end of the firearm {{in order to protect the}} crown of the muzzle from mechanical damage.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to physically mount a lens with a short flange focal distance on a camera with a long flange focal distance, but this will {{make it impossible to}} achieve infinity focus. The effect will be similar to that of an <b>extension</b> <b>tube,</b> because the lens will be mounted further from the image plane than intended. Some lens adapters utilize an optical element to compensate for this, effectively acting as a teleconverter. This introduces the typical side effects of a teleconverter, namely decreasing the amount of light that reaches the sensor, and adding a crop factor to the lens.|$|E
50|$|The idea of photographing {{an image}} through the {{viewfinder}} {{of such a}} camera is relatively new, and ttv photography and filmography has come into use {{with the advent of}} digital cameras and EyeTap devices. Before the advent of digital photography it was necessary to use <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> to photograph a close-up object such as a viewfinder, and it was difficult to judge focusing precisely. Both compact digital cameras and digital SLRs are able to focus on close objects without the need for <b>extension</b> <b>tubes,</b> and their autofocus function and digital viewing screen make it easy to focus and judge framing and exposure. Moreover, the EyeTap device captures exactly what the eye sees, and therefore can capture video recordings of anything that the human eye can look into. It is thus much better suited to this type of photography/videography than most previously known cameras.|$|R

(D)SLR camera & interchangeable-lens {{manufacturers}} offer lens accessories like <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> {{and secondary}} lenses like teleconverters, which mount {{in between the}} camera body and the primary lens, both using and providing a primary lens mount.
