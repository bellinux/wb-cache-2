5|$|Additionally, {{the figures}} from 2012 show that 34.7% of the {{permanent}} resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third of this population (853,000) held Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants (first generation <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens).|$|E

5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like the}} {{multicultural}} and metropolitan {{atmosphere of the}} earlier Tang capital at Chang'an, the Song capitals at Kaifeng and Hangzhou were home to an array of traveling <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> ethnic minorities. There was {{a great amount of}} contact with the outside world. Trade and tribute embassies from Egypt, Yemen, India, Korea, the Kara-Khanid Khanate of Central Asia and elsewhere came to Song China in order to bolster trade relations, while the Chinese sent embassies abroad to encourage foreign trade. Song Chinese trade ships traveled to ports in Japan, Champa in southern Vietnam, Srivijaya in Maritime Southeast Asia, Bengal and South India, and the coasts of East Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} had a Jewish community; {{inscriptions}} in Palmyrene from the necropolis of Beit She'arim in Lower Galilee confirm the burial of Palmyrene Jews. Occasionally and rarely, members of the Palmyrene families took Greek names while ethnic Greeks were few; {{the majority of people}} with Greek names, who did not belong to one of the city's families, were freed slaves. The Palmyrenes seem to have disliked the Greeks, considered them <b>foreigners,</b> <b>and</b> restricted their settlement in the city.|$|E
5|$|The later 860s saw a {{reduction}} of activity by the Foreigners—although the Annals indignantly report that they plundered the ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth in 863—with the Dublin forces active in Pictland and in the six months' siege of Dumbarton Rock. Áed Findliath took advantage of these absences to destroy the Viking fortresses {{in the north of}} Ireland. Amlaíb left Ireland for good in 871 and Ímar died in 873. With their disappearance, there were frequent changes of leadership among the <b>Foreigners</b> <b>and</b> a great deal of internecine conflict is reported for the following decades.|$|E

Furthermore, organizations not listed in the Law on State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission. The emblem can be used by both <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> citizens of Belarus, as long as the symbol is displayed with respect, although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government.|$|E
5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 ariary for <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> 400 ariary for locals), which is largely {{used to pay}} for the preservation of the site. The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the stylistic}} {{innovations}} Radama adopted {{for the construction}} of several of the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout of the compound remained largely unaltered from its original design with the sole exception of an expansion of the Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden stakes were built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses of several of Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still living at the time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting <b>foreigners,</b> <b>and</b> briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his main residence at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E

5|$|Following Alexander the Great's {{death in}} 323BCE, Judea was contested between the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire based in Syria and Mesopotamia. Seleucid emperor AntiochusIII's victory over Egypt in the Battle of Panium brought Judea under Seleucid control. The Jewish {{population}} of Jerusalem had aided Antiochus during his siege of the Baris, the fortified base of Jerusalem's Egyptian garrison. Their support {{was rewarded with}} a charter affirming Jewish religious autonomy, including barring <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> impure animals from the Temple's precincts, and an allocation of official funds {{for the maintenance of}} certain religious rituals in the Temple. Despite being allowed religious freedom, many Jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential Greek lifestyle. The imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement, and this {{led to the formation of}} Hellenistic elites among the Jewish population. Hellenization produced tensions between observant Jews and their brethren who had assimilated Greek culture.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attack, Richard did not return to the Tower but instead travelled from Mile End to the Great Wardrobe, one of his royal houses in Blackfriars, part of south-west London. There he appointed the military commander Richard FitzAlan, the Earl of Arundel, to replace Sudbury as Chancellor, and began to make plans to regain an advantage over the rebels the following day. Many of the Essex rebels now began to disperse, content with the King's promises, leaving Tyler and the Kentish forces the most significant faction in London. Tyler's men moved around the city that evening, seeking out and killing John of Gaunt's employees, <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> anyone associated with the legal system.|$|E
5|$|Restaurant menu: During {{the early}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{expanding}} trade and commerce brought money and {{people to the}} Song Chinese capital. The world's first restaurants sprang up and food like dumplings and noodles became available to the masses for a small price. Urban shopkeepers of the merchant middle class often had little time to eat at home, so they ventured out to eat {{at a variety of}} establishments such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and restaurants which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and drama theaters; this along with traveling <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand for a variety of flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu.|$|E

5|$|The Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules {{made under}} the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act require a permit for any public {{assembly}} or procession {{of five or}} more persons in any public place. The rationale given for this law is that {{a large group of}} people who gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent. In the 1950s and 1960s there were several violent riots in Singapore, the last incident being the 1964 race riots in which 36 people were killed. Although there have only been a few minor protests since then, the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests. On 31 December 2000, 15 members of Falun Gong consisting of 13 <b>foreigners</b> <b>and</b> two Singaporeans were arrested at MacRitchie Park for holding an illegal assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{first book}} starts {{on the topic}} of Greek {{philosophy}}. Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were <b>foreigners,</b> <b>and</b> (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends with a discussion on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.|$|E
5|$|Upon Ivan's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his simple-minded son Feodor. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in {{maintaining}} exclusive trading rights with England. Feodor declared his kingdom {{open to all}} <b>foreigners,</b> <b>and</b> dismissed the English ambassador Sir Jerome Bowes, whose pomposity had been tolerated by the new Tsar's late father. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent Boris Godunov that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor {{with two of his}} titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by Feodor's father, but was turned down.|$|E
