5|$|When a USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB <b>device</b> enumeration process <b>is</b> started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB <b>device's</b> information <b>is</b> read by the host and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> supported by the host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the <b>device</b> <b>are</b> loaded and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to limiting the total average power {{used by the}} device, the USB specification limits the inrush current (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when the device is first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device could cause problems with the host's internal power. USB <b>devices</b> <b>are</b> also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.|$|E
5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays. These <b>devices</b> <b>are</b> used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.|$|E
