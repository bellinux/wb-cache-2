50|$|Originally catalogs {{were just}} dealers' price lists, though today that is rarely the case. Over time, as philately developed, catalogs tended to {{accumulate}} additional supporting {{details about the}} stamps, such as <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> color variations, and so forth. As their use by collectors became widespread, the catalogs came to define what was and was not a legitimate stamp, since many collectors would avoid stamps not described in the catalog. In recent years, the Internet has become a common resource for information about stamps. Some catalogs have an on-line version while others are available only on-line.|$|E

40|$|Philatelic {{societies}} {{across the}} world, including {{those associated with}} the Holy Land, are recording that there are few newcomers to our hobby. Many reasons are quoted, such as the existence of alternative hobbies and distractions, the difficulty of acquiring material and information, and the potential cost. In this article I describe an experiment in forming a new collection of Palestine with a small outlay. It is impossible to pretend that I am a newcomer to collecting this country, but I have tried {{to act as if}} I knew very little, and will attempt to explain in a way that a relative newcomer may follow the procedure. For my tenth birthday, a kind aunt gave me a paperback book with the title “Stamp Collecting on a Small Income ” whose front cover showed the hands of a philatelist using hinges to mount a short set of mint definitive stamps from, I think, St Helena. (Short sets of definitives were popular with collectors in the days when top values of five shillings and above were beyond their budget.) With this title in mind, this article could be sub-titled “Palestine collecting on a small outlay. ” Before starting, one needs some information. My local library had a copy of a catalogue of stamps from the Middle East which listed all the basic issues of Palestine from 1918 to 1948.
