5|$|An {{equilibrium}} between electrons, positrons and photons {{was maintained}} {{during this phase}} of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, {{the main}} and {{emergency}} spillways failed, leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam. After deterioration of the main spillway largely stabilized and the water level of the dam's reservoir <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> {{the top of the}} emergency spillway, the evacuation order was lifted.|$|E

The Richardson number is a dimensionless value expressing {{the ratio of}} potential to kinetic energy. This ratio <b>drops</b> <b>below</b> 0.25 when the shear rate exceeds stratification. This can produce Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, resulting in a turbulence which leads to mixing.|$|R
50|$|Fontenelle {{experiences}} a semi-arid climate with short, warm summers and cold, long winters. Due to Fontenelle's high elevation and aridity, temperatures drop sharply after sunset.

Overall, the daily minimum temperatures are even lower than nearby Mount Dandenong despite being much closer to sea level.|$|R
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant uses three {{different}} hunting strategies to catch its prey. Gleaning insects from a perch is its primary hunting strategy; while gleaning, the bird sits upright with its wings <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> the tail, which is pointing straight down. From this position the tit-tyrant scans upwards into the vegetation {{for three to}} five seconds before attacking, making them surprisingly deliberate hunters for a small flycatcher.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{population}} had <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82. Unlike the stage road, it was closed during the winter months. While most of the old route {{was used for the}} new road, a portion of the original grade remains three miles below the pass on the east side. It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper's house and the remains of the gate.|$|E
5|$|Kempton and Jankowski relayed Hambleton's {{coordinates}} to King 22, a HC-130 {{search and}} rescue (SAR) aircraft operating just south of Quảng Trị. Recovering Hambleton quickly was essential, as the odds of recovering downed airmen <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> twenty percent if the aircrew member {{was on the ground}} after four hours. But their efforts would be severely hampered by the huge number of troops and large quantity of anti-aircraft fire in the area, some of it supporting the NVA's efforts to capture and protect the Cam Lo Bridge near Hambleton's position.|$|E

5|$|During December 1965, more {{submarine}} activity occurred 0.9km (0.56mi) {{southwest of}} Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, {{and over the}} following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70m (230ft) in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> sea level during October 1966.|$|E
5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, {{and the next day}} it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December7, the winds <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> hurricane status {{for the first time in}} five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E

5|$|The war also {{reflected}} a new height in military spending, especially by the Habsburgs. After the Seven Years' War, {{the size of}} the Habsburg military shrank, from 201,311men in arms in 1761 to 163,613in 1775. In preparing for a second summer's campaign, Joseph's army grew from 195,108effectives in the summer of 1778 to 308,555men in arms in Spring 1779. Habsburg military strength never <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> two hundred thousand effectives between 1779 and 1792, when Austria entered the War of the First Coalition. Several times it surged above three hundred thousand men in arms, responding to needs on the Ottoman border or the revolt in the Austrian Netherlands. The military also underwent a massive organizational overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two years}} of the expulsion, the {{population}} in the Chiquitos missions <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> 20,000. Despite the general decline of the settlements, however, the church buildings were maintained and, in some cases, extended by the towns' inhabitants. The construction of the church in Santa Ana de Velasco falls into this period. Bernd Fischermann, an anthropologist who studied the Chiquitano, suggests three reasons that the Chiquitano preserved the heritage of the Jesuits even after their expulsion: the memory of their prosperity with the Jesuits; the desire to appear as civilized Christians to mestizos and white people; and to preserve the ethnicity that originated from a mix of various culturally distinct groups blended by an enforced common language and customs learned from the Jesuits.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Cyclone Bola quickly weakened as it accelerated southeastward {{toward a}} frontal trough. On March 3, its winds <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> hurricane-force, and it gradually lost its tropical characteristics. The structure became asymmetric, {{with a large}} band of clouds extending well south of the circulation. By March 4, Bola had completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. Which turned south and began to affect the North Island of New Zealand on March 6. A building ridge of high pressure to its south caused the extratropical remnants of Bola to slow and turn to the west on March 7. The next day, the storm passed about 110 km (70 mi) north of the North Island. Around the same time, the storm began slowly filling, meaning the low pressure area associated with Bola was losing its identity. It turned southward on March 9, and on March 12 was absorbed by a stationary trough in the Westerlies near the western coast of the South Island.|$|E

5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and {{freezing}} rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The southern Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however {{there was a period}} of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during the afternoon of the 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> freezing again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. Wraparound snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th.|$|E
5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, {{as though it had}} landed or <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E
5|$|Continuing west-northwestward, Karen {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on November 13 {{with a central}} pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). Between November 13 and 14, Karen gradually turned towards the north as it underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. During this time, Karen finally weakened below Category 5 status as its winds <b>dropped</b> <b>below</b> 251 km/h (156 mph). This {{marked the end of}} its near-record 4.25-day span as a storm of such intensity, second only to Typhoon Nancy of 1961 which maintained Category 5 status for 5.5 days. Over the following days, the typhoon's structure gradually became disorganized, with its eye no longer well-defined by November 15. By this time, Karen began accelerating northeastward and later east-northeastward over the open ocean. The combination of its rapid movement and entrainment of cold air into the circulation ultimately caused the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 17. The remnants of Karen continued tracking east-northeast and were last noted by the JTWC on November 18 roughly halfway between the southern Aleutian Islands and northern Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
