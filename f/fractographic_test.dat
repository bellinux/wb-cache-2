40|$|Abstract Several {{cases of}} {{undefined}} conditions during operation of steam turbines, such as shut {{down of the}} turbine or leaking of the condenser, {{can lead to a}} corrosive environment. If the concentration of oxygen and chloride exceeds a critical level, pitting corrosion can occur. Since corrosion pits increase the local stress field, the initiation of fatigue cracks is facilitated and – under adverse conditions – these cracks can lead to final failure. In this work, the results of fatigue tests on 12 % Cr martensitic stainless steel, which is a standard blade material in the low pressure part of a steam turbine, are presented. The influence of corrosion pits and environment on the fatigue limit is investigated. Pit-to-crack transition is studied by optical observation and <b>fractographic</b> examination.

In order to understand the correlation between the nanostructure and the mechanical behaviour, four nanocomposite alloys with different characteristics were studied: two alloys from the Al-Fe-Cr-Ti system consisting of a spherical nanoquasicrystalline phase in an α-Al matrix; one alloy from the Al-Fe-V-Ti system consisting of a mixture of amorphous and α-Al phases; and one alloy from the Al-Mn-Cr-Cu system consisting of nanocrystalline particles embedded in an α-Al matrix.

The dissimilar joints between the DP, 22 MnB 5, and TRIP steels exhibit good resistance properties. On the contrary, the dissimilar joints encompassing the TWIP steel exhibit poor mechanical strength and fail along the weld seam by intergranular fracture, probably due to presence of Mn segregations. Therefore, the laser welding of TWIP steel with other advanced high strength steels is not recommended without the use of proper metal fillers.

Two different types of specimens C(T) and M(T) specimens made from stainless steel {{have been used for}} fracture toughness testing at the room temperature by the principles of the ASTM 1820 - 05 standard procedure. Stable crack initiation and crack propagation occurred for the C(T) specimens at lower values of crack driving force than for the M(T) specimens.

Comparison between the CTOD-R curves of both types of specimens shows some difference between the C(T) and the M(T) specimens, but a more significant difference appeared in the crack driving force, as consequence of different constraint (triaxiality) of the C(T) versus the M(T) specimens.

Axial fatigue specimens fabricated from cast Ti- 47. 9 Al- 2. 0 Cr- 1. 9 Nb (to {{be referred to}} as 48 - 2 - 2) and Ti- 47. 3 Al- 2. 2 Nb- 0. 5 Mn- 0. 4 W- 0. 4 Mo- 0. 23 Si (to {{be referred to as}} WMS) alloys were damaged by impact under controlled conditions with a 60 deg wedge-shaped indenter to simulate assembly-related damage in low-pressure turbine blades. The level of damage produced was quantified and found to correlate well with the peak load of the impact event. The WMS alloy exhibited a greater resistance to impact damage due to its higher yield strength and lamellar microstructure.

The failure stress of the WMS alloy was greater than that of the 48 - 2 - 2 alloy in the undamaged state. The {{relationship between}} impact damage and failure stress was examined using a threshold-based approach. These studies indicate that, for damage levels below a transitional flaw size, the failure stress is near that for undamaged specimens.

This {{paper was}} {{the winner of the}} EPMA PM Structural Parts Keynote Award made at Euro PM 2014 Microstructural {{features}} of sintered steels, which comprise both phases and porosity, strongly condition the mechanical behaviour of the material under service conditions. Many research activities have dealt with this relationship since better understanding of the microstructure&-property correlation is the key of improvement of current powder metallurgy (PM) steels. Up to now, <b>fractographic</b> investigation after <b>testing</b> has been successfully applied for this purpose and, more recently, the in situ analysis of crack evolution through the microstructure as well as some advanced computer assisted tools. However, there is still a lack of information about local mechanical behaviour and strain distributions at the microscale in relation to the local microstructure of these steels, i. e. which phases in heterogeneous PM microstructures contribute to localisation of plastic deformation or which phases can impede crack propagation during loading. In the present work, these questions are addressed through the combination of three techniques: (i) in situ tensile testing (performed in the SEM) to monitor crack initiation and propagation; (ii) digital image correlation technique to trace the progress of local strain distributions during loading; (iii) fractographic examination of the loaded samples. Three PM steels, all obtained from commercially available powders but presenting different microstructures, are examined: a ferritic-pearlitic Fe-C steel, a bainitic prealloyed Fe-Mo-C steel and a diffusion alloyed Fe-Ni-Cu-Mo-C steel, with more heterogeneous microstructure (ferrite, pearlite, upper and lower bainite, martensite and Ni rich austenite).

Thermal cycling and drop testing are commonly used because they reveal the failure modes and mechanisms that portable devices experience in operational environments. A large number of component boards were assembled in a full-scale production line to enable proper statistical and <b>fractographic</b> analyses. The <b>test</b> boards were assembled with different printed wiring board protective coatings, component under bump metallizations, and solder pad structures. The component boards were tested and the times-to-failure of the various combinations were statistically analyzed. The reliability data were also analyzed by the Weibull method, and the characteristic lifetimes and shape parameters were calculated. The failure modes under the thermal cycling, where solder interconnections fail by cracking through the bulk solder, were different from those observed in the drop tests, where cracks propagate along the intermetallic layers {{on either side of}} the interconnections. Under the thermomechanical loading the as-soldered microstructure, which is composed of only a few large eutectic colonies, undergoes local recrystallization that produces networks of grain boundaries along which the intergranular cracks damage solder interconnections. Under the mechanical shock loading, in turn, the strain–rate hardening of the solder material forces cracks to propagate in the intermetallic layers instead of the bulk solder. It was found that the {{reliability of}} solder interconnections can improve when the component boards have undergone thermal cycles before drop testing. The high-angle boundaries between the recrystallized grains generated during thermal cycling provide paths along which cracks can propagate but the propagation through the bulk solder consumes more energy than the propagation through brittle intermetallic layers. On the other hand, prolonged lifetime at elevated temperatures can reduce the drop test reliability considerably due to the formation of Kirkendall voids in the Cu 3 Sn intermetallic layers. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Technique advancements in {{immersion}} treatment {{have led}} to the emergence of the ImAg surface finish. With its supreme electrical performance, reliable solder joints and competitively low cost, this surface finish has gained considerable attention from PCB manufacturers and suppliers. However, some potential reliability risks with this surface finish also prevent it from gaining wider market adoption. Among these risks, dendrite formation and surface corrosion are the two failure modes with the most serious controversy. A comprehensive analysis of these two failure modes is the main objective of the present study. First of all, the dendrite formation was evaluated using a simple water drop test method. With the presence of liquid water between conductors, the dendrite formation will increase in both speed and severity of several orders of magnitude. The substantial test time reduction makes the water drop test an effective method to check the migration propensity. A comparative study was carried out on the solder pads with ImAg and OSP surface finishes. Experimental conditions included various DC voltage biases, media and gaps between test pads. The time-to-failure (TTF) was defined as the period for the leakage current to reach a certain level. The test results indicate that, when at a higher voltage bias, the TTF of dendrite formation is significantly shorter on the ImAg surface finish than that on the OSP surface finish. Dominant silver in dendrite products reveals its highly susceptible migration propensity. Therefore, a conservative usage of the ImAg surface finish in high-voltage applications is recommended. Then, the tarnish mechanism of the ImAg surface finish was elucidated. A high sulfur-based clay was used to generate a test environment containing sulfide gases. A galvanic corrosion mechanism is proposed to explain the preferred copper corrosion during the clay test. It is more accurate to use the copper content on the ImAg surface as the criterion for both tarnish detection and quantification. In addition, the solder wettability on the tarnished ImAg surface was also assessed through the solder spreading test method. A decrease of solder spreading on the tarnished surface is concluded. This impact turns out to be significant on the test patterns of strip line with smaller widths. Great attention needs to be paid when assembling the fine-pitch surface mount components on a PCB with a tarnished ImAg surface. Finally, the solder joint reliability on the tarnished ImAg surface was studied by means of X-ray, mechanical cross-section, high speed ball pull and <b>fractographic</b> examination. The <b>test</b> conditions included isothermal aging of up to 1000 hours at temperatures of 100 °C, 125 °C and 150 °C respectively. The extra voids in solder joints are concluded to be the only detrimental effect of the tarnished ImAg surface. It is possible to apply the existing industry standard on the solder joint void requirement as the acceptance criterion for solder joints on a tarnished ImAg surface...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} composites {{are attractive}} for aerospace applications {{due to high}} specific strength and stiffness. Their use has been gradually increased to 50 % by weight of the aircraft over past decades. As a consequence, modern aircraft utilize composites in the primary structures like wing skin and fuselage. The use of composites in primary structures has increased the need for reliable strength assessment methodologies. Composites are inherent to various damage types of which delamination is the most severe type of damage. Delaminations may grow due to fatigue resulting in the stress redistribution and potentially leading to structural failure, thus making fatigue an important design concern. Damage tolerance of aircraft structures is a key aspect in maintenance and safety of aircraft. For damage tolerant design of structures, the development of accurate delamination growth assessment tools is necessary. Delamination growth is affected by both cyclic and monotonic part of the fatigue load cycle. The effect of monotonic part is known as stress ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum cyclic stress) effect on delamination growth, {{and it has been}} extensively studied in the literature. Chapter 2 provides a detailed review of the literature concerning the stress ratio effect on delamination growth. The literature review shows that previous studies empirically relate delamination growth to a driving force parameter that seems not based on physical mechanisms. Studies are present where mechanisms of delamination growth have been investigated; however {{there is a lack of}} efforts to link these quantitatively to delamination growth models. The objective of this thesis is the development of a mechanistic model for delamination growth that is based on the observed delamination mechanisms and the effects of monotonic and cyclic loadings in fatigue. The thesis is based on the hypothesis that both monotonic and cyclic loading affect fracture surface formation, which can be used for delamination growth characterization. The secondary objective of the thesis is the characterization of fracture surfaces for the effect of monotonic and cyclic loading. To limit the scope, delamination growth under mode I fatigue has been investigated in the thesis. The approach of the thesis is experimental. Delamination growth is characterized experimentally both on macroscopic and microscopic levels, as described in chapter 3. Fatigue tests were performed on double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens to investigate delamination growth behavior under different stress ratios. Specimens were made from cured laminates of M 30 SC/DT 120 carbon/epoxy prepregs. Crack closure during delamination growth was investigated using a clip gauge extensometer. The effect of fiber bridging was investigated by cutting bridging fibers during delamination growth experiments. Microscopy of the fracture surfaces was performed using scanning electron microscopy. Width tapered DCB (WTDCB) specimens were used for the delamination growth tests under fatigue with constant monotonic and cyclic load during delamination extension. Results of the fatigue tests and microscopy are presented in chapter 4. The delamination growth rate has been related to the strain energy release rate (SERR). The SERR range has been defined such that it resembles the correct analogous to the stress intensity factor (SIF) range. For constant SERR range, the delamination growth rate is higher for higher stress ratios. Crack closure was observed to occur for the lowest stress ratio applied in the <b>tests.</b> <b>Fractographic</b> analysis of the fracture surfaces revealed broken fibers, loose fibers, hackles and striations. The striations and hackles on the fracture surfaces of WTDCB specimens were quantitatively analyzed for different combinations of monotonic load and cyclic load amplitudes. It was observed that striation spacing increased with monotonic and cyclic load. The hackle length increased with monotonic load, but decreased with the cyclic load amplitude. Crack closure and fiber bridging marginally explain the stress ratio effect on delamination growth, as discussed in chapter 5. Crack closure increases the effective minimum load at crack tip at the lower stress ratio only. This results in higher effective stress ratio at the crack tip. In this case, the SERR range was corrected for crack closure. By plotting delamination growth rate against corrected SERR range, the data shifted to the region with higher stress ratios. To illustrate the effect of crack closure in 3 D representation, delamination growth rate was plotted against SERR range and maximum SERR. It was observed that the data corrected for crack closure shifted to the higher stress ratio region, while remaining on the same crack resistance surface. It was further observed that fiber bridging decreases the delamination growth rate. The stress ratio remains the same. It was observed that fiber bridging affects both minimum and maximum loads during fatigue resulting in same stress ratio as without fiber bridging. In a 3 D representation of delamination growth rate versus SERR range and maximum SERR, the data was observed to shift to the lower delamination growth rate region due to fiber bridging. The experimental results showed that delamination growth is not a unique function of SERR range, but also depend on the stress ratio. This implies that delamination growth depends on both cyclic and monotonic loads. A two parameter model for delamination growth was developed based on the observation of the effect of cyclic and monotonic load on the fracture surfaces. Chapter 6 describes the mechanism of delamination growth and the development of the mechanistic two parameter model for delamination growth prediction. The two parameter components in the model are superimposed rather than multiplied in agreement with the superposition of the effects of cyclic and monotonic loads observed with microscopic features on the fracture surfaces. The two parameter model for delamination growth represents a crack resistance surface for the material in the 3 D coordinates of delamination growth rate versus SERR range and maximum SERR. The model has been implemented using data from the delamination growth experiments. The surface fitting tool of the commercial software MATLAB was used to obtain the equation. To validate the model, experimental data was taken from the literature. The predictions with the model and the reported experimental observations were observed to be in good agreement. The current model is different from previous models in that the relation between delamination growth and correlating parameters is no longer a simple fit of the experimental data by regression. The fit is rather an educated fit based on the observed contribution of monotonic and cyclic load components on fracture mechanisms. The two parameters in the model are superimposed to describe contribution of the load components. In previous two parameter models the terms were multiplied without justification using the physics of delamination growth. The conclusions of the thesis are summarized in chapter 8. It can be concluded that the effect of monotonic load on delamination growth is not fully explained by crack closure and fiber bridging. The delamination growth should be characterized using both monotonic and cyclic load components. These load components affects delamination growth at microscopic level independent of one another. The two parameter terms in the model are added in conjunction to the superposition of the effects of these parameters on microscopic features. It is concluded that the model can be extended to the delamination growth in different modes of fracture. Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & MaterialsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
