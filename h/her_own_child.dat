5|$|After finding {{most of the}} Melodies, Ninten is harassed at a karaoke bar by Teddy, {{the boss}} of a local gang. Teddy surrenders after losing to Ninten in a duel, and joins Ninten's party {{with the intent to}} avenge the deaths of his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Lloyd stays behind. In a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain, Ana pulls Ninten aside and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and profess their mutual love. When about to leave, the party is {{attacked}} by a powerful robot that knocks out the entire party. Lloyd arrives with a tank and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party and critically wounds Teddy, so Lloyd rejoins the party. They take a boat out on Holy Loly Lake and a whirlpool pulls them into an underwater laboratory where they find a robot who claims to have been built by George to protect Ninten. When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain and the robot helps them ascend. On the way, they find a cave with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the Mother Ship to free the prisoners. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh melody.

She recalls the rest of the song and reminisces about an alien named Gyiyg that she loved as <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> Queen Mary reveals that she is George's wife, Maria, and vanishes. Magicant, a mirage created by her conscience, vanishes with her.|$|E

25|$|Alice courageously {{faces the}} shame of bearing and rearing their illegitimate {{daughter}} Anna alone. This ordeal is the test of the title—of herself, her family, and her community. Her story is paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, a sinner of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified {{by most of the}} small-minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold feet at the news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> importunes her to let her have Anna instead; persuaded {{it would be in the}} best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies.|$|E
25|$|Pseudo-Apollodorus records an archaic legend, {{which claims}} that Hephaestus once {{attempted}} to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, {{causing him to}} ejaculate on her thigh. Athena wiped the semen off using a tuft of wool, which she tossed into the dust, impregnating Gaia and causing her {{to give birth to}} Erichthonius, whom Athena adopted as <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since {{he was the one who}} had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.|$|E

25|$|As {{traditional}} folklore {{tends to}} portray Wu {{as a power}} hungry woman with no care for who she hurt or what she did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> in order to implicate Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the child out of jealousy and hatred toward Wu since Wang had no children of her own. The third argument is that the child died of asphyxiation or crib death, considering that the ventilation systems of the time were non-existent or of poor quality. Lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method {{could lead to a}} build-up of fumes that would lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. No matter what caused the death of the child, Wu blamed Wang for it and Wang was removed from her position as empress.|$|E

Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that [...] "this odious witch" [...] suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought into the courtroom and asked {{to stand up and}} give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and scream at her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed from the courtroom before the evidence could be heard.

In 2011 Jacqui made a rape accusation against Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), whether Gilly is guilty or innocent was decided by a jury composed of viewers.
