25|$|The most {{important}} results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late {{director of the}} museum, {{in the neighborhood of}} “Pompey's Pillar”, where there is a good deal of open <b>ground.</b> <b>Here,</b> substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.|$|E
25|$|It {{was built}} on the north eastern side of the Shahajahanabad. It is located on the Ring Road near the Yamuna Bazaar. It derives its name Nigambodh Ghat from the burial <b>ground</b> <b>here.</b> The {{etymology}} of Nigambodh is derived from Sanskrit words ‘Nigam’ which means the “Ved” and ‘bodh’ means “knowledge”, meaning realization of knowledge. According to a folk legend, Lord Brahma (the creator) took a bath in the Yamuna River at this ghat to recover his lost memory and by this act Brahma not only got back his memory but also remembered the place he had kept his sacred books. In the past, the gate was closer to the ghat and nearer to the Salimgarh Fort.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} long and gentle slopes run {{down from the}} summit of Dow Crag toward the Duddon, while further north on this flank is Seathwaite Tarn. The <b>ground</b> <b>here</b> also begins in a shallow descent, but turns steep above the tarn {{in a line of}} minor crags. Seathwaite Tarn is a {{reservoir}} in a side valley of the Duddon system. This was originally a much smaller waterbody, but was dammed early in the 20th century to provide drinking water for the Barrow in Furness area. The dam is almost 400yards long and is concrete cored with slate buttresses, the resulting depth being around 80ft. Water is not abstracted directly from the tarn, but flows some distance downriver to an off-take weir.|$|E

25|$|East of {{the village}} limits, the Southern Tier Expressway and NY434 curve to the southeast, {{mirroring}} a similar turn {{in the course of}} the river and its surrounding valley. The route continues through forests and mostly undeveloped fields, serving exit65 of NY17 and passing by Owego Town Court ahead of another bend in the river. NY434 and the freeway again turn to match, proceeding generally eastward across an area of marshland along the southern edge of the river valley. Past the marsh, the valley swerves southward for a second time, taking the Susquehanna River and the two roads alongside it into an area with firmer <b>ground.</b> <b>Here,</b> NY434 begins to run along a line of homes and businesses that mark the northern edge of the hamlet of Apalachin.|$|E
25|$|The 1856 'Name Book' of the OS {{states that}} part of the house of Chapelton (NS 395 441) is {{believed}} to have been a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Though parts of the building are of great age, it is not certain that this was the chapel; it may have been the residence of the chaplain, while the chapel stood near Chapel Hill. This Chapel Hill is a circular artificial hill. About 1850, Mr. J McAlister raised it to its present height by taking the earth etc. that had slid from its sides, and putting it on the top. While doing this, a quantity of human bones was found near the base on the S and E sides, and also some stones which from their appearance Mr. McAlister thought had been exposed to fire, suggesting that the old chapel was destroyed by fire. Mr. R Miller, a former proprietor, stated that when the present road past Chapel Hill was being made, a quantity of bones was found, giving the idea that there had been a burial <b>ground</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} which Saxe {{had chosen}} to make his defence was naturally strong: the right of his army rested on Antoing, the centre on Fontenoy, and the left was covered by the Wood of Barry. This defensive line rested {{on the edge of}} a crest of high <b>ground.</b> <b>Here</b> lay the strength and advantage of Saxe's choice: the descent in many places along the position formed a natural glacis, and throughout the whole length, from Antoing to the wood, the prolonged slope offered an even and deadly field for cannon and musketry fire. This position was further strengthened by the construction of redoubts. Two were built along the Fontenoy-Barry gap, defended by two regiments of the Brigade of Eu, and each supplied with four cannons – the first breastwork (nearest Fontenoy), known as the Redoubt of Eu, played a central part in the battle. In the rear of these works and extending northeast to the village of Ramcroix stood the French left wing, including the six battalions of the Irish Brigade. Between Fontenoy and the larger village of Antoing on the French right a further three redoubts were built along the ridge-line. These defences were manned and supported by the regiments of Crillon, Bettens, Diesbach, and Biron, and three dismounted dragoon regiments. Antoing itself was defended by seven battalions, including four veteran battalions of Piedmont, and six guns. Additionally, six 12-pounders were mounted on the far side of the Scheldt facing Antoing, targeting the left flank of any force attacking in that quarter.|$|E

500|$|Alaska {{remained}} with TG 58.4 for the Battle of Okinawa. She {{was assigned to}} screen the carriers [...] and the fleet left Ulithi on 14 March and reached its operational area southeast of Kyushu four days later. The first air strikes on Okinawa began that day, and claimed 17 Japanese aircraft destroyed on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Here,</b> Alaska finally saw combat, as the Japanese launched a major air strike on the American fleet. Her anti-aircraft gunners destroyed a Yokosuka P1Y bomber attempting to crash into Intrepid. Shortly thereafter, Alaska was warned that American aircraft were in the vicinity. About ten minutes later, her gunners spotted an unidentified aircraft, approaching in {{what they thought was}} a threatening manner; they shot down {{what turned out to be}} an F6F Hellcat fighter, though the pilot was uninjured. Later that afternoon, Alaska shot down a second Japanese bomber, a Yokosuka D4Y.|$|E

2500|$|They were dragged to {{the nearby}} Casement Park sports <b>ground.</b> <b>Here</b> they were again beaten and {{stripped}} to their underpants and socks by {{a small group of}} men. According to the BBC and The Independent the men were also tortured. A search revealed that the men were British Army soldiers. Redemptorist priest Father Alec Reid, who later played a significant part in the peace process leading to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, intervened and attempted to get someone to call for an ambulance, but was dragged away and threatened with shooting if he didn't stand up; he was then pulled away from the men. [...] The corporals were further beaten and thrown over a high wall to be put into a waiting black taxi. It was driven off at speed, while camera crews captured one of its passengers waving a fist in the air.|$|E
