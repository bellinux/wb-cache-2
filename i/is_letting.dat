5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{development}} {{was motivated by}} the phrase 'Check on It' which Beyoncé and her management jokingly used before they decided {{to turn it into}} a song. [...] "Check on It" [...] is an R and hip hop song, which is instrumentally complete with a heavy bassline, strings, and wind instrument. Lyrically, it takes place in a club, where Beyoncé <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and look at her sexually attractive body when she is dancing. The song consists of two verse-raps by Slim Thug. [...] "Check on It" [...] was well received by contemporary music critics, who universally complimented Beyoncé's vocals, and the assertiveness with which she sings her lines.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} {{in their}} opinions when reviewing [...] "Help Is on the Way". Tim Newbound of Rock Sound described the piece as [...] "impressively structured and equally furious", while Evan Lucy of Billboard {{thought it was}} [...] "understated enough to capture radio attention and plenty explosive to please Rise Against's devoted fan base". Rob Parker of NME felt that [...] "Help Is on the Way" [...] and fellow Endgame track [...] "This <b>Is</b> <b>Letting</b> Go" [...] were able to [...] "strike the perfect balance between punk fury and melodic accessibility without losing any of frontman Tim McIlrath’s personality".

500|$|... "Check on It" [...] is an midtempo R and hip hop song, {{which makes}} use of a heavy bassline, strings, wind instrument, and {{frequent}} [...] "swinging pelvic taunts". According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the key of G major, and is set in common time at 83 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocal range spans from the low note A3 to the high note B5. According to Bill Lamb of About.com, Beyoncé adopts smooth and alluring vocals throughout [...] "Check on It". Lyrically, the song {{takes place in a}} dance club, where the female protagonist <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and look at her sexually attractive body when she is dancing. [...] "Check on It" [...] starts with a verse-rap from Slim Thug: [...] "Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas / Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it...". The rapper sounds like a 1975 Mercury Cougar turning over as he growls in his burly purr, as written by Bret McCabe of Baltimore City Paper.|$|E
500|$|While {{on the way}} to Starbase Armus IX for {{computer}} maintenance, the Enterprise arrives at the planet Omicron Theta, the site of a vanished colony where the starship Tripoli originally found the android Data (Brent Spiner). An away team travels to the surface and finds that what had been farmland is now barren with no trace of life in the soil. The team also finds a lab which they discover is where Dr. Noonien Soong, a formerly prominent but now discredited robotics designer, built Data. The team also find a disassembled android nearly identical to Data and return with it to the ship. As the course to the Starbase is resumed, the crew reassemble and reactivate Data's [...] "brother" [...] (also played by Brent Spiner) in sickbay. He refers to himself as Lore, and explains that Data was built first and he himself is the more perfect model. He feigns naiveté to the crew, but shows signs of being more intelligent than he <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> on. Later, in private, he tells Data that they were actually created in the opposite order, as the colonists became envious of his own perfection. He also explains that a crystalline space entity capable of stripping away all life force from a world was responsible for the colony's demise.|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} in Traveling Shoes, one that many critics overlook, is Angelou's {{love for her}} son. [...] The theme of {{motherhood}} is one of Angelou's most consistent themes throughout her series of autobiographies, although it does not overwhelm this book {{as it does in}} Gather Together in My Name and Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. [...] Motherhood is present in many of the book's subthemes—her relationship with her houseboy Kojo, her delight in being called [...] "Auntie" [...] by many African children, and her feelings toward [...] "Mother Africa". [...] Traveling Shoes begins with Guy's accident, his long recovery, and his mother's reaction to it, thus universalizing the fear of every parent—the death of a child. [...] The main character is a mother of a grown son, so liberation from the daily responsibilities of motherhood is emphasized, but it is complicated by the recognition that part of motherhood <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> go, something Angelou struggles with. [...] Confrontations between Angelou and Guy are minimal, consisting of their conflict over his choice of dating a much-older woman and of his demands for autonomy after she returns from the Genet tour. [...] Angelou seems to vacillate between wanting to supervise him and wanting to let go throughout this book. [...] In this way, as Lupton says, the motherhood theme, like the identity theme, is [...] "dual in nature".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy named [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] {{one of the}} [...] "10 tracks you need to hear", praising Minaj's vocal delivery, the inclusion of Soulja Boy, and the line [...] "Fix it, Jesus." [...] Colin Joyce of Spin called the song an [...] "unbridled joy", and noted that while {{it may not be}} included on The Pink Print, the album would be [...] "lucky, however, to feature any track half as exuberant as this one." [...] A writer for MTV News UK praised both the production and vocals on [...] "Yasss Bish", saying that Minaj's [...] "melodic" [...] vocals and [...] "fierce" [...] rap delivery were {{the best part of the}} song. Several critics noted a musical departure from the pop and dance-pop stylings of her second studio album [...] (2012). MTV News writer Emilee Lindner said [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] found Minaj going back to her original sound, saying: [...] "Nicki Minaj <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> her rapping speak for itself. She's left her colorful wigs, fancy robes and tutus behind — along with the hyper-pop production of some of her biggest hits — and now she's getting back to her roots." [...] Emma Goddard of Bustle praised the chemistry between the two rappers and saw the song as a change from the more upbeat sound found in Minaj's catalogue, which she credited with [...] "show her rapping prowess much more". Writing for The Source, Khari said of [...] "Yasss Bish": [...] " [...] sheds the wig and the excessive make-up, we get the most gorgeous Nicki we've seen in her career.

2500|$|... "Piece by Piece" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics, who promulgated {{it as one}} of the album's highlights for its lyrical content. Reviewing for Billboard, Jamieson Cox regarded the song as a raw and standout vocal showcase, saying that when Clarkson forges a real emotional connection with the track, it allows the album to transcend hammier and hackneyed moments in between. In his review for The New York Times, Pareles described it as the album's most accusatory song; and noted that despite the lyrical's vulnerability, its music rises quickly to bombast, triumphal and glamorous but remote. He also lamented that those moments are far too few in the album. Writing for AXS on its release, Chase Hunt singled out [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] as the one that feels more natural {{than the rest of the}} album's tracks. He wrote that songs penned by Clarkson, or any artist writing their own songs, feels different. And that the track <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> listeners into her soul while telling more of her story, past and present.|$|E

Might the man who loves her completely destroy her life?" [...] It was also reported in November that Derek would be killed off from the series at Christmas, and it was speculated that he would be murdered. Alfie and Kat were both named as suspects, amongst many others, with Soaplife saying that if Derek is Kat's lover, he might turn violent if she continues to reject him and she might be forced to kill him, or Alfie might find out that Derek is Kat's lover and murder him in revenge, referring back to Richie's reminders that Alfie had been in jail and would want to harm Kat's lover. In fact, Alfie quickly became the favourite with bookmakers William Hill.|$|E

[...] With a rating of 7/10 (flawed yet worthy), Spin magazine's Chris Norris said: [...] "Since Janet is State-of-the-art production right down to her sculpted nose, {{it makes sense that}} she should call her retrospective Design. As the studio team that wrought Control, Rhythm Nation and janet. (which for record-label reasons is under-represented here), designers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are unofficial second and third Janet Jacksons. Their triumph <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> their dazzling sound sculptures fade into the background of Janet's cartoon antics." [...] Elysa Gardner with [...] Vibe magazine was in high praise of Design of a Decade, as well as Jackson herself, stating, [...] "It's been almost 10 years since Janet Jackson announced that her first name wasn't Baby, and it's easy to forget what a bold proclamation that was coming from a woman—particularly a black woman—at that time [...] Only two women were there to remind the rest of us that there was power and freedom in feminine sexuality—to reinforce the fact that we could be adorable and flirtatious and strong and assertive. And Madonna wasn't a sista. [...] The 16 songs on her greatest hits package 1986/1996: Design of a Decade—which includes two strong new singles—trace a young woman's progression from questioning others' authority to reveling in her own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 64 is a {{great example}} of why people always say [...] "You should never let your past {{interfere}} with your present". Barret argues that sonnet 64 [...] "provides an example of past-oriented natural habitats that might interfere with the productive considerations of the future". In other words, because the speaker <b>is</b> <b>letting</b> the past overwhelm his thoughts, he therefore cannot think positively about the future due to past habits or tendencies. Unlike some of the other sonnets addressed to the young man, sonnet 64 moves toward a feeling of the lover's exposure to the risk of being destroyed. Barret also argues that the phonetic play between ruminate and ruinate is as she says an [...] "underscore a relationship inherent in the poem’s logic", [...] "Each quatrain of the sonnet open with the same construction — [...] "When I have seen" [...] — yet these statements are never met with a summational [...] "then", so the temporal ambiguity the phrase creates the remains unresolved: Does the speaker gesture toward repeated past actions ('in the instances that I have seen') or forward to a causational limit point ('once I have seen')?". When we read the lines that pertain to the waves and the shore, [...] "at times the waves are winning against the shore, and then at times the shore is winning against the waves", the speaker almost speaks in a tone of confidence and determination to not let time control his life. Although when he goes to say Time will take my love away we begin {{to get a sense of}} uncertainty within the speaker. This uncertainty within the speaker is described by Barret when she argues [...] "The sonnet registers temporal matters in personal terms; the couplet never corrects the poem's grammatically obscured engagement with time, but instead introduces a paralyzing temporal collapse: the present moment becomes overwhelmed by an anticipation of future loss—an extreme version of 'I miss you already.'.... The ruin/ruminate pairing bespeaks a suspicion of an imagined time spent looking back".|$|E
