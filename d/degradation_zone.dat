40|$|The harpacticoid copepod fauna {{associated}} with the coral <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> of Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) reefs was investigated {{for the first time}} in the Porcupine Seabight (NE Atlantic). The species list of the coral <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> includes 157 species, 62 genera and 19 families, and the most species-rich families were Ectinosomatidae (36 species), Ameiridae (29 species) and Argestidae (17 species). At least 80 % of the species were considered new to science. Most of the 23 known species have been reported from NE Atlantic coastlines and from higher latitudes in northern Subpolar and Polar Seas. At the family level, the harpacticoid fauna in the Porcupine Seabight did not seem to differ markedly from other deep-sea areas, with essentially the same abundant families. However, the presence of typically epifaunal taxa indicates that the hard substrates of the coral <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> provide an exceptional habitat. Further, harpacticoid composition and diversity of sediment and coral fragments were compared with similar substrates in a tropical reef lagoon (Zanzibar, Tanzania). Both regions harboured different fauna and the difference between coral and sediment was more obvious in the tropical lagoon.

40|$|Abstract The {{influence}} of microhabitat type on the diver sity and community {{structure of the}} harpacticoid copepod fauna associated with a cold-water coral <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> was investigated in the Porcupine Seabight (North-East Atlantic). Three substrate types were distinguished: dead fragments of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa, skele tons of the glass sponge Aphrocallistes bocagei and the underlying sediment. At the family level, it appears that coral fragments and underlying sediment do not harbour distinctly different assemblages, with Ectinosomatidae, Ameiridae, Pseudotachidiidae, Argestidae and Miraciidae as most abundant. Conclusions on assemblage structure and diversity of the sponge skeletons are limited as only two samples were available. Similarity analysis at species level showed a strong variation in the sediment samples, which did not harbour a distinctly different assemblage in opposi tion to the coral and sponge samples. Several factors (sedi ment infill on the hard substrates, mobility of the copepods, limited sample sizes) are proposed to explain this apparent lack of a distinct difference between the microhabitats. Coral fragments and sediment were both characterised by high species diversity and low species dominance, which might indicate that copepod diversity is not substantially influenced by hydrodynamical stress.

40|$|The {{metazoan}} meiofauna {{associated with}} Lophelia pertusa reef <b>degradation</b> <b>zones</b> in the Belgica mound province (Porcupine Seabight, North-East Atlantic) was {{studied in the}} framework of the Atlantic Coral Ecosystem Study (ACES; EC Fifth Framework Research Program). Attention was focused on the influence of and differences between different microhabitat types: dead coral fragments, glass sponge skeletons and the underlying sediment. This study demonstrates the importance of dead Lophelia pertusa framework and associated substrates for meiofauna along the European continental margins. The presence of these large biogenic structures on the sea floor of the continental margin (1) enables more taxa to be present and (2) particularly favors harpacticoid copepods, naupliar larvae and polychaetes. The meio-epifaunal community on these substrates significantly differs from the meio-infaunal community in the underlying sediment. This is mainly due to a much lower dominance of nematodes and a higher relative abundance of most other taxa, especially harpacticoids, naupliar larvae and polychaetes, in the latter habitat. This situation is comparable to that of epiphytic assemblages. Dominance of nematodes is low. The meio-infaunal assemblage in the underlying sediment is characterized by low densities. There are clear indications that cold-water coral <b>degradation</b> <b>zones</b> are biologically very diverse, in terms of species richness as well as equitability. Of all microhabitat types, coral fragments support the most diverse communities, whereas the underlying sediment is the least diverse...|$|R

To discuss dispersive capacities and the occurrence of cryptic species in meiobenthic organisms. Porcupine Seabight (north-east Atlantic Ocean; continental slope) and a transect along the Kenyan coast (Indian Ocean; shallow lagoon). In the north-east Atlantic, dead coral fragments, sponge skeletons and sediment were collected with a boxcorer. Along the Kenyan coast, dead coral fragments and coral gravel were collected during snorkelling and skin diving. Only nematodes belonging to the families Epsilonematidae and Draconematidae were considered. Community structure was analysed using multivariate techniques. Biodiversity was represented via rarefaction curves. Additive partitioning of species diversity was conducted. Turnover between microhabitats within locations and between locations within microhabitats were compared in a ternary plot. Twelve epsilonematid and five draconematid species {{were found in the}} Porcupine Seabight. In Kenya, 39 epsilonematid and 20 draconematid species were distinguished. Three species were found at both sampling locations. A table with the known distribution of all currently described species encountered in our study area is provided. At both sampling locations, the communities on coral fragments were significantly different from those in the other microhabitats, and were most diverse. In Kenya, species richness was mainly determined by local diversity and by turnover between localities. The contribution of beta-diversity decreased when abundance data were analysed. Turnover between microhabitats and between coral samples from different localities was higher than turnover between locations for gravel samples. Coral fragments were recognized as favourable substrata for typically epifaunal nematodes. Species-specific habitat preferences were explained by finely tuned morphological adaptations. Our results suggest that cosmopolitan species could well be cryptic species, and this explanation for the existence of morphologically identical nematodes in geographically distant areas is weighed up against other plausible explanations.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The Red Light Bolson lies in Trans-Pecos Texas. Two sets of earth fissures of differing age are present in the fine-grained alluvium which fills the bolson. These fissures are characterized by a continuous to discontinuous series of elongate, shallow surface depressions and a vegetation lineament. Collapse of a shallow subsurface cavity, which formed through erosional degradation of surficial soils overlying a fracture in a relatively impermeable calcrete, most likely created the observed surface characteristics. To test this hypothesis, surface and shallow subsurface investigations were conducted. The collapse depressions of the older fissures are mainly continuous and rounded in profile. They average 4. 5 and 2. 5 ft in width and depth, respectively, and exhibit an average width to depth ratio (W/D) of 2. 18. The vegetation lineaments of the older fissures are continuous. The collapse depressions of the younger fissures are discontinuous and rectangular in profile. They average 2. 7 and 3. 6 ft in width and depth, respectively, and exhibit an average W/D of 0. 62. The vegetation lineaments of the younger fissures are predominantly discontinuous. The surficial soils exposed in a trench excavated across a young fissure included an A horizon of clayey to silty, fine-grained sand, and a stage 111, fine-grained K horizon. An older, stage IV, gravelly K horizon was exposed below the upper calcrete. A cavity was present below an uncollapsed portion of the fissure at the excavation site. This cavity was located in the upper portion of the upper calcrete. The upper calcrete was highly degraded below the cavity. A fracture was present in the lower calcrete below the <b>degradation</b> <b>zone.</b> The bedding and grain-size characteristics of the <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> and fracture fill indicate that the fracture in the lower calcrete leads to the observed surface characteristics by permitting downward migration of water and soil particles.

These depressions capture runoff which migrates downward through the fracture. The high moisture infiltration leads to prolific vegetation growth along the fissure trace...|$|E

Differences in sediment characteristics were more important in structuring the nematode assemblages than diVerences between the coralline sediment and coral fragments. No effect related to the three-dimensional structure of coral fragments was found. Differences between nematode assemblages in the coralline sediment and on coral fragments were attributed to the exposed nature of the latter habitat, its large surface area and its microbial or algal cover.

40|$|Coral reefs are {{important}} hot spots of biodiversity, {{but despite the}} problems related to their conservation, studies on meiobenthic biodiversity are scarce. This paper provides a preliminary overview of the meiofauna and nematodes inhabiting coral sediments in the outer reef and lagoon habitats of the Maldives, and investigates their relationships with micro-habitat type. The abundance and community structure of the meiofauna and nematodes reveal significant differences between stations. Coral fragments and rubble from the outer reefs seem {{to act as a}} trap for the finest sediment, which might contribute to creating a heterogeneous micro-habitat suitable for both epifaunal (Epsilonematidae and Draconematidae genera) and sediment-dwelling (Tricoma, Richtersia, Ptycholaimellus and Molgolaimus) taxa. On the other side, the lagoon’s sediments are mainly colonized by dwelling taxa, probably due to the low-flow regime that enhances the deposition of organic matter and pelite fractions. A high level of diversity was recorded in both the habitats studied. Among the factors that probably determine the high diversity in the lagoon is the presence of small biogenic structures. These are characterized by a high degree of angularity, which might add more complexity to the habitat. The nematodes reveal an overlap in the taxonomic composition between the Maldives and other geographically distant areas, possibly supporting the existence of iso-communities that are typical of the coral <b>degradation</b> <b>zone.</b> Nematode trophic composition reflects differences in availability of food resources; epigrowth and non-selective deposit feeders are dominant in the lagoon, while selective deposit and epistrate feeders are dominant in the outer reefs...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The Compression After Impact (CAI) {{strength}} of polymeric composites after long term elevated temperature aging is studied. Aging temperatures range from 149 ∘C to 204 ∘C (300 ∘F to 400 ∘F). Two types of matrix material are studied, a thermoset bismaleimide (5260) and a thermoplastic polyimide (K 3 B). Glass transition temperature (Tg) and fracture toughness are measured after aging. Microscopy and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) {{are used to}} evaluate the aged composites. Out-of-plane bending of the CAI specimens during compression is measured by shadow moire. Moire interferometry is used to determine in-plane displacement and strain fields around the impact damage. Results show that the CAI strength degrades with aging for both K 3 B and 5260. The 5260 matrix suffers from thermo-oxidative degradation at higher temperatures. Surface decomposition causes weight loss and reduces mechanical properties. The CAI {{strength of}} the K 3 B matrix composite also decreases after aging. Evidence of an oxidation reaction is found in the K 3 B polymer by SIMS, but no weight loss is associated with this chemical reaction. Measured changes in fracture toughness and Tg do not correlate with CAI strength degradation. Stiffness changes due to aging are insignificant in this study. The degradation region is measured by microscopy near the surface of composites after long aging times. The depth of the <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> is dependent on aging time. Degradation growth is modeled with finite elements using diffusion/reaction governing equations. Finite element results agree well with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Perchlorate {{has entered}} human and {{environmental}} food chains and {{has received a}} great deal of attention because of its toxicity to humans. In this study, chemical degradation of perchlorate was investigated using partially oxidized titanium ions (Ti 2 + and Ti 3 +) in solutions and as part of an ion exchange membrane reactor system. Aqueous titanium ions (Ti 2 + and Ti 3 +) were applied to remove perchlorate ions and its destructive mechanism, reaction kinetics, and the effect of environmental factors were investigated. Titanium ions were able to degrade perchlorate ions very rapidly with half life less than one hour under conditions of high acid concentrations. A new reactor system with an ion exchange membrane was adapted to apply better the reactions of perchlorate destruction to water treatment practice. A novel treatment method was developed by integrating partially oxidized titanium ions with an ion exchange membrane, and it is named the Titanium and Membrane Hybrid System (TMH System). The results shown in this research demonstrate the feasibility of TMH System for perchlorate reduction. The perchlorate ions were rapidly adsorbed onto the ion exchange membrane and diffused through it, but they were reduced by titanium ions in the <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> relatively slowly. To enhance the overall rate of reaction, high concentrations of acid and Ti(III) are needed, but transport of hydrogen ions through the anion permeable membrane was observed and would be greater at higher acid concentrations. The proposed mathematical model predicts the performance and behavior of the TMH system for different physical and chemical conditions. It successfully described adsorption, diffusion and reduction of perchlorate in the system. This model could be used as an important tool for process design and optimization...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of lignin peroxidase during degradation of both wood and woody fragments {{by the white}} rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was investigated by using anti-lignin peroxidase in conjunction with postembedding transmission electron microscopy and immuno-gold labeling techniques. The enzyme was localized in the peripheral regions of the fungal cell cytoplasm {{in association with the}} cell membrane, fungal cell wall, and extracellular slime materials. In solid wood, lignin peroxidase was detected in low concentrations associated with both superficial and <b>degradation</b> <b>zones</b> within secondary cell walls undergoing fungal attack. A similar but much greater level of extracellular peroxidase activity was associated with wood fragments degraded by the fungus grown under liquid culture conditions optimal for production of the enzyme. Efforts to infiltrate degraded wood pieces with high levels of lignin peroxidase showed the enzyme to be restricted to superficial regions of wood decay and to penetrate wood cell walls only where the wall structure had been modified. In this respect the enzyme was able to penetrate characteristic <b>zones</b> of <b>degradation</b> within the secondary walls of fibers to sites of lignin attack. This suggests a possibility for a close substrate-enzyme association during wood cell wall degradation...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{behaviors}} and a xylanolytic-cellulolytic enzyme system of Tepidimicrobium xylanilyticum BT 14 towards xylan-rich plant biomass degradation were characterized. During the exponential growth phase, the bacterial cells were bound tightly {{to the growth}} substrate where the <b>degradation</b> <b>zones</b> appeared mostly around the cells, indicating that the xylanolytic-cellulolytic enzyme system {{was linked to the}} cell surfaces. Interestingly, several cells appeared to secrete extracellular matrix to connect to their neighbors, and the matrix disappeared when cells passed to the stationary growth phase. Cationized-ferritin staining resulted in a dense assembly of bulbs, protuberance-like structures on the growing bacterial cell surfaces. The cell-associated proteins derived by sonication contained predominated xylanase with relatively low carboxymethyl-cellulase (CMCase) activities, suggesting that the xylanolytic-cellulolytic enzyme system occurred as a cell-associated enzyme. By means of gel-filtration chromatography, a high molecular mass protein with the estimated size of 2000 kDa was retrieved from the cell-associated enzymes, and it appeared as a single protein band on non-denaturing gel. However, more bands were obtained after the protein was boiled with sodium dodecyl sulfate and β-mercaptoethanol – which contained 4 xylanases and one CMCase – suggesting that these proteins were organized as a multienzyme complex (MEC) in natural form. Additionally, the predominated xylanolytic MEC preferred binding to cellulose rather than xylan...|$|R
40|$|Contamination in low {{permeability}} soils poses a significant technical challenge to in-situ remediation efforts. Poor accessibility to the contaminants and difficulty in delivery of treatment reagents have rendered existing in-situ treatments such as bioremediation, vapor extraction, pump and treat rather ineffective {{when applied to}} {{low permeability}} soils present at many contaminated sites. This technology is an integrated in-situ treatment in which established geotechnical methods are used to install <b>degradation</b> <b>zones</b> directly in the contaminated W and electro-osmosis is utilized to move the contaminants {{back and forth through}} those zones until the treatment is completed. This topical report summarizes the results of the lab and pilot sized Lasagna{trademark} experiments conducted at Monsanto. Experiments were conducted with kaofinite and an actual Paducah soil in units ranging from bench-scale containing kg-quantity of soil to pilot-scale containing about half a ton of soil having various treatment zone configurations. The obtained data support the feasibility of scaling up this technology with respect to electrokinetic parameters as well as removal of organic contaminants. A mathematical model was developed that was successful in predicting the temperature rises in the soil. The information and experience gained from these experiments along with the modeling effort enabled us to successfully design and operate a larger field experiment at a DOE TCE-contaminated clay site...|$|R
40|$|In 1988, {{an area of}} landslides, {{known as}} The Roughs, {{situated}} on the Lower Greensand Escarpment, in the Wealden district of South Kent, started moving, after {{an extended period of}} stability. The Roughs had degraded to a low angled slope since being abandoned by the sea. This thesis undertakes to discover what triggered this reactivation, to clarify the mechanisms, magnitude and rate of the landslides and deduce the significance of the reactivation on other dormant landslides in the UK. The investigation was approached by the undertaking of a detailed desk study, a comprehensive series of fieldwork campaigns, and a statistical analysis of rainfall and a stability analysis of the slope. Although many investigations have been carried out in and around the research site, this thesis further contributes to the knowledge of the subject in the following ways. i	Confirmation of detail in the geotechnics of land movement and how they relate to geological structure in the Lower Greensand Escarpment, Bilsington to Folkestone. 	ii. 	New geological sections through The Roughs. 	iii. 	Indications of the topographic; hydrological and other reasons for the exact location and extent of landslide activity in 1988 and later. 	iv. 	Qualitative discussion on the concept of cyclic variations in the factor of safety. 	v. 	Quantitative analysis of the effect of wet weather periods on The Roughs. 	vi.

40|$|NonWOSInternational audienceAdhesive bonding is {{becoming}} a widely used assembling process in the naval field; it can allow great productivity, simplify design constraints and can lead, in general, to a significant weight reduction. Unfortunately, this technology is not completely mastered; parameters like the cure process, size of defects, joint adhesive thickness variations, size of parts to be assembled and non-linear behaviour of the adhesive joint, {{have to be considered}} to assess the risks and predict the service life. Moreover, for naval applications adapted state functions have to be proposed in order to take into account this variability of material properties, the time dependency of parameters like damage, solicitations or loads. Under these assumptions, time-independent reliability is insufficient to allow a pertinent-related failure probability calculation. The solution of such a problem can be given by the use of time-dependent reliability tools. This passes through coupling structural reliability software evaluation with a non-linear finite element code. This choice requires robust mechanical models able to describe the behaviour of naval structure with an acceptable numerical cost in order to perform the reliability study. This paper presents a time variant reliability approach based on the PHI 2 method. Cohesive-zone models are used to model the adhesive. This choice allows limiting the numerical cost of simulations and permits us to model the non-linear behaviour of adhesive. It also presents a good compromise between numerical costs and quality of results. The damage at the interface can be modelled and it has been proven that using cohesive zone models is well suited for bonded joints as the possible <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> is well defined. In order to determine the cohesive zone model parameters, tests were performed. The most relevant results are presented. Different numerical results showing the feasibility of this approach for adhesively bonded assemblies are discussed and the case of a representative part of a naval structure has been studied in this paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of Akanthepsilonema and the first-stage {{juvenile}} of Glochinema trispinatum are described. Furthermore, additional morphological information is provided for Triepsilonema tripapillata. Animals originate from a cold-water coral <b>degradation</b> <b>zone</b> in the Porcupine Seabight area (North-East Atlantic Ocean). Akanthepsilonema sinecornibus sp. n. differs from A. helleouetae in number of body annules, sexual dimorphism in amphid size, absence of copulatory thorns in males, absence of large spines and horns, shape of the copulatory apparatus, and position of ambulatory setae relative to vulva in females. The genus diagnosis for Akanthepsilonema is adjusted to incorporate the new species. Akanthepsilonema mainly differs froth every other genus in the family by the combination of six rows of ambulatory setae situated around the vulva in females and eight subcephalic setae not displaced toward the anterior part of the head capsule. Small differences between the Papua New Guinea and the Porcupine Seabight populations of T. tripapillata indicate minimal intraspecific variability. Second-stage juveniles from Papua New Guinea have two rows of three ambulatory setae, whereas Porcupine Seabight specimens have two rows of four ambulatory setae. First- and fourth-stage juveniles of T. tripapillata are described for the first time. Literature data and personal observations showed that the molting of first-stage juveniles into second-stage juveniles and of third-stage juveniles into fourth-stage juveniles involves {{a decrease in the}} number of body rings, resulting in a loss of flexibility which is possibly compensated for by the development (I-II) or the doubling of the number of rows (III-IV) of ambulatory setae. This decrease is also linked with the formation of the head capsule and the smooth tail tip, although intergeneric variability is evident. The molting of second-stage juveniles into third-stage juveniles and of fourth-stage,juveniles into adults is also subject to intergeneric variability. The variability in the number and orientation of caudal gland outlets among different nematode taxa is discussed. The presence of separate outlets for the caudal glands seems to be widespread within the family Epsilonematidae and has also been observed in various other, unrelated taxa of free-living aquatic nematodes, although their arrangement in Epsilonematidae is opposite. This aberrant arrangement is probably related to the aberrant locomotory pattern in this family...|$|E

Specifically, the scope of this study was limited to vertical configuration emplacements. Several promising alternatives were identified ranging from approaches involving standard excavation techniques to relatively specialized geotechnical construction methods which could be modified for the treatment zone emplacement purpose. Information developed in this report is designed to help the user select the most promising emplacement method(s) for a given site on the basis of (1) depth of emplacement, and (2) restrictions on handling excavated soils. Advantages, disadvantages, and estimated costs are identified for each alternative, and possible bases for improvement and cost reduction through further development are described...|$|R
40|$|Fretting wear in {{aluminium}} alloy AA 5754 joined by self-pierce riveting (SPR), {{a relatively new}} fastening technique increasingly used in vehicle structures, has been investigated in this paper. Surface damages have been induced when a joint experienced a sinusoidal cyclic tension-tension load. Various <b>degradation</b> <b>zones</b> have been characterised in the contact surfaces between the aluminium sheets, {{as well as the}} rivet and the locked sheet. Subsequent examination of the fretting scars at the contact surfaces and through the cross-section has been carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopies. The fretting patterns in the self-piercing riveted joints have been identified. It was noted that fretting wear was initially patchy and layers of compacted debris were created as fretting continued. An Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the fretting debris from the interface between the rivet and the aluminium sheet revealed the presence of Al, Fe, Si, C and O so that it is suggested that intimate mixing of debris from the {{aluminium alloy}} and the steel rivet had occurred. The effects of testing conditions such as the load magnitude and the number of loading cycles on the fretting wear patterns were also studied. Metallographic examination has shown that these fretting zones are critical with respect to fretting crack nucleation. The test results have shown that joint fracture initiates at these critical zones...|$|R
