25|$|The arms of Cumbria County Council {{were granted}} by the College of Arms on 10 October 1974. The arms {{represent}} the areas from which the new county council's area was put together; the shield's <b>green</b> <b>border</b> has Parnassus flowers representing Cumberland interspersed with roses; red for Lancashire (the Furness district) on white for Yorkshire (Sedbergh is from the West Riding). The crest is a ram's head crest, found in the arms both of Westmorland County Council and Barrow County Borough, with Cumberland's Parnassus flowers again. The supporters are the legendary Dacre Bull (Cumberland) and a red dragon, redolent of Cumbria's Brittonic origin.(Appleby in Westmorland). They stand on a base compartment representing Hadrian's Wall (in Cumberland), crossed with two red bars (from the Westmorland arms).|$|E

500|$|The Portuguese naval jack (jaco or jaque) is only hoisted at {{the prow}} of docked or {{anchored}} Navy ships, from sunrise to sunset. The national flag is permanently hoisted at the stern, when sailing, and from sunrise to sunset, when docked. It is a square flag (ratio 1:1) bearing a green-bordered red field with the minor {{coat of arms}} on the centre. The width of the <b>green</b> <b>border</b> and {{the diameter of the}} armillary sphere are equal to [...] and [...] of the side's dimension, respectively.|$|E
500|$|The platforms' {{color scheme}} {{consists}} of a light sage green trim line on a black border with [...] "75TH AVE" [...] tiled in white lettering on a black border beneath them. The name tablets have [...] "75TH AVE." [...] in white IND-custom font on a black background with a lighter <b>green</b> <b>border</b> as above. Beneath them are directional signs in white lettering on a black border.

500|$|This {{underground}} station has two tracks and one island platform. Both track walls have a lime green trim {{line with a}} medium Kelly <b>green</b> <b>border.</b> Small [...] "205" [...] signs are placed below them at regular intervals. The platform has a row of concrete-clad I-beam columns on both sides; these are painted medium Hunter green. There is clear evidence of water damage and mold due to poor drainage in numerous areas along the platform ceiling, the wall tiles, and {{to a number of}} the support columns. The station is also notorious for having piles of trash bags on the platform and at entrances, as well as for large amounts of litter on the tracks due to an absence of trash cans. 205th Street station was declared one of the five worst in the system in terms of maintenance and appearance by the New York City Transit Riders Council in 2005, problems which have persisted into the 2010s.|$|E

2500|$|The border {{has only}} been changed four times since 1927: The issue {{released}} shortly after the September 11 attacks on the United States featured a black border to symbolize mourning. However, this edition was a special [...] "extra" [...] edition published quickly for the breaking news of the event; the next regularly scheduled issue contained the red border. Additionally, the April 28, 2008 Earth Day issue, dedicated to environmental issues, contained a <b>green</b> <b>border.</b> The next change in border was in the September 19, 2011 issue, commemorating the 10th anniversary of September 11 attacks with a metallic silver border. The most recent change (again with a silver border) was in the December 31, 2012 issue, noting Barack Obama's selection as Person of the Year.|$|E
2500|$|The 313th's {{coat of arms}} was {{approved}} on 12 October 1925 and its distinctive unit insignia {{was approved}} on 5 August 1927. Both were rescinded on 2 February 1959. The distinctive unit insignia included a 1 1/8 in (2.86 cm) gold colored metal and enamel device, which consisted of shield with a half yellow, half <b>green</b> <b>border.</b> The center of the shield included a counterchanged red and yellow star. The colors of the shield symbolized the regiment's service as cavalry, artillery, and then cavalry. The star represented Texas, where it was organized, and the green and yellow border represented its service on the southwestern border. The regimental motto, [...] "We Also Serve", {{was attached to the}} bottom of the distinctive unit insignia. The regimental coat of arms was of a similar design to the distinctive unit insignia but included the Organized Reserve's Minuteman crest above the shield and omitted the motto.|$|E

2500|$|The {{outermost}} pair of tracks—the Fulton Street local tracks (Tracks A1 and A2)—and {{the outer}} two island platforms {{are no longer}} used in revenue service. To the west, the tracks continue under Schermerhorn Street to the decommissioned Court Street station, currently {{the site of the}} New York Transit Museum, in Brooklyn Heights. Track A2 is currently out of service for the storage of trains at the New York Transit Museum. Though {{it may be difficult to}} see in some of the unlighted portions of the station, a tile band is present on the trackside walls–similar in color to the Crosstown Line stations north to Flushing Avenue, and the Fulton Line stations east to Franklin Avenue–Lime (Nile) Green with a medium Kelly <b>Green</b> <b>border,</b> set in a three-high course consistent with many IND express stations. Captions reading [...] "HOYT" [...] are present in white lettering on a black background, with no mention of [...] "Schermerhorn". On the eastbound (southern) side, some of these captions have been stickered-over with different station names as required for film and TV shoots, though both sides have been used for filming. Both northern platforms have green-painted steel I-beams, while the beams on both southern platforms are tiled. Much of the ceiling at platform level is peeling due to water damage.|$|E

She traded among dark islands on a blue reef-scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the {{taffrail}} and at her masthead a house-flag, also red, but with a <b>green</b> <b>border</b> and with a white crescent in it. For an Arab owned her, and a Syed at that. Hence the <b>green</b> <b>border</b> on the flag. He {{was the head of}} a great House of Straits Arabs, but as loyal a subject of the complex British Empire as you could find east of the Suez Canal. World politics did not trouble him at all, but he had a great occult power amongst his own people.|$|E
