25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us <b>have</b> <b>anybody</b> to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

He stated in 2010: [...] "I {{want to make a}} {{difference}} in Canada with [...] I feel if I were to achieve my goals it could make a great difference to the growth of tennis in Canada and help to produce more top players in the future." [...] Before a Davis Cup tie with Japan in 2015, he said: [...] "I'm here because I want to be here. I don't <b>have</b> <b>anybody</b> telling me I need to be here. I want to succeed at this event, and I want to succeed representing Canada." ...|$|E
500|$|Former Batman {{writer and}} editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have {{expressed}} disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, [...] "e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals... We didn't <b>have</b> <b>anybody</b> like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective {{in a way that}} didn't involve violence." [...] However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, [...] "Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration." [...] Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that [...] "imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm sure her work will be wonderful." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} their upcoming album, vocalist Gregg Allman was {{also working on}} his solo album, Laid Back, and the sessions occasionally overlapped. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Allman and Betts took turns caring for Oakley, taking him outdoors to places like the zoo {{to keep him from}} drinking as much. [...] "Time and time again, I have sat and wondered, 'God, what in the hell could I have done, what could <b>have</b> <b>anybody</b> have done, to help him?'" [...] said Allman. Upon Leavell's entry into the group, Oakley {{went out of his way}} to make the new member comfortable. On November 11, 1972, overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, Showgirls {{is shown}} at midnight movies {{alongside}} {{such films as}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. It is heralded {{as one of the}} best [...] "bad movies", a camp classic in the vein of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Although the film was not successful when first released theatrically, it generated more than $100 million from video rentals and became one of MGM's top 20 all-time bestsellers. Verhoeven accepted the film's unexpected cult status, saying [...] "Maybe this kind of ritualistic cult popularity isn't what I intended, but it's like a resurrection after the crucifixion." [...] Eszterhas, however, maintains that the humor was intentional: [...] "What Paul [...] and I had in mind was something darkly funny. We went through the script line by line, and we were really laughing at some of it. I defy people to tell me that a line like, 'How does it feel not to <b>have</b> <b>anybody</b> coming on you anymore' isn't meant to be funny." ...|$|E

6000|$|CONRAD. Yes: {{the fellows}} you call men of science. The {{people who make}} money by it, and their medical hangers-on. But <b>has</b> <b>anybody</b> been right? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] ses Miss Tucker; [...] "I don’t {{think that}} it’s that exactly, but, you see, I couldn’t <b>’ave</b> <b>anybody</b> else. Not {{for their own}} sakes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{not going}} to <b>have</b> <b>anybody</b> {{following}} me around and trying to boss me. I've had all of that I'm going to stand!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nor <b>has</b> <b>anybody</b> else, {{so far as}} I can learn. There's another point--the {{land agent}} talked of a tall, stoutish man. You wouldn't call Prescott that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nor have I. I wouldn't {{it should}} have {{happened}} for all I own in the world,' said the dragoon. 'Have you spoke to Anne Garland to-day--or <b>has</b> <b>anybody</b> been talking to her?' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{found it}} quite easy to {{become acquainted with}} Miss Ruth Enderton, as she was very much {{inclined}} to conversation. [...] "It's ever so long," [...] she said, [...] "since I've <b>had</b> <b>anybody</b> to talk to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Course I {{believe in}} it on principle, but I don't propose to <b>have</b> <b>anybody</b> telling me what I got to think and do. No American 'll ever stand for that!" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Nowhere in {{the world}} <b>has</b> <b>anybody</b> come across such an {{extensive}} chain of rock arts with little interruption. What's exciting is most petroglyphs are intact," [...] internationally acclaimed paleontologist and former RASI secretary G L Badam told TOI.|$|R

6000|$|... "Good. You've got to {{get into}} the brown-canvas pack that's patched with moose-hide. You'll find a few pounds of lumpy gold. You've never seen gold like it in the country, nor <b>has</b> <b>anybody</b> else. Here's what you've got to do. Listen." ...|$|R

6000|$|Willy dried her eyes, {{and then}} she said, [...] "There's another {{practical}} thing I'm thinking of,--there isn't any breakfast, and the cook's gone! But I believe we can arrange that.
