It was our goal to conduct a multidisciplinary literature review. <b>Following</b> <b>the</b> <b>three-stage</b> approach proposed by Webster and Watson (2002), our methodology for identifying information privacy publications proceeded in three stages. First, we performed a search spanning the information systems, social sciences, law, marketing, organization theory, and economics literatures...|$|R
40|$|Using data {{collected}} from eight bank branches in India, this study examines how the trust between branch manager and loan officer begins and develops in multiple stages {{over a period of}} time. It seeks to fill an important gap in the academic literature on the development of trust between trustor and trusted {{over a period of time}} by empirically examining the trust relationship between branch manager and loan officer in a bank. The results of the cross case qualitative analysis conducted on stages of trust development using pattern matching technique suggest that trust relationship between branch manager and loan officer <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> <b>three-stage</b> model of Lewicki and Bunker (1996) with certain deviations applicable only to describe the relationship examined in this study. This study contributes to the literature by exploring the mechanism of trust development between branch manager and loan officer of bank branches in India through a case study and enriching the model of Lewicki and Bunker (1996) ...|$|R

The purpose of a formative evaluation was {{to determine how the}} prototype could be improved to benefit its users. <b>The</b> evaluation procedure <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> <b>three-stage</b> model developed by Alessi & Trollip (1991); namely the Quality Review, the Pilot Test and a Validative Stage. The Quality Review with subject matter experts and instructional design expert comments was completed in November 1995. This project focused on the Pilot Test with three students and the Validation Stage with twelve students. Protocol analyses and semi-structured interviews were used to answer the validation question: How do Dene and non-Dene students in grades five and six learn about the facts and layers from the "Rainforests of the World" software prototype? Individual students sat with the investigator at the rain forest computer program. Students thought aloud as they used the program to learn about rainforests of the world.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} research question in regional economic development, is why some regions {{are able to}} diversify into new products and industries, while others continue to face challenges in diversification? This doctorate research explores the different pathways to diversification. It <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> <b>three-stage</b> modular structure of DBA for Cranfield School of Management. This thesis consists of a systematic literature review, a single qualitative case study on UAE, and a research synthesis of published cases on Singapore, Norway and UAE. The linking document provides {{a summary of the}} three projects and consolidates findings and contributions into a path creation model that provides new understanding on the pathways to regional diversifications. This research integrates existing theoretical foundations of evolutionary economic geography, institutional economic geography, path dependence, industry relatedness, economic complexity, and path creation into a unified conceptual path creation model. It generates propositions, builds a framework and develops a matrix for path creation that integrate context, actors, factors, mechanisms and outcomes shaping regional diversification. It finds that in the context of path dependence and existing conditions of a region, economic actors undertake strategic measures to influence the institutional capabilities to accumulate knowledge and trigger indigenous creation, anchoring, branching, and clustering diversification mechanisms to create complex varieties of related and unrelated diversification outcomes. The institutional collaboration capabilities are found to be instrumental in accumulating knowledge and determining the relatedness and complexity of diversification outcomes. This research further provides a set of integrated platform strategies to guide policy-makers on setting up the pathways to regional diversification...|$|R
5000|$|Maoist {{theory of}} people's war divides warfare into three phases. In the first phase, the guerillas gain {{the support of}} the {{population}} through attacks on the machinery of government and the distribution of propaganda. In the second phase, escalating attacks are made on the government's military and vital institutions. In the third phase, conventional fighting is used to seize cities, overthrow the government, and take control of the country. Mao's seminal work On Guerrilla Warfare, has been widely distributed and applied, nowhere more successfully than in Vietnam under military leader and theorist Vo Nguyen Giap. Giap's People's War, People's Army closely <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> Maoist <b>three-stage</b> approach, but with greater emphasis on flexible shifting between mobile and guerrilla warfare, and opportunities for a spontaneous [...] "General Uprising" [...] of the masses in conjunction with guerrilla forces.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} common {{themes in the}} motivations for and obstacles to seeking forgiveness in participant narratives relating to seeking forgiveness {{in a sample of}} 156 narratives written by 78 students {{with a mean age of}} 21 years at a technical university in the Northeastern United States. Readers used a coding rubric to assess the motivations for and the obstacles to seeking forgiveness as written in the narratives. These motivations and obstacles were explored in the context of a <b>three-stage</b> forgiveness model. <b>The</b> main research question of the study was to explore common reasons that people did or did not seek forgiveness and the methods that they used to do so. Data from the study indicated that participant narratives describing seeking forgiveness did <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>three-stage</b> model and that the main motivation for seeking forgiveness was to reduce feelings of sadness or guilt on the part of the transgressor. A significant number also sought forgiveness for the benefit of the victim. Narratives about obstacles to seeking forgiveness indicated that the majority of people did not seek forgiveness because they felt that the victim deserved it. A smaller percentage did not seek forgiveness because they did not acknowledge their error or responsibility for any harm that was caused. Correlational analysis showed that individuals who sought forgiveness for the benefit of the victim were more likely to experience a positive effect on the relationship. The results of the study had several implications for theory and practice related to seeking forgiveness...|$|R
