5|$|On November 13, Machine Head {{announced}} {{cancellation of}} their North American tour {{dates from the}} 13th to the 23rd due to Robb Flynn requiring emergency surgery to treat an <b>inguinal</b> hernia.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that Andalusians {{experience}} ischaemic (reduced blood flow) diseases of the small intestine at a rate significantly higher than other breeds; and stallions had higher numbers of <b>inguinal</b> hernias, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater than other breeds. At the same time, they also showed a lower incidence of large intestinal obstruction. In {{the course of the}} study, Andalusians also showed the highest risk of laminitis as a medical complication related to the intestinal issues.|$|E
5|$|Most {{primates}} {{have two}} mammary glands, {{but the number}} and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The aye-aye also has two mammary glands, but they are located near the groin (<b>inguinal).</b> In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.|$|E
5|$|This sturdily built {{antelope}} has {{a yellow}} to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse sebaceous glands {{present on the}} coat make the coat greasy {{and give it a}} strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While R. r. bohor appears yellowish gray, R. r. wardi is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed—such as a dark stripe on the front of each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of hair around the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. However, R. r. redunca lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round bare spot below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of <b>inguinal</b> glands and vestigial foot glands, and four nipples. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. The tracks of the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the southern reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prominent}} {{forms of}} display among these animals is whistling and bounding. Instead of scent-marking its territory, the reedbuck {{will give a}} shrill whistle to make the boundaries of its territory be known. As it whistles, it expels air through its nose with such a force that the whole of its body vibrates. These whistles, usually one to three in number, are followed by a few stotting bounds. This behaviour {{is also used to}} raise alarm in herds. In this, the reedbuck raises its neck, exposing the white patch on its throat, but keeping the tail down, and leaps in a way similar to the impala's jumps, landing on its forelegs. This is accompanied by the popping of the <b>inguinal</b> glands in the legs. Fights begin with both opponents holding their horns low, in a combat stance; followed by the locking of horns and pushing one another. These fights can even lead to deaths.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inguinal</b> hernia* is a {{protrusion}} of abdominal contents {{through the}} <b>inguinal</b> canal. They are corrected through surgery.|$|E
25|$|Femoral hernias occur {{just below}} the <b>inguinal</b> ligament, when {{abdominal}} contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal. They {{can be hard to}} distinguish from the <b>inguinal</b> type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to <b>inguinal</b> hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and <b>inguinal</b> hernia.|$|E
25|$|Properitoneal hernia: rare hernia located {{directly}} above the peritoneum, for example, when {{part of an}} <b>inguinal</b> hernia projects from the deep <b>inguinal</b> ring to the preperitoneal space.|$|E
25|$|Inoculation at the mucous {{lining of}} {{external}} sex organs (penis and vagina) {{can lead to}} the <b>inguinal</b> syndrome named after the formation of buboes or abscesses in the groin (<b>inguinal)</b> region where draining lymph nodes are located. These signs usually appear from 3 days to a month after exposure.|$|E
25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the psoas major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the iliac crest between the transversus abdominis and abdominal internal oblique, and then run above the <b>inguinal</b> ligament. Both nerves give off muscular branches to both these muscles. Iliohypogastric supplies sensory branches to {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique above the <b>inguinal</b> ring to supply sensory branches to the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the <b>inguinal</b> ring and supplies sensory branches to the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|Sports hernia: a hernia {{characterized}} by chronic groin pain in athletes and a dilated superficial <b>inguinal</b> ring.|$|E
25|$|Double {{indirect}} hernia: {{an indirect}} <b>inguinal</b> hernia with two hernia sacs, without a concomitant direct hernia component (as {{seen in a}} pantaloon hernia).|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{symptoms}} {{may include}} inflammatory {{involvement of the}} perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or salpingitis may occur as well as lymphangitis and lymphadenitis in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20–30% develop <b>inguinal</b> lymphadenopathy. Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise. Diagnosis is more difficult in {{women and men who}} have sex with men (MSM) who may not have the <b>inguinal</b> symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inguinal</b> hernias {{are most}} {{commonly}} seen in Standardbred and Tennessee Walking Horse stallions due, {{likely due to}} a breed prevalence of a large <b>inguinal</b> ring, as well as Saddlebred and Warmblood breeds. <b>Inguinal</b> hernias in adult horses are usually strangulating (unlike foals, which are usually non-strangulating). Stallions usually display acute signs of colic, and a cool, enlarged testicle on one side. Hernias are classified as either indirect, in which the bowel remains in the parietal vaginal tunic, or direct, in which case it ruptures through the tunic and goes subcutaneously. Direct hernias are seen most commonly in foals, and usually congenital. Indirect hernias may be treated by repeated manual reduction, but direct hernias often require surgery to correct. The testicle {{on the side of}} resection will often require removal due to vascular compromise, although prognosis for survival is good (75%) and the horse may be used for breeding in the future.|$|E
25|$|Lymph nodes are {{particularly}} numerous in the mediastinum in the chest, neck, pelvis, axilla, <b>inguinal</b> region, and {{in association with}} the blood vessels of the intestines.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} of the testes {{follows the}} testicular arteries {{back to the}} paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the <b>inguinal</b> lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|The testes {{remain high}} in the abdomen until the 7th month of gestation, when they move from the abdomen through the <b>inguinal</b> canals into {{the two sides of}} the scrotum. It has been {{proposed}} that movement occurs in two phases, under control of somewhat different factors. The first phase, movement across the abdomen to the entrance of the <b>inguinal</b> canal appears controlled (or at least greatly influenced) by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The second phase, in which the testes move through the <b>inguinal</b> canal into the scrotum, is dependent on androgens (most importantly testosterone). In rodents, androgens induce the genitofemoral nerve to release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which produces rhythmic contractions of the gubernaculum, a ligament which connects the testis to the scrotum, but a similar mechanism has not been demonstrated in humans. Maldevelopment of the gubernaculum, or deficiency or insensitivity to either AMH or androgen can, therefore, prevent the testes from descending into the scrotum. Some evidence suggests there may even be an additional paracrine hormone, referred to as descendin, secreted by the testes.|$|E
25|$|Cryptorchidism is {{when one}} the {{testicles}} is {{retained in the}} abdomen or <b>inguinal</b> canal past a normal stage of development. It is a common occurrence in dogs and {{is thought to be}} a sex-limited autosomal recessive trait.|$|E
25|$|The paired {{testicular}} arteries arise {{directly from}} the abdominal aorta and descend through the <b>inguinal</b> canal, while the scrotum {{and the rest of}} the external genitalia is supplied by the internal pudendal artery (itself a branch of the internal iliac artery).|$|E
25|$|About 27% {{of males}} and 3% of females develop a groin hernia {{at some time in}} their life. In 2013 about 25 million people had a hernia. <b>Inguinal,</b> femoral and {{abdominal}} hernias resulted in 32,500 deaths globally in 2013 and 50,500 in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In many {{infants with}} <b>inguinal</b> testes, further descent of the testes into the scrotum {{occurs in the}} first 6 months of life. This is {{attributed}} to the postnatal surge of gonadotropins and testosterone that normally occurs {{between the first and}} fourth months of life.|$|E
25|$|His {{method of}} {{surgical}} removal of lungs {{became a major}} medical weapon {{in the treatment of}} tuberculosis and lung cancer, thus saving many patients. His name was also immortalised in Medicine in two other instances: the Macewen's operation for <b>inguinal</b> hernia and the Macewen's sign for hydrocephalus and brain abscess.|$|E
25|$|Usage {{during the}} first 12 weeks of {{pregnancy}} {{does not appear to}} increase the risk of any major birth defects. There may be a small increased risk for minor birth defects such as an <b>inguinal</b> hernia, but the number of reports is too small to be sure if there actually is any risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an <b>inguinal</b> orchiectomy - that is, surgical excision {{of the entire}} testis along with attached structures (epididymis and spermatic cord). A biopsy should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|During the 2005–06 pre-season, Fernandes {{underwent}} surgery in Munich {{due to an}} <b>inguinal</b> hernia. He was treated by specialist Ulrike Muschaweck. In the UEFA Champions League, he scored the equalising goal in a draw at Villarreal CF in the group stage, with Benfica again only being ousted by the eventual champions, in this case FC Barcelona in the quarter-finals.|$|E
25|$|A {{varicocele}} is {{an abnormal}} {{enlargement of the}} pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum. This plexus of veins drains blood from the testicles. The testicular blood vessels originate in the abdomen and course down through the <b>inguinal</b> canal {{as part of the}} spermatic cord {{on their way to the}} testis. Varicoceles occur in around 15% of all men.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Padre Pio was {{operated}} on for an <b>inguinal</b> hernia, {{and shortly after}} this a large cyst formed on his neck that was surgically removed. Another surgery was required to remove a malignant tumor on his ear. After this operation Padre Pio was subjected to radiological treatment, which was successful, it seems, after only two treatments.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} {{school of}} thought contends {{that in the case}} of <b>inguinal</b> hernia, the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause. They contend that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch.|$|E
25|$|In short, {{the descent}} of the testes {{consists}} of {{the opening of a}} connection from the testis to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall, followed by the development of the gubernaculum, which subsequently pulls and translocates the testis down into the developing scrotum. Ultimately, the passageway closes behind the testis. A failure in this process can cause indirect <b>inguinal</b> hernia or an infantile hydrocoele.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pelvis}} area, {{at the level}} of the last lumbar vertebra, the {{abdominal}} aorta, a continuation the descending aorta, splits into a pair of common iliac arteries. These immediately split into the internal and external iliac arteries, the latter of which descends along the medial border of the psoas major to exits the pelvis area through the vascular lacuna under the <b>inguinal</b> ligament.|$|E
25|$|In October1862, at {{the height}} of his popularity, Creighton injured himself in a game when he {{suffered}} a ruptured abdominal hernia hitting a home run. The rupture caused internal bleeding, and he died four days later. Diagnoses differ as to the cause of death, ranging from a strain to a ruptured bladder, but modern medical understanding of the symptoms suggests that it was most likely a ruptured <b>inguinal</b> hernia.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{surgical}} approaches are retroperitoneal (abdominal using laparoscopic surgery), infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin) and <b>inguinal</b> (groin using percutaneous embolization). Possible complications {{of this procedure}} include hematoma (bleeding into tissues), hydrocele (accumulation of fluid around the affected testicle), infection, or injury to the scrotal tissue or structures. In addition, injury to the artery that supplies the testicle may occur, resulting {{in a loss of}} a testicle.|$|E
25|$|Undescended testes are {{associated}} with reduced fertility, increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors and psychological problems when the boy is grown. Undescended testes are also more susceptible to testicular torsion (and subsequent infarction) and <b>inguinal</b> hernias. Without intervention, an undescended testicle will usually descend {{during the first year}} of life, but to reduce these risks, undescended testes can be brought into the scrotum in infancy by a surgical procedure called an orchiopexy.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{usually is}} made serologically (through complement fixation) and by exclusion of other causes of <b>inguinal</b> lymphadenopathy or genital ulcers. Serologic testing has a sensitivity of 80% after 2 weeks. Serologic testing {{may not be}} specific for serotype (has some cross reactivity with other chlamydia species) and can suggest LGV from other forms because of their difference in dilution, 1:64 {{more likely to be}} LGV and lower than 1:16 is likely to be other chlamydia forms (emedicine).|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{provides}} {{visualization of}} the thoracic and abdominal structures, and can sometimes rule out or narrow down a diagnosis. Information {{that may be}} gleaned from ultrasonographic findings include the presence of sand, distention, entrapment, strangulation, intussusception, and wall thickening of intestinal loops, as well as diagnose nephrosplenic entrapment, peritonitis, abdominal tumors, and <b>inguinal</b> or scrotal hernias. Abdominal ultrasound requires an experienced operator to accurately diagnose the cause of colic. It may be applied {{against the side of}} the horse, as well as transrectally.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} vary {{depending}} on the type of hernia. Symptoms may or may not be present in some <b>inguinal</b> hernias. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the groin or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt. When standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and swelling in the scrotum around the testicular area.|$|E
