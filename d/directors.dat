5|$|By June, four of {{the seven}} Watch Tower Society directors—Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D.

In June, Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the board's authority from the president. Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the <b>directors</b> to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally <b>directors</b> of the society. The Watch Tower Society's official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted <b>directors</b> confirmed that given to Rutherford; however, the pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford's. On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as <b>directors.</b> Between August and November the society and the four ousted <b>directors</b> published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former <b>directors</b> also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former <b>directors</b> left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned Rutherford to office.|$|E
