Did I not always see some <b>hard</b> <b>fiber</b> in her nature? Did I not, even {{at the time when}} I was proud to obey her behest, feel that it was surely a poor love which could drive a lover to his death or the danger of it? Did I not, in my truest thoughts, always recurring and always dismissed, see past the beauty of the face, and, peering into the soul, discern the twin shadows of selfishness and of fickleness glooming at the back of it? Did she love the heroic and the spectacular for its own noble sake, or was it for the glory which might, without effort or sacrifice, be reflected upon herself? Or are these thoughts the vain wisdom which comes after the event? It was the shock of my life. For a moment it had turned me to a cynic. But already, as I write, a week has passed, and we have had our momentous interview with Lord John Roxton and--well, perhaps things might be worse.|$|E

50|$|Leaf <b>fibers</b> or <b>hard</b> <b>fibers</b> are a type {{of plant}} fiber mainly used for cordage (producing rope). They are the toughest of the plant fibers which is most likely due to their {{increased}} lignin content {{when compared to the}} other groups of plant fibers. They are typically characterized as being very tough and rigid lending them towards being used in rope production over clothing or paper like other plant fibers.|$|R
50|$|The fibers are {{harvested}} from plants in long, thin bundles mainly {{through the process}} of decortication which is where the non-fibrous tissues are scraped away from the plant fibers by hand or in a machine.

The next generations of free elec tron lasers require novel solutions for beam loss monitor and radiation detection systems. A new concept at the Free Electron Laser Hamburg FLASH and Photo Injector Test Facility Zeuthen PITZ was developed and put into operation. The concept based on optical fibers used as radiation detection sensor. Slow beam loss monitors determine the total ionization dose at selected positions or along the beam line and undulator sections in a response time of a few milliseconds by measuring the radiation induced attenuation of the fiber. Fast beam loss monitors detect the Cerenkov light generated by relativistic electrons penetrating radiation <b>hard</b> <b>fiber.</b> The new beam loss position and beam profile monitor systems utilize this effect.

40|$|The tooth-like {{mouthparts}} of {{some animals}} consist of biomacromolecular scaffolds with few mineral components, making them intriguing paradigms of biostructural materials. In this study, the abrasion {{resistance of the}} jaws of one such animal, the bloodworm Glycera dibranchiata, has been evaluated by nanoindentation, nanoscratching, and wear testing. The hardest, stiffest, and most abrasion-resistant materials are found within a thin (< 3 μm) surface layer near the jaw tip and a thicker (10 – 20 μm) subsurface layer, both rich in unmineralized Cu. These {{results are consistent with}} the supposition that Cu ions are involved in the formation of intermolecular coordination complexes between proteins, creating a highly cross-linked molecular network. The intervening layer contains aligned atacamite [Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl] fibers and exhibits hardness and stiffness (transverse to the alignment direction) that are only slightly higher than those of the bulk material but lower than those of the two Cu-rich layers. Furthermore, the atacamite-containing layer is the least abrasion-resistant, by a factor of ≈ 3, even relative to the bulk material. These observations are broadly consistent with the behavior of engineering polymer composites with <b>hard</b> <b>fiber</b> or particulate reinforcements. The alignment of fibers parallel to the jaw surface, and the fiber proximity to the surface, are both suggestive of a natural adaptation to enhance bending stiffness and strength rather than to endow the surface regions with enhanced abrasion resistance...|$|E

The aimed {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of the height of water level and the peat land fiber size to the root system and the growth of Acacia (Acacia crassicarpa). This research was conducted for three months at the backyard of Soil Science Laboratory of University of Riau, Pekanbaru. This study used a completely randomized design which consisted of two factors. The first factor was the peat land fiber size that has two levels, D 1 (size of soft fiber) and D 2 (size of <b>hard</b> <b>fiber).</b> The second factor was the the height of water level with 3 levels, which was 25 cm, 50 cm and 75 cm.

40|$|Abstract: Agave sisalana (sisal) {{is known}} {{worldwide}} {{as a source}} of <b>hard</b> <b>fibers,</b> and Brazil is the largest producer of sisal. Nonetheless, the process of removing the fibers of the sisal leaf generates 95 % waste. In this study, we applied chemical sequential steps (hydrothermal extraction, precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, crystallization, SiO 2 and Sephadex LH 20 column chromatography) to obtain pectin, mannitol, succinic acid, kaempferol and a mixture of saponins as raw chemicals from sisal biomass. The structural identification of these compounds was performed though spectrometric methods, such as Infrared (IR), Ultraviolet (UV), Mass spectrometry (MS) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

50|$|All {{optical fibers}} undergo some darkening {{depending}} {{on a number}} of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber core glass composition, operating wavelength, dose rate, total accumulated dose, temperature and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped claddings are amongst the most radiation <b>hard</b> <b>fibers.</b> The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the radiation hardness of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher operating wavelength, lower dose rate, lower total accumulated dose, higher temperature (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo-bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.|$|R
40|$|Agave sisalana Perrine is a {{widespread}} species of the Brazilian Northeast region, where it is exploited only {{as a source of}} <b>hard</b> <b>fiber</b> (sisal). Although some other Agave species are sources of fructans, there is no study on this issue on A. sisalana. This paper aimed at extracting and isolating inulin from aqueous extract of A. sisalana boles. After preparation of extracts, crude inulin was precipitated with acetone at low temperature (4 °C). After purification by ion-exchange chromatography, a white powder was obtained by freeze-drying and characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis, Circular Dichroism (CD) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Moreover, its polysaccharide structure was confirmed by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). FT-IR analysis pointed out absorption at 1420 cm− 1, corresponding to deformation of CH 2 –OH lying on fructose ring, while absorption at 1075 cm− 1 was assigned to C[sbnd]O and C[sbnd]C stretching vibrations of inulin pyranose ring. NMR showed the presence of one signal in the anomeric region at δ 5. 4 ppm and others between 3. 1 and 4. 2 ppm in the 1 H spectrum, besides a chemical shift at 104. 4 ppm corresponding to the anomeric region of the 13 C spectrum of an internal β-fructofuranose unit. XRD highlighted the amorphous state of inulin-rich powder, thermal analysis a glass transition temperature in the range between 50. 0 and 55. 8 °C, CD a good thermal stability, and MALDI-TOF-MS a prevalence of oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization in the range 5 – 13. These techniques revealed that A. sisalana boles contain inulin with features similar to those extracted from other commercial sources such as Agave tequilana or Agave atrovirens, which extends the economic importance of this species beyond its simple use as a fiber source...|$|E
40|$|Only 5 % of {{the whole}} mass from {{decortication}} of Agave sisalana Perrine leaves, which is constituted by a <b>hard</b> <b>fiber,</b> is exploited, while the remaining 95 % consisting of solid and liquid wastes is normally discarded by sisal farms. Studies demonstrated the potential of products from A. sisalana in different pharmaceutical applications, but the quality of herbal raw materials is essential to reach the desired specifications of intermediate and final products. The aim of this work was to analyze physicochemical quality parameters of materials and extracts from bole and solid waste from A. sisalana collected in Monteiro, Paraíba-PB. Materials were dried in a forced circulation oven at 40 °C up to constant weight to obtain herbal drugs from bole (HDB) and solid waste (HDSW). Both HDB and HDSW were extracted with distilled water by dynamic maceration at 80 °C for 2 hours (7 : 1 w/v) to obtain the corresponding liquid extracts (HDB-LE and HDSW-LE, respectively). Physicochemical analyses were done according to pharmacopoeia methods either on materials (pH, particle size, density, loss on drying and ash content) or extracts (pH, dry residue, density by pycnometer, °Brix and spectrophotometric scanning at 200 - 800 nm). Since HDSW had larger particles size than HDB, {{the fact that the}} HDSW-LE volume (206. 5 mL) was lower than that of HDB-LE (268. 0 mL) under the same extraction conditions suggests a direct influence of the extraction protocol on the efficiency, as reported in the literature. Higher values of density (0. 55 g. mL- 1 ± 0. 03) and water content (6. 62 % ± 0. 12) for HDSW-LE compared with HDB-LE (0. 43 g. mL- 1 ± 0. 01 and 4. 33 % ± 0. 15, respectively) may reflect the larger particle size of HDB. Ash content of HDSW (16. 62 ± 0. 07 %) was higher than that of HDB (6. 43 ± 0. 12 %), thereby pointing out the presence of impurities resulting from decortication. The extraction efficiency from HDSW (31. 5 % ± 9. 1) was remarkably lower than from HDB (79. 3 % ± 18. 5), likely due to the high content in water-soluble carbohydrates of agave species boles. This inference seems to be confirmed by the higher values of °Brix (5. 47 ± 0. 55) and dry residue (6. 14 % ± 0. 38) for HDB-LE compared with HDSW-LE (2. 3 ± 0. 52 and 2. 48 % ± 0. 16, respectively). Spectrophotometric scanning suggested different compositions of these extracts. The quality control parameters established for A. sisalana in this study could be of some interest to guarantee quality and safety in herbal medicine...|$|E
