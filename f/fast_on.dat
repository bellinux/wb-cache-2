40|$|Stata/MP 1 is {{the version}} of Stata that is {{programmed}} {{to take full advantage}} of multicore and multiprocessor computers. It is exactly like Stata/SE in all ways except that it distributes many of Stata’s most computationally demanding tasks across all the cores in your computer and thereby runs faster—much faster. In a perfect world, software would run 2 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 2 cores, 3 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 3 cores, and so on. Stata/MP achieves about 72 % efficiency. It runs 1. 6 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 2 cores, 2. 1 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 4 cores, and 2. 7 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 8 cores (see figure 1). Half the commands run faster than that. The other half run slower than the median speedup, and some of those commands are not sped up at all, either because they are inherently sequential (time-series commands) or because they have not been parallelized (graphics, xtmixed). In terms of evaluating average performance improvement, commands that take longer to run—such as estimation commands—are of greater importance. When estimation commands are taken as a group, Stata/MP achieves an even greater efficiency of approximately 87 %. Taken at the median, estimation commands run 1. 8 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 2 cores, 2. 8 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 4 cores, and 4. 1 times <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> 8 cores. Stata/MP supports up to 64 cores. This paper provides a detailed report on the performance of Stata/MP. Command-bycommand performance assessments are provide...|$|R
50|$|Abu Qatada narrates that Muhammad {{was asked}} about <b>fasting</b> <b>on</b> the Day of Arafah. He said: as for the <b>fasting</b> <b>on</b> the Day of Arafah, I {{anticipate}} that Allah will forgive the year (i.e. {{the sins of the}} year) after it and the year before it 749.|$|R
5|$|Indiana's defense {{also held}} <b>fast</b> <b>on</b> the next possession, and Tech {{was unable to}} gain a first down {{following}} the turnover. Tech's punt was returned to the Indiana 38-yard line, where the Hoosier offense returned to the field. At first, the Hoosiers were successful moving the ball as they picked up a first down in Tech territory via a pass from Paci. The success was short-lived, however, as the Hoosiers were unable to gain a first down once on the Tech {{side of the field}} and had to punt. Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 21-yard line, where Tech began its third possession of the second half. Tech picked up a first down via two DeShazo passes, but couldn't gain another. Tech's punt was downed at the Indiana 20-yard line, and Indiana's offense began work with 3:02 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

The final ship of the British line, Culloden under Troubridge, sailed too close to Aboukir Island in the growing darkness and became stuck <b>fast</b> <b>on</b> the shoal. Despite strenuous efforts from the Cullodens boats, the brig Mutine and the 50-gun HMS Leander under Captain Thomas Thompson, the ship of the line could not be moved, and the waves drove Culloden further onto the shoal, inflicting severe damage to the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled <b>fast</b> <b>on</b> the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was {{organized}} in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under Guglielmo Embriaco arrived at Jaffa, and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build siege engines. The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of Joshua at the siege of Jericho. After a three-day <b>fast,</b> <b>on</b> 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them, and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is <b>fast</b> <b>on</b> the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews <b>fast</b> <b>on</b> that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E

This application, developed by scientists at the University of Chicago, simulates the gravitational collapse of self-gravitating gaseous clouds. It performs parallel I/O by using library routines that we developed and optimized separately for the SP and Paragon. The I/O routines perform two-phase I/O and use the parallel file systems PIOFS on the SP and PFS on the Paragon. We studied the I/O performance for two different sizes of the application. In the small case, we found that I/O was much <b>faster</b> <b>on</b> the SP.
