500|$|Final Fantasy XI Wings of the Goddess Original Soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from reviewers, with Patrick Gann saying that [...] "It is consistently good, but rarely is it mind-blowing". He did, however, praise Mizuta, saying that [...] "Mizuta has grown...to {{the point where}} I <b>imagine</b> <b>he</b> can take on nearly any project". It reached position #47 on the Oricon charts.|$|E
500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach â€” there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I <b>imagine</b> <b>he</b> will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E

2500|$|A {{front page}} story in The Philadelphia Evening Item was headlined: [...] "The End of Eakins," [...] and a {{subsequent}} story asked, [...] "does anyone <b>imagine</b> <b>he</b> [...] will not sink into obscurity {{and leave the}} city?"

2500|$|It {{was unusual}} {{for a man of}} Mackenzie's humble origins to attain such a {{position}} in an age which generally offered such opportunity only to the privileged. Lord Dufferin, the current Governor General, expressed early misgivings about a stonemason taking over government. But on meeting Mackenzie, Dufferin revised his opinions: [...] "However narrow and inexperienced Mackenzie may be, I <b>imagine</b> <b>he</b> is a thoroughly upright, well-principled, and well-meaning man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1991, Matsuo {{began to}} work as a video game music {{composer}} himself, writing the score to Master of Monsters. Over the next few years, he worked as an independent composer on several games and anime series, including [...] In 1995, he joined the independent music composition group <b>Imagine.</b> <b>He</b> has continued since then to compose and orchestrate works for over 40 games and anime shows, as well as the television show Kamen Rider 555 and a few pieces as part of original albums.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Mutke {{enlisted the}} help of Professor Otto Wagner of the Munich Technical University to run {{computational}} tests to determine whether the aircraft could break the sound barrier. These tests do not rule out the possibility, but are lacking accurate data on the coefficient of drag that would be needed to make accurate simulations. Wagner stated [...] "I don't want to exclude the possibility, but I can <b>imagine</b> <b>he</b> may also have been just below the speed of sound and felt the buffeting, but did not go above Mach-1." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Northampton, Worcestershire Royals captain Vikram Solanki {{led from}} the front, scoring 119 off 137 balls, {{including}} 13 fours and 1 six. Support from his colleagues took the visitors up to 211 for 4 off their 45 overs. Worcestershire director of cricket Tom Moody said of Solanki: [...] "I can't see why he won't be in the mix for England section this summer. It depends how the selectors shuffle the deck, but I would <b>imagine</b> <b>he</b> will be in their minds for consideration at the very least. We were very confident {{he was ready for}} the challenge of captaincy and he has had a great start." ...|$|E
2500|$|The voice flute was {{a popular}} size of {{recorder}} in the eighteenth century, especially in England. It offered an alternative instrument for amateurs to play music written for the transverse flute, since both instruments are at the same pitch. The usual clef used for recorder parts was the French violin clef, with G {{on the bottom line}} of the staff. Imagining this clef in place of the treble clef and using the normal F-alto fingerings on a voice flute renders music composed for flute or violin in the original key [...] Although the rather large number of surviving eighteenth-century voice flutes suggests this may have been a common practice at that time, there is little documentary evidence to support the idea ( [...] ; [...] ). Parts intended for this instrument were also often written in transposed notation, so the player could <b>imagine</b> <b>he</b> was playing an ordinary alto in F ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
