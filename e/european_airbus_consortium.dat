He also decided that English should be the working language and that measurements should not be metric because most airlines already had American built aircraft.|$|E
25|$|France has a {{mixed economy}} that {{combines}} extensive private enterprise with substantial state enterprise and government intervention. The government retains considerable influence over key segments of infrastructure sectors, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power and telecommunications. It has been relaxing its control over these sectors {{since the early}} 1990s. The government is slowly corporatising the state sector and selling off holdings in France Télécom, Air France, {{as well as in}} the insurance, banking, and defence industries. France has an important aerospace industry led by the <b>European</b> <b>consortium</b> <b>Airbus,</b> and has its own national spaceport, the Centre Spatial Guyanais.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{generation}} of jet airliners introduced wide-body (twin-aisle) craft and high-bypass turbofan engines. Pan Am and Boeing [...] "again {{opened a new}} era in commercial aviation" [...] when the first Boeing 747 entered service in January 1970, marking the debut of the high-bypass turbofan which lowered operating costs, and the initial models which could seat up to 400 passengers which earned it the nickname [...] "Jumbo Jet". Other wide-body designs included the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets, smaller than the Boeing 747 but capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways. There was also the market debut of the <b>European</b> <b>consortium</b> <b>Airbus,</b> whose first aircraft was the twinjet Airbus A300.|$|R

40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the trade dispute between the <b>European</b> <b>consortium</b> <b>Airbus</b> SAS and the American company Boeing. The {{research}} focuses on the substance and running process of the dispute and how the World Trade Organization (WTO) solves the conflict between two biggest rivals {{within the field of}} aircraft industry. Why is the conflict over state subsidies from European governments in behalf of Airbus and governmental subsidies from the United States for Boeing one of the longest-running trade disputes on the WTO field? The first part {{deals with the}} World Trade Organization and explains Dispute Settlement Mechanism of WTO. It also shows stages of the Boeing-Airbus dispute. Furthermore, it clarifies the issue of governmental subsidies within international business law. The second part deals with three aspects which directly answer the research question: the importance of civil large aircraft and both companies (Boeing and Airbus) for their parental countries (The United States and The EU members), characteristics of the players (the USA and the EU) and their economical and political power, and the characteristics of the WTO field and its struggling with resolving such politicized case and disputes over governmental subsidies...|$|R
50|$|The Three-Eleven was {{introduced}} at the 1967 and 1969 Paris Air Shows. It was a widebody in the size, weight, and range {{class of the}} original, somewhat smaller <b>European</b> <b>Airbus.</b> At the time, the Three-Eleven was widely assumed to have emerged with encouragement from some British government circles and circles close to Rolls-Royce, who were anxious to have a fall-back option in case the <b>European</b> <b>Airbus</b> failed. BAC was thought to have welcomed such encouragement, not {{being part of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Airbus</b> (as distinct from Hawker Siddeley) and having little airliner work for the future as the One-Eleven project wound down.|$|R
50|$|CASA {{was one of}} the {{original}} members of the <b>Airbus</b> <b>Consortium</b> with France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 1972. In 1977, CASA was awarded the contract to design and build the C-101, a trainer and attack aircraft for the Spanish Air Force. CASA joined the Eurofighter 2000 project in 1996.|$|R

50|$|The BAC Two-Eleven and BAC Three-Eleven were British {{airliner}} studies {{proposed by}} the British Aircraft Corporation in the late 1960s. The projects emerged from design studies aimed at competing first with the Boeing 727-200 {{and then with the}} proposed <b>European</b> <b>Airbus.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hawker Siddeley (which {{merged with}} British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1977 to form British Aerospace) {{was part of}} the first Airbus project, the Airbus A300. The British {{government}} withdrew support in 1969 but Hawker Siddeley was allowed to continue as supplier of the aircraft's wings due to the advanced stages of design and the reluctance of other nations to take over the wing design. In 1979 BAe rejoined the <b>Airbus</b> <b>consortium.</b> In 2001 <b>Airbus</b> Industrie became Airbus S.A.S., the Airbus Integrated Company.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, the U.S. had a near {{monopoly}} in the Large Civil Aircraft (LCA) sector. The <b>Airbus</b> <b>consortium</b> (created in 1969) started competing {{effectively in the}} 1980s. At that stage the U.S. became concerned about the European competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the European governments for the developments of the early models of the Airbus family. This became a major issue of contention, as the European side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to U.S. LCA manufacturers through NASA and Defense programs.|$|R

5000|$|In 1969 and 1970, the British government-owned airline British European Airways (BEA) {{expressed}} {{willingness to}} operate the proposed airliner, as did the private Court Line Aviation airline (the latter equally willing {{to operate the}} <b>European</b> <b>Airbus).</b> No orders were placed: design was not finalised and the programme had not launched. By this stage, the Three-Eleven had become involved in several controversies: ...|$|R
5000|$|MPC 75 {{development}} {{was started by}} Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) in 1988 in Hamburg, Germany. The name [...] "MPC" [...] was formed from [...] "MBB" [...] and [...] "Peoples Republic of China" [...] because the project was a German - Chinese joint venture. China was represented by China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC). In the wake of restructuring German aerospace companies in 1989, MBB was taken over and the MPC 75 project came under [...] "Deutsche Airbus GmbH". [...] "Deutsche Airbus GmbH" [...] was representing the independent German part of the <b>Airbus</b> <b>consortium.</b> For the development of MPC 75 restructuring {{did not make a}} difference since the same engineers continued the design work.|$|R
50|$|In January 1993, Boeing {{and several}} {{companies}} in the <b>Airbus</b> <b>consortium</b> started a joint feasibility study of a Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT), aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market. This joint study was abandoned two years later, Boeing's interest having declined because analysts thought that such a product was unlikely to cover the projected $15 billion development cost. Despite {{the fact that only}} two airlines had expressed public interest in purchasing such a plane, Airbus was already pursuing its own large-plane project. Analysts suggested that Boeing would instead pursue stretching its 747 design, and that air travel was already moving away from the hub-and-spoke system that consolidated traffic into large planes, and toward more non-stop routes that could be served by smaller planes.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{controversy}} addressed Britain's {{foreign policy}} and was double-sided. On the one hand, in nascent complaints at European governments' finance for aircraft which competed with American products, private US aircraft makers cautioned that such support may ultimately impact trade and political relations across the Atlantic. On the other, Britain's potential Common Market partners warned that since the Three-Eleven project competed with the <b>European</b> <b>Airbus,</b> around which they had largely coalesced, it threw doubt over British loyalty to the EEC which it had applied to join.|$|R
50|$|The Airbus A310 is a medium- to {{long-range}} twin-engined wide-body jet airliner {{that was}} developed and manufactured by Airbus. Entering service in 1983, {{it was the second}} aircraft to enter production by <b>Airbus,</b> the <b>consortium</b> of <b>European</b> aerospace companies now a subsidiary of Airbus. The A310 is a derivative of the Airbus A300, the first twin-engined widebody airliner.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} proceed, the Three-Eleven needed what was termed {{at the time}} [...] "{{government}} launch aid." [...] In 1967, the British government entered the <b>Airbus</b> Industrie <b>consortium</b> through Hawker Siddeley and could not support competing projects. After withdrawing from Airbus {{over the issue of}} British engines in 1969, the government was theoretically free to support the Three-Eleven.|$|R

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, in order to provide effective management of responsibilities, a Groupement d'intérêt économique would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities. On 18 December 1970, Airbus Industrie was formally established following an agreement between Aérospatiale (the newly merged Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation) of France and the antecedents to Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, each receiving a 50 per cent stake in the newly formed company. In 1971, the consortium was joined by a third full partner, the Spanish firm CASA, who received a 4.2 per cent stake, the other two members reducing their stakes to 47.9 per cent each. In 1979, Britain joined the <b>Airbus</b> <b>consortium</b> via British Aerospace, which Hawker Siddeley had merged into, which acquired a 20 per cent stake in Airbus Industrie with France and Germany each reducing their stakes to 37.9 per cent.|$|R

The group's nine-axle mobile crane, the LTM 11200-9.1 - with a 100 m telescopic boom - in 2007 received the heavy-lifting industry's Development of the Year award for being the world's most powerful {{example of such a}} machine.|$|R
2500|$|DAPA {{issued a}} request for {{proposals}} on 23 December 2014. [...] The finance ministry approved an 8.6991 trillion won ($7.9171 billion) budget for development of the ADD KF-X design, but parliament will not authorize that spending or launch full-scale development until it votes on the government's 2016 budget in December 2015. [...] During that time, Airbus, Boeing, and Korean Airlines are attempting to propose a cheaper alternative to the ADD fighter design and deprive Lockheed Martin of an opportunity to provide technical assistance. [...] The team is likely to offer {{a version of the}} F/A-18E/F Super Hornet as a base design. [...] Because the U.S. limits certain technologies that can be transferred abroad, Boeing can provide stealth and radar knowledge through the <b>European</b> <b>Airbus</b> company.|$|R

40|$|Very large {{aircraft}} - {{such as the}} planned Airbus A 3 XX - require correspondingly high lift forces and extended landing gear structures, thus causing potentially very high airframe noise levels during landing approach. This problem was realized by the <b>Airbus</b> <b>Consortium</b> and first relevant research initiatives {{date back to the}} early 90 ies. Soon after initial research at DLR beban under contract to Airbus Industrie, dedicated to landing gear airframe noise. Recognizing the general challenge of research for aircraft noise reduction at that time, a European Noise Reduction Initiative (ENRI) was proposed, dealing with both engine- and airframe-noise. Subsequent technical discussiond, however, led to separate programmes for engine- and airframe noise research, the latter being initiated under the acronym RAIN (Reduction of Airframe and Installation Noise). RAIN encompasses analytical and experimental work to describe, predict and reduce the noise both from landing gears and high lift devices. In parallel national research programmes began: In France wind tunnel and flyover experiments relate to the whole aircraft airframe noise characteristics, while corresponding research in Germany focusses on high lift devices noise. In Great Britain noise modelling is performed for landing gear noise prediction. These national efforts are coordinated by the Airbus partner companies (3 E-programme) ...|$|R
40|$|Development, production, sales, {{and support}} of modern {{advanced}} technology aircraft has {{become more and more}} difficult, costly and risky for a single manufacturer to undertake the task alone. Joint ventures offer an attractive solution. Experience has shown that the old concept of a dominant manufacturer who retains full initiative, can be exceeded in efficiency by real 'cooperative ventures'. The key elements in such ventures are that pragmatic organizational and cooperative behavioural solutions are used. The positive aspects of joint 'team' work can indeed more than compensate for the apparently increased complexity. From the experience gained in the last 14 years in the <b>European</b> <b>Airbus</b> Programme, examples are given of representative problems and their solutions, covering: organization, optimization of the design through cross-fertilization, production sharing, market penetration in front of competition and others. As for any human activity a strong motivation for the success of the joint venture is nevertheless required from all participants. ...|$|R

2500|$|In April 1994, Boeing {{introduced}} {{the most modern}} commercial jet aircraft at the time, the twin-engine 777, with a seating capacity of approximately 300 to 370 passengers in a typical three-class layout, in between the 767 and the 747. The longest range twin-engined aircraft in the world, the 777 was the first Boeing airliner to feature a [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] system and was conceived partly {{in response to the}} inroads being made by the <b>European</b> <b>Airbus</b> into Boeing's traditional market. This aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computer-aided design (CAD) techniques. The 777 was also the first airplane to be certified for 180 minute ETOPS at entry into service by the FAA. [...] Also in the mid-1990s, the company developed the revamped version of the 737, known as the 737 [...] "Next-Generation", or 737NG. It has since become the fastest-selling version of the 737 in history, and on April 20, 2006 sales passed those of the [...] "Classic 737", with a follow-up order for 79 aircraft from Southwest Airlines.|$|R
25|$|On January 11, 2005, Boeing and Airbus {{agreed that}} they would attempt to find a {{solution}} to the dispute outside of the WTO. However, in June 2005, Boeing and the United States government reopened the trade dispute with the WTO, claiming that Airbus had received illegal subsidies from <b>European</b> governments. <b>Airbus</b> has also responded to this claim against Boeing, reopening the dispute and also accusing Boeing of receiving subsidies from the U.S. Government.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{international}} sales, a license from the public agency of aviation or transport {{of the country where}} the aircraft is to be used is also necessary.
