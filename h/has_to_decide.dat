Don S. Davis described General Hammond as initially [...] "hard-nosed and straight-ahead", and later as seemingly [...] "stern and straight-laced". Recognizing the need to fulfill the role as a General, Davis still tried to [...] "bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and that make him a little more likeable." [...] The welfare {{of the men and}} women under Hammond's command is paramount in the general's mind. Besides knowing that people may not return from his sanctioned missions, General Hammond <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger, even if he [...] "always does so reluctantly and with regret".

[...] Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, [...] "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." [...] Third, some players are able to use the initiative to [...] "play a kind of powerful 'serve and volley' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess." [...] Fourth, [...] "If White wants to draw, it is often not so easy for Black to prevent this. This {{advantage is}} particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing." ...|$|E
