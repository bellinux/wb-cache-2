5|$|By the 2000s, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters needed {{upgrades}} to its building {{systems and}} facilities. The company {{spent two years}} deciding whether to renovate its current building or to move to cheaper, more modern space in Center City. In 2006 Rohm and Haas decided {{to stay in the}} current building and spend up to US$25 million on renovations. The building's architecture and layout were the main reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> stay. The building allows single departments to stay together on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments would likely have to be spread out over several floors.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2008, {{before the}} release of Left 4 Dead, Valve Corporation {{announced}} that it had purchased Turtle Rock {{in an effort to}} expand the company's console market. Gabe Newell, founder and president of Valve Corporation, added that it was an easy decision <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> make, as they had high expectations for Left 4 Dead and considered themselves having a long-term relationship with Turtle Rock. After being acquired by Valve, Turtle Rock served as Valve's in-house satellite development team, and was renamed Valve South.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E

5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} private operations along the line. Continental Railway Systems {{was established by}} Rasmus Surdal. The company {{would be allowed to}} use the rolling stock and infrastructure, and two of the trains were painted white. However, it was not possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> get the necessary bank surety demanded by NSB, and nothing came of the plans.|$|E
5|$|With {{increasing}} {{competition from}} trucks and automobiles in the 1920s, passenger volume {{began to decline}} along with less-than-carload freight, such as milk from the many dairy farms along the Ma and Pa's pastoral route. The Ma and Pa substituted more economical, self-propelled gas-electric passenger cars for steam-powered passenger trains in 19271928. Carload freight volume increased in the 1920s, however, as more industries located along the line, and earnings were strong enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> declare dividends in 1930 and 1931. The Ma and Pa's relative prosperity ended with the economic downturn during the Great Depression, which cut the railroad's gross revenues by half from 1932 to 1935.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s WNO {{continued}} {{to expand in}} scope. Handel (Rodelinda, 1981) and Martinů (The Greek Passion, 1981) {{were added to the}} company's repertoire, and in 1983 Das Rheingold was staged in the WNO's first Ring cycle, followed by the other three operas of the cycle over the next two years. Das Rheingold, Siegfried and Götterdämmerung were conducted by the company's musical director, Richard Armstrong; Die Walküre (1984) was conducted by Goodall; it was seen as a coup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> secure his services – he was described by The Guardian as the greatest living Wagnerian conductor – but the casting of the whole cycle was criticised for some serious weaknesses among the principal singers, and reviewers were generally unimpressed by Göran Järvefelt's production.|$|E

5|$|Environmental impact studies {{began on}} the part of SR 125 south of SR 54 in 1987. In 1990, Caltrans {{proposed}} building the southern portion as a toll road, operated by private firms; California Transportation Ventures (CTV) and PrivaCAL both applied for the role. In September, state officials approved this proposal, which was expected to cost $400 million. In the 1991 agreement, Caltrans agreed not to build more than one high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on I-805 to reduce competition from SR 125. CTV soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for the road, including some that Caltrans had declined. The next year, while the company hoped to start the environmental impact study, objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from the road, as well as the part of the franchise agreement that would allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> collect a settlement if SR 905 was constructed with more than six lanes, since it would compete with the proposed toll road.|$|E
5|$|Following the public's {{positive}} {{reaction to the}} graphics of the Final Fantasy VII Technical Demo for PS3 presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2005, {{it was decided to}} release the role-playing video game Final Fantasy XIII on the PlayStation 3 rather than the PlayStation 2 as originally planned. In August 2005, the Technology Division began working on the White Engine, a PlayStation 3 engine {{that was supposed to be}} exclusively used for Final Fantasy XIII. Eight months later, however, it was decided to repurpose the engine to further make it compatible with other projects such as the action RPG Final Fantasy Versus XIII (later rebranded and repurposed into Final Fantasy XV) and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV. In order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> stay competitive in a multi-platform environment, support of the engine was extended from the PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, both of which were successful in Western markets. This marked the official development start of a company-wide engine for whose purpose the Technology Division was expanded into the Research and Development Division in September 2006. Murata remained the division's general manager with a full-time staff at his disposal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the first Xenosaga game, Takahashi and Sugiura reassessed the {{internal}} structure of Monolith Soft, determining that the current lead developers were too old, clashing with their intended goals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> foster young talent. With this mindset, Takahashi stepped down from his lead role in the Xenosaga series, he continued to work for the company in a supervisory role by providing scenario draft's, while younger staff continued the series development. This move also allowed Takahashi a greater degree of creative freedom in a number of projects as opposed to being tied to a single series. In May 2002, Monolith Soft moved from Yokohama to their current offices in Meguro, Tokyo. The next entry in the Xenosaga series, Xenosaga Episode II, began development under a new team following {{the release of}} Episode I. While developing Episode II, the staff shifted their focus from the main series to help tell the story through multiple media. Among these additional projects was , a spin-off title for mobile devices co-developed with Tom Create and Namco Mobile. Pied Piper was Tanaka's last work on the Xenosaga series. Beginning in 2003, Monolith Soft also developed Namco × Capcom, a PlayStation 2 crossover game featuring character's from various Namco and Capcom video games. The idea was proposed by Monolith Soft, with development lasting two years.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E
5|$|In an August 3, 1973, {{memo to the}} Atari {{engineering}} department, co-founder Nolan Bushnell {{laid out}} plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> create a prototype 20-player version of Gotcha {{in time for a}} trade show later that year, though no such game was ever made. Instead, released {{at the same time as}} Gotcha and showcased at the early November 1973 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition were two additional versions of Gotcha: one with a tinted color overlay, and a true multi-color version of Gotcha with red, blue, and green colors. The color version of Gotcha was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is believed to be the first color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|E
5|$|NSB assured {{passengers}} {{that the}} trains were more capable than their reputation, {{and that they}} would continue to be used on the Bergen Line. If an alternative was needed, NSB stated {{that they would have to}} use El 18 locomotives in combination with B5 carriages. However, the carriages were at the time being used on regional rush-hour trains around Oslo, were in need of renovation and did not offer the facilities required by intercity travelers. In October, NSB stated that they planned to withdraw Class 73 from service on the Bergen Line, because the use of multiple units was not flexible enough. With locomotive-hauled trains, it was possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> add or remove just a single carriage, but with multiple units, it was necessary to double the capacity if a single unit was insufficient. While originally planned to be introduced in 2008, delays in the upgrades delayed the delivery of the carriages beyond 2010.|$|E

5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of a plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>to</b> develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin {{during the summer of}} 1999.|$|E
