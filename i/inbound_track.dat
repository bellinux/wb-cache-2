5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The <b>inbound</b> <b>track</b> will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E
5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the <b>inbound</b> <b>track,</b> both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E
500|$|Inbound and {{outbound}} trains formerly {{shared a}} single two-car platform on the <b>inbound</b> <b>track,</b> requiring Yawkey passengers to embark or debark {{from the front}} two cars of outbound trains or the rear two cars of inbound trains. In 2012, work began on a new station, which includes two longer high-level platforms and an overhead pedestrian bridge. The bridge will eventually allow direct access from the Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue overpasses through the planned Fenway Center development. Passengers boarded from {{the east end of}} the new station until March 10, 2014; after delays, it opened fully that day.|$|E

The network serves 46 stations which {{can all be}} reached by lift, something that makes the system unique in Germany.

Also, ballast is still found, but only on the <b>inbound</b> <b>track,</b> at the entrance to Schoppershof station (U2).|$|E
2500|$|Two older streetcars are {{on display}} on the unused outer <b>inbound</b> <b>track</b> at Boylston station, which {{formerly}} carried cars coming from the Pleasant Street Portal. Car #5734, a Type 5 A-1 car built in 1924 and retired in 1959, {{is owned by the}} Seashore Trolley Museum, but resides semipermanently in Boston. PCC #3295, built in 1951 and retired in 1986, is owned by the MBTA. The cars were formerly used for fantrips, the most recent one being in 1997. These trolleys are no longer in working condition, however. [...] The cars were heavily vandalized on January 14, 2014, but the vandalism was fully removed the next day.|$|E
2500|$|The metro project {{involved}} a significant {{extension of the}} Østensjø Line. The {{first part of the}} extension was built as a tramway; work on the [...] section to Bøler commenced in 1957. This included construction of the first tunnel on the Østensjø Line and resulted in Oppsal Station being moved. The tracks were rearranged at Brynseng where the Lambertseters Line's <b>inbound</b> <b>track</b> was placed under the Østensjø Line's outbound track to avoid a level crossing. Between Brynseng and Høyenhall a four-track bridge was built over the Trunk Line. The first revenue trams ran to Bøler from 20 July 1958. During parts the 1960s, the Østensjø Line was also served by Line 3.|$|E

50|$|CDC also {{manufactured}} two multi-processor computers {{based on}} the 7600, with the model number 7700. They consisted of two 7600 machines in an asymmetric configuration, a central and an adjunct machine. They were used for missile launch and <b>inbound</b> <b>tracking</b> of USSR ICBMs. The radar simulator was a real-time simulator with a CDC 6400 for input/output front-end. These systems were {{to be used in}} the Pacific Missile Range. One computer was installed at TRW in Redondo Beach CA (later moved to Kwajalein Atoll, South Pacific), and the second one was installed at McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach CA. They were actual 7600s connected by chassis 25 to make them a 7600 MP. The operating system was TOS/BOS (Tactical Operating System/Basic Operating System).|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of the First European – South African Transmission ExpeRiment (FESTER), {{which took place}} in South Africa, over the False Bay area, centered around Simon’s Town. The experiment lasted from April 2015 through February 2016 and involved continuous observations as well as periodic observations that took place during four Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) of 2 weeks each, which were spread over the year. The continuous observations aimed at a characterization of the electro-optical propagation environment, and included standard meteorology, aerosol, refraction and turbulence measurements. The periodic observations aimed at assessing the performance of electro-optical sensors in VIS / SWIR / MWIR and LWIR wavebands by following a boat sailing outbound and <b>inbound</b> <b>tracks.</b> In addition, dynamic aspects of electro-optical signatures, i. e., the changes induced by variations in the environment and/or target orientation, were studied. The present paper provides an overview of the trial, and presents a few first results...|$|R
2500|$|The Furuset Line {{branches}} {{off from}} the Østensjø Line after Hellerud Station. The outbound line runs in a culvert under the tracks of the Østensjø Line before joining up with the <b>inbound</b> <b>track.</b> The line continues along the southern side of Tvetenveien and then passes into a tunnel through which it runs under named road and reaches Tveita Station. After crossing under Ring 3 the line exits the tunnel and runs along {{the western side of}} Tvetenveien to Haugerud Station. It continues along Tvetenveien, which is crosses over just before it reaches Trosterud Station. Immediately afterwards the line enters a tunnel, in which Lindeberg Station is situated. The line exits the tunnel for less than [...] before entering a new tunnel, in which it remains. In this tunnel are the stations Furuset and Ellingsrudåsen.|$|E
2500|$|The CNW {{was known}} for running [...] "left-hand main" [...] on double track mainlines. In other words, traffic was routed by default to the track on the left rather than the track on the right. In the United States, most railroads {{followed}} the [...] "right-hand main" [...] operating practice, while [...] "left-hand main" [...] running was more common in countries where British companies built the railroads. According to a display in the Lake Forest station, {{the reason for this}} was a combination of chance and inertia. When originally built as single-line trackage, the C arbitrarily placed its stations on the left-hand side of the tracks (when headed inbound toward Chicago). Later, when a second track was added, it was placed on the side away from the stations so as not to force them to relocate. Since most passengers waiting at the stations were headed toward Chicago, the <b>inbound</b> <b>track</b> remained the one closest to the station platforms. The expense of reconfiguring signals and switches has prevented a conversion to right-hand operation ever since.|$|E

With full ownership of the Outbound track gone to CSX, the platform has been fully removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1974 and {{consists}} of a mezzanine and two side platforms with two rail tracks. Line 5 trains terminated at this station, used an underground loop that leaves from the outbound track to Niehl and then joins with the <b>inbound</b> <b>track</b> from Buchheim.|$|E
