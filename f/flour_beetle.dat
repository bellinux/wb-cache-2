Polyandrous behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus. Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as marmosets, mammal groups, the marsupial genus' Antechinus and bandicoots, around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas and dunnocks, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as pipefish.|$|E

50|$|Female red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{polyandrous}} in mating behavior. Within {{a single}} copulation period, a single female will mate with multiple different males. Female red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> engage in polyandrous mating behavior {{in order to}} increase their fertility assurance. By mating with an increased number of males, female beetles obtain a greater amount of sperm. Obtaining a greater amount of sperm is especially important since many sexually active male red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are non-virgins and may be sperm-depleted. It {{is important to note that}} red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> engage in polyandry to obtain a greater amount of sperm from males, not to increase the likelihood of finding genetically compatible sperm.|$|R

2500|$|Adjacent sperm storage organs: [...] Females can {{sometimes}} store sperm in adjacent organs, {{especially when they}} mate multiply and thus give unequal preference to certain males. [...] In many polygamous species, males often {{have the ability to}} displace a previous male's sperm. [...] In response to this, females retain control of sperm choice by using multiple sperm storage sites to exercise cryptic female choice. [...] By moving sperm to adjacent organs females can prevent particular sperm from being displaced and save the displaced sperm for fertilization. Moving the sperm can also prevent it from continuing on in the fertilization process. [...] In the Dryomiza anilis fly and in the <b>flour</b> <b>beetle,</b> females choose sperm from [...] a number of different storage locations. In the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle,</b> females often possess several storage receptacles for sperm from different males, and can choose which spem to utilize for fertilization.|$|E
2500|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{reported}} to be pest and disease free. [...] Primary issues include the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina which attacks the roots and lower stems of the crop causing damping-off disease. The fruit fly species Dacus punctifrons may also attack the fruit of this plant. The fruit generally rots due to the existence of larvae. Halticus tibialis is a flea hopper similar to an aphid and may also cause problems for egusi-itoo crops, often killing the leaves of the plant by sucking out sap. After harvesting many beetle species including the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the cigarette beetle may feed on seeds which are not properly stored in air-tight containers [...] Cucumeropsis mannii provides ground cover, effectively suppressing weeds. Intercropping with sorghum, cassava, coffee, cotton, maize, or banana crops can reduce weedings during the growing season from 2-3 to just one. This has significant positive effects on the female farmer who spends the majority of her time weeding.|$|E
50|$|The {{confused}} <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{very similar}} in appearance and habit to the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tribolium castaneum and the destructive <b>flour</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tribolium destructor. Both the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> are small, about 3-6 mm (1/8-1/4 inch) in length, and reddish-brown in color. The primary distinguishing physical difference is the shape of their antennae: the confused flour beetle's antennae increase gradually in size and have four clubs, while the red flour beetle's antennae have only three. Additionally, red flour beetles {{have been known to}} fly short distances, while confused flour beetles do not. Tribolium destructor is much darker than either and less common.|$|E
50|$|In red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles,</b> {{males are}} known to engage in {{polygamous}} behavior. Research largely shows that Male red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> engage in polygamous behavior to avoid inbreeding depression, especially when there is competition from other males. There is a higher fertilization success in out-bred males when they compete with inbred males to fertilize the same female.|$|R

50|$|During mating, red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are known}} to engage in {{polygamous}} behavior. Male <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> {{have been known to}} recognize their relatives while the females do not have this capability. Lack of the ability to recognize their relatives has led females to mate with any male within the population. Female red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are also known to store sperm after mating. More sperm is stored by the first mating, which leads to less sperm stored in subsequent matings. However, amount of stored sperm does not stop the last male mate from fertilizing the egg. This {{is due to the fact}} that with each mating, males can remove previously stored sperm thus giving their own sperm an advantage to fertilize the egg.|$|R

50|$|Two {{different}} types of beetles are classified as flour beetles: the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle.</b> Both are similar in physical characteristics. They are flat and oval in shape and usually range around 1/8 inch long. Their exoskeletons are reddish brown with a shiny and smooth texture. The eggs, larvae, and pupae resemble each other closely in physical features, as well. The eggs usually {{tend to be a}} white color, or at times even colorless. They are very small in size and have a sticky outer covering that causes certain food particles to stick to them. The larvae have six legs, with two pointy projections toward the caudal end. Finally, the pupal stage (a cocoon-like form) is usually a white or brownish color. The beetle life cycle lasts about three years or more, with the larval stage ranging anywhere from 20 to over 100 days, and the pupal stage around eight days. Beetles usually breed in damaged grain, grain dust, high-moisture wheat kernels and flour. The female <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> can lay between 300 and 400 eggs during her lifetime period of 5 to 8 months. The flour beetles mainly infest grains, including, but not limited to: cereal, corn meal oats, rice, flour, and crackers. This type of beetle is the most abundant insect pest of flour mills across the United States. Their small size allows them to maneuver through cracks and crevices and get into the home and other areas. Once they are present in areas with potential food sources, they can infest material such as flour, resulting in a sharp odor or moldy flavor. The red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is able to fly short distances and the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is unable to fly. While the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is more commonly found in the northern United States, the red flour beetles are more predominant in the southern United States in areas with warmer climates.The red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> are commonly used as a model organisms, to study genetics and ecology. The genome of the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> has been sequenced.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{cosmopolitan}} {{and common}} pestsingrain stores and flour mills. Their ability to exploit {{a wide variety}} of stored products has contributed to their status as major pests of stored food. Although it was previously reported that the same aggregation pheromone, 4, 8 -dimethyldecanal (DMD), is shared by three <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> species (Tribolium castaneum, T. confusum, and T. freemani), the volatiles released by the other Tribolium species associated with stored products have not yet been examined. In the present study, the volatiles produced by males and females of eight Tribolium species were examined by solid phase microextraction (SPME). SPME samples were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Experiments were conducted to identify volatiles emitted by the adults of different Tribolium species and to determine whether DMD is a common aggregation pheromone. We observed that DMD is not a common pheromone of the eight species tested, but is common to T. castaneum, T. confusum, T. freemani, and T. madens. Two other volatiles were detected, 1 -pentadecene, which is shown here to be a common semiochemical of <b>flour</b> <b>beetles,</b> and 1, 6 -pentadecadiene, which was detected in five species (T. audax, T. brevicornis, T. destructor, T. freemani, and T. madens).

40|$|Density {{dependence}} is {{a common}} phenomenon in nature, {{and the intensity of}} density dependence is driven by competition over depletable resources. Habitat selection patterns are often density-dependent, and are driven by decreasing population mean fitness in a habitat as population density increases in that habitat. Yet not all resources are depletable, and non-depletable resources may sometimes be most important in dictating patterns of habitat selection. Ectotherms, for example, are defined by their dependence on environmental temperature to regulate body temperature, and temperature is often the most important resource for ectotherms. Is density dependence an important mechanism in ectotherms, especially when temperature is a limiting factor? In this thesis, I examine density dependence of fitness and habitat selection by ectotherms using red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> and common gartersnakes. In chapter one and three, I test whether density-dependent habitat selection occurs when habitats differ in both temperature and food availability with red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> and common gartersnakes, respectively. In chapter two, I modify the isodar model of habitat selection to account for the effect of temperature on ectotherms, derive predictions from the modified model, and test these predictions with controlled experiments with red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> selecting between habitats that differ in food quantity and temperature. Finally, in chapter four, I examine the effect of density on metrics of fitness and habitat selection with common gartersnakes. Red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> exhibited strong density dependence in both habitat selection and fitness at their optimal temperature, but density dependence weakened at lower temperatures. Common gartersnakes exhibited mostly density-independent habitat selection with a strong preference for warm field habitat over cool forest habitat, but exhibited some density dependence in habitat selection within field habitat. Overall, my thesis demonstrates that ectotherms have variable density-dependent responses, and that these responses are strongly modulated by temperature...|$|R
