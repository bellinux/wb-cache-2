5|$|On 1 September 1939, the {{invasion}} of Poland by Nazi Germany began. Consequently, Britain and France, obligated by the Anglo-Polish military alliance and Franco-Polish alliance to attack Germany {{in the case of}} such an invasion, demanded that Germany withdraw. On 3 September 1939, after Germany failed to comply, Britain, France, and most countries of the British Empire declared war on Germany, but provided little military support to Poland. They took minimal military action <b>during</b> <b>what</b> became known as the Phony War.|$|E

5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; <b>during</b> <b>what</b> became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} <b>during</b> <b>what</b> {{became known as}} the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies {{on one side and the}} USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E

5|$|For {{three months}} in 1985, 3,000 minor {{earthquakes}} were detected in the northwestern section of the park, <b>during</b> <b>what</b> {{has been referred to}} as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} in 1894 {{in the village of}} Kalinovka, which is close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was {{employed}} as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. With the help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges, and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there. <b>During</b> <b>what</b> was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of World War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.|$|E
5|$|Lion was hit twice more, <b>during</b> <b>what</b> came to {{be called}} the Run to the North, after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships slowly moved out of range and rendezvoused with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. Beatty {{gradually}} turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre. By 18:35 Beatty was following the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180Â° turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Beatty then turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast to search for Hipper's ships.|$|E

5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize <b>during</b> <b>what</b> little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E
5|$|Lord Methuen {{failed to}} perform {{adequate}} reconnaissance {{in preparation for}} the impending battle, and was unaware that Boer Vecht-generaal (Combat General) De la Rey had entrenched his forces {{at the foot of the}} hills rather than the forward slopes as was the accepted practice. This allowed the Boers to survive the initial British artillery bombardment; when the British troops failed to deploy from a compact formation during their advance, the defenders were able to inflict heavy casualties. The Highland Brigade suffered the worst casualties, while on the Boer side, the Scandinavian Corps was destroyed. The Boers attained a tactical victory and succeeded in holding the British in their advance on Kimberley. The battle was the second of three battles <b>during</b> <b>what</b> became known as the Black Week of the Second Boer War.|$|E

5|$|The Devonian {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks <b>during</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as}} the Late Devonian extinction; one {{at the end of the}} Frasnian stage, and one twice as large at the end of the following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive tetrapods with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The {{king was}} {{reluctant}} to shed blood, and this greatly irritated the ultra-reactionary Chamber of Deputies, who felt that Louis XVIII was not executing enough. The government issued a proclamation of amnesty to the âtraitorsâ in January 1816, but the trials that had already begun were finished in due course. That same declaration also banned {{any member of the}} House of Bonaparte from owning property in, or entering, France.

5|$|When the Second World War {{began in}} September 1939, Lang saw his main duty as the {{preservation}} of spiritual values <b>during</b> <b>what</b> he deemed to be an honourable conflict. He opposed strategies such as indiscriminate bombing, and on 21 December 1940, {{in a letter to}} The Times signed jointly with Temple and Cardinal Hinsley, Lang expressed support for the pope's Five Peace Points initiative. Lang was sympathetic to the Sword of the Spirit campaign, founded by Cardinal Hinsley in 1940 to combat anti-democratic tendencies among Catholics. In May 1941 Lambeth Palace, Lang's London home, was hit by bombs and made uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} {{in what would}} become the Battle of Britain began for his unit on 12 July 1940. The fighting reached a climax on 7 August when Eagle Day was launched (code name Adlertag). Hitler had issued FÃ¼hrer Directive no. 17 (Weisung Nr. 17) on 1 August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force (RAF) to achieve air supremacy, or at least air superiority, in preparation for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen SeelÃ¶we), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain. From 7 September onwards, the Luftwaffe switched to attack British towns and cities, with London coming under particularly heavy attack, <b>during</b> <b>what</b> was dubbed The Blitz by the British. In total, Philipp flew 130 missions over England. His number of aerial victories increased, including his 12th to 15th on 27 September, which led to the presentation of the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe on 28 September 1940. He claimed his 20th victory on 20 October, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He was the second pilot of JG54 to receive this award. The first was his Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) Hauptmann Dietrich Hrabak, who received the award one day earlier.|$|E
