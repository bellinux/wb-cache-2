25|$|Also {{released}} in 2003, Adams formed a punk band called The Finger with Jesse Malin, Colin Burns, and Johnny T. Yerington. The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s Raleigh, North Carolina rock band Finger, of which Adams {{was a big}} fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists {{to return to their}} punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk bandHeart Attack and more famously as the lead singer of D Generation). They began by releasing two EPs: We Are <b>Fuck</b> <b>You</b> and Punk's Dead Let's Fuck which were later collected to form the albumWe Are <b>Fuck</b> <b>You,</b> Released in 2003.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), is being asked {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, <b>fuck</b> <b>you,</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>you,</b> you're cool, <b>fuck</b> <b>you</b> – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E

[...] At the end of the song, Rihanna performs new lyrics which were not included on the original 1 minute and 18 second interlude; [...] "Remember how you did it/ If you still wanna kiss it/ Then come and get it." [...] According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Sun, the instrumentation of [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] consists of [...] "snaky, slurpy, bass-droppin' beats." [...] The song's lyrics revolve around sadomasochistic sexuality and dominance over men, and consists mainly of oral sex metaphors, including the lyric [...] "Doggy want the kitty." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{track is}} [...] "American Wedding", a 7-minute remake of [...] "Hotel California" [...] by American rock band Eagles. The track expresses an extended {{tale of a}} shotgun marriage and subsequent divorce. Its here that we [...] "might get a little peek into {{the psychology of the}} man shirking the foremost genre for love songs: He doesn't believe in love. At least not in the United States." [...] The song has a [...] "totally unexpected ending for a song told as a flashback." [...] The album ends with [...] "Nature Feels", a reinterpretation of MGMT's [...] "Electric Feel". The song exhibits Ocean as an [...] "openly fun character", opening the song with the line [...] "I've been meaning to <b>fuck</b> <b>you</b> in the garden."

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, <b>fuck</b> <b>you,</b> I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to ruin my life and you think that it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on."

500|$|... "Closer" [...] {{features}} a heavily modified bass drum sample from the Iggy Pop song [...] "Nightclubbing" [...] from his album The Idiot. Lyrically, it is {{a meditation on}} self-hatred and obsession, but to Reznor's dismay, the song was widely misinterpreted as a lust anthem due to its chorus, which included the line [...] "I wanna <b>fuck</b> <b>you</b> like an animal". The music video for [...] "Closer" [...] was directed by Mark Romanek and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network heavily censored the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig's head spinning on a machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag. A radio edit that partially censored the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime. The video has since been made part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.|$|E

500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: <b>fuck</b> <b>you,</b> fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them."

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} the {{interlude}} is spare and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting, [...] "cake cake cake cake cake cake." [...] Aside from the repetitive chant of [...] "cake", the interlude consists of multiple sexual metaphors. The lyric [...] "I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticing/ Nothing else like this, I'ma make you my bitch/ And it's not even my birthday/ But you wanna put your name on it" [...] is a metaphor referring to a vagina. Rihanna sings about the desire to have spontaneous sex. Rihanna promises her lover that she will make him do whatever she pleases, singing [...] "I'mma make you my bitch." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy of The Montreal Gazette described the lyric as a [...] "promise", with Rihanna intending to act upon her desires. The interlude ends mid-verse and mid-lyric with a fade at 1:18. Katherine St. Asaph of Popdust described the fade as [...] "ungraceful", as well as writing that it makes the track appear as {{though it is not}} finished. Upon the fade, Rihanna puts forward the line [...] "Ooh, I wanna <b>fuck</b> <b>you</b> right now." [...] Dunlevy and St. Asaph were critical of the final line, with the former labelling it as [...] "blatant", and the latter noting that [...] "cursing makes everything obvious." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times {{stated that}} [...] "Cabaret" [...] is a [...] "percolating bedroom jam that depicts sex {{as a form}} of at-home theater". Boston Globes Sarah Rodman called the song a [...] "sexed-up jam". HitFix's Melinda Newman {{described}} the song as a [...] "loop-driven to getting down with your lady, who’s taking off her clothes as quickly as she can". According to Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine, in [...] "Cabaret", Timberlake compares the love to a burlesque and noted that the song resembles producer Timbaland's earlier work. Andy Kellman of Allmusic wrote that the song features Timbaland's signature sound and finds Timberlake proclaiming more [...] "clever/nauseating" [...] lyrics: [...] "If sex is a contest, then you're coming first"; [...] "'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we're laying in a manger." [...] The chorus is consisted of Timberlake singing [...] "It's a cabaret" [...] while being accompanied by Timbaland, who repeats [...] "Put on a show, get on the floor". According to Stern, in his part with a duration about two minutes, Drake raps raunchy and fast-talking lines, [...] "I’mma <b>fuck</b> <b>you</b> like we’re having an affair". Nick Krewen of Toronto Star wrote that Drake raps lines [...] "about a sexual tête-à-tête amidst a melee of scattershot rhythms".|$|E

500|$|Poppy Cosyns of The Sun said Spears [...] "reaffirm her bad-girl {{image on}} the album's {{infectious}} second single", while BBC Music's Talia Kraines thought that the singer [...] "loves the attention being shone directly on her as the 'ringleader' as she sings of adrenaline flowing through her veins when it's time {{to put on a}} show." [...] Ben Norman of About.com considered the song a [...] "true and triumphant Britney Spears pop song with a pensive underbelly (the first verse in particular) and a supremely executed hook." [...] Jonny Mugwump of The Quietus said, [...] "a paean to her performance adrenalin, [...] a medium-paced, big power-popper topped with an orbit-esque guitar," [...] and commented that the song's lyrics highlight Spears' uniqueness – [...] "the <b>fuck</b> <b>you</b> attitude. Despite everything, regardless of the personal destruction and undoubted hell she might still be haunted by, within the fictional space of the music, this woman couldn't give a damn. She rightly taunts the world around her, sounding utterly defiant. There is no place for apology or humble platitudes." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH also praised its lyrics, describing them as [...] "a confident, and encouraging, return to form."

500|$|DJ Evil Dee and Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz, who {{produced}} the album, put their samplers to use here, lacing the album with their signature basement sound, filled with hard drums, grimy horn arrangements and deep basslines. In the album's liner notes, DJ Evil Dee stated: [...] "This album {{was done on}} blunted terms. Anyone who is offended by {{the contents of the}} album, <b>FUCK</b> <b>YOU.</b> Nuff said." [...] Allmusic describes the dark production: [...] "The Beatminerz production crew craft subterranean beats to match Buckshot's mayhem. The tracks are dark, layered with muted jazz samples, and seemingly bottomless." [...] A few of the samples used here were later recreated by a number of hip hop artists in the 1990s. The single [...] "Buck Em Down" [...] features a sample from Donald Byrd's [...] "Wind Parade", a sample which was later re-used for Organized Konfusion's 1994 concept track [...] "Stray Bullet". [...] "How Many MC's..." [...] features a sample from Grover Washington, Jr.'s [...] "Hydra", which was used for earlier hip hop tracks like EPMD's [...] "Underground". The iconic [...] "Who Got Da Props" [...] heavily utilizes a looped sample from Ronnie Laws's jazz classic [...] "Tidal Wave", which was featured in several hip-hop and R tracks, including Usher's [...] "Think Of You" [...] from his self-titled 1994 album. Evil Dee and Walt take a portion of the sample and craft it into a different loop.|$|E
500|$|The band's break, {{according}} to Mick Pyro, {{came as a}} result of ten days recording time they won in [...] "some competition or something, some fucking battle of the bands". In 2003, Republic of Loose signed to Big Cat Records. The single [...] "Girl I'm Gonna <b>Fuck</b> <b>You</b> Up", released in late 2003, was largely ignored by daytime radio in Ireland, with Mick Pyro commenting in an early Hot Press interview: [...] "We were never going to be the type of band that Larry Gogan or Ian Dempsey would play anyway, regardless of the lyric". The band's debut album, This is the Tomb of the Juice, was partially recorded in the ten days studio time they had won in the aforementioned competition. This is the Tomb of the Juice was recorded in 2003 then released in 2004. 2004 was also the year in which Republic of Loose débuted at Oxegen (on the New Band Stage), a festival at which they have since regularly performed. Singles [...] "Comeback Girl" [...] and [...] "You Know It" [...] were released in July and October 2005 respectively, both achieving significant airplay on Irish radio and entering the top thirty of the Irish Singles Chart. By 2006 the band had toured Ireland, the United Kingdom, where they performed at festivals such as Glastonbury and T in the Park, and France, where they performed at Furia Sound Festival, Nice Jazz Festival and Les Transmusicales. They also performed alongside veteran rock band Lir at Vicar Street in January 2006.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and <b>fuck</b> <b>you!</b> Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E
