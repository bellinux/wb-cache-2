40|$|For {{more than}} a century, lawyers have written about legal reasoning, and the flow of books and {{articles}} describing, analyzing, and reformulating the topic continues unabated. The volume and persistence of this 2 ̆ 2 unrelenting discussion 2 ̆ 2 (Simon, 1998, p. 4) {{suggests that there is}} no solid consensus about what legal reasoning is. Legal scholars have a tenacious intuition - or at least a strong hope - that legal reasoning is distinctive, {{that it is not the}} same as logic, or scientific reasoning, or ordinary decision making, and there have been dozens of attempts to describe what it is that sets it apart from these other forms of thinking. These attempts generate criticism, the critics devise new formulations that generate further criticism, and the process continues. In this chapter, <b>I</b> describe the <b>primary</b> <b>forms</b> of legal reasoning, the most important schools of thought about legal reasoning, and some of the major differences between legal reasoning and scientific reasoning...|$|R
40|$|The {{lysosomal}} protease cathepsin B {{has been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} pathologies including pancreatitis, tumor angiogenesis, and neuronal diseases. We used a tube formation assay to investigate the role of cathepsin B in angiogenesis. When cultured between two layers of collagen <b>I,</b> <b>primary</b> endothelial cells <b>formed</b> tubes in response to exogenously added VEGF. Overexpressing cathepsin B reduced the VEGF-dependent tube response, whereas pharmacologically or molecularly suppressing cathepsin B eliminated the dependence on exogenous VEGF. However, tube formation still required VEGF receptor activity, which suggested that endothelial cells generated VEGF. Indeed, VEGF mRNA and protein was detectable in cells treated with cathepsin B inhibitor, which correlated with a rise in the level of HIF- 1 α. In addition to boosting the level of proangiogenic factors, blocking cathepsin B activity reduced the amount of the antiangiogenic protein endostatin. Thus endothelial cells have the intrinsic capacity to generate pro- and antiangiogenic agents. These observations complement and expand our appreciation of how endothelial cell–derived proteases regulate angiogenesis...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is an interpretive {{study of the}} dynamics of cultural identification as enacted by Chinese individuals living overseas who participate in a virtual online community known as Wenxuecity. com. The study draws on intercultural communication theories of identity proposed by Carbaugh, Collier, and Hecht, as well as on my own integrative framework for the analysis of cultural identity, to explore the self-other interaction in identity enactment, the multidimensionality of identity, and the centrality of communication in processes of identification. Through the application of a qualitative analysis of online discourse, <b>I</b> found three <b>primary</b> <b>forms</b> of cultural identification – perceptual, strategic, and positional cultural identification – that reveal how online commentators make sense of their individual and group identities. Through online discussion of a variety of topics – from China’s history, East-West tensions, to academic power structures and racial hierarchies in host cultures or media stereotyping and global hegemonic relations – and using communicative strategies like self-other comparison, advice, and ideological debate, commentators enact both a sense of group cohesiveness as well as their internal, conflictive heterogeneity. Their discourse allows for the exploration of how multiple dimensions of identity – individuality, sociality, materiality, and spirituality – intersect to shape the fragmentary character of cultural identification. In the particular case of the group under study, the dominant trends observed reveal that cultural identification is a process characterized by the enactment of a sense of marginalization in host societies, heightened individuality, strategic attachment to or distancing from Chinese cultural membership, and ideological divisions.

40|$|International audienceNanoparticles play an {{important}} role in controlling the mobility of pollutants such as arsenic (As) in the environment. In natural waters, aggregates of nanoparticles can be constituted of organic matter (OM) associated with iron (Fe). However, little is known about their network structure, especially the role of each component in the resulting aggregate morphology. This network structure can be of major importance for the metal and metalloid sorption processes. We synthesized an aggregate model of nanoparticles by varying the Fe/organic carbon (OC) ratio (R). By coupling small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we revealed the fractal organization of Fe (<b>i.</b> e. <b>primary</b> beads <b>forming</b> a nanoparticle called an intermediate aggregate and then forming a secondary aggregate of nanoparticles). As the aggregate size increases with R, the As adsorption rate increases at a constant As/Fe ratio. Two hypotheses were considered: with increasing R, i) the repulsion interactions between the nanoparticles increase, inducing a structure opening, and ii) the Fe part size increases more strongly and is more ramified than the OM part, leading to a decrease of the coating by OM. Both hypotheses involve an increase in the number of available As binding sites. This study offers new perspectives on the impact of the network structure of heterogeneous nano-aggregates on their sorption capacity and could explain some metal/metalloid sorption variations observed in natural samples with variations in Fe/OC ratios...|$|R
