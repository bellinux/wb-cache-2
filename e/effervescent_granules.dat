30|$|<b>Effervescent</b> tablets or <b>granules</b> contain {{mixtures}} of acid(s) (e.g., citric acid, tartaric acid) and base(s) (sodium or potassium bicarbonate/carbonate). Upon contact with water, these formulations {{have the capability}} to react with each other and liberate carbon dioxide gas resulting in the effervescent action (Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, General Chapters, 2017; Bertuzzi, 2009; Shrewsbury, 2015). For some active ingredients that are not stable for compounding into liquid form, oral solution or suspension may be administered to the patients who have difficulties in swallowing by prior dissolution of the <b>effervescent</b> tablet or <b>granules</b> in a cup of water. This study investigated both rivastigmine tartrate and donepezil hydrochloride (HCl). Both model drugs are cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The approved dosage forms by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for rivastigmine tartrate are capsules and extended release transdermal film loaded with free drug ([URL] 2017). However, rivastigmine tartrate liquid has been discontinued. The approved dosage forms for donepezil HCl are available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablet ([URL] 2017). This study aimed to investigate the substitution of commonly used effervescent acids (such as citric acid and/or tartaric acid) (Bertuzzi, 2009) with a less studied fruit acid (malic acid). This study suggests an improvement strategy.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The herbal Espinheira Santa (Maytenus ilicifolia) can {{ingested}} in capsules {{for treatment}} of injuries from digestive tract, such as gastritis. However, {{the large amount of}} drug administered dose medication adherence difficult, so this study sought an alternative by formulating <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> facilitating drug intake. The obtained granules made by wet and effervescent mixture of citric acid, sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate at different concentrations, totaling eight formulations, in addition to lactose as diluent and disintegrant in the composition. The granules were produced in sizes from 1 and 2 mm. Rheological tests were compared against the dry extract, analyzed the average particle sizes of beads, mapped its surface by scanning electron microscopy and evaluated their behavior effervescent. The flow properties of the granules showed better values than the dry extract. The co-processed formulations showed average particle sizes distributed closed, where 1 mm time effervescence had smaller, respecting all formulations, pharmacopeial limits of maximum 5 minutes.

40|$|The {{medicinal}} plant Maytenus ilicifolia is a commonly used phytomedicine {{for the treatment}} of gastritis. The high dose required and low density of these extracts make necessary a daily intake of several capsules, hindering adherence to the medication. The purpose of this work was to develop a suitable dosage form for the administration of Maytenus ilicifolia using <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules.</b> A 23 factorial design was used to study the physical characteristics of the granules (particle size distribution, repose angle, Carr index, scanning electron microscopy and disintegration time). Moisture stability was also determined. According to the experimental design, granule size is {{the most important factor in}} determining the flow characteristics of <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules.</b> In turn, the disintegration time is controlled by the content of sodium bicarbonate present in the effervescent mixture as well as the granule size. The stability of formulations when exposed to moisture is strongly influenced by the percentage of effervescent mixture present in the vegetal granules. Precautions in handling and storage should be taken to ensure the stability of these preparations. The <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> produced from Maytenus ilicifolia met the pharmacopoeial quality parameters, with appropriate mechanical and physical characteristics and proved to be a promising vehicle for plant extracts...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse the {{population}} pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of racemic ibuprofen administered in suspension or as <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> {{with the aim}} of exploring the effect of formulation on the relevant pharmacodynamic parameters. DESIGN: The pharmacokinetic model was developed from a randomised, cross-over bioequivalence study of the 2 formulations in healthy adults. The pharmacodynamic model was developed from a randomised, multicentre, single dose efficacy and safety study of the 2 formulations in febrile children. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Pharmacokinetics were studied in 18 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45 years, and pharmacodynamics were studied in 103 febrile children aged between 4 and 16 years with bodyweight 225 kg. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic study consisted of two 1 -day study occasions, each separated by a 1 -week washout period. On each occasion ibuprofen 400 mg was administered orally as suspension or granules. The time course of the antipyretic effect was evaluated in febrile children receiving a single oral dose of 7 mg/kg in suspension or 200 or 400 mg as <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules.</b> During the pharmacodynamic analysis, the predicted typical pharmacokinetic profile (based on the pharmacokinetic model previously developed) was used. RESULTS: The disposition of ibuprofen was described by a 2 -compartment model. No statistical differences (p > 0. 05) were found between the 2 formulations in the distribution and elimination parameters. Absorption of ibuprofen from suspension was adequately described by a first-order process; however, a model with 2 parallel first-order input sites was used for the drug given as <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules,</b> leading to time to reach maximum drug concentration (tmax) values of 0. 9 and 1. 9 hours for suspension and granules, respectively. The time course of the antipyretic effect was best described using an indirect response model. The estimates (with percentage coefficients of variation in parentheses) of Emax (maximum inhibition of the zero-order synthesis rate of the factor causing fever), EC 50 (plasma concentration eliciting half of Emax), n (slope parameter) and k(out) (first order rate constant of degradation) were 0. 055 (10), 6. 16 (14) mg/L, 2. 71 (18) and 1. 17 (23) h(- 1), respectively, where To is the estimate of the basal temperature, 38. 8 (1) degrees C. No significant (p > 0. 05) covariate effects (including pharmaceutical formulation) were detected in any of the pharmacodynamic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the indirect nature of the effect exerted by ibuprofen, the implications of differences found in the plasma drug concentration profiles between suspension and <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> are less apparent in the therapeutic response...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work was to prepare a chrono modulated delivery system to meet chronopharmacological needs of asthma. In this study theophylline was selected as a model drug. To meet this objective we considered an initial lag phase of release for 3 - 5 hrs and later a rapid (surge) release phase. To achieve surge release a rapidly releasing core tablet of theophylline was developed by admixing theophylline with <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> and super disintegrants. The lag phase in release was achieved by coating the EV core tablets with release retarding polymer EUDRAGIT RS- 100 containing HPMC, further over coated with enteric polymer CAP.

30|$|Very {{little water}} {{should be used}} as an ingredient, or be {{encountered}} during compounding and handling <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> and tablets. It is advised to process effervescent tablets in an environment of NMT 25 % RH and controlled room temperature (Bertuzzi, 2009). Granules should be packaged in individual pouches, while tablets be packaging with desiccants in thin tall tubes with internal polymeric coat and hermetic seal to insure complete protection. Quantities sufficient for a limited time period use, such as for 2  weeks, are also advised (Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, General Chapters, 2017). The label of “Not to open until the time of use” should also be included. Otherwise, they may self-destruct due to the effervescent reaction catalyzed by the water vapor present inside a container. When pharmaceutical scientists purchase raw materials, caution for the impurity being trapped in during manufacturing and purification processes must be taken. The impurity components and compositions should be made available in the safety data sheet of a raw material. Detection of hydrate present in a compound may be done with DSC combined with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), HPLC or FTIR in comparison with its USP Reference Standard.|$|E
40|$|A 59 -year-old woman, who had {{a history}} of {{cervical}} cancer managed with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, presented in December 2008 with a 1 -week history of vomiting blood and passing melaena. Her haemoglobin level had dropped from 93 g/L to 75 g/L. The patient had been referred for endoscopic evaluation of her oesophagus and this examination revealed a mid-oesophageal, submucosal mass measuring 20 to 25 cm. There were no ulcerations or erosions. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a heterogeneously echogenic lesion involving the submucosa and extending outside the muscularis propria. Multiple large vascular channels ranging in size from 7 to 15 mm were present (Fig 1 a and b). Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a mildly enhancing oesophageal mass and the presence of phleboliths (Fig 2 a). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thorax was performed to better delineate the longitudinal extent of the lesion. <b>Effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> were given to the patient before scanning to ensure adequate distension of her oesophagus.

40|$|Aspirin {{has been}} used therapeutically for over 100 years. As the {{originator}} and an important marketer of aspirin-containing products, Bayer’s clinical trial database contains numerous reports of the pharmacokinetics of various aspirin formulations. These include evaluations of plain tablets, effervescent tablets, granules, chewable tablets, and fast-release tablets. This publication seeks to expand upon the available pharmacokinetic information concerning aspirin formulations. In the pre-systemic circulation, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is rapidly converted into its main active metabolite, salicylic acid (SA). Therefore, both substances are measured in plasma and reported in the results. The 500 mg strength of each formulation was chosen for analysis as {{this is the most}} commonly used for analgesia. A total of 22 studies were included in the analysis. All formulations of 500 mg aspirin result in comparable plasma exposure to ASA and SA as evidenced by AUC. Tablets and dry granules provide a consistently lower Cmax compared to <b>effervescent,</b> <b>granules</b> in suspension and fast release tablets. Effervescent tablets, fast release tablets, and granules in suspension provide a consistently lower median Tmax compared to dry granules and tablets for both ASA and SA.

To investigate the hypoglycemic activity of the <b>effervescent</b> <b>granules</b> prepared using E. ulmoides Oliv. and moso bamboo leaves (EBEG) in HepG 2 cells, EBEG were prepared with 5 % of each of polysaccharides and chlorogenic acids from moso bamboo and E. ulmoides Oliv. leaves, respectively. HepG 2 cells cultured in a high-glucose medium were classified into different groups. The results displayed EBEG-treated cells showed better glucose utilization than the negative controls; thus, the hypoglycemic effect of EBEG was much {{greater than that of}} granules prepared using either component alone, thereby indicating that this effect was due to a synergistic action of the components. Further, glucose consumption levels in the cells treated with EBEG (156. 35 % at 200 [*]μg/mL) and the positive controls (metformin, 162. 29 %; insulin, 161. 52 %) were similar. Thus, EBEG exhibited good potential for use as a natural antidiabetic agent. The hypoglycemic effect of EBEG could be due to the synergistic action of polysaccharides from the moso bamboo leaves and chlorogenic acids from E. ulmoides Oliv. leaves via the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and glucose- 6 -phosphate displacement enzyme...|$|E
