50|$|The legendary {{story of}} the origin of Irete town goes back to one migrant named Nwaoha. Nwaoha has two stories {{regarding}} his place of origin. One has it that he migrated from Arochukwu via Ubomiri and settled at the region of the present Aboha village in Ohii. The other story has it that he migrated with his younger relative, Ara from Owaelu in the present Uratta in Owerri North Local Government Area. Nwaoha is today the ancestor of the five communities that constitute Umunwaoha:1. Ohigide: the first surviving son of Nwaoha (Emeohe died without an offspring).2. Ogwe: the ancestor of Orogwe.3. Egwu: the ancestor of Ndegwu.4. Nkowu-ohia: the ancestor of Amakohia-Ubi.5. Ubiam: the ancestor of Irete and the last son of Nwaoha.The various versions of the {{story of the}} origin of Irete all agree that Ubiam was the ancestor of Agu, who was the father of Eregerenwa, the Irete of today.Ubiam, the youngest son of Nwaoha was said to have received two main blessings from his father, which were to insulate him from the oppression of his elder brothers because Nwaoha believed that Ubiam was his father re-incarnate. Ubiam was said to have received from Nwaoha, the greatest and most revered spiritual staff of authority (ofo) named “Nwakparaku”. The Nwakparaku staff (ofo ukwu) besides being spiritually important, also endowed Ubiam and his descendants with political roles among the descendants of Nwaoha especially in the pre-colonial age.The second blessing Ubiam received from his father was the Ofo Nta. This staff is used till today during the Nta festival. The Nta festival is an annual ceremony among the five sons of Nwaoha. All the five sons of Nwaoha participate in the Nta festival in turns, starting from Orogwe and closing with Ohii. The political significance of the Ofo Nta to Irete vis-à-vis the rest of Umunwaoha was lost because of hate and acrimony by the other four brothers and their descendants against Ubiam {{as a result of his}} possession of the gift of Ofo Nta. They made desperate efforts to get back the Ofo Nta from Ubiam but, with the help of his elder brother Ogwe, Ubiam was able to resist the pressure. Ogwe led Ubiam to hide the Ofo Nta at Umuguma in Ara, where the daughter of Nwaoha was married to a man called Ugo. It is for this reason that till today, Irete takes the Ofo Nta from Umuguma every year in the company of his elder brother, Orogwe. It is as a result of his assistance that till today, the rotation of the hosting right of the annual Nta festival in Umunwaoha begins with Orogwe in compensation for his brotherly help. However it is important to note that today, Irete is the only community amongst Umunwaoha Ofo Ise that uses the Nta Staff of authority for its Nta festival. It is believed that other communities withdrew in anger as a result of differences and misunderstandings in sharing of the properties of their great ancestor, Nwaoha.To this day, Nwakparaku (Ofo Ukwu) and Ofo Nta, the two <b>essential</b> <b>staff</b> of authority of Nwaoha are still located at Umuogbunda lineage in Umueye, Irete. The lineage or succession of holding the two Ofos till date is as follows:i. Ubiam to Aguii. Agu to Eregerenwa (Irete)iii. Eregerenwa to Eyeiv. Eye to Oriev. Orie to Nwahihievi. Nwahihie to Ukaravii. Ukara to Abiangwoviii. Abiangwo to Ogbundaix. Ogbunda to Ekehx. Ekeh to Ihemexi. Iheme to Ijewuonwu (the man who received Douglas, the white District Officer from Owerri)xii. Ijewuonwu to Ekwelibe (the father of the present Eze of Irete, HRH Eze Ethelbert C. Ekwelibe)xiii. Ekwelibe to Kelechi - called onye ishi ala - the present holder of the Ofos.Ubiam it was, who in a show of courage, patriotism and ingenuity killed with an improvised warhead and a machete, a mythical elephant that ravaged and terrorized the towns of Umunwaoha and its environs. History has it that he developed his own technology using a large quantity of gun powder, then stones wrapped in animal skin to serve as bullets, to produce massive warheads. The bullets were planted in a heap of yams with the gun powder stuffed in, then the tinder was lighted, which burned slowly. As the elephant swallowed the bullets along with the yams, the tinder ignited the gun powder and it exploded in the entrails of the elephant. The stones, which acted as war heads ruptured the inner organs of the elephant. When Ubiam noticed that smoke came out of the trunk and other openings of the elephant, he descended on it and with a well sharpened machete, beheaded and stood astride the fallen elephant to the admiration of his elder brothers. This earned him the appellation, “Ubiam ji mma gbue enyi”, meaning “the great Ubiam that killed the elephant with a machete”.|$|E

40|$|With an {{increase}} in large scale Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services for children with autism, the need to define and measure quality is <b>essential.</b> <b>Staff</b> competence is key and identifying and measuring this accurately is critical. ABA service providers typically measure competence by direct observation, video analysis, and written examination. However, apart from the York Measure of Quality of Intensive Behavioural Intervention (YMQI) there is an interesting lack of direct links between defining competencies and developing assessment tools. In this study we used three measures of competencies developed from the UK ABA Autism Education Competence Framework Level 1. Along with the YMQI we assessed their construct validity by comparing the performance of two groups of tutors working in a school for children with autism (“experienced” vs. “inexperienced”) and performance of the “inexperienced” group at baseline (T 1) and following one year of competence based training (T 2). Results revealed that the more experienced group in both the between group and longitudinal comparisons achieved higher scores supporting {{the construct validity of}} the measures.

This paper explores facilitators and barriers {{in the process of}} implementation of innovations in genetic health care.

Barriers and facilitators in transition processes were identified using mixed methods, including an online open-ended questionnaire among professionals and an international expert meeting. A multi-case study approach was used to explore recent experiences with innovations in genetic services in different phases of implementation. Barriers encountered in transitions in genetic service provision include the following: lack of genetic knowledge and skills among nongenetic health care providers, resistance to new divisions of responsibilities, and a need for more close collaboration and communication between geneticists and nongeneticists. Facilitating factors include the following: statutory registration of genetic specialists, availability of <b>essential</b> <b>staff</b> and equipment, and existence of registries and guidelines. Other challenges are experienced in the establishment of the appropriate legal and financial structures.

40|$|Excerpt] The early {{phase of}} {{recruitment}} is <b>essential</b> to <b>staffing</b> success: larger applicant pools permit managers {{to be more}} selective when making job offers and increase the overall utility of selection systems (Murphy, 1986). Despite {{the importance of this}} early stage of recruitment, little is known about how early recruitment practices affect potential applicants’ intentions and decisions to pursue job opportunities (Breaugh 2 ̆ 6 Starke, 2000). In addition, existing research on the first phase of recruitment is limited because most recruitment research has only concentrated on a small range of recruitment practices that are typically deployed during later phases of recruitment like the job interview (Rynes, 1991).
