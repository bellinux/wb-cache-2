50|$|The {{anamorphic}} {{section of}} the original Iscorama was the template for subsequent Iscorama adapters, all of which shared its 1.5× horizontal stretch ratio, patented <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and adjustable anamorphic alignment capability. The ISCO anamorphic <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was unique in that the taking lens was simply set to infinity and then focus was adjusted using the anamorphic adapter alone. This was a major advance on competing manufacturers' designs, all of which required that focus was calibrated simultaneously on both the taking lens and the adapter.|$|E

50|$|The Leica II {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1932, with a built in rangefinder coupled to the lens <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This model has a separate viewfinder (showing a reduced image) and rangefinder. In 1932 the flange to filmplane was standardised to 28.8mm, first implemented on Leica model C, and the Leica Standard the next year.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{models were}} copied {{in whole or}} in part by the U.S.S.R., mostly models which were {{intended}} for filming animation or special effects process plates, or for high-speed filming. In a few cases, the U.S.S.R. added spinning mirror-shutter reflex focusing and viewing, thereby deleting the Mitchell-designed rackover <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the Mitchell-designed side viewer.|$|E

40|$|Design-centered {{learning}} environments offer great promise for providing effective, grounded learning experiences. Learners {{are given a}} set of design criteria and a library of components which they use to design artifacts that will satisfy the specified criteria. Despite their appeal, design-centered {{learning environments}} are plagued with complexities that can overwhelm learners. To address this problem, we have developed a proactive problem-solving <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> that helps learners cope with the complexities inherent in design-centered learning. By exploiting a rich model of the design context, the <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> selects design problems and intervenes with multimedia advice. The mechanism has been implemented in Design-A-Plant, a design-centered learning environment for botanical anatomy and physiology.

These are considered to be compromise designs, suited for convenience, but not well suited for work that falls outside their designed range.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{constraint}} in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but differs from the constraint that shows up in mathematical optimization. In TOC, the constraint {{is used as a}} <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for management of the system. In optimization, the constraint is written into the mathematical expressions to limit the scope of the solution (X can be no greater than 5).|$|E
50|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{camera is}} a camera {{fitted with a}} rangefinder, typically a split-image rangefinder: a range-finding <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> allowing the photographer to measure the subject distance and take photographs that are in sharp focus. Most varieties of rangefinder show two images of the same subject, one of which moves when a calibrated wheel is turned; when the two images coincide and fuse into one, the distance can be read off the wheel. Older, non-coupled rangefinder cameras display the focusing distance and require the photographer to transfer the value to the lens focus ring; cameras without built-in rangefinders could have an external rangefinder fitted into the accessory shoe. Earlier cameras of this type had separate viewfinder and rangefinder windows; later the rangefinder was incorporated into the viewfinder. More modern designs have rangefinders coupled to the <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> so that the lens is focused correctly when the rangefinder images fuse; compare with the focusing screen in non-autofocus SLRs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{framework}} of encoder-decoder with attention for sequence labelling based spoken language understanding. We introduce Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory - Long Short Term Memory networks (BLSTM-LSTM) as the encoder-decoder model to fully utilize the power of deep learning. In the sequence labelling task, the input and output sequences are aligned word by word, while the attention mechanism cannot provide the exact alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> for encoder-decoder framework. Experiments on the standard ATIS dataset showed that BLSTM-LSTM with <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> defined the new state-of-the-art by outperforming standard BLSTM and attention based encoder-decoder. Further experiments also show that the proposed model is more robust to speech recognition errors. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

50|$|The {{stage of}} an {{inverted}} microscope is usually fixed, and focus is adjusted {{by moving the}} objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment.|$|R
50|$|Overhead {{projectors}} normally {{include a}} manual <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> which raises and lowers {{the position of}} the focusing lens (including the folding mirror) in order to adjust the object distance (optical distance between the slide and the lens) to focus at the chosen image distance (distance to the projection screen) given the fixed focal length of the focusing lens. This permits a range of projection distances.|$|E
50|$|The einzel lens {{principle}} in a simplified form {{was also used}} as a <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> in display and television cathode ray tubes, and {{has the advantage of}} providing a good sharply focused spot throughout the useful life of the tube's electron gun, with minimal or no readjustment needed (many monochrome TVs did not have or need focus controls), although in high-resolution monochrome displays and all colour CRT displays an (engineer-adjustable) focus potentiometer control is provided.|$|E
5000|$|An {{eyepiece}} {{consists of}} several [...] "lens elements" [...] in a housing, with a [...] "barrel" [...] on one end. The barrel is shaped {{to fit in}} a special opening of the instrument {{to which it is}} attached. The image can be focused by moving the eyepiece nearer and further from the objective. Most instruments have a <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> to allow movement of the shaft in which the eyepiece is mounted, without needing to manipulate the eyepiece directly.|$|E
5000|$|Toggle {{focus is}} very rarely used (e.g. Carson Bandit 8x25 [...] ). It {{provides}} a one-handed <b>focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in a relatively}} large toggle, making it quick and easy to operate [...] "in the field" [...] with gloves but can be rather over-sensitive and difficult to fine tune.|$|R
5000|$|Polaroid {{integral}} film packs usually {{contain a}} flat [...] "Polapulse" [...] electrical battery, which powers {{systems in the}} camera, including exposure and <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> electronic flash, and a film ejection motor. The inclusion of the battery within the film pack ensures that a fresh battery is available with each new pack of film.|$|R
50|$|All optics {{are subject}} to {{manufacturing}} tolerances; even with perfect manufacture, optical trains experience thermal expansion. <b>Focus</b> <b>mechanisms</b> must accommodate part variations; even custom-built systems may have some means of adjustment. For example, telescopes such as the Mars Orbiter Camera, which are nominally set to infinity, have thermal controls. Deviations from its operating temperature are actively compensated to prevent shifts of focus.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{focusing}} screen in non-autofocus 35 mm SLR cameras is the split screen and microprism ring variation that aids focusing and became standard in the 1980s. The microprism ring breaks up the image unless the lens setting is in focus, the split screen shows part of the image split in two pieces. When both pieces are aligned the setting is in focus. The drawback is that the prisms have considerable light loss, making low-light focusing almost impossible. Compare with <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> in rangefinder cameras.|$|E
50|$|Work {{table is}} used to place and hold the {{measured}} piece. Its own volume, X, Y travel and carrying capacity are critical. Meanwhile, {{for the convenience of}} holding workpiece, it will be need to buy a rotary table, V-holder and other accessories.Besides, the projector must also have a flexible and stable <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and large working distance (the top surface of the workpiece and the lens pitch). Select appropriate data processing mode: all optical measuring projectors on market, without exception, have been digitized. We must focus on its data processing capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The Crayford focuser is a {{simplified}} <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for amateur astronomical telescopes. Crayford focusers are considered superior to entry-level {{rack and pinion}} focusers, normally found {{in this type of}} device. Instead of the rack and pinion, they have a smooth spring-loaded shaft which holds the focus tube against four opposing bearing surfaces, and controls its movement. It is named after the Crayford Manor House Astronomical Society, Crayford, London, England where it was invented by John Wall, a member of the astronomical society which meets there. The original Crayford Focuser is on display there.|$|E
50|$|The EOS 7s / 30V / ELAN 7NE (Japanese/Asia-Pacific European/North American product names) and the EOS 33V / ELAN 7N (Asia-Pacific Europe/North America) are 35 mm film single-lens reflex cameras from Canon of Japan, {{launched}} in April 2004. The 7s/30V/ELAN 7NE employ Canon's Eye Controlled <b>Focus</b> <b>mechanism</b> while the 33V/ELAN 7N do not. These cameras were the replacements for the earlier EOS 30/33 model.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} lenses for SLRs and DSLRs provide {{automatic}} focus. The autofocus sensor(s) and electronics are {{actually in the}} camera body, and this circuitry provides electrical power and signals to a motor inside the lens that adjusts the focus.

40|$|Device for the {{non-contact}} {{measurement of}} the distance (A) to an object (10), {{by means of an}} optical device which focusses a measuring beam (11) consisting of a light beam, in particular a laser beam, onto the measuring point (12) of the object (10), having a detector (25) receiving reflected light (13) from the measuring point (12) in order to detect the focal point deviation {{from the surface of the}} object (10), in particular having a measuring lens (2) focussing the reflector light (13) through a diaphragm (14) onto a light-sensitive sensor (15) and an evaluation unit (17) receiving sensor signals. In order to cause the greatest possible precision of distance measurement between a <b>focussing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a working light source, the device is designed so that the measuring beam (11) is focussed onto a workpiece acting as a measuring object (10) by including the <b>focussing</b> <b>mechanism</b> (18) of a working laser and that the measuring beam (11) is arranged along the same axis or along a paral lel axis to the working beam (19) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{rangefinder}} is {{a device}} to measure subject distance, {{with the intent to}} adjust the focus of a camera's objective lens accordingly (open-loop controller). The rangefinder and lens <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{may or may not be}} coupled. In common parlance, the term [...] "rangefinder camera" [...] is interpreted very narrowly to denote manual-focus cameras with a visually-read out optical rangefinder based on parallax. Most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation, if it is provided at all, is only a byproduct of the focusing process (closed-loop controller).|$|E
50|$|In {{the basic}} technique, using strip photography, a camera with a {{vertical}} slit aperture is positioned opposite a turntable on which an object is centered. Both {{the object and}} the camera are oriented as precisely as possible so as to eliminate aberrations due to the <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the camera, the aperture, and {{the characteristics of the}} object itself. As the object is rotated on the turntable, the film is exposed in small intervals corresponding to the dimensions of the aperture. Since the image is projected onto the film backwards and upside down, the turntable spins in the direction opposite of the direction of the film advance mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|The Mamiya Six, {{also known}} as the Mamiya-6, is a series of folding medium-format {{rangefinder}} cameras manufactured by Mamiya between 1940 and the late 1950s. The cameras captured twelve 6 cm × 6 cm images on 120 film rolls. Some later models could also take sixteen 4.5 cm × 6 cm images. The cameras were coupled rangefinders, but had a unique <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that moved the film plane instead of the lens. The lenses were not interchangeable, and were made by various Japanese manufacturers. Beginning with the model IV, the name on the top plate changed from [...] "Mamiya Six" [...] (two lines) to [...] "Mamiya-6".|$|E

Since <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is {{essential}} equipment, which could compensate {{the difference between}} adjustment environments and working conditions of space optics remote sensors, the detection of it is very important. Based on engineering practice, this paper firstly introduces the basic detection of <b>focusing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> that is the appearance inspection and the boundary dimension inspection, and then introduces several common performance test projects, that is the detection of stroke, step length, gravity inclination, rock, and empty back and the test of modal, self-locking performance and closed-loop accuracy, and also introduces relative detection methods and cautions.

Intorduction Space optics remote sensor {{is one of the}} most important loads of the earth observation satellites, and its main task is to obtain the accurate location, high definition and layered images. However, the laboratory assembly and adjustment environment is different from the launch and in-orbit operation ones, such as temperatures, vibration, shock, pressure, gravity and etc. These factors will lead to the defocus phenomenon of space optical remote sensors and the image accuracy and quality will be greatly reduced. In order to overcome the phenomenon, high precision and stability focusin...|$|R
