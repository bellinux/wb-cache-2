40|$|Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC) is an <b>intensive</b> <b>sweetener,</b> {{obtained}} by alkaline hydrogenation of neohesperidin. In this investigation a supposed taste enhancing {{effect of this}} substance was tested. A three-step procedure was used. In the first experiment, using a pool of 31 subjects, NHDC and sucrose detection thresholds were measured. In the second experiment, psychophysical functions for both tastants were determined. Then, 15 participants closest to the group threshold who, in addition, had produced monotonic psychophysical taste functions were selected {{to participate in the}} next two experiments. In the third experiment, taste enhancement was tested. Three psychophysical sucrose functions were constructed, one with a near-threshold amount of NHDC added to each of seven sucrose concentrations, one with a near-threshold amount of sucrose added (control 1) and one without any addition (control 2). No difference was found between the NHDC-enriched sucrose function and the sucrose-enriched sucrose function. Finally, in experiment 4, differential threshold functions were constructed with either NHDC or sucrose added. Neither the overall shape of the functions nor a comparison of the points of subjective equality showed enhancement. It was concluded that weak NHDC does not enhance the taste of aqueous sucrose solutions...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM 5) is a Ca(2 +) -activated nonselective cation channel {{involved in}} the transduction of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes. We previously showed that TRPM 5 is a locus for the modulation of taste perception by temperature changes, and by quinine and quinidine, 2 bitter compounds that suppress gustatory responses. Here, we determined whether other bitter compounds known to modulate taste perception also affect TRPM 5. We found that nicotine inhibits TRPM 5 currents with an effective inhibitory concentration of ~ 1. 3 mM at - 50 mV. This effect {{may contribute to the}} inhibitory effect of nicotine on gustatory responses in therapeutic and experimental settings, where nicotine is often employed at millimolar concentrations. In addition, it implies the existence of a TRPM 5 -independent pathway for the detection of nicotine bitterness. Nicotine seems to act from the extracellular side of the channel, reducing the maximal whole-cell conductance and inducing an acceleration of channel closure that leads to a negative shift of the activation curve. TRPM 5 currents were unaffected by nicotine's metabolite cotinine, the <b>intensive</b> <b>sweetener</b> saccharin or by the bitter xanthines caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. We also tested the effects of bitter compounds on another essential element of the sweet taste transduction pathway, the type 3 IP 3 receptor (IP 3 R 3). We found that IP 3 R 3 -mediated Ca(2 +) flux is slightly enhanced by nicotine, not affected by saccharin, modestly inhibited by caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline, and strongly inhibited by quinine. Our results demonstrate that bitter compounds have differential effects on key elements of the sweet taste transduction pathway, suggesting for heterogeneous mechanisms of bitter-sweet taste interactions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential (TRP) channels can {{be activated}} {{by a wide}} variety of physical and chemical stimuli. As such they are well-equipped to function as polymodal sensors in sensory neurons. Different TRP channels are modulated by naturally occurring chemicals extracted from plants. However, in contrast to earlier belief, the interaction between TRP channels and natural compounds seems to be rather unspecific. The present study illustrates the interaction and promiscuity of two well-known natural compounds, nicotine and mustart oil, on TRP channels involved in chemosensation. In the first part we studied the effect of nicotine on TRPA 1. In contrast to previous belief, nicotine not only activates nicotinic receptors but also TRPA 1. This channel, expressed in a subset of polymodal nociceptive neurons, is important for behavioral responses to noxious cold and multiple irritant substances including the unsaturated aldehydes contained in cigarette smoke. Moreover, TRPA 1 {{plays an important role in}} the development of inflammatory pain. Thus, TRPA 1 might be responsible for the irritation of the mucosa and skin observed during topical application of nicotine, as used in nicotine replacement therapies. The action of nicotine on TRPA 1 is membrane-delimited, stabilizing the open state(s) and destabilizing the closed state(s) of the channel. In nociceptive neurons from Trpa 1 knockout mice, nicotine responses were strongly reduced compares to wildtype neurons. Trpa 1 knockout mice also lacked the mouse airway constriction reflex after nasal installation of nicotine. In the second part, we studied the effect of nicotine on TRPM 5, a Ca 2 +-activated non-selective cation channel involved in taste transduction. We found that, similar to quinine, nicotine can inhibit TRPM 5 currents and as such, can inhibit sweet taste perception. Inhibition of TRPM 5 by nicotine has two components: a voltage-independent component, which reduces the maximal whole-cell conductance and a voltage-dependent component which causes acceleration of channel closure and a positive shift of the voltage dependence of channel activation. In contrast, TRPM 5 currents are unaffected by nicotineÂ’s metabolite cotinine, the bitter xanthines caffeine, theobromine and theophylline or the <b>intensive</b> <b>sweetener</b> saccharine. In the last part we analysed the effect of MO, a plant-derived irritant that has been extensively used in experimental models to induce pain and inflammation, on TRPV 1. Previous literature ascribed the noxious effects of this compound to specific activation of the cation channel TRPA 1 in nociceptive neurons. However, we found that the capsaicin receptor TRPV 1 has a surprisingly large contribution to aversive and pain responses and visceral irritation induced by MO. Moreover, TRPV 1 was also important for the MO induced responses in nociceptive neurons. Interestingly, MO has a bimodal effect on TRPA 1, activating the channel at micromolar concentrations, but producing current inhibition at millimolar concentrations. Both the human and mouse TRPV 1 isoforms were activated by millimolar concentrations of MO, thus refuting the dogma that TRPA 1 is the sole nocisensor for MO. Activation of TRPV 1 by MO is membrane-delimited and works via a voltage-dependent shift towards more negative potentials. In contrast to allicin, the pungent compound in garlic, TRPV 1 activation by MO is not via modification of cysteine residues. Similar to capsaicin however, TRPV 1 activation by MO is reduced in the S 513 Y TRPV 1 mutant. Lastly, we found that, similar to capsaicin, MO cross sensitize with other TRPV 1 stimulators such as heat and extracellular protons. The molecular determinants of these interactions may help to understand the mechanisms of action of MO in physiologically relevant conditions (patho-physiological body temperature and acidosis of inflamed tissue)). In conclusion, we have shown that TRP channels play a generalized role in the detection of noxious natural compounds, both in the somatosensory and in the gustatory system. These compounds can be used to investigate the role of TRP channels in vivo. It is, however, of vital importance to continuously reshape many established dogmas on biophysical properties, drug specificity and physiological role of TRP channels as the TRP channel drug specificity is less pronounced as previously believed. It is therefore essential to continue the search for specific TRP channel agonists and antagonists. List of abbreviations I	INTRODUCTION	 1 1.

40|$|The Equiratio Mixture Model {{predicts the}} psychophysical {{function}} for an equiratio mixture type {{on the basis}} of the psychophysical functions for the unmixed components. The model reliably estimates the sweetness of mixtures of sugars and sugar-alchohols, but is unable to predict intensity for aspartame/sucrose mixtures. In this paper, the sweetness of aspartame/acesulfame-K mixtures in aqueous and acidic solutions is investigated. These two <b>intensive</b> <b>sweeteners</b> probably do not comply with the model's original assumption of sensory dependency among components. However, they reveal how the Equiratio Mixture Model could be modified to describe and predict mixture functions for non-additive substances. To predict equiratio functions for all similar tasting substances, a new Equiratio Mixture Model should yield accurate predictions for components eliciting similar intensities at widely differing concentration levels, and for substances exhibiting hypo- or hyperadditivity. In addition, it should be able to correct violations of Stevens's power law. These three problems are resolved in a model that uses equi-intense units as the measure of physical concentration. An interaction index in the formula for the constant accounts for the degree of interaction between mixture components. Deviations from the power law are corrected by a nonlinear response output transformation, assuming a two-stage model of psychophysical judgment.

40|$|The rising {{concern about}} the spread of obesity and {{diabetes}} and a growing awareness about healthy foods in western societies have stimulated {{in the last years}} a strong interest toward stevia sweeteners as alternative of sucrose and artifi cial <b>intensive</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> The worldwide demand for purifi ed steviol glyco- sides from stevia is steadily increasing, and it is expected that in the future the agricultural production capacity will be lower than the market demand. This provides a strong incentive to explore the possibilities to cultivate stevia and to produce leaves and extracts, beyond the traditional production zones. The culti- vation of stevia might represent a formidable opportunity for the growers, in order to diversify the cropping systems and to meet the increasing market demand for high-quality and traceable raw material. In addition, several legislative initiatives, such as the steviol glycosides approval as food additive in several countries, represent favorable factors {{for the development of a}} stevia-based agro-industry. To foster the introduction of this novel species, a signifi cant improvement of its cultivation should be achieved and a modern agronomical blueprint defi ned. It is in fact imperative to develop economically viable and environmentally sustain- able crop production systems through the integration of site-specifi c agronomic techniques and effi cient mechanization technologies for the production and processing of a higher quality product. Several agronomic aspects require still to be optimized (e. g., choice of the cultivar, propagation and transplanting, sustainable weed management, nutrition, irrigation, harvesting), in order to improve, not only the leaf yield but also its quality in terms of steviol glycosides and bioactive compounds. Traceability and crop quality control along the pro- duction chain are the strongest points, in order to obtain a certifi cation that will provide to the farmers preferential market access and to sell the raw material at a differential price. The present chapter, therefore, aims to provide updated scientifi c information regarding the most important agronomic factors in order to foster stevia cultivation and attain maximum yield and qualit...|$|R
