Now, that movie provides a very good example of {{how difficult it is to}} predict the future. You may recall that in the film we showed the Bell System and PANAM; well, they’ve both gone, long before 2001. But I’m happy to see that the Hilton, which we also showed in 2001, is still here, though not yet in orbit! This proves how impossible it is to predict social and political developments: who could have imagined what’s happened in Europe during the last few years? However, we can, to some extent, anticipate technological developments by observing what's going on in science and engineering. But the problem there is predicting when things will happen, even though one can be quite certain that they will. A good example is provided by my 1945 paper on communications satellites, which I imagined would be large, manned space-stations. When I wrote that, World War II was still in progress, and I was working on Ground Controlled Approach Radar, which had the the...|$|E
40|$|This week 2 ̆ 7 s summit aims to {{save the}} embattled {{healthcare}} overhaul {{through the power of}} persuasion, writes Lesley Russell in Inside Story HEALTHCARE REFORM is back on the agenda <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> and in a big way. Since things came to an unexpected and screeching halt after the Massachusetts election, which cost the Democrats their super-majority in the Senate, the daily news on spiralling health costs has helped to drive the recognition that reform is imperative. To give one example: WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross in California, one of the largest health insurers in the state, announced early this month that it was about to hike health insurance premiums by as much as 39 per cent for individuals. A recent survey by the Center for American Progress shows double-digit hikes in insurance premiums implemented or pending in at least ten other states. Meanwhile, the five biggest health insurance companies in the United States have collectively reported a record profit for 2009, even as they covered fewer customers. The economic crisis is making it increasingly difficult for middle-class families to keep up their health insurance payments. Chairman Henry Waxman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is set to hold hearings on this issue on 24 February [...] . Read the full article Photo: Talk Radio New...|$|E

40|$|The war is {{over and}} history is forgotten, says Simon Adams There are things we are not {{supposed}} to mention about the war in Iraq. Like the fact that our troops are participants in the most unpopular war in modern history. Even before a single shot was fired there were massive protests. And since March 20 literally {{millions of people around the}} world have marched against the US-led invasion. The Vietnam War was never this immediately and globally unpopular. Not even after years of napalm, not after My Lai, not ever. While the initial stage of the invasion, with tanks racing across the desert, facilitated a partial boost in approval of the ‘support our troops’ variety, even this has been undermined by the growing death toll of Iraqi civilians and coalition soldiers. The shocking and awful missile barrage of Iraq’s cities, the ongoing ‘pockets of resistance’ which seem much deeper than anyone imagined, and the fact that the most powerful nation in history has so far been mightily unsuccessful in conquering a Third World country, has not helped either. Vietnam must have haunted the dreams of Bush and Rumsfeld <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>this</b> past <b>week.</b> When Bush the Elder fought the first Gulf War in 1991 he said it shattered forever America’s ‘Vietnam Syndrome’. What then, do we make of the quagmire that his son has now immersed America in? Call it the revenge of history. I’m old enough to remember when Saddam Hussein was our comrade in arms. I lived in America between 1979 and 1983. I recall the yellow ribbons we tied around trees at my school - a ribbon a day, for each of the 444 days the American hostages remained prisoners of fanatical Muslim students in Teheran. Old enough to recall when Ayatollah Khomeini was public enemy number one. Old enough to remember learning that we (meaning the Americans and I, a foreigner) had allies in the Middle East and that one of the greatest of these was the nation of Iraq whose armies were marching against the evil Iranians. When Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 Saddam was considered a potential ally in a treacherous region. His brutal regime was secular and his Ba’ath Party had wiped out the Iraqi Communist Party. Like the Americans, Saddam hated and feared Iran’s Islamic revolution. He seemed like the kind of guy Washington could do business with. The fact that Saddam’s regime brutalised and tortured its own people was a peripheral matter. Bigger issues of geopolitics and American hostages were at stake. In 1982 President Reagan removed Iraq from the US State Department’s list of states that supported terrorism. Throughout the Iran-Iraq War America was openly with Saddam against Iran. The links between Washington and Baghdad extended to the Americans sharing sensitive satellite intelligence with the Iraqi Army so they could wage war more effectively. The US Navy provided armed escorts for Iraqi oil tankers. And in December 1983 US President Ronald Reagan even sent a special envoy - a certain Mr Donald Rumsfeld - to meet Saddam Hussein and establish a closer relationship with the Iraqi dictator. No wonder Rummy claims such insight into the minds of Iraq’s brutal rulers - he’s supped with them as their guest! Not that you’ll hear him mention this on CNN. These days Rummy works for President Bush the Younger as Secretary of Defense. He speaks continually of ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and Saddam’s appalling human rights record. Maybe he really does know something that we don’t. Maybe Saddam took Rummy into his confidence all those years ago in Badghad? After all, the lines between trusted ally and evil tyrant were apparently a lot less clear then than they are today. Bush the Younger, in arguing in favour of an invasion of Iraq, sometimes recalls Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against the Kurds. Like the appalling incident in March 1988 when Iraqi forces gassed over four thousand Kurds in Halabja. Bush has called this an act of attempted genocide. The problem is that none of it is news. The American State Department and CIA were aware of the Iraqi military’s use of chemical weapons throughout the 1980 s while Iraq was a US ally. On 20 March 1984, for instance, US intelligence sources reported that they had ‘incontrovertible evidence that Iraq has used nerve gas in its war with Iran and has almost finished extensive site for mass-producing the lethal chemical agent’. And yet this did not stop the United States from re-establishing full diplomatic ties with Iraq in November that year. Nor did it stop the US from continuing to support Saddam’s war against Iran. Indeed when the US Senate, or the United Nations, attempted to constrain Iraq the Reagan administration intervened. In March 1986, for example, the UN Security Council proposed a declaration against Iraq’s use of chemical weapons. The United States voted against the declaration. Britain and Australia abstained. The war continued. As did the trade, according to a 1994 US Senate Committee Report, of materials used in manufacturing chemical weapons. From 1985 - 1989 about a dozen US companies were involved in exporting biological agents to the Iraqis, assisting them in making, among other things, deadly anthrax. The US Department of Commerce licensed this trade. That is, until the end of the Iran-Iraq War and the Cold War altered the structure of allegiance in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq War continued until 1988, by which time a million people had been killed. It is now a matter of public record that the Reagan administration secretly traded weapons for hostages with the Iranians in the early 1980 s. What was largely overlooked in the resulting ‘Iran-Contra Scandal’, however, was the fact that Washington had therefore militarily supported both sides of the Iran-Iraq war, possibly prolonging the killing. One million dead. This is only a small part of the history not mentioned on CNN. And certainly not on FoxNews where the disgraced cold warrior Oliver North, the Pentagon’s ‘fallguy’ during the Iran-Contra Scandal, now works as a frontline reporter. This current war in Iraq is an elaborate exercise in political amnesia. No matter how long, or what new twists it takes, it remains morally wrong. As Czech author Milan Kundera once wrote, the struggle for human freedom is the struggle of memory against forgetting. Now more than ever.
