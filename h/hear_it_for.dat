2500|$|A three-track {{version of}} this single was {{released}} in the UK containing [...] "Head Like a Hole (Opal)" [...] which is not included on the US release.

2500|$|Europe {{entered an}} arms race to build ever larger {{artillery}} pieces. Burgundy's guns continued to develop, {{and in the same}} year that Odruik fell, Philip's smith constructed a gun capable of shooting balls weighing 200 kilograms. In 1382 an [...] "incredibly huge bombard" [...] was aimed at Oudenaarde, its muzzle 60 inches around and 20 inches in diameter. One observer described it thus, [...] "One could <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> five leagues in the daytime, and ten leagues at night, and it made such a huge noise that … it seemed as though all the demons of hell were present." [...] By the early 15th century both French and English armies were equipped with larger pieces known as bombards, weighing up to 5 tons (4,535kg) and firing balls weighing up to 300lbs (136kg). In 1404 a cannon was created with the inscription, [...] "I am named Katrin. Beware of what I hold. I punish injustice." [...] In 1411 the cast iron cannon Faule Mette was created, and it was capable of shooting stone balls weighing 400 kilograms, but didn't very often. The artillery trains used by Henry V of England in the 1415 Siege of Harfleur and 1419 Siege of Rouen proved effective in breaching French fortifications, while artillery contributed to the victories of French forces under Joan of Arc in the Loire Campaign (1429). It wasn't just the English blasting their way through France either. Burgundy started by battering down the walls of Vellexon in 1409 and in 1411 they took Ham with only three shots from their bombard Griette. France eventually came around under the reforms of King Charles V (1422-1461), whose leadership made France the premier artillery force in Europe, and won the Hundred Years' War. Gun developments in France would prove extremely effective during the Italian wars of the 1490s. In 1431 a wrought-iron cannon was forged, weighing over 12,000 kilograms and could fire projectiles of 300 kilograms. It was called the Dulle Griet. These weapons were transformational for European warfare. A hundred years earlier the Frenchman Pierre Dubois wrote that a [...] "castle can hardly be taken within a year, and even if it does fall, it means more expenses for the king's purse and for his subjects than the conquest is worth," [...] but by the 15th century European walls fell with the utmost regularity.|$|E
