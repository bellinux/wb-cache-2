The performance of three different sprayers was tested: the first, a traditional air-convection sprayer, the other two, suitably designed for treatments in tendone vineyards. The air flow which exited through the discharge diffusers and moving towards the target sucked air from the surrounding environment that enlarged the flow rate on the target.

40|$|International audienceNational {{policies}} in Europe aim to reduce use of pesticides. Grapevine receives yearly many sprayings. There {{is a great}} variety of sprayers available for vineyards. We can sum up ques-tions addressed to research bodies by the following issues. Is it possible to sort out sprayers and practices according to crop protection and environmental performances? How much is it possible to save on amounts of chemicals sprayed when one uses an efficient sprayer? The present contribution to this research is based on a 4 rows, 10 meters length, physical full scale model of a vineyard. The Evasprayviti model of a vineyard row was designed to repro-duce different foliage volume and densities and to simulate the interaction of the canopy with the flow of plant protection product and air emitted by a mobile sprayer. It comprises a col-lecting device, and a complementary structure on each side of it. The collecting device ena-bles accurate and repeatable sampling of the spray deposits. It is composed of plastic sheets that simulate leaves, attached to vertical aluminium posts. The complementary structure pre-vents perturbative effects on the spray flow on the edges of the collecting device. Evasprayviti can be configured to simulate different growth stages (Codis&al, 2013). The test spray is a mix of a tracer, Tartrazine, and water. A standard <b>pneumatic</b> <b>sprayer,</b> an airblast sprayer and an air-assisted face to face sprayer were tested. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>sprayer</b> was tested in 3 configurations, for spraying respectively 2, 3 and 4 rows at a time. The face to face sprayer and the airblast sprayer were configured to be used to spray 3 rows and 2 rows, respectively. The amount of product deposited in the canopy and its distribution according to depth and height of leaves was studied for early, intermediate and full growth stage, with respective Leaf Area Index (LAI) values of 0. 24, 0. 88 and 1. 68 ha/ha. The sampling of a cross-section of the collecting device was divided in compartments (3 depths x 3 heights at full growth stage). Deposits on rows close to sprayer and on rows next to sprayer were compared when relevant. The mass of deposits per unit of leaf surface, normalised by amount sprayed per hectare of ground, was measured for each compartment. For precision assessment, this normalised deposit was divided by the reference potential deposit on the target, which is cal-culated for each growth stage according to the hypothesis that all the spray is homogeneous-ly deposited in the compartments. Results showed different deposition profiles, which are discussed. The face to face sprayer exhibited the best efficiency and homogeneity in full and intermediate growth stage, and best efficiency on early stage as well, with homogeneity comparable to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>sprayer's</b> on this stage. The airblast sprayer used on two rows had a good overall efficiency for early and intermediate stages but a bad homogeneity at all stages...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>sprayers</b> {{are widely}} used in {{vineyards}} due to their very fine droplet size, which makes the drift risk to become an important problem to be considered. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of the spout diameter at the release point on the spray droplet size and uniformity achieved for different liquid flow rates (LFR) and air flow rates (AFR). A test bench was developed to simulate a real <b>pneumatic</b> <b>sprayer</b> under laboratory conditions, and it was empirically adjusted to match the air pressure conditions as closely as possible to real working conditions. Two positions of insertion of the liquid hose, the conventional position (CP) and an alternative position (AP), were tested for three LFRs, 1. 00, 1. 64, and 2. 67 Lmin- 1, and four AFRs, 0. 280, 0. 312, 0. 345, and 0. 376 m 3 s- 1. The air speed decrease between the two insertion points of the liquid hose was measured. A Malvern SprayTec® instrument was used to measure the droplet size, and the D 50, D 10, and D 90 parameter values were obtained. The relative SPAN factor (RSF) was also calculated. A model to predict variations in D 50 was fitted using the aforementioned parameters. The results show that variations in the diameter of the spout significantly change the droplet size, producing a mean increase of 59. 45 % in D 50 and similar increases in D 10 and D 90. The model developed to predict variations in D 50 has a very high degree of accuracy (R 2 = 0. 945). The relative decrease in the air speed along the spout did not present significant differences for the different airflow rates tested. The results of the study show that the droplet size produced in pneumatic spraying can be modified easily by varying the air spout dimensions. This should be taken into account by manufacturers from a design point of view. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBanana crop is {{dramatically}} exposed to Sigatoga disease. Until now, the control was operated thru aerial application but national and European legislations banned aerial spraying on crops (Directive 2009 / 128 /CE), arguing of {{human health and}} environment safety (PAN, 2004). The Optiban project was launched in 2008 to meet the requirement of the Food and Agriculture Ministry and the Groups of banana growers of Guadeloupe and Martinique (UGPBAN). It aims at improving a ground based system to replace aerial application (Rombaut, 2011); agronomic goal is to treat principally the upper leaves. For this purpose an original mistblower named Optiban was specifically designed.

Several loading paths with different pressure changing {{were used in the}} simulations. From the research, the original expansion ratio of diameter using a bilinear loading path, namely the internal pressure was increased linearly, is only 22 %, and bursting occurs quickly. With a step-like loading path, namely the internal pressure is increased step by step, among the steps, the pressure is kept constant, and the strain rate of bulging can be kept into a small range. Thus the deformation around the hoop direction is more even than the linear loading path, and than bursting can be postponed. During bulging, the inner pressure should be lowered with the increase of diameter to keep the strain rate in a small range around a constant value. Through optimization of loading path, the forming limit can be enhanced obviously so that the expansion ratio of diameter can be increased to 25. 1 %...|$|R

Subtle changes in canopy reflectance could present useful information to detect the onset of crop stress. This {{study was conducted in}} a greenhouse to evaluate a portable spectroradiometer and a portable chlorophyll fluorometer for the {{detection of}} crop injury caused by glyphosate spray. Non-glyphosate resistant soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) plants were sprayed with glyphosate using a <b>pneumatic</b> track <b>sprayer</b> in a spray chamber. Four plants received a rate of 0. 86 kg ae/ha glyphosate and four plants received 0. 086 kg ae/ha. Additional four non-sprayed plants were used as controls. After the glyphosate spray, the chlorophyll reflectance of the plants was measured with the spectroradiometer at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours to determine the plant response to herbicide. Simultaneously, fluorescence induction kinetics of the crop under stress was measured with the portable chlorophyll fluorometer. Results of the statistical mean separation indicated that the plant chlorophyll reflectance measurement could be used to differentiate crop stress from glyphosate at 24 hours after spray among treatments and to identify the effect of herbicide at 24 hours after spray in each treatment. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis with the reflectance data showed that the crop stress of the soybean plants from glyphosate could be identified at 24 hour...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of the electrostatic charge on foliar spray deposition in an Apulian “tendone” vineyard using an innovative <b>pneumatic</b> electrostatic <b>sprayer.</b> The sprayer was fitted with nozzles that linked the pneumatic atomization of the liquid, obtained using compressed air, to the electrostatic induction charge, thereby producing a stream of charged fine droplets. Furthermore, the sprayer was designed for low volume treatments, and the experimentation was carried out during a phenological stage with high leaf density to evaluate the performance of the machine under particularly challenging operative conditions. The sprayer was studied at three forward speeds (4, 5, and 6 km/h), and gave poor deposition inside the canopy, whether or not the electrostatic system was activated. Forward speed did not significantly affect the mean foliar spray deposition, whereas activation of the electrostatic system significantly increased the deposit only on the layer of foliage nearest to the sprayer (lower layer), but had no effect on deposition on the layer of foliage inside the canopy (upper layer). The ratio between the deposits on the two layers (lower:upper) was 6. 5 : 1 when the electrostatic system was switched off, and 9. 0 : 1 when it was switched on. However, this behaviour may allow targeted treatments on grapes, such as Plant Protection Products (PPP) or bio growth stimulants. Furthermore, the small droplets produced by the machine are suitable for table grape protection because the droplets do not mark the grapes, which would reduce the quality of the product and its commercial value...|$|R

Para tanto, foram preparadas caldas fitossanitárias com diferentes concentrações de adjuvantes e medidas as características de tensão superficial, ângulo de contato e área molhada de gotas aplicadas sobre a superfície de folhas de café e de vidro. Essas caldas foram pulverizadas a campo por meio de um pulverizador de volume ultra baixo com bicos pneumáticos, nos volumes de 20, 30, 40, 46, 67 e 92 L. ha- 1, e um pulverizador convencional de volume alto, com bicos hidráulicos, nos volumes de 200 e 400 L. ha- 1, em que avaliaram-se os depósitos de marcador sobre folhas de plantas de café, bem como a capacidade de campo operacional dessas aplicações.

These spraying liquids were sprayed at the field through an ultra low volume <b>sprayer</b> equipped with <b>pneumatic</b> nozzles, at the volumes of 20, 30, 40, 46, 67 and 92 L. ha- 1, and a conventional high volume sprayer, equipped with hydraulic nozzles, at the volumes of 200 e 400 L. ha- 1, for evaluation of tracer deposits on coffee leaves, as well as the operational field capacity of these applications. Before and after the sprays, it were done 1 and 3 collections of leaves, respectively, with a previous and the three others at 7, 14 and 21 day after the spray (DAS), in which were evaluated the number of L. coffeella live and dead larvae, number of new and old mines, number of mined leaves, number of eggs, number of parasitized L. coffeella larvae and the efficiency of control. The results showed that, increasing the oil concentration in admixture to the spraying liquid, there are reductions in the surface tension value and, consequently, on the contact angle, increasing the wetted area by the droplets.
