40|$|The {{results of}} the first {{extended}} ion probe study of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are reported. The analytic procedures and the current limits on the precision and accurary of <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> of light elements are discussed in considerable detail. It is shown that <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> of several elements can be made on different individual fragments of a single IDP of 10 - 15 microns in size. The deuterium enrichments observed {{in several of the}} particles are shown to be intrinsic, providing independent proof that the particles are extraterrestrial. Carbon <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> on fragments of three IDPs give ratios similar to terrestrial values and show a largely uniform isotopic composition for a given particle.

30|$|The <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> were {{performed}} at Shizuoka University, Japan, using the procedure of Wada et al. (1984). The 20 – 30 individual tests used for each measurement were reacted in saturated phosphoric acid at 60  °C, and the evolved CO 2 gas was analyzed with a MAT- 250 mass spectrometer. The obtained value was {{converted into a}} value against a PDB standard employing the US National Bureau of Standards NBS- 20 (Vienna PDB). The standard deviations of the in-house standard (total of 19 measurements) were 0.04 [*]‰ for δ 18 O and 0.02 [*]‰ for δ 13 C, which represented the precisions of the <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} of determining crustal mass-age curves is discussed. Problems {{in doing this}} include determination of model ages and accounting for mixing of materials of different ages during crust forming processes. These difficulties can be overcome with some reasonable assumptions and estimates of rock volumes based on areal proportions. This technique was used to construct a reasonably well constrained mass-age curve for the southwestern U. S. based on <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> on over 100 samples. The results imply that the crust in this area grew episodically at 2. 8, 1. 8, and 0. 1 Ga.

40|$|We present {{here the}} {{experimental}} setup and standardization {{of a newly}} acquired stable isotope ratio mass-spectrometer (Isoprime 100, Isoprime(A (R)) UK) coupled with elemental analyzer (Pyrocube, Elementar(A (R)) -Germany) in a continuous flow mode, for the measurements of C, N and S isotopes {{in a variety of}} natural as well as synthetic organics and sulfur containing solid samples. We have calibrated our instrument using a suite of certified international standards supplied by International Atomic Energy Agency Vienna and cross-checked against several in-house laboratory standards used by other institutions of international repute. A synthetic organic compound Sulfanilamide was continuously used along with international standards to develop an in-house internal laboratory standard for the accurate and precise <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements.</b> Important components contributing to the overall uncertainty of the <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> such as blank contributions, amount effect and response of mass-spectrometric current against thermal conductivity detector were performed using several aliquots of epsilon-Amino-n-caproic acid and sulfanilamide (in-house) standards. Both short and long term variabilities in the measure isotopic data were assessed using our in-house laboratory standard Sulfanilamide. Overall estimated uncertainties of C, N and S <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> are better than 0. 2, 0. 2 and 0. 3 aEuro degrees, respectively; which are well within the recommended limits of aforementioned isotopic data...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{analyses}} of glacial ice {{suggest that the}} atmospheric concentration of methane has {{doubled in the last}} several hundred years, presumably due to anthropogenic perturbations of the relevant biogeochemical cycles. In principal, carbon <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> of atmospheric methane would provide information concerning changes in the sources and sinks of methane. The isotopic composition of methane is dependent on the source of the methane carbon, the mechanism of methane synthesis, and the degree and mode of oxidation which the methane has experienced. Unfortunately, few carbon <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> of atmospheric variations have been reported, so conclusions about temporal isotopic variations cannot be made. Also, before <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> of atmospheric methane can be used to identify changes in methane isotopic composition from different sources must be obtained. Methane bubbles from the anoxic sediments of Cape Lookout Bight, NC exhibit seasonal C- 13 variations. The C- 13 values ranged from - 58 in August to - 64 in the winter months with the evolution of the C- 13 enriched gas occurring during periods of peak methane production. Even though a few intramolecular C- 13 measurements of the pore water acetate have been made (methyl group, - 26 per mil; carbonyl, - 6 per mil), {{it is not clear how}} the acetate fermentation pathway affects the methane C- 13 /C- 12 composition...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{knowledge}} of the quality or the accuracy and precision of a measurement is important for data evaluation and planning inspection strategies. The auditing of nuclear material accounts requires accepted performance information on the measurements used for the accounting data.

Information on the quality of gamma-ray <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> that can be obtained under various measurement conditions is obtained through inter-comparison exercises, laboratory or field measurement exercises, and tailored laboratory experiments.

40|$|International audienceIsotopic {{measurements}} at the micron scale using {{secondary ion}} mass spectrometry (SIMS) require an accurate {{control on the}} instrumental mass fractionation (IMF). The IMF correction is challenging since substantial mass fractionation can occur during both emission and detection processes. In this work, we report hydrogen <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> {{on a series of}} organic standards using polyatomic ions (CH-, CD-, C 2 H-, C 2 D-) with the NanoSIMS- 50 instrument. We show that the D/H ratios resulting from the measurement of CD-/CH- and C 2 D-/C 2 H- ratios are close to the true D/H ratios of the samples over more than 3 decades and allow accurate hydrogen <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> to be performed in solid samples. Large secondary emission yields are usually associated with high electron affinities and correlate presently with low IMF effects. Moreover, we show that even when large variations in secondary ionic current are observed, an accurate isotopic ratio can still be inferred. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|As {{a highly}} toxic heavy metal, the {{pollution}} and exposure risks of lead are of widespread concern for human health. However, {{the collection of}} blood samples for use {{as an indicator of}} lead pollution is not always feasible in most cohort or longitudinal studies, especially those involving children health. To evaluate the potential use of urinary lead as an indicator of exposure levels and source apportionment, accompanying with environmental media samples, lead concentrations and <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> (expressed as (207) pb/(206) pb, (208) pb/(206) pb and (204) pb/Pb- 206) were investigated and compared between blood and urine from children living in the vicinities of a typical coking plant and lead-acid battery factory. The results showed urinary lead might not be a preferable proxy for estimating blood lead levels. Fortunately, urinary lead <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> could be used as an alternative for identifying the sources of children's lead exposure, which coincided well with the blood lead isotope ratio analysis.

40|$|Ca, Al-rich Inclusions (CAIs) {{preserve}} {{evidence of}} thermal events that they experienced during their {{formation in the}} early solar system. Most CAIs from CV and CO chondrites are characterized by large variations in O-isotopic compositions of primary minerals, with spinel, hibonite, and pyroxene being more O- 16 -rich than melilite and anorthite, with delta 17, O- 18 = approx. - 40 %o (DELTA O- 17 = delta O- 17 - 0. 52 x delta O- 18 = approx. - 20 %o). These anomalous compositions cannot {{be accounted for by}} standard mass dependent fractionation and diffusive process of those minerals. It requires the presence of an anomalous oxygen reservoir of nucleosynthetic origin or mass independent fractionations before the formation of CAIs in the early solar system. The CAMECA NanoSIMS is a new generation ion microprobe that offers high sensitivity <b>isotopic</b> <b>measurements</b> with sub 100 nm spatial resolution.
