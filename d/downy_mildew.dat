5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, <b>downy</b> <b>mildew,</b> and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
5|$|The water mould (oomycete) Bremia lactucae has {{infected}} commercial {{crops in}} Italy and California. In 2002 on the Ligurian coast, widespread infection of several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' {{and to a}} lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> in a cultivated crop of Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County, California in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A Phytoplasma infection damaged X.bracteatum crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, bronzing of foliage, and malformation of flower heads. Genetically, the pathogen was indistinguishable from the agent of aster yellows. The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) attacks and forms galls on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and <b>downy</b> <b>mildew,</b> which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E
40|$|So far 19 genera of <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> {{have been}} described, of which seven are {{parasitic}} to grasses. Here, we {{introduce a new}} genus, Baobabopsis, to accommodate two distinctive <b>downy</b> <b>mildews,</b> B. donbarrettii sp. nov., collected on Perotis rara in northern Australia, and B. enneapogonis sp. nov., collected on Enneapogon spp. in western and central Australia. Baobabopsis donbarrettii produced both oospores and sporangiospores that are morphologically distinct from other <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> on grasses. Molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that the two species of Baobabopsis occupied an isolated position among the known genera of graminicolous <b>downy</b> <b>mildews.</b> The importance of the Poaceae {{for the evolution of}} <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> is highlighted by the observation that {{more than a third of}} the known genera of <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> occur on grasses, while more than 90 % of the known species of <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> infect eudicots...|$|R
40|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>mildews</b> {{and root}} and foliar rots caused by Phytophthora {{are among the}} most {{destructive}} plant pathogens and therefore have attracted considerable attention during the past two decades. Although it has been realized that a close phylogenetic relationship exists, so far sharp distinction has been made between the obligate biotrophic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and the hemibiotrophic Phytophthora. In the study presented here, it is shown that a continuum of character states from hemibiotrophic Phytophthora species to obligate biotrophic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> is present. Intermediate character states between <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and Phytophthora species exist in several rare parasites of grasses, which are not embedded within the major clades of the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> but are placed sister to these, with unresolved affinities to both these clades and to Phytophthora. They still have retained traits hitherto thought to be exclusive for Phytophthora. A careful review of previous research is presented and it is highlighted that uniquely for <b>downy</b> <b>mildews,</b> Poakatesthia may form an intracellular mycelium, growing through several host cells. In addition, scanning electron microscopy reveals that sporangiophore growth is not determinate in Viennotia and that outgrowth from sporangiophores is very similar to Phytophthora infestans. It is concluded that the sharp morphological distinction between <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and Phytophthora species (that are often placed in separate families and even different orders), is rather artificial, since all features thought to be exclusive to Phytophthora or the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> are united in the rare grass-parasitizing down mildew genera Viennotia and Poakatesthia and the enigmatic genus Sclerophthora. Therefore, several paradigms regarding the distinction between Phytophthora and the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> need to be reconsidered...|$|R

25|$|Merlot {{thrives in}} cold soil, {{particularly}} ferrous clay. The vine tends to bud early which gives it some risk to cold frost and its thinner skin increases its susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of Botrytis bunch rot.

The vine can also be susceptible to <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> (though it has better resistance to powdery mildew than other Bordeaux varieties) and to infection by leafhopper insect varieties.|$|E
25|$|The grapevine was {{introduced}} to Australia in the 19th century and was mostly a bulk wine producing grape. The particular clones planted in Australia were of poor quality and highly susceptible to coulure, frost and <b>downy</b> <b>mildew.</b> By {{the mid to late}} 20th century, many acres of Malbec were uprooted and planted with different varieties. By 2000, there were slightly over 1,235 acres (500 hectares), with the Clare Valley having the most significant amount.

25|$|The {{popularity}} of Carignan was largely tied to {{its ability to}} produce very large yields {{in the range of}} 200 hl/ha (11 tons/acre). The vine does face significant viticultural hazards with significant sensitivity to several viticultural hazards including rot, powdery mildew, <b>downy</b> <b>mildew,</b> and grape worms. Carignan is a late budding and ripening grape which requires a warm climate in order to achieve full physiological ripeness. The vine also develops very thick stalk around the grape clusters which makes mechanical harvesting difficult. It has an upright growth habit and can be grown without a trellis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fourth group}} are the white blister rusts, Albuginales, which cause white blister disease {{on a variety}} of {{flowering}} plants. White blister rusts sporulate beneath the epidermis of their hosts, causing spore-filled blisters on stems, leaves and the inflorescence. The Albuginales are currently divided into three genera, Albugo parasitic predominantly to Brassicales, Pustula, parasitic predominantly to Asterales, and Wilsoniana, predominantly parasitic to Caryophyllales. Like the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews,</b> the white blister rusts are obligate biotrophs, which means that they are unable to survive without the presence of a living host.|$|R
40|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>mildews</b> are {{amongst the}} most {{widespread}} and economically important pathogens of cultivated grasses in the tropics and subtropics. Despite their importance, molecular methods, particularly DNA sequence analysis, have rarely been applied to either species identification or to the determination of phylogenetic relationships between species. Here we report the presence of several cryptic species in the genus Peronosclerospora. Further we confirm that maize can be parasitised by several species of Peronosclerospora, including P. eriochloae, {{which has not been}} reported previously as a pathogen of maize. The presence of 14 distinct phylogenetic lineages, including three that are parasitic to maize, highlights the current fragmentary knowledge on the diversity and classification of species within Peronosclerospora. Species identification in Peronosclerospora has been traditionally based on the host genus and a set of variable morphological characteristics, which has meant that the identification of species is often unreliable. This situation is primed for the application of molecular techniques for the identification of species. One of the lineages parasitic to maize in Australia has not yet been formally described and its distribution is not known. Future investigation including a broad sampling of <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> from maize and other cultivated and native grasses on a world-wide basis is a prerequisite to a re-evaluation of quarantine regulations aimed at restricting or limiting their spread. ...|$|R

25|$|Carginan's {{tendency}} to produce short shoots with clusters that grow {{closely to the}} trunk of the vine means that it is difficult variety to harvest mechanically. However, the economy of scale for blending varieties or grapes destined for lower priced box and jug wines often do not work well with the expense and labor cost of hand-harvesting. Among the viticultural hazards that Carignan is susceptible to include powdery mildew and infestation of the vine from grape worms and the European Grapevine Moth. The vine has some slight resistance to the fungal disease of botrytis bunch rot, <b>downy</b> <b>mildew,</b> and phomopsis.|$|E
25|$|Pedro Ximénez is a {{mid to late}} {{ripening}} grape {{variety that}} also tends to bud at {{the midpoint of the}} budding period of the vine growing season.

Despite having thin skinned berries, Pedro Ximénez is highly susceptible to the viticultural hazard of botrytis bunch rot as well as <b>downy</b> <b>mildew,</b> esca and eutypa dieback. The vine has some resistance to the fungal disease powdery mildew but is also very prone to damage caused by termite infection.|$|E
25|$|It was {{previously}} suggested that Mondeuse noire was {{identical to the}} northern Italian wine grape variety Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso due to the similarity of the wines. In California, many plantings of Mondeuse noire were called Refosco, further adding to the confusion. DNA analysis has shown {{that this is not}} the case, and that the two varieties are unrelated. Mondeuse noire is very similar to Muscardin which is found in Southern Rhône where it is one of the thirteen grape varieties permitted in the wine Châteauneuf-du-Pape. One difference is that Muscardin has less sensitivity to <b>downy</b> <b>mildew.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Peronosporaceae are obligate biotrophic plant pathogens. They parasitize {{their host}} plants as an {{intercellular}} mycelium using haustoria {{to penetrate the}} host cells. The <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> reproduce asexually by forming sporangia on distinctive white sporangiophores usually formed on the lower surface of infected leaves. These constitute the [...] "downy mildew". The sporangia are wind-dispersed {{to the surface of}} other leaves. According to the genus concerned, the sporangia may then germinate by forming zoospores, thus resembling Phytophthora, or by germ-tube. In the latter case, the sporangia behave as conidia and are often referred to as such. Sexual reproduction is via oospores.|$|R

40|$|Powdery mildew attacks several {{important}} crops in greenhouses (e. g. tomatoes, cucumbers). Compared to other airborne pathogens, such as <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> (e. g.

However, an effective control of powdery mildew with organic fungicides gives the possibility to optimize climate conditions to also prevent <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and gray mold. Sulphur, a well established fungicide, is rated as slightly to very harmful to beneficial organisms (Koppert Biological Systems, 2010) and may have a phytotoxic effect on some crops (e. g. melon). Effects of potassium and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) against diseases are well known (Horst et al., 1992).

The disease-reducing effect of potassium bicarbonate was comparable to sulfur for most of the tested crops. With protective applications, the efficacy was higher than 90 %. However, in melon, where powdery mildew was present before the first spray was applied, efficacy was only 74 %. Compared with plant oils or extracts (such as fennel oil, tea tree oil and lecithin), potassium bicarbonate has shown the same or better efficacy.
