40|$|This paper proposes how {{the test}} case Sine With Dwell could be {{modified}} {{for the evaluation}} of yaw stability of heavy vehicles. The test case was originally proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for evaluation of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Programs</b> (<b>ESP)</b> performance during an oversteer situation on high friction. The modified test case presented here accounts for the heavy vehicle dynamics through three main modifications of the original test case. Firstly, to avoid rollover, the test case is performed on low friction. Secondly, to avoid excess understeer behaviour, the steering input frequency is lowered compared to the original test. Thirdly, to account for response times, the responsiveness and stability criteria are modified. These modifications are derived from hardware in the loop simulations and field tests for different tractor/truck and trailer combinations. By using the modified responsiveness and stability criteria it was shown that the tested ESP system could be objectively evaluated. A clear improvement on vehicle stability was seen in the results when ESP was used...|$|R

2500|$|Electronic {{stability}} control (ESC), {{also referred}} to as <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>program</b> (<b>ESP)</b> or dynamic stability control (DSC), is a computerized technology that improves a vehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help [...] "steer" [...] the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained. ESC does not improve a vehicle's cornering performance; instead, it helps to minimize the loss of control. [...] According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one-third of fatal accidents could be prevented by the use of the technology.|$|E
40|$|English When {{developing}} modern {{control systems}} like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control (TC), brake assistant (BAS) and <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>programs</b> (<b>ESP)</b> to increase safety and comfort in vehi-cles, accurate tyre models are very important. Numerical simulation models {{are needed to}} predict the vehicle’s behaviour for various driving conditions. Testing facilities like the tyre measurement tower are needed to provide the necessary experimental data to validate these tyre models. The tyre measurement tower of the Dynamics and Control section of the TU Eindhoven, is already capable of simulating different situations, but it needs hydraulic actuators to subject the wheel to vertical vibra-tions and alternating steer angles. This report discusses {{the design of a}} vertical hydraulic actuator for the tyre measurement tower. A theoretical model of the hydraulic actuator and the measurement tower is developed, to determine what size of hydraulic cylinder is needed to fulfill the demands for good tyre measurement. This is done for a-symmetrical and symmetrical cylinder types. The size of these hydraulic cylinders limit the choice between servo valves, and this choice has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the total system. Some available hydraulic cylinders and servo valves ar...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an improved}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Program</b> for cars that {{can deal with}} the sudden burst of a tyre. The Improved <b>Electronic</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Program</b> (IESP) is based on a fuzzy logic algorithm. The IESP collects data from the same sensors of a standard ESP and acts on brakes/throttle with the same actuators. The IESP reads the driver steering angle and the dynamic condition of the car and selectively acts on throttle and brakes in order to put the car on the required direction even during a tyre burst. Comment: The problem of controlling cars is becoming difficult to be managed. Handling of cars on wet surfaces is becoming too hard. So, the car-manufacturers are adopting special systems to control stability. This paper wants to give a thrust to improve performances of these systems, integrating the conventional softwares with a Fuzzy Logic routin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} of ESP’s equipment {{rate in the}} vehicle market, how to evaluate and promote {{the performance of the}} syetem which the vehicle equipped with is becoming the major issue in decades. In this paper, a method from a psychological perspective is brought forward to build an accessment system for the <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>program</b> which is based on the mental factor of the drivers after the great effort on the survey of the appilication of the Ergonomics-Psychology throught the world. The system concluded five factors: workload, situation awareness, trust, stress and locus of control, and formed a questionnaire based on 13 basic questions. After the deployment of the the driver simulator test, the results show that the evaluation system provides a new methold to access the <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>program,</b> and should give a bright sight to the subjective-objective correlation of handling and stability...|$|R
