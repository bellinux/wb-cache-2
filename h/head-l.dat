It is normally a right-branching language, but this order {{gives way to}} left-branching {{as a part of}} the phenomenon known as pied-piping with inversion. Pied-piping with inversion has been argued in previous work to be the result of optimality-theoretic constraint interaction between a <b>Head-L</b> constraint (which favors left-headed constituents) and a Wh-L constraint (which favors candidates in which interrogatives align with the left edge of CP). This paper shows that the pied-piping with inversion phenomenon is further limited by a constraint known as Branching Consistency, which limits the degree to which a right-branching language tolerates left-branching constituents...|$|E
