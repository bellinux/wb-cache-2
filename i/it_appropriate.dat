5|$|In {{this way}} he {{differed}} substantially from contemporaries such as Wagner and Berlioz, {{and even from}} Schumann and Chopin.

An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.|$|E
5|$|The myth {{influenced}} popular {{religion as}} well. One {{example is the}} magical healing spells based on Horus's childhood. Another {{is the use of}} the Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets.

5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed <b>it</b> <b>appropriate</b> {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E

5|$|The flag {{may also}} be flown at half-mast when the Central People's Government advises the Chief Executive to do so, or when the Chief Executive {{considers}} <b>it</b> <b>appropriate</b> to do so, on occurrences of unfortunate events causing especially serious casualties, or when serious natural calamities have caused heavy casualties. When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised {{to the top of}} the pole and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the top of the pole is one third of the length of the pole. When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed <b>it</b> <b>appropriate</b> that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, British, and French all {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought <b>it</b> <b>appropriate</b> that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would, reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that there be no indemnity imposed upon Germany.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Paine was a noted {{writer and}} {{political}} theorist whose work had influenced and helped drive the American Revolution. Having returned to England, {{he decided to}} write a book addressing the arguments of Edmund Burke, a prominent conservative strongly fearful of the French Revolution. This was simply titled Rights of Man. The first part was published in 1791, and attracted no attention from Pitt's administration. The second, published on 16 February 1792, advocated, amongst other things, {{the right of the people}} to replace their government if they thought <b>it</b> <b>appropriate.</b> The work was an immediate success, selling a million and a half copies, and generated public support for various reform movements. It also brought Paine to the attention of the government and made him a subject to its crackdown. While Paine was visiting an aunt in Kent, Pitt had a writ issued against J.S. Jordan, Paine's publisher, prosecuting him for seditious libel—a crime based on the concept that the executive was beyond reproach, that made it illegal to criticise the government. Paine returned to London and began to campaign for Jordan, finding him a lawyer and agreeing to pay his legal fees. Jordan, however, most likely frightened for his life, pleaded guilty and turned his files over to the court. With this additional evidence, a writ was issued for Paine on 21 May, charging him with the same crime. His trial date was set for 8 June, and later rescheduled for 18 December.|$|E

25|$|After a {{screening}} phase from April 1994, 275 {{male and female}} patients were randomly assigned paroxetine, imipramine or placebo (an inert pill). Of the 275, 93 were given paroxetine, 95 imipramine and 89 placebo. The paroxetine group were given 20mg daily for four weeks, rising to 30mg at week five and 40mg at week six if the clinician thought <b>it</b> <b>appropriate.</b> The last study visit was in May 1997, and the blind was broken in October.|$|E

From 7–8 August, the British had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch. General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief Middle East Command in Cairo, had also ordered a further battalion of infantry and more artillery to Berbera but these reinforcements did not arrive in time. He also considered <b>it</b> <b>appropriate</b> to appoint a major-general to command this expanding force and on 11 August, a new commander, Godwin-Austen, reached Berbera.|$|E

This marked the first time that these tribes had agreed to a common name for themselves, distinct from that of the Moros and different from the migrant majority and their descendants.|$|E
25|$|The {{recommendations}} on negotiations {{are concerned with}} what U.S. is after, i.e., GVN action to increase effectiveness of its military effort; to ensure popular support to win war; and to eliminate strains on U.S. Government and public confidence. The negotiating posture is designed not to lay down specific hard and fast demands or to set a deadline, but to produce movement in Vietnamese Government along these lines. In this way we can test and probe effectiveness of any actions the GVN actually takes and, at the same time, maintain sufficient flexibility to permit U.S. to resume full support of Diệm regime at any time U.S. Government deems <b>it</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Article 13 of the Law of Cohesion regulates {{characteristics}} {{of health care}} offered in Spain by medical specialists, which is provided {{at the request of}} primary care physicians.

It includes care, diagnosis, therapy, rehabilitation and certain preventive care, as well as health promotion, health education and prevention of illness whose nature makes <b>it</b> <b>appropriate</b> to handle at this level. Specialized care guarantees the continuity of integrated patient care once the capabilities of primary care have been exhausted and until matters can be returned to that level. Insofar as patient condition allows, specialized care is offered in out-patient consultation and in day hospitals. As of 2010, Spain recognizes fifty distinct medical specialties.|$|E
