5|$|Pall Mall was {{constructed}} in 1661, replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket (approximately where Warwick House Street is now) to the royal residence, St James's Palace. Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times, although the earliest <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> are from the 12th century {{in connection with a}} leper colony at St James's Hospital. When St. James's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century, the park's boundary wall was built along {{the south side of the}} road. In 1620, the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality.|$|E
25|$|Another {{building}} {{may have}} been erected on {{some part of the}} site at a later date, because there are <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> to such a building in the reign of Elizabeth I and its remains are said to have been demolished around 1800, but there is no certain information about this.|$|E
500|$|The seminal modern {{study of}} the late army is {{contained}} in The Later Roman Empire, 284-602 (LRE) by the [...] "high priest" [...] of late Roman studies, A.H.M. Jones. Because of its wealth of detail and <b>documentary</b> <b>references,</b> this 1964 publication remains an essential tool for all scholars of the period. However, its primary weakness is its age, for {{a considerable amount of}} archaeological work and other relevant scholarship has transpired in the decades since its publication.|$|E

2500|$|The five tinted {{drawings}} added around 1250 {{are in a}} style especially {{associated with}} England, and best known through the contemporary work of Matthew Paris at St Albans, although {{it had been an}} English speciality since Anglo-Saxon times. [...] A pen drawing with a strong outline is coloured with light brushed washes (the archbishop is in fact purely in ink, perhaps unfinished). They may be connected with a now lost psalter, also at Westminster and recorded in the inventory of 1388, which was said to have been given by Henry III (r. 1216-1272), who was rebuilding Edward the Confessor's abbey and also his Palace of Westminster at just this time. [...] There are a number of <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> to paintings in connection with the works on both buildings, now almost all lost.|$|E

50|$|Wolnzach {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the foundation document of Wessobrunn Abbey in 756, {{by the name of}} Wolamotesaha. In 1150 there occurs the first <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to Wolnzach as the site of a market.|$|R

5000|$|In 1227 Prince-Archbishop [...] {{confirmed}} {{and thus}} recognised {{the foundation of}} the convent. Midlum's St. Pancras Church, which existed before, was integrated into the convent.

50|$|In {{some parts}} of England, the pattern of {{dispersed}} settlement has remained unchanged for many hundreds of years. Many of the locations found in Domesday may be dispersed farmsteads. It is sometimes possible to identify <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> to farmsteads in the 18th or 19th centuries with these Domesday entries.|$|E
50|$|The first clear <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to this cathedral is in a deed dated 1176 {{transcribed}} in the cartulary of Calci Charterhouse, {{although it}} may well be referred to in two earlier documents of 1138 and 1145.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> {{to the stream}} appears in the 13th-century {{cartulary}} of Buckfast Abbey, {{in which it is}} called Nordbroc and Northbroke ("north brook"), probably because of its course just {{to the north of the}} River Mardle.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> is dated 819. The monastery was {{of great}} {{significance}} as a missionary centre {{not only for}} the Bavarian Forest but also for part of Bohemia. It was destroyed in the Hungarian invasions of the early 10th century.|$|R

50|$|The {{first known}} {{reference}} in {{writing to the}} town was in the year 1050. Klaus Pampus writes in his book Urkundliche Erstnennungen oberbergischen Orte (Earliest <b>Documentary</b> <b>References</b> to Places in Oberberg) that Radevormwald came into the possession of the imperial abbey of Werden {{and at the time}} was called Rotha.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{known to}} art historians by a conjectural Dutch {{version of his}} name, all {{contemporary}} <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> use the French forms Jean-Charles-Dominique or Jean-Charles-Donat (with or without hyphens). The Académie's documents spell his surname [...] "Vambec" [...] or [...] "Vambecq", but he signed his work [...] "J. Van Beecq", [...] "JVBeecq", or [...] "I. Van Beec".|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to Hembury Castle {{is in the}} 13th-century {{cartulary}} {{of nearby}} Buckfast Abbey, where it {{is referred to as}} vetus castellum quod dicitur Hembire. The name probably derives from Old English hean byrig, [...] "at the high burh".|$|R
50|$|While no <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> {{has been}} made to Rawdon before the Domesday Book was {{composed}} in 1086, the area had seen human activity at least as early as in the Bronze age, as evidenced by archeological finds of bronze axe heads and a gold torque.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> of Noss Mayo was in 1286 as Nesse Matheu. The manor {{here was}} held by Matheu son of John from 1284 to 1309. Noss Mayo was given by Edward II of England in 1287 to Mathew Fitzjohn of the manor of ‘Stok’.|$|R
5000|$|In 1227 Prince-Archbishop [...] {{confirmed}} {{and thus}} recognised {{the foundation of}} the convent. The nuns had the privilege to freely elect their provost, their legal warden. The Midlum St. Pancras Church, which existed before, was integrated into the convent. No remains of cloister or conventual outbuildings remain, and there are only few <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> to them.|$|E
5000|$|In 992 {{a certain}} Gudesteus became Bishop of Burgos {{and it becomes}} {{impossible}} to know for certain whether certain <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> to a [...] "Bishop Gudesteus", as in a witness list to a donation of 9 April 992, belong to the bishop of Burgos or of Oviedo. Nonetheless a document of 18 August that year is accepted as Gudesteus of Oviedo's.|$|E
50|$|<b>Documentary</b> <b>references</b> to a William Dering {{being active}} in Charleston in 1764 have been found; some scholars, believing {{the two to}} be one and the same, have {{suggested}} {{a link between the}} dancing master and the earlier pastelist Henrietta Johnston (whose first marriage was to a man named Dering), who lived in that city until her death. Others believe the link to be dubious at best.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to the Schenkenberg {{dates from}} 1329 and dubs it in dem Schenkenberge. The name Schenkenberg is {{probably}} {{a reference to the}} Mundschenk family, which owned land in the area. The Kuenringer, who also owned property in this area, were called the Oberste Schenken.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} surviving <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to {{the place}} is as Plemestocha in the Domesday Book and its name is derived from Old English meaning either [...] "outlying farm with a plum-tree" [...] or, if it is short for Plympton Stock, [...] "outlying farm belonging to Plympton".|$|R
5000|$|This area {{is known}} for its many springs, some very near the sites of these churches, and there is no <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to this saint until the late Middle Ages, so it has been surmised that the name Alkelda is in fact simply a {{corruption}} of the Anglo-Saxon haligkelda, meaning holy spring.|$|R
50|$|Bradninch {{dates back}} to before the 7th century and at some time there was almost {{certainly}} a Norman or Saxon fortress on Castle Hill. There are no physical remains, and no known primary <b>documentary</b> <b>references,</b> but the likely site {{was surrounded by a}} number of 'castle' field names on the tithe map. It would have been unusual for Bradninch not to have had a castle given its status in the medieval period.|$|E
5000|$|Stanningfield {{takes its}} name from the Early English name [...] "Stanfella" [...] or [...] "Stansfelda" [...] meaning [...] "stony field". It is known that the area was {{occupied}} early in recorded British history as traces of Roman occupation has been found on one local farm. Occasional <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> mention the village in Anglo-Saxon and Norman times, including The Domesday Book. The oldest building, St Nicholas' Church, dates back at least to the Norman period.|$|E
50|$|The <b>documentary</b> <b>references</b> the {{made for}} {{television}} documentary also broadcast globally in the Discovery Channel, Chasing Zero: Winning the War on Healthcare Harm which used hospital accidents to focus a lens on leaders in healthcare reducing preventable medical error rates to zero. The documentary captures segments of Chasing Zero filmed {{around the globe}} at locations including Geneva, Switzerland; London, England; Hawaii; the Brigham and Women’s Hospital; the Cleveland Clinic; Vanderbilt University Medical Center; Johns Hopkins; and the Mayo Clinic.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to the Hermannskogel can {{be found}} in the Klosterneuburg Monastery’s tithe register. It dates from 1355 and names the hill hermannschobel. The name is {{composed}} of the personal name Hermann, which was common in the Middle Ages, and Kobel (which appears elsewhere as [...] Kogel), a common designation for cone-shaped hills.|$|R
50|$|According to the commune's website, {{the first}} <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to Koerich was in 979 {{but it was}} not until the 12th century that its two castles were built: the Fockeschlass of which all traces have {{disappeared}} though it is shown on the first cadastral map in 1771; and the Grevenschlass whose ruins still dominate the centre of the village.|$|R
50|$|In 1440 came a <b>documentary</b> <b>reference</b> to two places, Mosbruch and Zum Ried. The former {{has since}} absorbed the latter, {{but there are}} still two chapels in the municipality, one for each of the two {{formerly}} separate municipalities. In feudal times, the Üßbach formed the border between the Electorate of Cologne and the Electorate of Trier.|$|R
