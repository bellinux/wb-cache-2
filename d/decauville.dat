50|$|The first {{cars were}} basic single {{cylinder}} vehicles with {{independent front suspension}} by sliding pillars and a transverse leaf spring, identical to earlier <b>Decauvilles.</b> A unique gearbox used an integral 3-speed differential - 3 straight cut pinions brought to bear in turn on a single large straight-cut crown wheel.|$|R
5000|$|In 1903, the Ehrhardt family {{withdrew from}} {{management}} due to financial losses {{and also because}} the license to build <b>Decauvilles</b> was revoked. The factory began building under the new name, Dixi (Latin, [...] "I have spoken") in 1904 with Willi Seck as chief engineer. The top model, the type U35, was introduced in 1907 and was soon recognized for its reliability and performance with 65 hp (48 kW) and {{a top speed of}} 85 km/h (53 mph).|$|R
25|$|The {{funicular}} entered {{service on}} 12 or 13 July (sources vary), and its operation was {{handed over to}} the <b>Decauville</b> company with a contract lasting until 1931. However, lacking the necessary authorisation from the Paris Prefecture of Police to run the service, the company had to close the funicular from 24 November 1900 until 22 May 1901.|$|E
25|$|An {{advanced}} dressing {{station was}} built in the village and late in 1916, a light <b>Decauville</b> railway was repaired and sidings installed, to run from Peake Woods near La Boisselle to the village. A regular service was started by petrol locomotive up Gun Pit Road and a walkway was built alongside. On 2 November, Crown Prince Rupprecht the German army group commander on the Somme, wrote in his diary that the British were digging in west of Delville Wood to Martinpuich and Courcelette, which suggested that winter quarters were being built and that only minor operations were contemplated. Infantry attacks diminished but British artillery fire was constant, against which the large number of German guns in the area could only make a limited reply, due to a chronic shortage of ammunition. German counter-attacks were cancelled because of troop shortages. Martinpuich was lost on 25 March 1918 during Operation Michael, the German spring offensive. The village was recaptured for the last time by the 17th (Northern) Division on 25 August, during the Second Battle of Bapaume.|$|E
500|$|A large supply dump was {{established}} at Watten {{next to the}} River Aa. This site was eventually used to store material required for all the V-weapon sites in the Saint-Omer area. Building materials were brought there by barges and trains where they were unloaded onto a <b>Decauville</b> narrow-gauge railway for transportation to the construction site, where concrete mixers operated day and night. A 90 kV power line running to a transformer at Holque north of Watten provided electricity. An old quarry at Wizernes codenamed [...] (Gravel Quarry Northwest), some [...] south of Watten, was also converted into a storage dump to supply the Watten facility.|$|E
500|$|As an {{additional}} bomb-proofing method, the dome {{was surrounded by}} a bomb-proof [...] "skirt" [...] or Zerschellerplatte of steel-reinforced concrete, [...] wide and [...] thick. This was supported by a series of buttresses, which were not tied into the dome itself, above the entrances to the Gustav and Gretchen tunnels. Another concrete structure was tied into the skirt to the north-west of the dome, which was perhaps intended for use as an observation and control tower. A separate underground building was constructed on the western side of the quarry to serve as a hospital and as offices for the engineers. A <b>Decauville</b> narrow-gauge railway was installed on the quarry floor to transport supplies from the main line to the construction site.|$|E
500|$|All work on {{the large}} masses of bedrock was {{conducted}} by hand, without any help of powered machines, as the first power station in Boden was not constructed until almost ten years later in 1909. The first work that was done at the site {{was to create a}} large ditch, [...] wide and with a depth of [...] or more, that would surround the core of the fort. Creating patrol trenches and placements for the turrets {{on the top of the}} forts was also work done early on. The teams of workers would first bore down in the bedrock using pinch bars and sledgehammers, then use black powder to blast the rock into manageable pieces which could be transported away from the site, using wheelbarrows, horse-drawn carriages and in some cases <b>Decauville</b> railways. When the ditch, or parts of it, had been completed, work started on the inner part of the fort by boring horizontally from the bottom of the ditch into the mountain itself. This work was a lot harderthe cost for each cubic metre of blasted tunnel was five times the cost of a cubic metre of blasted ditchboth due to the confined space in the tunnels and the risk of damaging the bedrock. The use of black powder instead of dynamite reduced the risk of bedrock damage, but it also increased the time needed to complete the tunnels. All in all, the amount of bedrock bored, blasted, loaded and transported away from the forts has been estimated to be around [...]|$|E

2500|$|The Paris city {{government}} voted {{to construct the}} Montmartre funicular in 1891. Initially, operation of the funicular was subcontracted to <b>Decauville</b> through a concession that ended in 1931.

2500|$|Gauges below [...] were rare, but did exist. In Britain, Sir Arthur Heywood {{developed}} [...] gauge estate railways, {{while in}} France <b>Decauville</b> produced {{a range of}} industrial railways running on [...] and [...] tracks, most commonly in restricted environments such as underground mine railways, parks and farms. Several [...] gauge railways were built in Britain to serve ammunition depots and other military facilities, particularly during World War I.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{they found}} many {{discrepancies}} during the off-loading of equipment; mainly the landing craft, both experimental lighters and ships' boats, were {{almost to the}} point of being unsuitable. Once ashore, they discovered shortages of engineering tools and transportation, even with the use of the portable <b>Decauville</b> track system. Nonetheless, the Marines moved into position, manning the guns, their infantry entrenched. A counterattack force hidden in the hills as the [...] "attacking" [...] force conducted simulated raids by cruisers and large beach landing teams.|$|E
2500|$|A second <b>Decauville</b> {{line was}} {{constructed}} in Jerusalem, winding around the mountains close to the Old City, continuing to al-Bireh in the north. This railway was initiated by General Allenby after a Turkish counter-attack on the British in Jerusalem, who had recently occupied the city. Construction began in May 1918 and completed in September of the same year, by which time it was useless because the front had moved northwards. This short line passed in today's Knesset and Biblical Zoo area. A further narrow gauge extension, at [...] gauge was built by the British from Lydda to Tira and Lubban, partly adjacent to the existing [...] Turkish line.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exception}} was the Esquel line. After {{the end of}} the First World War, narrow gauge track and facilities were plentiful and cheaper, given their extensive use at the front for supplies and troop movement. [...] <b>Decauville</b> railroads were used extensively in Buenos Aires Province in rural areas and to carry freight. For passenger services, locomotives for [...] track were readily available and it was decided to pursue this cheaper option. In 1921 it was agreed to lay down the Jacobacci-Esquel line, and also to connect it with the existing private [...] gauge railway in the Chubut Valley from Dolavon to Puerto Madryn. This would be the Patagonian Light Railways Network.|$|E
2500|$|Mallet {{also worked}} out schemes for {{compounds}} with independent divided drive for HP and LP, some {{with a single}} rigid chassis that were never built, others with a rigid rear chassis on which the HP cylinders were mounted and an articulated LP front engine unit. The latter arrangement was adopted worldwide. The first application {{was a series of}} 600mm gauge locomotives specially built by the <b>Decauville</b> Company for the Paris Exposition of 1889; the design was introduced to the North American railroading in 1900 with B No. 2400, and rapidly became popular there. US practice progressed to the [...] "simple Mallet", which used the same articulated arrangement but eliminated the compounding. Both simple and compound Mallet locomotives lasted to the end of steam.|$|E
2500|$|German First Lieutenant Paul Jürgen Vollmer, {{commander}} of the First Battalion, 120th Landwehr Infantry, emptied his pistol trying to kill York while he was contending with the machine guns. Failing to injure York, and seeing his mounting losses, he offered in English to surrender the unit to York, who accepted. By {{the end of the}} engagement, York and his seven men marched 132 German prisoners back to the American lines. [...] Upon returning to his unit, York reported to his brigade commander, Brigadier General Julian Robert Lindsey, who remarked [...] "Well York, I hear you have captured the whole damn German army." [...] York replied [...] "No sir. [...] I got only 132." [...] His actions silenced the German machine guns and were responsible for enabling the 328th Infantry to renew its attack to capture the <b>Decauville</b> Railroad.|$|E
2500|$|When the British {{advanced}} northwards in November 1917, {{the railway}} was sabotaged by Austrian saboteurs from the retreating Central Powers army and most (five) of its bridges were blown up. The Turks carried away {{anything that was}} movable, from railway cars and wooden rails to parts of the stations. It was however still valuable to the British, as it provided the only viable link from Jerusalem to Egypt, as the roads were in disrepair. Trestle bridges were installed instead of the destroyed iron ones, and the first British train reached Jerusalem on December 27, 1917. In February 1918, a <b>Decauville</b> [...] gauge railway was built from Jaffa to Lydda, with an extension to the Auja River, the front line at the time. This extension was furthered to the Arab village al-Jalil (today the Glilot area), and continued to be used until 1922–23 mainly for transporting construction materials, without locomotives. Another extension was built from the Jaffa station to the port, which operated until 1928.|$|E
