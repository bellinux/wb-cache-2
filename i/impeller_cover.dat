40|$|LecturePg. 91 - 100 The fan laws, {{particularly}} {{what the}} limits {{are in their}} use is described. The derivation is covered very briefly. To help {{understand some of the}} fan law uses, centrifugal <b>impeller</b> characteristics are <b>covered,</b> particularly some of the things controlling the shape of the curve. A discussion of the fan law deviations in an individual <b>impeller</b> is <b>covered.</b> Multistage centrifugals are covered using two, four, and six stage configurations. A set of stage curves are made up for use of the study. These curves reflect two basic impeller designs. The designs result in a high (15 percent) and a low (five percent) head rise.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study {{described}} in this paper was to investigate the impact of shroud curvature on the performance of a centrifugal impeller or stage. The paper discusses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study done to assess the influence of shroud curvature on impeller performance. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analyses (FEA) methods were used to describe the various designs of the impeller. Aerodynamic and mechanical analysis results are presented for four <b>impellers</b> of varying <b>cover</b> curvature and axial length. The aerodynamic results showed there were clear aerodynamic benefits to decreasing the curvature along the impeller shroud. The mechanical analytical results showed that the impeller with the lowest curvature or longest axial length provided the highest performance; it also yielded the lowest Von Mises stress level. In closing, there are clear aerodynamic benefits to decreasing the curvature along the impeller shroud but these benefits must be weighed against the impact on the rotordynamic considerations Comments are offered regarding the rotordynamic issues that must be considered when increasing the length of impellers...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 143 - 162 Rotating {{blade and}} disk fatigue {{failures}} cause a fairly {{small percentage of}} machine shutdowns, but can require extensive repairs and downtime. This tutorial focuses on steam turbines, centrifugal compressors, and axial compressors primarily for refineries and process plants. For steam turbines, axial compressors, and open impeller centrifugal compressors, the main concern is resonance giving blade rather than disk vibration. For <b>covered</b> <b>impellers</b> in centrifugal compressors disk modes are the main response for problems, albeit failures are much more rare. Reviews of methods are to give insight to design evaluation, calculation, and test procedures. Cases will be given where designs were suspect with high potential for cause of fatigue, with other cases due to minor resonance combined with either manufacturing defects, operation, and/or environment such as liquid ingestion and corrodents. For some cases, test data will be correlated with theories provided, while others will use references, some {{of which will be}} shows to perhaps require consideration of alternative probable causes. The material will utilize both proven concepts and cases for lessons learned...|$|R
40|$|The {{centrifugal}} compressor for a marine use turbocharger with its design pressure ratio of 3. 2 was tested with a vaneless diffuser and various vaned diffusers. Vaned diffusers {{were chosen to}} <b>cover</b> <b>impeller</b> operating range as broad as possible. The analysis of the static pressure ratio in the impeller and the diffusing system, consisting of the diffuser and scroll, showed that there were four possible combinations of characteristics of impeller pressure ratio and diffusing system pressure ratio. The flow rate, QP, where the impeller achieved maximum static pressure ratio, was surge flow rate of the {{centrifugal compressor}} determined by the critical flow rate. In order to operate the compressor at a rate lower than QP, the diffusing system, whose pressure recovery factor was steep negative slope near QP, was needed. When the diffuser throat area {{was less than a}} certain value, the compressor efficiency deterio-rated; however, the compressor stage pressure ratio was almost constant. In this study, by reducing the diffuser throat area, the compressor could be operated at a flow rate less than 40 percent of its design flow rate. Analysis of the pressure ratio in the impeller and diffusing systems at design and off-design speeds showed that the irregularities in surge line occurred when the component that controlled the negative slope on the compressor stage pressure ratio changed...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 103 - 102 One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} diagnostic problems for centrifugal compressors is fatigue failure of an impeller, especially those with covers. The structure of a <b>covered</b> <b>impeller</b> is inherently resistant to alternating forces at normal flow conditions and operation, but only if it is designed using proper parameters over and above steady-state stress limits. Critical parameters are reviewed with respect to excitation and response. Besides well-known disk critical speeds, a fundamental parametric equation first published in 1979 is further explained and emphasized. Occasional failures that occur usually involve certain design features coupled to added excitation from flow variations, either at the extremes of the operating map or form process and control design features and deviations. Test data for process refrigeration units that experienced numerous failures in the 1970 ?s required actual strain gauge results via slip ring data acquisition to prove that liquid ingestion was the cause of high excitation. These critical data gave much confirmation to assist in future design reliability. In a more recent unusual case, a compressor impeller failed within hours after startup; aspects of the original design and process operation are presented along with improvements. Some cases require special internal instrumentation to solve recurring failures. Documentation of failures including some with liquid ingestion is discussed, along with suggestions for review to mitigate potential failures of repaired unites as well as new designs. Also discussed is confirming evidence from other references where applicable. Design improvements, both for older and more efficient impellers, are shown to reduced risk, especially for those with vaned diffusers...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 59 - 70 The {{reliability}} of centrifugal compressors {{for the most}} part depends on the reliable operation of impellers. Most of the time, damage to impellers is due to mechanical fatigue. Fatigue damage has been observed in blades, discs, and covers. The damage is due to alternating stress resulting from vibration of structure. Alternating force can excite natural mode(s) of vibration that in turn may result in high alternating stresses. Analysis of a blade by itself, or for that matter a disc or cover by themselves, is easier. However, in reality, the impeller is a system that combines the blade, disc, and <b>cover</b> (<b>impeller</b> with shroud). The dynamic behavior of such a system becomes complex compared to that just for blades or just a disc. Understanding the dynamic behavior is important to rationalize fatigue failures and thus design a reliable impeller. The paper presents: The results of the finite element analysis (FEA) of a simple impeller. These results help in the understanding of the behavior without the complexity of the results, thus paving the way to understand the behavior of similar complex systems. Specifically, it helps to: -	Rationalize the results of the system {{based on the results of}} blade alone and of disc alone. -	Describe a method to create an interference type diagram. -	Explain the results based on the diagram. The results of the FE analysis for an impeller, and A method that helps in drawing conclusion(s) about the possible resonance of an impeller...|$|R
30|$|The {{transient}} {{flow through the}} modeled pump was simulated using the commercial software ANSYS CFX 14.5, which utilized the finite volume method to solve the unsteady three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations. Because of the fast convergence and the accurate hydraulic performance achieved compared to other turbulence models, the standard k-ε model was selected to complete the turbulence equation, with the standard wall function {{for the treatment of}} the flow in the boundary layer based on the refined grids [27]. All the solid walls in the computational domain were set as no-slip walls with a roughness of 0.2  mm. The surfaces of the impeller and back blades were set in a rotating reference frame with a rotational speed identical to the nominal operating speed of the pump [28, 29]. All the other surfaces were set in a stationary frame. The transient rotor–stator model was attached to the interfaces between the rotating and stationary regions. An axial velocity, based on the variation of the flow rate, was provided at the inlet boundary located at the suction branch. In addition, the outlet boundary was set as an opening with a specified static pressure {{in the case of the}} upstream influence of backflow on the primary flow domain. A high-resolution technique was used for the discretization of the advection scheme and turbulence terms. The second-order backward Euler method was applied for the transient scheme. The convergence criterion was set as 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 for the scaled residuals, with at least 20 iterations per time step. The time step was set as 0.000172414  s, as this provided a blade rotation of 3 ° between iterations, which means an <b>impeller</b> rotational period <b>covers</b> 120 time steps. Ten impeller revolutions were required when the flow reached a clear periodic regime. The data of one additional impeller revolution was then extracted to analyze the {{transient flow}} characteristics for each case. The data include the maximum, minimum, time-average, and standard deviation of the selected flow variables, including static pressure, total pressure, relative velocity, and absolute velocity.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 24 The {{efficiency}} of compressor impellers, {{apart from the}} design, depends on some features linked with their manufacture. These features are the accuracy of geometry, the surface quality obtained, and the blockages which are inevitable with <b>covered</b> <b>impellers</b> and are attributable to the joining method applied, e. g., greater blade thicknesses {{in the case of}} riveting, or narrowed cross sections, due to weld seams, in the case of welding. As a result of the ever increasing importance of efficiency, efforts have been made to further improve the manufacturing process. The advantages and disadvantages of the various forming methods for high-quality impellers, such as milling with a relatively high accuracy, and involving high manufacturing outlay, are discussed. The various casting processes with a variety of possibilities to fulfill the requirements made with regard to the dimensional tolerances, process-dependent blade thicknesses and manual work for achieving certain specified accuracies are described. The {{efficiency of}} impellers with closed passageways, that is, with a cover or shroud disc, is superior to that of impellers with open passageways. This means that when no cast impellers are used, suitable methods must be available for joining the blades and the cover. For maximum accuracy and minimum blockage, the high-vacuum brazing method has become more and more accepted during the past few years. However, the manufacture of impellers applying the brazing method becomes problematic for large diameters. In addition to vacuum brazing, manual and machine welding processes continue to be applied, including slot welding for two-dimensionally curved blades. Diffusion welding and electron-beam welding have not found acceptance since high costs, unfavorable crevices, and sharp edges, along with possible deformations, have a negative influence on the behavior of such impellers during operation. It is true that the sophisticated riveting process of some manufacturers for two-dimensionally curved blades requires great wall thicknesses; but, {{it is also true that}} high-accuracy impellers can be produced by this method. In addition, the vibratory behavior of such impellers is favorable due to system-inherent dampening. Moreover, riveted impellers will tolerate high stresses when the Bauschinger effect is taken into account. The manufacture of highly stressed impellers for turbocompressors is based on the availability of suitable materials and adequate test methods...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 35 - 44 To {{cover the}} {{remaining}} operation {{life of an}} offshore platform, {{it was necessary to}} go from a single stage compressor to a two-stage compressor. The design of the new two-stage compressor required two different <b>impeller</b> arrangements to <b>cover</b> the range of suction/discharge pressures anticipated. One rotor has nine wheels and another one has 11 by adding one impeller at the outboard ends of both compression sections. With a rotor flexibility ratio around of 2. 5, the new replacement compressor is a borderline machine on the API 617 (2002) stability screening map. The stability study indicated that the compressor failed to meet the Level-I stability criteria at the design conditions. A detailed stability investigation became necessary though the machine was predicted to be stable based on an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) empirical method. An independent party was contracted to conduct a full stability audit on both rotors. Compressor cross-coupling was evaluated uniquely and lumped at each impeller location in the analysis model. Additionally, the destabilizing force from all labyrinth seals in the compressor were calculated and included in the detailed stability analysis. The study results indicated that both rotors would most likely be susceptible to severe instability problems even using a modified center labyrinth seal with a shunt-injection and swirl brakes. Consequently, the effect of damper seals on the rotor stability was further investigated independently. It was concluded that a honeycomb seal could bring the log-decrement to a distinctively positive value for the nine-wheel rotor, but not succeed in raising the log-decrement to positive for the 11 -wheel rotor. Because of faster than anticipated declines in well deliverability, it was decided to bypass the nine-wheel configuration and install the 11 -wheel configuration. The 11 -wheel rotor used a modified center labyrinth seal with a shunt/brake deswirl system. As a backup, the nine-wheel rotor and the inner casing were modified to fit with a pocket damper seal. The 11 -stage compressor was successfully commissioned and has run well in the field for more than one year. Overall shaft vibration level was low and the predicted subsynchronous vibration was not observed. In this paper, a correlation study was carried out and a comparison was made to discuss how to calculate the Wachel number, and how to practically evaluate the contribution of the labyrinth seals and the gas deswirl devices in a detailed (API Level-II) rotor stability analysis...|$|R
