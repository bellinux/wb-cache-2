She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|At age 37, Mary turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{finding a}} husband and {{producing}} an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line {{under the terms of}} Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E

Although {{scheduled}} for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly {{was considered to be}} so indispensable to the bureau's operations that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Catholic charitable work.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1950s, Carson turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> conservation, {{especially}} {{some problems}} {{that she believed}} were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, {{which led to a}} nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that {{led to the creation of}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had neutralized the detachment left to secure the Abbasid army's rear in Phrygia, were able to trap Harun's army between their own converging forces. The defection of the Armenian general Tatzates, however, allowed Harun to regain the upper hand. The Abbasid prince sent for a truce and detained the high-ranking Byzantine envoys, who included Empress Irene's chief minister, Staurakios. This forced Irene {{to agree to a}} three-year truce and pay a heavy annual tribute. Irene then focused <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Balkans, but warfare with the Arabs resumed in 786, until mounting Arab pressure led to another truce in 798, on terms similar to those of 782.|$|E
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck {{to get a better view}} of the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon.

5|$|Once {{the right}} to vote was secured, Stevens turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> women's legal status. She {{supported}} passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and worked with Alice Paul from 1927–1933 on a volume of work comparing varying impact on law for women and men. The goal in compiling the data was to obtain an international law protecting women's right of citizenship. The research was completed with the help of feminists in 90 countries and evaluated laws controlling women's nationality from every country. Gaining approval for the work from the League of Nations in 1927, Stevens presented the proposal Pan American Union in 1928, convincing the governing body to create the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM). In 1931, she joined the American Institute of International Law, becoming its first female member. In 1933, her work resulted in the first treaty to secure international rights for women. The Convention on the Nationality of Women established that women retained their citizenship after marriage and Convention on Nationality provided that neither marriage nor divorce could affect the nationality of the members of a family, extending citizenship protection to children.|$|E

After confronting a legion of servants of Amon, including a breed of Protoss-Zerg hybrids, Mengsk informs Kerrigan that Raynor is still alive and uses him as a leverage against her, keeping the location where he is imprisoned a secret, until she joins forces with the Hyperion to locate and rescue him. However, seeing that she discarded her humanity after all the effort he took to restore it, Raynor rejects her, despite her confession that she loves him, and parts ways with her. Kerrigan then turns <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Korhal and sends her forces to bring down Mengsk once and for all. However, during their showdown, Mengsk uses the artifact to immobilize her, but Raynor appears to protect her, and Mengsk is ultimately killed by Kerrigan. With the Dominion under control of Mengsk's son Valerian, Kerrigan bids farewell to Raynor and departs with the Zerg Swarm to confront Amon and his forces.|$|E
