40|$|The {{concept of}} en bloc removal of tissue {{surrounding}} the esophagus {{was applied to}} intrathoracic esophageal cancers, and the first 80 cases were operated on by this technique between 1969 and 1981. Analysis of prognostic factors showed that only penetration through the esophageal wall and lymph node spread influenced survival. Since 1981, a new staging system based on wall penetration (W) and lymph nodes (N), as well as systemic metastases (M), and similar to the modified Dukes' system for colon cancer {{has been used to}} select patients before and during surgery for en bloc resection if favorable pathology (W 1, N 0, or N 1) could be anticipated. When curative resection was not attainable, based on preoperative and operative staging, a standard esophagectomy was considered for relief of symptoms when necessary. From July 1981 to June 1984, 68 esophageal cancers were referred to us, and 31 were resected by the en bloc method, 21 by standard esophagectomy, and 16 were not resected. The success of preoperative staging was confirmed, as only nine of the 31 en bloc cases demonstrated both W 2 and N 2 pathology. The proportion of W 2 N 2 cases subjected to en bloc esophagectomy was less (p less than 0. 01) than that in the preceding series. This selection of cases showed a <b>favorable</b> <b>deviation</b> in the survival curve following en bloc esophagectomy since 1981 compared to the earlier interval. Patients treated by en bloc esophagectomy had a significantly greater survival than they did following standard esophagectomy at all time intervals after 6 months. There was no difference in hospital mortality or complications between the two operations. Further evidence for the value of the new staging system was shown by the significant difference in survival curves between those with favorable versus unfavorable staging and treated by en bloc esophagectomy. Among all cases resected between 1981 and 1984, 18 -month survival in W 1 stage was 67 % compared to 35 % for W 2 disease. Survival with N 0 disease was 58 % versus 43 % for N 1 stage and 21 % for N 2 stage. The favorable survival rates after en bloc resection in those with limited (less than W 2 N 2) disease support the concept of selecting patients for curative surgery based on preoperative and operative staging. Preoperative radiation therapy caused a significant decline in patient survival at 6 and 12 months and has been abandoned. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|A bidding {{rotating}} {{savings and}} credit association (Rosca) is modeled as {{a sequence of}} symmetric-independent-private-value auctions with price-proportional benefits to bidders. We estimate a structural econometric model which, by introducing an altruistic component into each bidder's utility function, allows for socially <b>favorable</b> <b>deviations</b> from the private information, non-altruistic bidding equilibrium. We find that bidding is more altruistic in groups managed by experienced organizers and in Roscas whose current members have already run through more than one Rosca cycle of the current group, implying that effective leadership and enduring relationships help mitigate the social cost of strategic behavior. When a bidder has to meet an unforeseen expenditure and this information is public, bidders act more altruistically than when information is private and the Rosca funds are used for investment, indicating reciprocal risk sharing among Rosca participants.

40|$|The {{effect of}} primary ion species of differing charge and mass - specifically, deuterium, hydrogen, and helium - on instabilities and {{transport}} is studied in DIII-D plasmas through gyrokinetic simulations with GYRO [J. Candy and E. Belli, General Atomics Technical Report No. GA-A 26818, 2010]. In linear simulations under imposed similarity of the profiles, {{there is an}} isomorphism between the linear growth rates of hydrogen isotopes, but the growth rates are higher for Z > 1 main ions due to {{the appearance of the}} charge in the Poisson equation. On ion scales the most significant effect of the different electron-to-ion mass ratio appears through collisions stabilizing trapped electron modes. In nonlinear simulations, significant <b>favorable</b> <b>deviations</b> from pure gyro-Bohm scaling are found due to electron-to-ion mass ratio effects and collisions. The presence of any non-trace impurity species cannot be neglected in a comprehensive simulation of the transport; including carbon impurity in the simulations caused a dramatic reduction of energy fluxes. The transport in the analyzed deuterium and helium discharges could be well reproduced in gyrokinetic and gyrofluid simulations while the significant hydrogen discrepancy is the subject of ongoing investigation...|$|R

Recent laboratory testing efforts {{have indicated that}} the modeling of radiant heat transfer effects is needed to accurately characterize piping heat loss. An analytical methodology for integrating radiant heat transfer was implemented with HWSIM. Laboratory test data collected in another project was then used to validate the model {{for a variety of}} uninsulated and insulated pipe cases (copper, PEX, and CPVC).

40|$|Among all {{neutrino}} mixing parameters, {{the atmospheric}} neutrino mixing angle theta 23 introduces the strongest {{variation on the}} flux ratios of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos. We investigate the potential of these flux ratio measurements at neutrino telescopes to constrain theta 23. We consider astrophysical neutrinos originating from pion, muon-damped, and neutron sources and make a comparative study of their sensitivity reach to theta 23. It is found that neutron sources are most <b>favorable</b> for testing <b>deviations</b> from maximal theta 23. Using a chi 2 analysis, we show, in particular, the power of combining (i) different flux ratios from {{the same type of}} source, and also (ii) combining flux ratios from different astrophysical sources. We include in our analysis “impure” sources, i. e., deviations from the usually assumed initial (1 : 2 : 0), (0 : 1 : 0), or (1 : 0 : 0) flux compositions...|$|R
40|$|Interstellar neutral {{hydrogen}} atoms {{flowing into the}} solar system are attracted by the solar gravitational force, repelled by solar hydrogen Ly-alpha radiation pressure, and are ionized, primarily, through charge exchange with the solar wind protons. The solar cycle variation of the radiation pressure causes the net central solar force to fluctuate between attraction and repulsion resulting in the modulation of the neutral hydrogen density about the usual time independent model. The calculation presented here shows that the time dependent downstream density is strongly modulated by {{a large number of}} travelling neutral density waves. The waves possess a continuous range of wavelengths as is to be expected for a Maxwellian gas subjected to several eleven year cycle variations during its journey through the solar system. The amplitudes of the density modulation were found to be quite large. The backscattered glow was found to depend on the position of the detector and the phase of the solar cycle. At the most <b>favorable</b> condition a <b>deviation</b> of the order of 25 % from the time dependent glow might be observed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to develop fuzzy tools for {{measuring}} risk based on adaptation of corresponding indicators developed within the methodology of the probability theory. The study {{is limited to the}} situations where the economic indicator, which performs the function of a decision criterion and is an object of the analysis of the degree of risk, is modeled by a fuzzy number, and the latter is to be understood as a fuzzy value with a normal and convex membership function. Also in this case there applied the interval method, which describes fuzzy estimation of the criterion index by membership degrees. Within the framework of implementing the goal set, there consistently considered a number of probabilistic indicators of risk degree: mean absolute deviation, semideviation, coefficient of unfavorable deviations, ratio of expected losses (losses). For the latter, a modified version is proposed, in which the expected <b>favorable</b> and unfavorable <b>deviations</b> of the values of the criterion index are estimated taking into account the probability of their occurrence due to which it was called the weighted expected loss ratio. For the initial and modified version of the expected loss ratio, their fuzzy adaptations are formulated. According to the known property of the semideviation index, in the situation of probabilistic uncertainty the values of the coefficient of unfavorable deviations and the weighted expected loss ratio coincide. If the analyzed criterion index is described by a fuzzy estimate, the use of fuzzy adaptations of these coefficients in the general case leads to different results. It is also revealed that the fuzzy adaptation of the coefficient of unfavorable deviations coincides with the indicator of the degree of risk {{on the basis of a}} combined (hybrid) version of the possibility measure...|$|R
