5|$|Florindo {{opens with}} {{celebrations}} to mark Apollo's {{victory over the}} dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him {{to fall in love}} with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains <b>hopeful</b> <b>and</b> continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.|$|E

25|$|He {{followed}} his success by developing into his Rose period from 1904 to 1907, which introduced a strong element of sensuality and sexuality into his work. The Rose period depictions of acrobats, circus performers and theatrical characters are rendered in warmer, brighter colors and {{are far more}} <b>hopeful</b> <b>and</b> joyful in their depictions of the bohemian life in the Parisian avant-garde and its environs. The Rose period produced two important large masterpieces: Family of Saltimbanques (1905), which recalls the work of Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) and Édouard Manet (1832–1883); and Boy Leading a Horse (1905–06), which recalls Cézanne's Bather (1885–87) and El Greco's Saint Martin and the Beggar (1597–1599). While he already had a considerable following {{by the middle of}} 1906, Picasso enjoyed further success with his paintings of massive oversized nude women, monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive (African, Micronesian, Native American) art. He began exhibiting his work in the galleries of Berthe Weill (1865–1951) and Ambroise Vollard (1866–1939), quickly gaining a growing reputation and a following amongst the artistic communities of Montmartre and Montparnasse.|$|E
25|$|Amerike – The Golden Land {{tells the}} journey of America’s Jewish {{ancestors}} who emigrated from their towns and cities in Europe and Russia (especially the Pale of Settlement) {{to start a new}} life in America. The characters in this story start off with a tremendous amount of hope in leaving their homes and starting new lives in NYC. However, their notions of America as a free land are shattered at Ellis Island when they witness families being torn apart to Ellis Island’s selection process. Life turns out to be quite difficult in America, the characters in the show soon discover. Poor wages, long hours, and sweatshop conditions are horrors that tug at the seams of the characters. Events such as the Triangle Factory Fire, Workers Unionization, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, The Great Depression, World War I, and the Holocaust – World War II are telling points of the story in showing these immigrants growth, participation, and contribution to American economy and culture. The story ends on a <b>hopeful</b> <b>and</b> spirited note where survivors of the Holocaust are welcomed into the United States by the immigrants who fought to create a life for themselves there. Told in popular songs of the day, Amerike – The Golden Land is performed in Yiddish with Russian and English supertitles.|$|E

Although Icke regards Christian patriots as the only Americans who understand the New World Order, he also told a Christian patriot group: [...] "I don't know which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the one you want to replace it with". James Ward argues that Icke's underlying message is <b>hopeful,</b> <b>and</b> that therein lies his appeal: as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, [...] "If we want a world of love and peace, {{we have to be}} loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like." ...|$|E

Nolan described Mal as [...] "the essence of the femme fatale", the key noir reference in the film. As a [...] "classic femme fatale" [...] her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves. DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance saying that [...] "she can be strong and vulnerable and <b>hopeful</b> <b>and</b> heartbreaking {{all in the same}} moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character".|$|E
