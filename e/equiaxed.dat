50|$|When ideally implemented, {{this process}} mixes the {{material}} without changing the phase (by melting or otherwise) {{and creates a}} microstructure with fine, <b>equiaxed</b> grains.

Friction stir processing also enhances the tensile strength and fatigue strength of the metal.

Tensile loading results in <b>equiaxed</b> dimples, which are spherical depressions a few micrometres in diameter that coalesce normal to the loading axis. Shear stresses will result elongated dimples, which are parabolic depressions that coalesce in planes of maximum shear stress. The depressions point back to the crack origin, and shear influenced failure will produce depressions that point in opposite directions on opposing fracture surfaces. Combined tension and bending will also produce the elongated dimple morphology, but the directions of the depressions will be in the same direction on both fracture surfaces.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{the amount}} of a phase or constituent, that is, its volume fraction, is defined in ASTM E 562; manual grain size {{measurements}} are described in ASTM E 112 (<b>equiaxed</b> grain structures with a single size distribution) and E 1182 (specimens with a bi-modal grain size distribution); while ASTM E 1382 describes how any grain size type or condition can be measured using image analysis methods. Characterization of nonmetallic inclusions using standard charts is described in ASTM E 45 (historically, E 45 covered only manual chart methods and an image analysis method for making such chart measurements was described in ASTM E 1122. The image analysis methods are currently being incorporated into E 45). A stereological method for characterizing discrete second-phase particles, such as nonmetallic inclusions, carbides, graphite, etc., is presented in ASTM E 1245.|$|E
50|$|As {{solidification}} proceeds, {{an increasing}} number of atoms lose their kinetic energy, making the process exothermic. For a pure material, latent heat is released at the solid-liquid interface so that the temperature remains constant until the melt has completely solidified. The growth rate of the resultant crystalline substance will depend on how fast this latent heat can be conducted away. A dendrite growing in an undercooled melt can be approximated as a parabolic needle-like crystal that grows in a shape-preserving manner at constant velocity. Nucleation and growth determine the grain size in <b>equiaxed</b> solidification while the competition between adjacent dendrites decides the primary spacing in columnar growth. Generally, if the melt is cooled slowly, nucleation of new crystals will be less than at large undercooling. The dendritic growth will result in dendrites of a large size. Conversely, a rapid cooling cycle with a large undercooling will increase the number of nuclei and thus reduce the size of the resulting dendrites (and often lead to small grains).|$|E
50|$|Hot rolling is a {{metalworking}} {{process that}} occurs above the recrystallization {{temperature of the}} material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an <b>equiaxed</b> microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually large pieces of metal, like semi-finished casting products, such as slabs, blooms, and billets. If these products came from a continuous casting operation the products are usually fed directly into the rolling mills at the proper temperature. In smaller operations the material starts at room temperature and must be heated. This is done in a gas- or oil-fired soaking pit for larger workpieces and for smaller workpieces induction heating is used. As the material is worked the temperature must be monitored {{to make sure it}} remains above the recrystallization temperature. To maintain a safety factor a finishing temperature is defined above the recrystallization temperature; this is usually 50 to 100 °C (90 to 180 °F) above the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature does drop below this temperature the material must be re-heated before more hot rolling.|$|E
50|$|The major {{objective}} of CETSOL {{is to improve}} and validate the modelling of Columnar-Equiaxed Transition (CET) and of the grain microstructure in solidification processing. This aims to give industry confidence in {{the reliability of the}} numerical tools introduced in their integrated numerical models of casting, and their relationship. To achieve this goal, intensive deepening of the quantitative characterization of the basic physical phenomena that, from the microscopic to the macroscopic scales, govern microstructureformation and CET will be pursued.CET occurs during columnar growth when new grains grow ahead of the columnar front in the undercooled liquid. Under certain conditions, these grains can stop the columnar growth and then the solidification microstructure becomes <b>equiaxed.</b> Experiments have to take place on the ISS due to the long-duration required to solidify samples with the objective to study the CET. Indeed, the length scale of the grain structure when columnar growth takes place is of the order of the casting scale rather than the microstructure scale. This {{is due to the fact}} that, to a first approximation, it is the heat flow that controls the transition rather than the solute flow. Experimental programs are being carried out on aluminium-nickel and aluminium-silicon alloys.|$|E
5000|$|Spray forming offers certain {{advantages}} over both conventional ingot metallurgy and more specialized {{techniques such as}} powder metallurgy. Firstly, it is a flexible process {{and can be used}} to manufacture a wide range of materials, some of which are difficult to produce by other methods, e.g. Al-5wt% Li alloys or Al-SiC, Al-Al2O3 metal matrix composites (MMCs). The atomisation of the melt stream into droplets of 10-500 µm diameter, some of which, depending on diameter, cool quickly to the solid and semi-solid state provide a large number of nucleants for the residual liquid fraction of the spray formed material on the billet top surface. The combination of rapid cooling in the spray and the generation of a large population of solid nucleants in the impacting spray leads to a fine <b>equiaxed</b> microstructure, typically in the range 10-100 µm, with low levels and short length scales of internal solute partitioning. These microstructural aspects offer advantages in material strength because of fine grain size, refined distribution of dispersoid and/or secondary precipitate phases, as well as tolerance to impurity ‘tramp’ elements. This fine structure in the ‘as sprayed’ condition means homogenising heat treatments can often be avoided. Because of the complex solidification path (i.e. the rapid transition from superheated melt to solid, liquid or semi-solid droplet to temperature equilibration at semi-solid billet top and final slow cooling to fully solid) of the spray formed material, extended solubility of alloying elements and the formation of metastable and quasi-crystalline phases has also been reported.|$|E
50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the atomising gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: spray height, atomiser gas pressure, melt flow rate, melt superheat and atomiser configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), arc spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and spray forming using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an <b>equiaxed</b> homogeneous structure.|$|E
5000|$|As in {{conventional}} extrusion processes, in friction extrusion, a shape change is enforced on the charge by forcing its passage through a die. However, friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in several key ways. Critically, in the friction extrusion process, the extrusion charge (billet or other precursor) rotates {{relative to the}} extrusion die. In addition, similar to conventional extrusion, an extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.  Scrolled features {{on the face of the}} die aid material flow into the extrusion orifice which can lead to order of magnitude reduction in extrusion force compared to conventional extrusions of equivalent cross section.  Third, the combined effects of elevated temperature and large levels of deformation normally lead the extrudate to have a relatively fine, <b>equiaxed,</b> grain structure which results from recrystallization after the conclusion of deformation: desirable crystallographic textures may also be created by the process and formation of nanocomposite structures are also possible. Based on the foregoing, it can be said that the essential controlled parameters in friction extrusion are typically: ...|$|E
40|$|A {{macroscopic}} {{model of}} Columnar-to-Equiaxed Transition (CET) formation is presented. The {{growth of a}} columnar zone and an <b>equiaxed</b> zone are treated separately and modeled on a fixed grid. The model uses a columnar Front Tracking (FT) formulation to compute {{the motion of the}} columnar front and the solidification of the dendritic columnar mushy zone. The model for the <b>equiaxed</b> zone calculates the average growth of <b>equiaxed</b> grains within the control volumes of undercooled liquid. The proposed model, which calculates the average <b>equiaxed</b> growth, is different from previous FT models which consider each <b>equiaxed</b> grain envelope separately. A lognormal size distribution model of seed particles is used for the <b>equiaxed</b> nucleation in the undercooled liquid zone. After nucleation, average <b>equiaxed</b> growth is computed by considering the <b>equiaxed</b> envelopes as spherical. The extended volume concept is used to deal with grain impingement. The Scheil equation is used to calculate the solid fraction and latent heat release. When the <b>equiaxed</b> fraction is great enough, advancement of the columnar front is halted and the CET position is determined. CET formation was simulated for directional solidification of an aluminium-silicon alloy. The results were compared with a previous FT-CET prediction model as well as with experimental data.

40|$|Abstract. The {{simulation}} of macrosegregation in a 2. 45 -ton steel ingot with the three-phase mixed columnar-equiaxed model was presented previously. The results showed an overestimation of {{the intensity of}} bottom negative segregation. The reason {{is due to the}} assumed globular morphology for the <b>equiaxed</b> crystal. Therefore, in this paper a simple approach is suggested to treat the dendritic morphology of <b>equiaxed</b> crystals. Three aspects are improved: the drag force between the moving <b>equiaxed</b> crystals and the surrounding melt, the mechanism of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition, the packing limit of the <b>equiaxed</b> crystals. The modified model is used to calculate the macrosegre-gation of the same ingot. It is found that the modified model predicts less severe negative segrega-tion in the bottom <b>equiaxed</b> zone than the previous globular <b>equiaxed</b> model does, i. e. it agrees bet-ter to the experiment.

40|$|In metallurgy, {{one of the}} {{industrial}} issues {{is to be able}} to control the structure as well as the defects formed during the solidification step, since they induce the working properties of the solidified material. The usual microstructure is dendritic and can be either columnar (preferred growth direction), or <b>equiaxed</b> (solid grains without preferential direction), or together with both regime at the Columnar to <b>Equiaxed</b> Transition (CET), or in a mixed regime between columnar and <b>equiaxed.</b> The phenomena at the origin of <b>equiaxed</b> dendrites imply a multitude of complex mechanisms (heterogeneous nucleation and fragmentation, kinetics of growth…). The <b>equiaxed</b> dendrites can be obtained by two known mechanisms, the first one based on heterogeneous nucleation is controlled by introducing refining particles during the solidification [1, 2], and for the second one <b>equiaxed</b> grains are issued from the columnar structure by fragmentation or other mechanisms [3, 4]. In both cases, the convection plays a very significant role in the origin and transport of the nuclei and <b>equiaxed</b> grains. Forced convection in the bulk liquid can be generated by mechanical [5] [6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, or electromagnetic stirring 17]. The benefit of electromagnetic stirring has been discussed in the literature during the last decades. Early investigations have shown a decrease of the grain size with increasing strength of forced convection [8, 10].

We {{studied the}} crystallographic features, {{especially}} the orientation relationship {{with respect to}} austenite, of martensite in a steel transformed from coarse-grained <b>equiaxed</b> austenite (35 µm), ultrafine-grained <b>equiaxed</b> (2. 5 µm) or lamellar (300 nm) austenite fabricated by sever plastic deformation.
