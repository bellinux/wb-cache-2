Points out that CND is a necessary condition to firms participate of the government shopping system and represents an incentive to firms maintain their tributary duties reasonably in order. In order to evaluate {{the effects of this}} mechanism about the fulfilment of tax obligation, it was constructed a simple partial equilibrium model, understanding that, the higher is the tax rate to the sector and/or the lower is the exposure of its revenues to the public sector, the smaller the governments requirements for granting CND will be. Based on the solution of the model with the aid of Brazilian national accounts of 2006, identifies sectors where the government should be more rigid to give the CND, like services to firms, construction, pharmaceutical products and information services. Finally, it notes that, the sectors less affected by CND are appliances companies, cigarettes producers, mining and metallurgy...|$|E

On June 11, 1881 Chile issued a decree in favor of the second option and to enact an export tax upon the export of saltpeter. The Chilean war debts, the impossibility to assume the financial obligations of nitrate certificates and the will to deflate European opposition to the annexation were the reasons to the decree that was criticized in Chile after the war.|$|R

50|$|Alongside fiat money, credit money also develops. Credit money, {{although}} {{expressed in}} currency units, does not consist of money tokens.

5000|$|In 1665, England boasted a {{population}} {{about four times}} as large {{as that of the}} Dutch Republic. This population was dominated by poor peasants, however, and so the only source of ready cash were the cities. The Dutch urban population exceeded that of England in both proportional and absolute terms and the Republic would be able to spend more than twice the amount of money on the war as England, the equivalent of £11,000,000. The outbreak of war was followed ominously by the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London, hitting the only major urban centre of the country. These events, occurring in such close succession, virtually brought England to its knees, as the English fleet had suffered from cash shortages even before these calamities, despite having been voted a record budget of £2,500,000 by the English parliament. The navy did not pay its sailors with money, but with [...] "tickets", or <b>debt</b> <b>certificates.</b> Charles lacked an effective means of enforcing taxation. The only way to finance the war, in effect, was to capture Dutch trade fleets. English penury made the war's outcome dependent on the fortunes of its privateers; in fact Dutch privateers would be the more successful.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the way {{in which}} credit market imperfections affect the behaviour of economic agents, and examines how a variety of tangible or intangible assets such as fiat money, reputation and inventories, facilitate bilateral exchange and influence investment decisions of firms under such circumstances. The first chapter of the thesis deals with the role of fiat money as a medium of exchange in a model in which agents hold consumable goods or nonconsumable cash. The physical environment of pairwise random matching for bilateral trade, however, prevents them from issuing <b>debt</b> <b>certificates.</b> Unlike fiat money, consumables have uncertain quality characteristics, and agents can only detect the quality of a subset of goods. As a consequence, barter is plagued by asymmetric information, whereas monetary exchange involving generally recognisable legal tender is not. This suggests that it is because of, rather than despite, its intrinsic uselessness that, as a medium of exchange, fiat money is superior to goods or assets subject to some form of quality uncertainty. The second chapter examines the effects of reputation and internal finance on a firm's investment incentives. An entrepreneur with unknown productivity finances risky production with a combination of internal finance and funds from external investors who, just like himself, are able to learn about his true productivity over time, a process that influences their willingness to lend. However, investment decisions taken by the entrepreneur, are not observable to outsiders. This information problem leads not only to underinvestment but also to premature liquidation. It is shown that the acquisition of reputation and internal funds may counteract such undesirable outcomes. On the other hand, it becomes clear that when assets are low, incentives to invest are disrupted because of a high probability of liquidation in the near future. Young firms appear to be particularly susceptible to effects of this type. Finally, the third chapter studies inventory investment and internal-finance decisions of a financially constrained firm facing an uncertain demand process. The model gives an explanation for the stylised fact that production is more volatile than sales. Assuming that firms have limited access to capital markets they are forced to rely on internal finance. However, following a series of unfavourable sales realisations such funds possibly are so low that firms find themselves unable to re-establish the old inventory level in subsequent periods. Conversely, after a series of high sales the firm has a substantive amount of money to finance output quantities that may be in excess of sales...|$|R

40|$|U radu se razmatraju vijesti o Morlacima koje su prikupljene proučavanjem arhivske građe šibenske provenijencije iz razdoblja između Ciparskoga i Kandijskoga rata (1570. – 1645.). Najviše pozornosti posvećeno je trgovačkome i demografskome kontekstu šibensko-morlačkih odnosa, a potom pograničnim sukobima i običajima na šibenskoj dionici mletačko-osmanskoga krajišta. U posebnim se prilozima na kraju rada donose popisi Morlaka zabilježenih u suvremenim spisima šibenskih notara i šibenskim matičnim knjigama. In {{the period}} between the War of Cyprus and the Cretan War (1573 – 1645), the trading {{relations}} between the Venetian Republic and the Ottoman Empire were very fruitful and dynamic. The {{same can be said}} about Dalmatia as the border area between them, which was particularly evident in the everyday life of Šibenik as one of the centres of intense Venetian-Ottoman trade and mutual cultural influences. The Morlacs, members of Christian communities living in the Ottoman hinterland of the Dalmatian communes, {{played an important role in}} trade. They mostly brought corn, meat, cheese, and wool to Šibenik and bought from Šibenik’s and Italian merchants fabrics, jewellery, clothes, delicacies, and most importantly – salt. This can be concluded from the numerous contracts signed in the offices of Šibenik’s notaries, most of which have the form of <b>debt</b> <b>certificates,</b> i. e. statements of credit-debit obligations in the framework of a well-developed credit-based trade. Nevertheless, the relatively frequent appearance of Morlacs in the records of Šibenik’s notaries is not primarily a reflection of elaborate export trade (in which the Ottoman Muslims played a more prominent role), but rather a consequence of the need of local Morlac communities to buy goods on credit from the merchants of Šibenik. One should also note that the trading contacts between Šibenik’s families and individuals from the rural border settlements of the Šibenik commune on the one side, and the Morlacs on the other, often evolved into more complex and even intimate relations of family and friendship. Members of Morlac katuns and villages under the Ottoman governance are almost without exception documented in Šibenik’s notarial and communal documents not only by their given and family names (and/or patronymic), but also by the label “Morlac” (Morlachus, Morlacho) or, more rarely, “Vlach” (Vlachus, Valacho), while the registry books of Šibenik give the ethnonym of “Molos” (Molossus). Contrary to that, Christian merchants from the Ottoman cities, most of whom were, judging from the preserved notarial records, coming to Šibenik from Skradin, Drniš, Knin, and Banja Luka, were not especially or additionally identified as Morlacs. Some of them are mentioned only by their given and family names. During the period in question, one can also observe an increased number of Morlac immigrants. Individual, temporary or permanent migrations of Morlacs to the Šibenik area were mostly related to army service, servant job, or contracting “mixed” marriages. On the basis of analysed sources, one may conclude that the most prominent destinations for the Morlac migrants included Šibenik’s suburb of Varoš (Vrtovi), Vrpolje, and Jadrtovac (a castrum of the Andreis family). These were also the three crucial defence points of Šibenik’s mainland, if one excludes the guarding posts scattered all over the numerous hills. The Morlac migrants mostly came from settlements in the vicinity of the Šibenik-Ottoman border. They belonged to the communities of Zagora, Petrovo Polje, Miljevci, and Cetina, with which the citizens of Šibenik were generally in good relations, especially when it came to trade. It is from the same area that large groups of refuges would colonize the Šibenik area during the Cretan and Morean wars...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{thesis is}} that the modern 'financial revolution', usually dated to eighteenth century England, but far more {{properly}} to the sixteenth-century Netherlands, in terms of those institutions for both government finance (borrowing) and international finance (bills of exchange), owed its essential origins to the impediments of Church and State that reached their harmful fruition in the later thirteenth and early fourteenth century. The major obstacle {{that came from the}} Church was of course the usury doctrine, and more accurately the final evolution of this doctrine in Scholastic theology and canon law, along with the intensification of the campaign against usury in the thirteenth century. The major obstacles that the State provided, with the spreading stain of ever more disruptive international warfare from the 1290 s, was the development of nationalistic bullionist philosophies and of monetary-fiscal policies (to finance warfare) that hindered the international flow of specie in later medieval Europe. For public borrowing, one must begin with the contentious policies of Venice, Florence, and other Italian city states in basing their finances on forced loans, which did pay interest, and thus with the usury controversies that erupted, over not just the loans, but the sale of interest-bearing <b>debt</b> <b>certificates</b> in secondary markets. The alternative solution, found elsewhere - first in Flemish towns from the 1270 s [...] and one that would govern European public finance up to the nineteenth century, was to raise funds for urban governments through the sale of rentes, for one or more lifetimes (lijfrenten, erfelijkrenten). These were not loans, and hence they were not usurious, because the buyer of rentes had no expectation of repayment (unless the government chose to redeem them); instead they represented the purchase of a future stream of income, either lifetime or perpetual (heritable). Those rentiers who sought to regain some part of their invested capital had only one recourse: to seek out buyers in secondary markets. The true efficiency of modern public finance also rested upon the development of such markets and thus upon the development of full-fledged negotiablity; and public finance also depends upon satisfactory instruments to permit low risk, low cost international remittances. The solution to both problems lay {{in the development of the}} negotiable bill of exchange. Such bills, at first non-negotiable, emerged in the late thirteenth century as a response to circumvent not only the usury doctrine (to 'disguise' interest payments in the exchange rate) but also the almost universal bans on bullion exports. Yet another barrier that medieval English merchants faced was the virtual absence of deposit-banking because of the crown's strict monopoly on the coinage and money supply, so that the usual origin of such banking, in private money-changing, was unavailable. Although English merchants sought remedies by using transferable commercial bills, they were not truly negotiable, for they had no legal standing in Common Law courts. But from the late thirteenth century, the Crown was incorporating the then evolving international Law Merchant into statutory law, and it also established law merchant courts, which did give such financial instruments some legal standing. In 1437, a London law-merchant court was the first, in Europe, to establish the principle that the bearer of a bill of exchange, on its maturity, had full rights to sue the 'acceptor' or payer, on whom it was drawn, for full payment and to receive compensation for damages. From that precedent, and then from those provided by similar law-merchant court verdicts in Antwerp and Bruges (1507, 1527), the Estates General of the Habsburg Low Countries (1537 - 1541) produced Europe's first national legislation to ensure the full legal requirements of true negotiability - including the right to sue intervening assignees to whom bills had been transferred in payment. These Estates-General also legalized interest payments (up to 12 %), thus permitting open discounting, another obviously essential feature of modern finance, private and public. Antwerp itself, with the foundation of its Bourse in 1531, became the international financial capital of Europe, especially as a secondary market in national rentes - the very instrument that became the foundation of English public finance, in the form of annuities, from the 1690 s. ...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{thesis of}} this article is that the {{essential}} origins of the modern ‘financial revolution’ were the late-medieval responses, civic and mercantile, to financial impediments from both Church and State, concerning the usury doctrine, that reached their harmful fruition in the later thirteenth and early fourteenth century. That ‘financial revolution’, in terms of those national institutions for government borrowing and international finance, involving negotiable securities, in the form of annuities or rentes, and bills of exchange, is generally thought to have originated in eighteenth century England; but as James Tracy has earlier shown it first took place, on a fully national basis, in the sixteenth-century Habsburg Netherlands.

When a bank finances the purchase of a ship, the borrower has to execute a ship mortgage in favour of the bank. By definition, a ship mortgage is a security over the ship which enables the bank, on default by the borrower, to take possession of the ship and sell it to discharge the debt. In order to enforce the ship mortgage, the bank may ask a maritime court to arrest the ship and, through judicial procedure, sell or auction it. This paper comparatively explores the legal and practical issues regarding the nature and the enforcement of ship mortgages in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. When a bank finances the purchase of a ship, the borrower has to execute a ship mortgage in favour of the bank. By definition, a ship mortgage is a security over the ship which enables the bank, on default by the borrower, to take possession of the ship and sell it to discharge the debt. In order to enforce the ship mortgage, the bank may ask a maritime court to arrest the ship and, through judicial procedure, sell or auction it. Ownerships and mortgages of ships may be registered with any registries located in jurisdictions such as Panama, Liberia, Bahamas, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands. These registries are {{often referred to as the}} “flags of convenience”. As these countries depend significantly on income from shipping, they open their registers to non-nationals. Anyone can register a ship on one of these open registers, and a link between the nationals of the flag state and the ship is not required (1). On the other hand, a ship is a highly mobile vehicle of carriage. It may not return to its home base nor visit the same port again. It is a well-established international shipping practice that ship mortgages can be enforced world-wide, regardless of where the mortgages are registered. This paper comparatively explores the legal and practical issues as regards the nature and the enforcement of ship mortgages in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The introduction of laws on ship mortgages and registration were prompted by the China’s need to purchase more vessels and obtain shipping finance through various finance structure such as equity, debt or charters that are consistent with international standards. In fact, most major shipping companies in China expand their fleets by adopting these types of financing structures or arrangements. The Rules of the People’s Republic of China Governing Registration of Ships came into force on 1 st January 1995 (the Registration Rules). Under the Registration Rules, the following ships shall be registered: ships owned by citizens of the PRC whose residence or principal places of business are located within the territory thereof; ships owned by enterprises with legal person status established under the laws of the PRC and whose principal places of business are located within the territory thereof, provided that if foreign investment is involved, the proportion of registered capital contributed by Chinese investors shall not be less than 50 %; public service ships of the PRC Government and ships owned by institutions with legal person status; and other ships whose registration is deemed necessary by the competent authority of harbour superintendency of the PRC. The Bureau of Harbour Superintendency is the competent authority in charge of the registration of ships, but the Ship Registration Administration (situated at various ports) is the agency in control of actual registration. Before registration can occur, the Harbour Superintendency requires submission of proper documentation (2). Having examined and verified the application for registration of ownership, the Ship Registration Administration shall issue to the shipowner whose application meets the requirements of the Rules, a Certificate of Registration of Ship’s Ownership and a Certificate of Ship’s Nationality. Where mortgage is established with respect to a ship of 20 tons gross tonnage or over, the mortgagee and the mortgagor shall apply to register it with the Ship Registration Administration (3) to obtain a Certificate of Registration of Ship Mortgage. Where two or more mortgages have been established on the same ship, the authority will make the registration in sequence of dates on which the applications were registered, and indicate the respective dates in the register of ships. Special provisions covering the making of commercial loans also exist. Thus, a Chinese shipping company wishing to borrow foreign currencies in its own name directly from a foreign entity for the purpose of purchasing vessels, must first seek approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). This is governed by the Administration of Borrowing of International Commercial Loans by Domestic Organisations Procedures promulgated by SAFE in 1997. Under the laws, all international commercial loans (4) require SAFE approval or risk being declared void. In addition, all international commercial loans must be registered with SAFE which will then issue a Foreign <b>Debt</b> Registration <b>Certificate,</b> to be presented to authorised banks. This will enable borrowers to open foreign exchange bank accounts and undertake procedures for remitting foreign exchange abroad. Bearing in mind that some overseas lenders may be reluctant to take a mortgage over a vessel under the PRC flag, there has been a recent tendency for domestic shipping enterprises wishing to avoid the red tape of the above procedures, to set up subsidiaries in developed maritime countries such as Liberia and Panama. Under such schemes, loans are advanced to these subsidiaries for the purchase of ships, but once the transactions are completed, both the ownership and mortgages must be registered with the appropriate Liberian or Panamanian authorities. The offshore subsidiaries may then charter the ships back to their mother companies in China (5). As part of the transaction, the Liberian or Panamanian shipowners must also assign all their rights and benefits (e. g. assignment of insurance proceeds, charter, sub-charter and freight) in favour of the overseas lender as security. When a foreign mortgagee enforces his foreign registered mortgage in China, the law of the flag state (not Chinese Law) shall apply to the mortgage of the ship (6). It is speculated that this strategy will continue to dominate the market of ship financing in the PRC, unless the relevant authorities relax the control of foreign exchange. Although cutting down on the red tape, the SAFE may not be entirely excluded from these proceedings, as the overseas financial institutions involved may require guarantees from the parent companies in China for the loans advanced to their overseas subsidiaries in addition to taking mortgages of the ships. Assignment by the Chinese companies, the bareboat charter, rights in relation to the various insurances of the ship, and the sub-charter freight may also be regarded as guarantees which require SAFE approval. Under the Rules Governing Guarantees, only qualified financial institutions authorised by the central government can provide guarantees to foreign lenders for foreign debts. Government departments and unincorporated institutions cannot issue guarantees for foreign debts. Any subsequent amendment to the principal loan agreement shall be subject to the consent of the guarantor and to the approval of SAFE...|$|R
