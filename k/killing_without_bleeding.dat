40|$|Introduction: Endometrial polyps, submucous myomas, {{hyperplasia}} endometrium and {{endometrial cancer}} can proceed with or <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> {{or any other}} symptoms. All diseases can coexist with or lead to endometrial cancer. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the usefulness of transvaginal sonography in the diagnosis of asymptomatic diseases in the uterus cavity in correlation with time after the last menstrual period. Material and methods: 59 postmenopausal women (min 1 year after menopause), <b>without</b> uterine <b>bleeding,</b> non HRT users, referred for hysteroscopy or D&C because of abnormal transvaginal sonography. Results: Average endometrium thickness in normal histopathology results was 8. 8 ± 4. 5 mm (median 8) and was lower than in women with abnormal results (12. 7 ± 3. 4 mm (median 13)) (p 0. 05). In a subgroup of 18 women after more than 14 years after menopause, the average endometrium thickness in normal histopathology results was 8. 9 ± 5. 2 mm and in abnormal results it was 12. 3 ± 3. 0 mm (p > 0. 05). Conclusions: Usefulness of transvaginal sonography in the diagnosis of uterus cavity pathology in women <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> after menopause is higher until 5 years after menopause. Frequency of different pathologies existing in the uterus cavity depends on time since the last menstrual period. Endometrial thickness of up to 8 mm, as a single symptom in postmenopausal women <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> should be an indication for control TV ultrasound only. No histology is required...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes {{solutions}} of {{the flow}} through three inlet/diffuser configurations with terminal shock systems are reported. Calculations <b>without</b> <b>bleed</b> indicate that the terminal shock location is very sensitive to the outflow back pressure. For cases {{where there are no}} available experimental results, it becomes difficult to estimate the back pressure that will result in a terminal shock. Estimates based on quasi-one-dimensional analysis are not found adequate for complex two-dimensional flows. It is found that since the flow downstream of the terminal shock is subsonic, and what happens at the outflow boundary affects the flow inside the inlet, enough of the subsonic diffuser must be modeled to accurately predict the terminal shock region. The diffuser portion should be fairly long with the outflow boundary occurring in a region of more or less uniform flow to be able to prescribe a uniform back pressure. The third configuration studied was investigated with and <b>without</b> incorporating <b>bleed</b> in the code. It is found that the use of bleed stabilizes the shock location and allows solutions which <b>without</b> <b>bleed</b> result in unstarting of the inlet.

40|$|Although {{bleeding}} is {{a common}} complication of surgery, routine laboratory tests have been demonstrated to have a low ability to predict perioperative bleeding. Better understanding of hemostatic function during surgery would lead to identification of high-risk patients for bleeding. Here, we aimed to elucidate hemostatic mechanisms to determine perioperative bleeding. We prospectively enrolled 104 patients undergoing cervical spinal surgery <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> diathesis. Blood sampling was performed just before the operation. Volumes of perioperative blood loss were compared {{with the results of}} detailed laboratory tests assessing primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis, and fibrinolysis. Platelet aggregations induced by several agonists correlated with each other, and only two latent factors determined inter-individual difference. Platelet aggregability independently determined perioperative bleeding. We also identified low levels of plasminogen-activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and α 2 -plasmin inhibitor to be independent risk factors for intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, respectively. Most important independent factor to determine postoperative bleeding was body weight. Of note, obese patients with low levels of PAI- 1 became high-risk patients for bleeding during surgery. Our data suggest that bleeding after surgical procedure may be influenced by inter-individual differences of hemostatic function including platelet function and fibrinolysis, even in the patients <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> diathesis...|$|R

40|$|Tracheostomy in {{intensive}} care unit patients can be performed <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> complications in case of normal thromboelastometry results (EXTEM CT) despite increased PT-INR: a prospective pilot study Miroslav Durila 1 *, Pavel Lukáš 1, Marta Astraverkhava 1, Jan Beroušek 1, Michal Zábrodský 2 and Tomáš Vymazal 1 Background: Coagulopathy is often accompanied by prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) in septic and nonseptic patients {{in intensive}} care unit (ICU). The conventional way to correct the coagulopathy is to administer fresh frozen plasma (FFP) before invasive procedures to minimise the risk of bleeding. However, prolonged PT can be present even in hypercoagulation status, resulting in unnecessary administration of FFP. In the present study, we have assessed the reliability of thromboelastometry in case of prolonged PT and the relationship to bleeding complications during surgical tracheostomy. Methods: The study was conducted during the period between April 2013 and April 2014 in patients undergoing surgical tracheostomy. Coagulation status was assessed using PT, and the status was reassessed by thromboelastometry for prolonged PT. Tracheostomy was performed in patients with normal thromboelastometry results without administering FFP. Results: Tracheostomy was performed in total 119 patients. Normal value of PT as measured by international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1. 2 was found in 64 (54 %) patients, while prolonged INR> 1. 2 was found in 55 (46 %) patients. Patients with INR ≥ 1. 3 (with INR min- 1. 3, max- 1. 84, and median- 1. 48) were further analysed by thromboelastometry. Despite prolonged INR, thromboelastometry results were in normal ranges in all cases except one. With normal thromboelastometry, tracheostomy was performed safely <b>without</b> any <b>bleeding</b> complication. Conclusions: Surgical tracheostomy in septic and nonseptic patients can be performed <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> complications in case of normal thromboelastometry results (EXTEM CT) despite increased PT-INR.

40|$|Abstract Background Fluid {{resuscitation}} during {{cardiac surgery}} is common with significant variability in clinical practice. Our {{goal was to}} investigate current practice patterns of fluid volume expansion in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries in the USA. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 124 cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and perfusionists. Survey questions were designed to assess clinical decision-making patterns of intravenous (IV) fluid utilization in cardiovascular surgery for five types of patients who need volume expansion: (1) patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) <b>without</b> <b>bleeding,</b> (2) patients undergoing CPB with bleeding, (3) patients undergoing acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH), (4) patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or use of a ventricular assist device (VAD), and (5) patients undergoing either off-pump {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (OPCABG) surgery or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). First-choice fluid used in fluid boluses for these five patient types was requested. Descriptive statistics were performed using Kruskal-Wallis test and follow-up tests, including t tests, to evaluate differences among respondent groups. Results The most commonly preferred indicators of volume status were blood pressure, urine output, cardiac output, central venous pressure, and heart rate. The first choice of fluid for patients needing volume expansion during CPB <b>without</b> <b>bleeding</b> was crystalloids, whereas 5 % albumin was the most preferred first choice of fluid for bleeding patients. For volume expansion during ECMO or VAD, the respondents were equally likely to prefer 5 % albumin or crystalloids as a first choice of IV fluid, with 5 % albumin being the most frequently used adjunct fluid to crystalloids. Surgeons, as a group, more often chose starches as an adjunct fluid to crystalloids for patients needing volume expansion during CPB <b>without</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Surgeons {{were also more likely to}} use 25 % albumin as an adjunct fluid than were anesthesiologists. While most perfusionists reported using crystalloids to prime the CPB circuit, one third preferred a mixture of 25 % albumin and crystalloids. Less interstitial edema and more sustained volume expansion were considered the most important colloid traits in volume expansion. Conclusions Fluid utilization practice patterns in the USA varied depending on patient characteristics and clinical specialties of health care professionals...|$|R
