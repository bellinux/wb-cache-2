5|$|On the November 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, {{and asked him}} whether or not <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to be fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the main plot was {{inspired}} by a scene from the novel Sometimes a Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E

5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> essential {{to the future of}} the firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
5|$|Yusef {{continues}} to manipulate Zainab, {{to the point}} of becoming violent with her. Yusef then tries to encourage Zainab to move to Pakistan, and recruits Amira to manipulate Syed with the same idea. As Zainab starts to disrespect his wishes, Yusef slaps her and apologises as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to lose her. Yusef meets up with Tariq and offers him his daughter's restaurant. Upon discovering that the restaurant doesn't belong to Yusef, he reveals to Afia that Yusef started the fire involving Zainab. Afia then tells Yusef she knows he started the fire and threatens to tell Zainab if he does not do so first. Yusef admits to Zainab that he started the fire and kicks him out of the house, she later forgives Yusef however. Yusef and Zainab then marry.|$|E
25|$|The Stockholms {{navigating}} officer misread his radar {{thinking he was}} on a 15-mile setting when in reality the radar was set for 5miles. Thus, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> farther from the Andrea Doria than he actually was. He also failed to consult his captain as was required by regulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{distress}} that Relativism {{causes the}} classical physicist {{lies in its}} ambiguity; it does not deny that truth exists, but it does deny that truth can be comprehended (which, for the scientist, amounts to the same thing). The scientist’s white lab-coat <b>is</b> soiled; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> part of the experiment. Just as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reaching shore (or so <b>he</b> <b>thought),</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> tossed back into the primeval soup.|$|R

25|$|On 11 February 2007 Maher was criticised by South Australian cricket captain Darren Lehmann for not declaring {{to make a}} game {{of their}} Pura Cup match at the Gabba. Lehmann said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> playing Tasmania {{referring}} to Tasmania's reliance on final day run chases.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{has been}} variously classified as an involuntary manslaughter since the officer later claimed <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> using his taser gun. On January 30, 2010, Alameda County prosecutors charged Mehserle with murder for the shooting. He resigned his position, and pleaded not guilty. The trial began on June 10, 2010. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle {{was found guilty}} of involuntary manslaughter and not guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.|$|E
25|$|His {{ultimate}} {{departure from}} the scientific scene in 1675 can also be attributed to his religiosity. Perhaps due {{to the influence of}} Antoinette Bourignon, Swammerdam came to believe that his scientific work was no longer in the service of God. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> conducting investigations into the natural world merely to satisfy his own curiosity. As a result, he subjected himself to the tutelage of Bourignon and, for the most part, renounced scientific study.|$|E

25|$|For some time, Silvio Berlusconi had {{challenged}} Romano Prodi to {{a debate}} on national television. Prodi, however, said he would accept only if certain rules had been set. Possibly because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> behind in the polls, Berlusconi saw the debate {{as a chance to}} turn the tables, and accused Prodi of fleeing from him. It is notable that, in the 2001 elections, it was Berlusconi who refused to meet the centre-left candidate, Francesco Rutelli.|$|E
25|$|Upon Elizabeth's {{death in}} 1830, Monroe moved to New York City {{to live with}} his {{daughter}} Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur who had married Samuel L. Gouverneur in the White House. Monroe's health began to slowly fail {{by the end of the}} 1820s and John Quincy Adams visited him there in April 1831. Adams found him alert and eager to discuss the situation in Europe, but in ill health. Adams cut the visit short when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> tiring Monroe.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} from World War I, Crosby attended Harvard {{in the spring}} of 1919 under an accelerated program for veterans. He took 19 courses, six in French (which he read and spoke fluently) and six in English literature. The remainder of his courses were in fine arts, music, Spanish, and social ethics. Taking his studies very lightly, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to fail, and paid a knowledgeable man who was familiar with what questions would be asked on the exams to tutor him. He graduated with a BA in 1921.|$|E

But the couple's relationship worsened gradually so that Bourguiba decided {{to sleep in}} his friends' rooms at the campus. On April 9, 1927, Mathilde {{gave birth to a}} boy they named Jean Habib Bourguiba. After that, the couple moved out to settle in Bagneux, a French suburb, in a room used both as bedroom and dining room. Bourguiba, although sick, had to prepare for his final exams, which he sat a month after the birth of his son. He finally obtained a bachelor's degree in law and the higher degree of political studies from the Paris Institute of Political Studies.|$|E
25|$|After his collegiate career, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL drafted Unitas in {{the ninth}} round. However, Unitas was {{released}} before the season began as the odd man out among four quarterbacks trying to fill three spots. Steelers Head Coach Walt Kiesling had {{made up his mind}} about Unitas; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not smart enough to quarterback an NFL team, and Unitas was not given any snaps in practice with the Steelers. Among those edging out Unitas was Ted Marchibroda, future longtime NFL head coach. Out of pro football, Unitas—by this time married—worked in construction in Pittsburgh to support his family. On the weekends, he played quarterback, safety and punter on a local semi-professional team called the Bloomfield Rams for $6 a game.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many memorable moments during the main events, {{including}} Jack Straus's 1982 comeback win after discovering he had one $500 chip left when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out of the tournament. The end of the 1988 main event was featured in the movie Rounders. Chris Moneymaker and Greg Raymer, the winners in 2003 and 2004, both qualified for the main event through satellite tournaments at the PokerStars online card room. Jerry Yang, the winner in 2007, had only been playing poker for two years prior to his victory. He won his seat at a $225 satellite tournament at Pechanga Resort & Casino, in California. With passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) of 2006 online poker sites have been barred from purchasing entrance directly for their users.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{was born}} on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, to an Italian father, Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894–1967), and an Italian-American mother, Angela Crocetti (née Barra; 1899–1966). They were married in 1914. His father, who was a barber, was {{originally}} from Montesilvano, in Abruzzo, and his maternal grandparents' origins {{are believed to be}} also from Abruzzo, although it is not clearly known. Martin had an older brother named William Alfonso Crocetti (1916-1968). Martin's first language was an Abruzzese dialect of Italian, and he did not speak English until he started school at the age of five. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his broken English. He later took up the drums as a hobby as a teenager. Martin then dropped out of Steubenville High School in the 10th grade because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> smarter than his teachers. He bootlegged liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill, and boxed as a welterweight.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 the American Chess Congress {{started work}} on drawing up {{regulations}} {{for the future}} conduct of world championship contests. Steinitz supported this endeavor, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> becoming too old to remain world champion. The proposal evolved through many forms (as Steinitz pointed out, such a project had never been undertaken before), and resulted in the New York 1889 tournament to select a challenger for Steinitz, rather like the more recent Candidates Tournaments. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws; and neither wanted to play a match against Steinitz – Chigorin had just lost to him, and Weiss {{wanted to get back}} to his work for the Rothschild Bank. The third prizewinner Isidore Gunsberg was prepared to play Steinitz for the title in New York, and Steinitz won their match in 1890–91. This experiment was not repeated and the 1894 match in which Steinitz lost his title was a private arrangement between the players.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Last Man Standing match between Shane McMahon and Kane. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Kane was forced to unmask himself after he had lost a Mask vs. Title match to Triple H. Shortly after Kane unmasked himself, Kane turned on and chokeslammed his tag team partner Rob Van Dam. Three weeks later on the July 14 episode of Raw, during an {{interview}} between Kane and Jim Ross, Kane set Jim Ross on fire after <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mocking him. The following week on Raw, after a match between Kane and Van Dam ended in a no-contest, Linda McMahon came out to try and stop Kane from attacking Van Dam. Kane, however, gave Linda McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ramp. On the July 28 episode of Raw, Shane McMahon made a surprise appearance by attacking Kane for his actions the week before. The next week on Raw, Eric Bischoff defeated Shane McMahon after Kane interfered and gave McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ring steps. On August 24 at SummerSlam, Kane defeated Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match, and Shane McMahon defeated Eric Bischoff in a No Disqualification Falls Count Anywhere match. The following night on Raw, during a match between Shane McMahon and Chris Jericho, Kane interfered and performed a chokeslam on McMahon. Shortly afterwards, McMahon superkicked Kane into a dumpster that was on fire and full of gasoline. On the September 8 episode of Raw, Bischoff announced that McMahon and Kane would face {{each other in a}} Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven. The next week on Raw, after both men signed a contract for their match at Unforgiven, McMahon gave Kane multiple low blows, followed by a Leap of Faith through an announce table.|$|E
