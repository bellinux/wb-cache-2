This dissertation is an even study on market reaction around the implementation of QFII. The author find there is no significant abnormal returns in the whole market within the short-term period, 3 months after implementation; negative abnormal returns followed the implementation. Also, there are no significant abnormal returns in the long-term period. These insignificant results implied that investors were taken a wait-and-see attitude and lack of confidence on stock market liberalization. Moreover, the findings is partly comply with the prediction of international asset pricing models, it suggested the scheme may not help much in reducing the cost of equity capital and risk premium of Chinese companies.

5000|$|The amended {{version of}} the Catalan Statute prompts the State to allot {{investments}} in Catalonia according to Catalonia's own percentage contribution to the total Spanish GDP. The Autonomy Statute of Andalusia, a region that contributes less to Spain's GDP than the region of Catalonia contributes, requires it in turn to allocate state investments in proportion to its population (it is the largest Spanish Autonomous Community in terms of population). These requirements are legally binding, as they are enacted as part of Autonomy Statutes, which rank only below the Constitution itself. It is self-evident that, should all autonomous communities be allowed to establish their particular financing models upon the State, the total may add {{up to more than}} 100% and that would be inviable.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to discuss the {{possibility}} of using an interregional dual programming model in the central planning for regional development. First, a direct two-period interregional model has been presented and then that model has been used for constructing its dual. As a result of solving the dual of an interregional programming model one obtained the following dual variables (accounting prices) : regional prices for commodities, transportation services, manpower, valuations on restrictions concerning production increases, old production facilities, national <b>investment</b> <b>quotas,</b> export to and import from particular foreign markets. These accounting prices point to the directions of changes in the free terms of constraints where one could find an improvement to the objective function. Therefore they are of paramount importance to the planner. The article contains a detailed review of factors which determine the regional differentiation of accounting prices and a survey of possibilities how to equalize them in space. In the author's view the only possibility to eliminate regional differences in accounting prices exists with respect to mobile resources, particularly to the labour force.

The analysis reveals that quota is undervalued in the border, midlands and west and south-west regions, while milk quota is overvalued in the east and south regions. This implies that farmers in certain regions overpay for additional quota, while other farmers secure good value for their <b>quota</b> <b>investments.</b> The paper concludes by discussing that the identified regional differences are only partly explained by economic and production factors. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In this study, I analyse {{what drives}} {{investment}} and capital development, {{and hence the}} development of fishing capacity in a well-managed fishery. An empirical analysis of drivers of firm-level investment in the Norwegian purse seine fishery is conducted. The industry is regulated by tradable production quotas that entitles the holder to a certain share of the total allowable catches of various pelagic species. Considerable investment in physical capital {{has taken place in}} the industry over the last decade, and the fleet has realised large resource rents. Both quotas and physical capital are crucial to the operation of the firm. For this reason a multiple capital good model is used in the analysis. The empirical results suggest that few economic variables significantly affect firm-level investment in the fishery. Firm-specific effects are, however, found to be important determinants of <b>investment,</b> particularly in <b>quota.</b> Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that when introducing transferrable quotas, auctioning may be superior to grandfathering, as firms otherwise may not take the full opportunity cost of the quota into account...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Concerns about declining {{stock and}} {{profitability}} in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry {{led to the}} introduction of individual transferable quota (ITQ) management in 1998. In this study, fisher groups were categorised by effort and quota ownership traits to examine response to revised management, and how profit drivers moderated this change. The number of investors who are not active fishers has steadily grown with a commensurate expansion of the lease quota market. The number of lease dependent fishers has remained steady through time while quota owner fishers have declined. In contrast to many other ITQ fisheries, the investor group has not consolidated into a small number of entities and there is little processor involvement. This was a result of fisheries rules explicitly designed to retain benefits of diverse ownership though a cap on the maximum allowed number of quota units per legal entity. Three categories of active fishers participate in the lease trade. Quota-transferring fishers lease quota both in and out, usually to secure access to quota {{at the start of the}} season with surplus quota being leased off later. Large-scale, lease quota dependent fishers have increased through time and are characterised by high fishing effort and high annual turnover but low profit per unit of fish. Small-scale lease quota dependent fishers utilise capital less fully and have less capacity to survive in the long run. These small scale lease fishers face barriers to entry into the large scale category through high upfront capital investment costs, which could hamper industry renewal. Potential issues for management that arise from lease-reliant fishers are (i) that their higher financial stress increases compliance risk and (ii) their lack of <b>investment</b> in <b>quota</b> assets reduces incentive for stewardship of the resource...|$|R
40|$|The Tasmanian rock lobster {{industry}} has been managed by Individually Transferable Quotas (ITQs) and several input control measures since 1998. In this study, nine years of rock lobster fishing business data were used to categorise the catch and quota ownership traits and examine {{the response to the}} introduction of ITQ management. More specifically the study investigates how profit drivers moderated industry structure change. Owners who are not active fishers (investors) have steadily grown in number with a commensurate expansion of the lease quota market. A cap on the maximum allowed number of quota units per legal entity of 200 units (around 2 % of the total) was implemented at the start of ITQ management and this has proven effective in the maintenance of diverse ownership with little processor control. Active fishers who lease in quota (lease dependent fishers) took {{a large proportion of the}} total catch in 2007. An economic pressure to expand lease operations was identified, which accrued through better utilisation of capital. The pressure to increase in size through leasing in quota exists for businesses with small holdings. In contrast, as ownership of quota increased to approximately 30 units, the marginal profitability of fishers increased through the opposite process, that is, reducing fishing activity and supplementing income by leasing out quota. Income supplementing appears to be a transitional state, and in time these quota owners will move to the more stable state of "investor". Thus the fishery is trending towards a smaller number of highly active lease fishers with units supplied by a broad group of investors. Lease fishers need to move into the large-scale category catching at least 75 units to achieve a normal economic profit and remain viable in the long run. However, they face barriers to entry to this large catch category through high upfront capital investment costs. Other potential issues for management that arise are that their higher financial stress increases compliance risk and their lack of <b>investment</b> in <b>quota</b> assets reduces incentive for stewardship of the resource.

40|$|New Zealand as a {{geographically}} isolated country, {{with few}} natural resources, {{has always been}} highly dependent on trade for her economic prosperity. This has meant that New Zealand has been particularly vulnerable to "external shocks. " How New Zealand has responded to this vulnerability has, however, varied across time. From the 1930 s onwards, policy-makers sought to insulate the domestic economy from external pressures through controls over imports, overseas investment, prices and wages. This had created by the 1980 s a "for-tress New Zealand" - {{one of the most}} regulated economies among OECD members. The Labour Government elected in 1984 sought to break down the wall of the fortress with the introduction of a raft of deregulatory and liberalisation measure. Tariffs were eliminated or drastically reduced; restrictions on foreign <b>investment</b> were relaxed; <b>quotas</b> were removed; the financial markets were deregulated. This now made New Zealand's economy one of the most open among OECD members. The expectation of the market liberalisers was that exposure to overseas competition would increase the efficiency of domestic producers. It is true that some New Zealand firms are now very competitive players in world export markets. However, if this is seen as a beneficial consequence of economic openness, there have been many adverse consequences for New Zealand such as the increase in foreign control of assets and the growth of an unskilled, low-paid workforce and all the implications this has for the standard of living of a large number if New Zealanders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. ITQ {{introduction}} has {{had several}} effects on fisheries in terms of, for example, {{changes in the}} composition of the fishing fleet and fishing efficiency gains. After ITQ introduction in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry in 1998, an increasing number of fishers have become dependent on quota leasing to catch fish (Putten van and Gardner Accepted). At the same time quota owners who lease out their entire quota, increasingly characterises the fishery. The economic, social and cultural implications of structural changes observed in ITQ fisheries around the world (Eythórsson 2000) also apply in Tasmania, although the particulars of these developments vary. Changes in the Tasmanian industry are also observed in terms of the characteristics of the lease quota market and market participants. Brokers have an increasingly important role in trading lease quota thereby reducing the number of personal interactions. The role of processors in the lease quota market is also pertinent {{not only in terms of}} price developments but also in market interactions and dependencies. The change in market relationships and connections, in parallel with increasing dependence on lease quota by a large component of the industry, may be particularly relevant as strong social connections characterise this fishery. In this research, social networks in the quota lease market of the ITQ managed Tasmanian rock lobster fisheries are analysed. Changes in lease quota trade networks and network characteristics proceeding quota introduction in 1998 are analysed. The economic characteristics of different lease quota fisher types are also considered in this context. Network parameters indicate that the lease quota market can be represented by a scale-free network. Over time the market has become more strongly dependent on internal networks, in particular processors who take on the roles of pseudo brokers to ensure fisher loyalty. The change in network structure of the lease quota market indicates that a small number of quota owner investors and processor quota redistributors appear to be in an increasingly powerful position in this market. This development is surprising because disproportionate quota ownership by processor, as observed in many other ITQ managed fisheries, has been averted in Tasmania. Processor control in the lease market cannot be gained by purchasing quota due to a successful input control where quota ownership by one legal entity was capped. Because market control cannot be gained through <b>investment</b> in <b>quota,</b> it has been gained by virtue of redistributing lease quota...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To analyse the {{strategy}} used by British American Tobacco (BAT) to re-enter the Chinese market from 1979 to 2000 after historically dominating the market before the 1950 s. Design: Analysis of tobacco industry document files to date available only on-site at the Guildford Depository operated by BAT. An additional search of recent {{documents related to}} BAT, placed in the Minnesota Depository, was also carried out. Results: BAT has been committed to regaining its historically dominant position in China since the country reopened to foreign companies in 1979. Initially, BAT remained cautious relative to competitors in seeking joint ventures, finding market access hindered by bureaucratic complexity, restrictions on foreign <b>investment</b> and imports <b>quotas,</b> and later an advertising ban. Instead, the documents suggest BAT strongly relied on illegal imports to expand market presence of State Express 555 and other key brands. It was only when risks to contraband sales increased that the company made greater efforts to establish a legal presence in the country. Attempts to stress {{the long history of}} BAT in China and a proclaimed commitment to corporate social responsibility have been used to facilitate later negotiations. Conclusion: China has remained relatively closed to transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) during its transition to a market economy, maintaining a firm grip over foreign investment and imports. Nonetheless, BAT has circumvented such restrictions through illegal imports and exploitation of inconsistencies in the local enforcement of advertising bans. Governments need to understand and address the full range of market entry tactics by TTCs in order to ensure effective tobacco control...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{reform of}} the {{agricultural}} policy in the EU provides totally new frame conditions for farmers. Main components of the reform are the decoupling of direct payments and particular for dairy farmers the reduction of intervention prices for milk products such as butter and SMP. The objective of this analysis is to develop strategies for dairy farmers considering the initial situation of four typical farm sizes at different productivity levels, debt-to-equity ratios and risk attitudes. The uncertainty of the price development for milk itself {{as well as for}} milk quotas will be covered using Monte Carlo simulations. Due to decreasing intervention prices profitability of milk production is endangered in most dairy farms and the values of assets will decrease. For most low to medium efficient dairy farms it was found, that selling the cow herd and the reference quantity immediately would yield highest values for net worth. If the current favourable situation for selling the reference quantity is missed, continual production would be better. For the remaining dairy farms it is most important to uncover all resources to improve efficiency by reducing production costs and increasing milk yields. These farmers can wait with further <b>investments</b> until milk <b>quota</b> prices have settled on the expected lower level. Only high efficient dairy farmers, normally with higher milk yields and the advantage of econo-mies of scale can get profit from further milk production. The micro economic analysis derived from the typical farms concludes that quota is not longer limiting factor in all regions {{as long as there is}} still surplus of milk in EU and prices for dairy products on world markets are relatively low.
