These data show the flux of meteoroids capable of producing infrasound at the ground is at least 1 /month and is limited to meteors with peak visual brightness above – 2. Comparisons to current meteor <b>infra-sound</b> theory show excellent agreement with amplitude and period predictions for weakly non-linear shock waves using a realistic vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. Similar predictions show isothermal assumptions underestimate the amplitude by orders of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of avalanches with seismic signals {{is an important}} task. For risk mitigation, estimating remotely avalanche activity by means of seismic signals is a good alternative to direct observations that are often limited by visual conditions and observer’s availability. In seismology, the main challenge is to discriminate avalanche signals within the natural earth seismic activity and background noise. Some anthropogenic low frequency (<b>infra-sound)</b> sources like helicopters also generate seismic signals. In order to characterize an avalanche seismic signal, a 3 -axis broad band seismometer (Guralp 3 T) has been set-up on a real scale avalanche test site in Lautaret (France). The sensor is located in proximity of 2 avalanche paths where avalanches can be artificially released. Preliminary results of seismic records are presented, correlated with avalanche physical parameters (volume released, velocity, energy) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElastic wave on {{seafloor}} {{caused by}} low frequency noise radiated from ship is called ship seismic wave {{which can be}} used to identify ship target. In order to analyze the wave components and the propagating properties of ship seismic wave, the numerical calculation of synthetic seismograms on seafloor aroused by a low frequency point sound source is carried out using a wave number integration technique combined with inverse Fourier transform. According to the numerical example of hard seafloor, the time series of seismic wave on seafloor are mostly composed of interface waves and normal mode waves. Each normal mode wave has a well-defined low cut-off frequency, while the interface wave doesn't have. The frequency dispersion of normal mode wave is obvious when frequency is lower than 100  Hz, while the interface wave is dispersive only in the <b>infra-sound</b> frequency range. The time series of seismic wave is dominated by the interface wave when the source frequency is less than the minimal cut-off frequency of normal mode wave...|$|E
40|$|The paper gives a brief {{description}} of the principles and the uncertainty of the acoustic calibration methods that today are applied by National Metrology Institutes and calibration service centers. Even if some of the calibration principles have been applied over more than half a century, the methods and the instrumentation are still being refined in order to minimize their uncertainty, to extend their frequency ranges, to include extra parameters and to speed up slow processes. In addition to the traditional methods for microphone sensitivity and frequency response calibration, new development areas, like for example wind power, has created needs for low-frequency and <b>infra-sound</b> calibration, down to 0. 1 Hz. Other high-tech areas have lead to the development of methods for phase response comparison calibration of microphones for large arrays, for sound intensity measurement and for verification of dynamic linearity of microphones at very high sound pressure levels, up to about 174 dB that corresponds to 10 kPa...|$|E

Purpose: {{revealing}} of the physico-chemical {{peculiarities of}} converter processes with various blast supply and {{association of the}} acoustic characteristic with them; development of the control methods {{with regard to the}} acoustic characteristic. With various types of the blow, the acoustic signal is associated with the converter bath processes including those in the <b>infra-sound</b> range. The break-down phenomenon during the combination blow is studied. The expression for calculating the bottom zone length is defined more precisely. The rational acoustic control frequency range is determined and process prediction and control methods are determined for various blast supply. These methods make it possible to increase the production of good-quality metal and to enhance its quality. The conditions permitting elimination of the break-down during the combination blow are determined.

40|$|As of today, {{there exist}} no reliable, {{objective}} methods for {{early detection of}} thrombi in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (ECMO) system. Within the ECMO system, thrombi are not always fixed to a certain component or location in the circuit. Thus, clot fragments of different shapes and consistencies may circulate and give rise to vibrations and sound generation. By bedside sound measurements and additional laboratory experiments (although not detailed herein), {{we found that the}} presence of particles (clots or aggregates and fragments of clots) can be detected by analyzing the strength of <b>infra-sound</b> (< 20 Hz) modes of the spectrum near the inlet and outlet of the centrifugal pump in the ECMO circuit. For the few patients that were considered in this study, no clear false positive or negative examples were found when comparing the spectral approach with clinical observations. A laboratory setup provided insight to the flow {{in and out of the}} pump, confirming that in the presence of particles a low-amplitude low-frequency signal is strongly amplified, enabling the identification of a clot...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Possibility of detecting, {{recognizing}} and monitoring {{the location of}} marine biological species accumulations in the coastal zone using radar-acoustic system which includes parametrical sounding and receiving arrays, autonomous acoustical and hydrophysical transducers transmitting data through radio-communication channels, and coastal sector scan radars as well is considered. Specialists have been in recent years giving intent attention to problem of biological monitoring the location of marine species (MBS) accumulations in the coastal zone. The potentialities of active hydrolocation tools are restricted by r verberational interference, involving the required long-range detection handicap, and also by significant effect of sound and <b>infra-sound</b> radiation on behavioral description of MBS and on a whole ecological system. The possibility of detecting, {{recognizing and}} monitoring the MBS location by passive hydrolocation tools are restricted by high level of sea noise in the sea straits and shelf areas. The authors of numerous articles (for example, [1 - 3]), showed that the movement of MBS accumulations in water medium produced considerable changes in its structure: there were turbulent streams, its stratification discontinuity resulted from. In other words, the structure of moving MBS is contrastly inhomogeneous for acoustic (primary, secondary and combination frequencies), electromagnetic an...|$|E

The unusual animal behaviour, often observed before earthquakes in a moderate seismic area in Western Pied-mont (NW Italy), can be connected with the anomalies of some physical parameters, recorded in a multiple pa-rameters monitoring. Physical phenomena such as radioactive decay, gas emission, soil temperature increase, water pH variations in creeks and lakes, magnetic declination anomalies, air electricity and <b>infra-sound,</b> can generate damages to biological structures or, sometimes, death. A multiple parameters physical monitoring started recently in Western Piedmont, which is useful to propose the study of seismic precursors possibly linked to animal behaviour. Observations of unusual animal behaviour as vocal communications and movements were collected in the same area.

40|$|Abstract. The great Sumatra-Andaman {{earthquake}} of 26 December 2004 caused seismic waves propagating {{through the}} solid Earth, tsunami waves propagating through {{the ocean and}} infrasound or acoustic-gravity waves propa-gating through the atmosphere. Since the infrasound wave travels faster than its associated tsunami, it is for warning purposes very intriguing to study the possibility of <b>infra-sound</b> generation directly at the earthquake source. Garces et al. (2005) and Le Pichon et al. (2005) emphasized that infrasound was generated by mountainous islands near the epicenter and by tsunami propagation along the continen-tal shelf to the Bay of Bengal. Mikumo et al. (2008) con-cluded from the analysis of travel times and amplitudes of first arriving acoustic-gravity waves with periods of about 400 – 700 s that these waves are caused by coseismic motion of the sea surface mainly {{to the west of}} the Nicobar islands in the open seas. We reanalyzed the acoustic-gravity waves and corrected the first arrival times of Mikumo et al. (2008) by up to 20 min. We found the source of the first arriving acoustic-gravity wave about 300 km to the north of the US Geological Survey earthquake epicenter. This confirms the result of Mikumo et al. (2008) that sea level changes at the earthquake source cause long period acoustic-gravity waves, which indicate that a tsunami was generated. Therefore, a denser local network of infrasound stations may be helpful for tsunami warnings, not only for very large earthquakes. ...|$|E
