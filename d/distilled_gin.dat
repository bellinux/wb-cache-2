50|$|Two large {{operations}} {{dominated the}} brewing industry of 19th and 20th century Warrington, Greenalls of Wilderspool and Walkers of Winwick Road. Greenalls were also {{heavily involved in}} <b>distilling</b> <b>Gin</b> and later Vodka. Greenalls ceased brewing in 1990 and gradually refocussed on its hotel business changing {{its name to the}} De Vere Group in 2000. Former Greenalls employees founded the Coach House Brewery in 1991, whilst the historic brewery site was designated a Conservation Area and redeveloped. Walkers merged with Tetley's Brewery in 1960 to become part of Tetley Walker. The brewery closed in 1996 and is now the site of the Halliwell Jones Stadium, home of Warrington Wolves, as well as a Tesco store.|$|R

25|$|Pot <b>distilled</b> <b>gin</b> {{represents}} the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single <b>distilled</b> <b>gin</b> or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E
2500|$|Compound gin is made {{by simply}} {{flavouring}} neutral spirits with essences or other [...] "natural flavourings" [...] without redistillation, and is not as highly regarded as <b>distilled</b> <b>gin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Column <b>distilled</b> <b>gin</b> evolved {{following}} {{the invention of}} the Coffey still, and is produced by first distilling high proof (e.g. 96% ABV) neutral spirits from a fermented mash or wash using a refluxing still such as a column still. The fermentable base for this spirit may be derived from grain, sugar beets, grapes, potatoes, sugar cane, plain sugar, or any other material of agricultural origin. The highly concentrated spirit is then redistilled with juniper berries and other botanicals in a pot still. Most often, the botanicals are suspended in a [...] "gin basket" [...] positioned within the head of the still, which allows the hot alcoholic vapours to extract flavouring components from the botanical charge. This method yields a gin lighter in flavour than the older pot still method, and results in either a <b>distilled</b> <b>gin</b> or London dry gin, depending largely upon how the spirit is finished.|$|E

2500|$|Many modern absinthes are {{produced}} using a cold mix process. This inexpensive {{method of production}} does not involve distillation, and is regarded as inferior {{in the same way}} that cheaper compound gin is regarded as inferior to <b>distilled</b> <b>gin.</b> [...] The cold mixing process involves the simple blending of flavouring essences and artificial colouring in commercial alcohol, in similar fashion to most flavoured vodkas and inexpensive liqueurs and cordials. Some modern cold mixed absinthes have been bottled at strengths approaching 90% ABV. Others are presented simply as a bottle of plain alcohol with a small amount of powdered herbs suspended within it.|$|E
60|$|Bills enough, {{were the}} Corn-Law Abrogation Bill once passed, and a Legislature willing! Nay this one Bill, which lies yet unenacted, a right Education Bill, is not this of itself the sure parent of innumerable wise Bills,--wise regulations, {{practical}} methods and proposals, gradually ripening towards {{the state of}} Bills? To irradiate with intelligence, that is to say, with order, arrangement and all blessedness, the Chaotic, Unintelligent: how, except by educating, can you accomplish this? That thought, reflection, articulate utterance and understanding be awakened in these individual million heads, which are the atoms of your Chaos: {{there is no other}} way of illuminating any Chaos! The sum-total of intelligence that is found in it, determines the extent of order that is possible for your Chaos,--the feasibility and rationality of what your Chaos will dimly demand from you, and will gladly obey when proposed by you! It is an exact equation; the one accurately measures the other.--If the whole English People, during these 'twenty years of respite,' be not educated, with at least schoolmaster's educating, a tremendous responsibility, before God and men, will rest somewhere! How dare any man, especially a man calling himself minister of God, stand up in any Parliament or place, under any pretext or delusion, and for a day or an hour forbid God's Light to come into the world, and bid the Devil's Darkness continue in it one hour more! For all light and science, under all shapes, in all degrees of perfection, is of God; all darkness, nescience, is of the Enemy of God. 'The schoolmaster's creed is somewhat awry?' Yes, I have found few creeds entirely correct; few light-beams shining white, pure of admixture: but of all creeds and religions now or ever before known, was not that of thoughtless thriftless Animalism, of <b>Distilled</b> <b>Gin,</b> and Stupor and Despair, unspeakably the least orthodox? We will exchange it even with Paganism, with Fetishism; and, on the whole, must exchange it with something.|$|E
60|$|More {{touching}} still, {{there is}} not a hamlet where poor peasants congregate, but, by one means and another, a Church-Apparatus has been got together,--roofed edifice, with revenues and belfries; pulpit, reading-desk, with Books and Methods: possibility, in short, and strict prescription, That a man stand there and speak of spiritual things to men. It is beautiful;--even in its great obscuration and decadence, it is among the beautifulest, most touching objects one sees on the Earth. This Speaking Man has indeed, in these times, wandered terribly from the point; has, alas, as it were, totally lost sight of the point: yet, at bottom, whom have we to compare with him? Of all public functionaries boarded and lodged on the Industry of Modern Europe, is there one worthier of the board he has? A man even professing, and never so languidly making still some endeavour, to save the souls of men: contrast him with a man professing to do little but shoot the partridges of men! I wish he could find the point again, this Speaking One; and stick to it with tenacity, with deadly energy: for there is need of him yet! The Speaking Function, this of Truth coming to us with a living voice, nay in a living shape, and as a concrete practical exemplar: this, with all our Writing and Printing Functions, has a perennial place. Could he but find the point again,--take the old spectacles off his nose, and looking up discover, almost in contact with him, what the real Satanas, and soul-devouring, world-devouring Devil, now is! Original Sin and suchlike are bad enough. I doubt not: but <b>distilled</b> <b>Gin,</b> dark Ignorance, Stupidity, dark Corn-Law, Bastille and Company, what are they! Will he discover our new real Satan, whom he has to fight; or go on droning through his old nose-spectacles about old extinct Satans; and never see the real one, till he feel him at his own throat and ours? That is a question, for the world! Let us not intermeddle with it here.|$|E

50|$|The British {{government}} tried {{a number}} of times to stop the flow of gin. The Gin Act 1736 taxed retail sales at a rate of 20 shillings a gallon on spirits and required licensees to take out a Â£50 annual licence to sell gin, a fee equivalent to about Â£ today. The aim was to effectively prohibit the trade by making it economically unfeasible. Only two licences were ever taken out. The trade became illegal, consumption dipped but then continued to rise and the law was effectively repealed in 1743 following mass law-breaking and violence (particularly towards informers who were paid Â£5 to reveal the whereabouts of illegal gin shops). The illegally <b>distilled</b> <b>gin</b> which was produced following the 1736 Act was less reliable and more likely to result in poisoning.|$|E
