5000|$|In {{electrical}} distribution, a <b>fuse</b> <b>cutout</b> or cut-out fuse is {{a combination}} of a fuse and a switch, used in primary overhead feeder lines and taps to protect distribution transformers from current surges and overloads. An overcurrent caused by a fault in the transformer or customer circuit will cause the fuse to melt, disconnecting the transformer from the line. It can also be opened manually by utility linemen standing on the ground and using a long insulating stick called a [...] "hot stick".|$|E
50|$|On a 3 phase circuit a {{recloser}} is {{more beneficial}} than three separate <b>fuse</b> <b>cutouts.</b> For example on a wye to delta conversion if cutouts are {{used on the}} wye side, and only 1 out of 3 of the <b>cutout</b> <b>fuses</b> open, some customers on the delta side would have a low voltage condition, due to voltage transfer through the transformer windings. Low voltage can cause severe damage to electronic equipment. But if a recloser were used, all three phases will open, eliminating the problem.|$|R
50|$|All of the {{defendants}} in this case are manufacturers of electrical devices, {{the most important of}} which for purposes of this case are dropout <b>fuse</b> <b>cutouts,</b> which are devices for breaking electrical power circuits. The defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix the prices of these devices. Defendant Southern States Equipment Corporation (Southern) acquired Lemmon U.S. Pat. No. 2,150,102, which the dropout <b>fuse</b> <b>cutouts</b> {{the defendants}} manufacture are said to infringe. Defendant Line Materials (Line) acquired Schultz U.S. Pat. No. 2,176,227, which is an improvement on the Lemmon patent (it is simpler and cheaper), but its use infringes the Lemmon patent. Line and Southern settled a patent dispute by entering into an agreement under which Southern licensed Line royalty-free under the Lemmon patent, and Line licensed Southern royalty-free under the Schultz patent and authorized Southern to grant sublicenses under the Schultz patent. The agreement also provided that all sublicenses granted by Southern under Line's patents were required to include provisions for minimum prices to be established by Line, and all sublicenses under the Lemmon patent were to include provisions for minimum prices to be fixed by Southern.|$|R
40|$|A heavy {{pollution}} on outdoor insulators causes electrical discharges, flashovers, {{surface erosion}} or tracking. In extremely cases the dielectric breakdowns occur. In this paper the breakdowns of four insulators has been shown: porcelain bushing insulators on rectifier set ups of electrostatic precipitators, the porcelain <b>fuse</b> <b>cutouts,</b> a porcelain housing of metal oxide surge arrester and polymer concrete insulators. The analysis of other damages of condenser bushings and instrument transformers {{published in the}} literature has led us to a hypothesis that a part of these failures could be initiated or accelerated by external pollution...|$|R
5000|$|Distribution lines use two systems, either grounded-wye ("Y" [...] on {{electrical}} schematics) or delta (Greek letter [...] "Î”" [...] on electrical schematics). A delta system {{requires only}} a conductor {{for each of}} the three phases. A grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor, the neutral, whose source is the center of the [...] "Y" [...] and is grounded. However, [...] "spur lines" [...] branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires, plus the neutral. A wide range of standard distribution voltages are used, from 2,400 V to 34,500 V. On poles near a service drop, there is a pole-mounted step-down transformer to provide the required mains voltage. In North America, service drops provide 240/120V split-phase power for residential and light commercial service, using cylindrical single-phase transformers. In Europe and most other countries, 230V three phase (230Y400) service drops are used. The transformer's primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called <b>fuse</b> <b>cutouts.</b> In the event of an overload, the fuse melts and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem. They can also be opened manually by linemen using a long insulated rod called a hot stick to disconnect the transformer from the line.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The rewireable <b>fuse</b> or <b>cutout</b> {{is widely}} used in Bangladesh and elsewhere, {{in spite of the}} very real danger of {{improper}} replacement of fuse wires. To assess the problem, a preliminary survey of buildings, electrical shops, and electricians were conducted. The majority of buildings and retail establishments were found to use fuse wires. Electricians were found to use copper of arbitrary thicknesses as fuses, and were unaware of the existence of specialized fuse wires. Every year, there are numerous fires in the garments and other industries, causing hundreds of deaths. As the vast majority of these fires are of electrical origin, the evidence is strong that improper fuse wiring may have been the cause of the fires. The number of smaller fires which do not make it to the news is likely to be orders of magnitude greater than the publicized fires. Even when the origin is not electrical, insulation failures may cause secondary electrical fires, that may cause the fire to spread rapidly {{to the rest of the}} building, making it hard to extinguish...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Recently, {{owing to}} a high demand of and high {{dependence}} on electric power, {{the reliability of the}} distribution voltage of electric power systems has become more important. 22 kV high voltage <b>cutout</b> <b>fuses</b> have been used widely, but some melting accidents have occurred due to pollution/contamination of bushings. As the number of contaminants in bushings increases, the electric fields on the fuse element surface rise to a critical level, triggering corona discharge. A fuse element material that is more resistant to corona discharge than the Ag element is desired. A new type of current-limiting fuse made of stainless steel wires, which is low-cost and simple in design has been developed. Characteristics tests, including a blocking test with a high surge current when a voltage is applied, have been conducted. Using a model fuse, it was confirmed that this new type of fuse possesses similar performance characteristics to those with an Ag element.
