40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyse and improve the {{performance}} of metrics like Coefficient of Correlation (CoC) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for image recognition in real-time environment. The main novelties of the methods are; it can work under uncontrolled environment and no need to store multiple copies of the same image at different orientations. The values of CoC and SSIM get changed if images are rotated or flipped or captured under bad/highly illuminated conditions. To increase the recognition accuracy, the input test image is pre-processed. First, discrete wavelet transform is applied to recognize the image captured under bad illuminated and dull lightning conditions. Second, to make the method rotation invariant, the test image is compared against the stored database image without and with rotations in the horizontal, vertical, <b>diagonal,</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>diagonal</b> and flipped directions. The image recognition performance is evaluated using the Recognition Rate and Rejection Rate. The results indicate that recognition performance of Correlation Coefficient and SSIM gets improved with rotations and discrete wavelet transform. Also it was observed that CoC with proposed modifications yield better results as compared to state of the art enhanced Principal Component Analysis an...|$|R

40|$|A {{permanent}} seismotectonic {{activity is}} present in the region of northern Velebit. Through history a number of earthquakes magnitudes of VIII° and IX° MCS are reported. In this century the most powerful earthquake of a magnitude of 5. 8 occurred in 1916. The key tectonic movements that cause these earthquakes are dislocations of the Adriatic platform towards the north and the resistance of the Dinarides towards these movements. The tectonic dynamics of a structural arrangement depend on the relationship between stress and the deformation of structural units. According to the tectonic measurements performed on outcrops of major faults the following orientation of stress was obtained: from 20 / 25 ° to 200 / 205 ° in the northern Velebit region and 340 to 160 ° in the hinterland.

40|$|Human {{platelet}} thrombospondin adsorbed on plastic promotes {{attachment and}} spreading of human G 361 melanoma cells. Attachment is rapid, and spreading is maximal by 90 min with 60 - 90 % of the attached cells spread. In contrast, thrombospondin promotes attachment but not spreading of human C 32 melanoma cells, which attach and spread only on laminin substrates. The specificity of these interactions and {{the regions of}} the thrombospondin molecule involved in attachment and spreading were examined using proteolytic fragments of thrombospondin and by inhibition studies. The sulfated fucan, fucoidan, and monoclonal antibody A 2. 5, which is directed against the heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin, selectively inhibit spreading but only weakly inhibit attachment. Monoclonal antibodies against some other domains of thrombospondin, however, are potent inhibitors of attachment. The amino- terminal heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin does not promote attachment. Large fragments lacking the heparin-binding domain support attachment but not spreading of G 361 cells. Attachment activity is lost following removal of the 18 -kD carboxyl-terminal domain. These results suggest {{that at least two}} melanoma ligands are involved in cell attachment and spreading on thrombospondin. The carboxyl-terminal region and perhaps other regions of the molecule bind to receptor(s) on the melanoma surface that promote initial attachment but not cell spreading. Interaction of the heparin-binding domain with sulfated glycoconjugates on melanoma surface proteoglycans and/or sulfated glycolipids mediates spreading. Monoclonal antibodies A 2. 5 and C 6. 7 also <b>reverse</b> <b>spreading</b> of G 361 cells growing on glass culture substrates, suggesting that binding to thrombospondin mediates attachment of these melanoma cells in culture...|$|R

However, the value of anti-PLA 2 R 1 antibody titers in predicting patient outcomes is unknown. Here, we screened serum samples from 50 patients positive for PLA 2 R 1 for immunoreactivity against a series of PLA 2 R 1 deletion mutants covering the extracellular domains. We identified reactive epitopes in the cysteine-rich (CysR), C-type lectin domain 1 (CTLD 1), and C-type lectin domain 7 (CTLD 7) domains and confirmed the reactivity with soluble forms of each domain. We then used ELISAs to stratify 69 patients positive for PLA 2 R 1 by serum reactivity {{to one or more}} of these domains: CysR (n= 23), CysRC 1 (n= 14), and CysRC 1 C 7 (n= 32). Median ELISA titers measured using the full-length PLA 2 R 1 antigens were not statistically different between subgroups. Patients with anti-CysR-restricted activity were younger (P= 0. 008), had less nephrotic range proteinuria (P= 0. 02), and exhibited a higher rate of spontaneous remission (P= 0. 03) and lower rates of renal failure progression (P= 0. 002) and ESRD (P= 0. 01) during follow-up. Overall, 31 of 69 patients had poor renal prognosis (urinary protein/creatinine ratio > 4 g/g or eGFR< 45 ml/min per 1. 73 m(2) at end of follow-up).

One potential resolution to this long-standing puzzle involves female multiple mating (polyandry). Because many meiotic drivers severely reduce the sperm competitive ability of their male carriers, females are predicted to evolve more frequent polyandry and thereby promote sperm competition when a meiotic driver invades. Consequently, the driving chromosome’s relative fitness should decline, halting or <b>reversing</b> its <b>spread.</b> We used formal modeling to show that this initially appealing hypothesis cannot resolve the puzzle alone: other selective pressures (e. g. low fitness of drive homozygotes) are required to establish a stable meiotic drive polymorphism.
